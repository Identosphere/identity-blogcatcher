 PIVX Weekly Pulse (Oct 10th, 2025 — Oct. 16th,&nbsp;2025) <p>Your weekly PIVX recap is here. Get all the key market insights and community updates in one easy&nbsp;summary.</p> Market Pulse   Masternode Count: The number of active masternodes plunged to 1,979, down sharply from last week’s 2,071. This decline follows a week where PIVX saw a significant price spike as attention shifted to privacy coins. This sharp drop suggests that some masternode owners may have opted to take profit following the recent rally in direct response to the market’s bullish price movement.    Price Check: PIVX experienced a high-octane week, with its Daily USD Value swinging dramatically between $0.18 and $0.25. This translated to a robust weekly average of $0.2083, shattering the prior week’s $0.15 average. While prices briefly touched $0.33 during the peak, a late-week decline reflected broader market pessimism, leading to a slight consolidation.    Trading Buzz: Riding on the wave of last week’s excitement, PIVX trading volume surged again, climbing to nearly $260 million this week. This is more than double last week’s already high volume of $104&nbsp;million.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>What’s the first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word “privacy?” I bet you think about protecting your space from the eyes of prying neighbours and co-workers. I wouldn’t be wrong to say that privacy is now being framed as a legal or technological problem. Virtually every website has a privacy page, and end-to-end encryption has become a major selling point for&nbsp;apps.</p><p>But I think that privacy is a deeply psychological phenomenon. It is an essential human need for control over social interaction and personal information.</p> Privacy isn’t about&nbsp;Hiding <p>Traditional definitions of privacy, such as the “right to be let alone,” have been expanded in the psychological context to reflect its active, regulatory nature. Social psychologist Irwin Altman’s influential Privacy Regulation Theory frames privacy not as a static state, but as a dialectical and dynamic boundary regulation process.</p><p>The goal, according to Altman, is to achieve an optimal level of privacy. This would mean a fluctuating balance between the desired level of social contact and the actual level. When our actual privacy is less than desired (too much exposure), we feel crowded or annoyed. And when it is greater (too much isolation), we feel lonely. This constant, shifting need for control highlights privacy’s core psychological functions:</p>  Self-Development and Autonomy: Privacy offers a critical space for self-reflection, emotional release, and the integration of experiences into a cohesive self-identity. It provides a secure place to “recharge” from social demands and avoid being manipulated or dominated by the expectations of&nbsp;others.  Emotional Release: Having a private space allows for the safe expression of feelings and impulses that might be considered inappropriate in public, serving as a psychological “release&nbsp;valve.”  Protected Communication: Privacy is a prerequisite for intimacy. The selective sharing of personal information is necessary to build trust, form stable relationships, and receive social&nbsp;support.   The Digital Age and the “Privacy&nbsp;Paradox” <p>The rise of digital technologies has profoundly complicated our psychological relationship with privacy. A phenomenon known as the Privacy Paradox emerged as a key area of study. People often express high levels of concern about their online privacy, but simultaneously engage in significant self-disclosure on social media and other platforms.</p><p>Psychologists have explored several explanations for this apparent contradiction, moving beyond the idea that people simply don’t&nbsp;care:</p>  Privacy Calculus Theory: This is one of the most common models, suggesting people engage in a rational (or seemingly rational) cost-benefit analysis. They weigh the perceived risks (such as identity theft, data misuse) against the perceived benefits (e.g., social connection, personalized services, convenience) of disclosing information. Often, the immediate, tangible benefits are overweighted compared to abstract, long-term risks.  Lack of Awareness and Control: Users frequently lack full information about what data is being collected, how it is being used, and the long-term consequences of disclosure. We are all culprits in this regard. Have you ever read the terms of service of any of the popular apps you use? The bottom line is that when the control is external and the process is opaque, it becomes difficult to maintain the psychological boundary necessary for a feeling of&nbsp;privacy.  Contextual Privacy: The meaning and expectation of privacy are highly contextual. What we willingly share with a peer on a messaging app is very different from what we would share with an employer or a stranger. Yet online platforms often blur these distinct social contexts.  <p>In conclusion, privacy is not withdrawal from society. It is the selective control that empowers us to participate in it on our own&nbsp;terms.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

  Partnering with Flow: The Agile Hardware Future  <p>A new manufacturing generation is emerging, and Pari and his team are leading the way.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/roelof-botha/">Roelof Botha</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/zefi-hennessy-holland/">Zefi Hennessy Holland</a>	 



Published October 14, 2025
  



Flow founder Pari Singh.



 
<p>The American hardware industry is undergoing a renaissance. New players are emerging across aerospace, automotive, defense, and beyond—and they must iterate more quickly, and with more complexity, than ever before. Just as software developers needed new tools to move from a waterfall framework to the more flexible agile approach, hardware now needs a different type of collaborative platform—one that can instantly align requirements across systems to build safely, reliably, and quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why <a href="https://flowengineering.com/">Flow Engineering</a> is poised to have a generational impact.</p>



<p>Whether it’s an electric vehicle, a rocket, or a robot, building complex hardware requires full context throughout the system: changing the thermal parameters for a single component, for example, can have a ripple effect through the rest of the design. But the legacy products used to track these requirements are clunky artifacts of a bygone era and simply don’t measure up. Engineers are reluctant to use them, and they make development cycles, already famously long in hardware, even longer.</p>



<p>Today’s electric vehicles have more in common with computers than internal combustion vehicles. And Flow founder Pari Singh knows that, like software, hardware’s future is agile. His insights are making Flow the default requirements management platform for the next generation of hardware companies.</p>



<p>Built specifically for agile hardware teams, Flow serves as a modern system of record, automatically verifying changes and propagating them downstream. Its magic lies in the collaboration it enables. Flow feels natural and intuitive for systems engineers and their domain-specific colleagues alike, and integrates with a full suite of engineering tools. Teams can break down silos and iterate continuously, working together and with outside partners in real time, all from a single source of truth. As with software development, these shorter feedback loops dramatically reduce time to market—which gives Flow’s customers a critical competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Born and raised in London and obsessed with engineering from a young age, Pari was a 22-year-old Imperial College graduate when he launched a design consultancy for hybrid rocket engines. He built a tool to do in two hours what took others twelve weeks. This led to the innovative idea behind Flow. As we at Sequoia have gotten to know Pari, we’ve found him to be clear-thinking, driven, and resilient. He is also relentless in his pursuit of top talent and building a truly special team—which is fortunate given the company’s rapid growth.<br></p>



<p>Flow is working with top companies across space, defense, nuclear, aero, and robotics, including Rivian, Joby, Astranis, and Radiant Nuclear. As this next generation of hardware businesses continues to scale, we at Sequoia are pleased to lead the Series A to help Flow accelerate their success. The team is <a href="https://flowengineering.com/about-us/#openings">hiring now</a> both in London and at their new HQ in San Francisco.</p>



<p>Through the combined effort of systems engineers and their colleagues, a collection of pumps, valves, and pipes can become a spaceship—and the future of hardware engineering itself will require the same kind of extraordinary collaboration. In this industry-wide effort to build the hardware of tomorrow, we believe Pari and the team at Flow are leading the way.</p>

<p>Discord has confirmed a significant data breach involving a third-party customer service provider, resulting in the exposure of sensitive government-issued photo identification for approximately 70,000&nbsp;users.</p><p>The company disclosed the incident last week, noting that the breach did not involve a direct attack on its core systems. Instead, hackers successfully compromised an unnamed external vendor responsible for handling customer support and Trust &amp; Safety functions.</p><p>The most critical data exposed belongs to users who had communicated with the support teams, particularly those who submitted documents for age-related appeals. Discord stated that these users may have had photos of their government-issued IDs, such as driver’s licenses or passports, exposed.</p><p>The volume of the compromise is under dispute. Discord identified about 70,000 users globally who may have had their ID photos accessed. However, the hackers behind the incident have claimed to have stolen a far greater volume of data, including up to 1.5 terabytes of age verification-related photos. Discord has dismissed these larger numbers as “incorrect” and part of the extortion attempt.</p><p>In addition to the sensitive photo IDs, the unauthorized party gained access to a wide range of personal information shared with customer service agents, including real names, email addresses, IP addresses, limited billing information, and internal corporate data.</p><p>Discord confirmed that full credit card numbers, CCV codes, and user passwords were not impacted by the breach. User messages and activity outside of customer support conversations were also unaffected.</p> Third-Party Risk Highlights a Systemic&nbsp;Flaw <p>The incident is a reminder of the escalating risks associated with third-party vendors. A company’s overall security posture is only as strong as its weakest link in the supply chain. In this case, a customer support platform, which often retains sensitive data to manage user appeals, became the primary&nbsp;target.</p><p>Following the discovery of the breach, a Discord spokesperson confirmed that the company took immediate action, stating, “We’ve secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor.” But the deed has been done, and what could possibly go&nbsp;wrong?</p><p>Discord has notified all users whose data may have been impacted and is working with law enforcement, cybersecurity experts, and data protection authorities to manage the aftermath of the incident. The company maintains that it will not reward the perpetrators for their illegal actions. Affected users are advised to be highly vigilant for suspicious communications, as the stolen personal data could be used in phishing or identity fraud attempts.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights.

  <p>In this episode, Sebastien is joined by Jelena Djuric, co-founder of Noble, a generic asset issuance chain built for the Cosmos ecosystem. Jelena shares her journey into crypto, which began with an interest in political science, leading her to discover Bitcoin's potential. She describes the origins of Noble, created to solve a critical need within Cosmos: a native, fungible source of liquidity like USDC.</p><p>Before Noble, assets were often bridged in fragmented ways, creating poor user experiences. Noble was designed as a simple, secure, and neutral "asset issuance hub," a purpose-built chain for natively issuing assets and distributing them throughout the Cosmos network via IBC.</p><p>Jelena emphasizes that Noble is intentionally "boring," with a minimal feature set to reduce the attack surface. It operates with a proof-of-authority consensus model to meet the compliance needs of asset issuers like Circle. Jelena also discusses the importance of CCTP for moving USDC between Cosmos and other ecosystems, with Noble as the routing hub. Looking ahead, Jelena sees a future where Noble supports a diverse range of assets beyond stablecoins, including RWAs.</p><br>Topics discussed in this episode:     Introduction      Jelena's background and entry into crypto      Why fragmented liquidity is holding crypto back      Noble's vision for unifying liquidity      Why a "boring" chain is a more secure chain      Noble's proof-of-authority model for issuer trust      Bringing a single source of truth for USDC to the Interchain      Using CCTP to connect liquidity across ecosystems      Noble's business model      The future of solving liquidity for RWAs  <br>Links mentioned in this episode:       Jelena Djuric, Co-Founder, Noble: <a href="https://x.com/jelena_noble">https://x.com/jelena_noble</a>       Noble: <a href="https://x.com/noble_xyz">https://x.com/noble_xyz</a>   <br>Sponsors:       Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Since its March debut, the <a>Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program</a> has continued to gain momentum, expanding <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a> utility across Web3. The program connects partners with Brave’s <a href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1973448714741227569">over 100 million monthly users</a> through premium placements—including in-browser New Tab Takeovers and the new Rewards Offer Wall—and amplifies reach through social, in-app, and on-chain experiences.</p>
<p>This month’s update highlights new partners bringing BAT utility to mobile trading apps, decentralized exchanges, travel booking platforms, and on-chain games, pushing the program into new verticals and community spaces.</p>

 Meet September’s featured partners

It has since evolved into a full-featured platform offering advanced tools, including limit orders, dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and perpetuals, making it a go-to hub for both casual and pro traders. Meanwhile, the Jupiter product suite has expanded to include a mobile wallet, a lending protocol, and its all-encompassing Portfolio app.</p>
<p>As part of the Partner Program, Jupiter will explore swap discounts for Brave Rewards users and BAT holders, helping to make trading and earning DeFi even more rewarding. Additionally, BAT is already supported on Jupiter, allowing users to buy, sell, and swap directly on the platform.</p>

 Orange Cap Games 
<p><a href="https://www.vibes.game/blog">Orange Cap Games (OCG)</a> is a boundary-pushing design studio known for bringing beloved franchises to life through premium physical and digital game experiences. With a focus on product-led adoption and meticulous attention to detail, OCG crafts immersive trading card games and collectibles that resonate with both Web3 and mainstream audiences.</p>

From the family-friendly world of Vibes to the charm of Moonbirds, Orange Cap creates iconic trading cards, collectible grails, and epic experiences.</p>

 Updates from existing program partners 

 Bandit’s Badchain 
<p><a href="https://earn.badchain.org/">Bandit’s Badchain</a> recently launched a successful interactive quest via the Brave Rewards Offer Wall where users earned GUANO upon completion. As one of the first Offer Wall activations designed to drive on-chain engagement, the campaign saw over 650 participants and distributed more than 1.5 million GUANO in rewards.</p>
<p>By piloting experimental formats like this, Bandit is exploring new paths to market fit while furthering the Partner Program’s goal of rewarding Brave Rewards users through participation and play.</p>

 GolfN 
<p>The Brave x <a href="https://www.golfn.com/">GolfN</a> merch capsule officially lands in the <a href="https://proshop.golfn.com/">GolfN Pro Shop</a> on October 16, 2025, featuring exclusive Brave-branded golf towels, tees, and ball markers. Items can be purchased with BAT on Solana, other cryptocurrencies, or credit card (while supplies last).</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, Brave Rewards users can also claim a promo code via the Rewards Offer Wall to unlock a Brave badge in the GolfN app. The badge earns points for in-app participation, and BAT holders who redeem it will receive a bonus point boost, redeemable for even more perks.</p>

 GuanoCoin 
<p>Since joining the Partner Program in March, <a href="https://www.guanocoin.com/">GuanoCoin</a>’s BAT Cave has grown to <a href="https://x.com/guanocoin/status/1975342950927507865">over 360,000 BAT</a> locked—a 40% increase since <a href="https://x.com/guanocoin/status/1950216977240170898">July</a>—reflecting growing community engagement and long-term confidence in the BAT ecosystem. Locking BAT reduces circulating supply, strengthens BAT’s utility on Solana, and rewards participants with GUANO.</p>
<p>GuanoCoin also established a <a href="https://www.meteora.ag/pools/GYuh9af5UqUjzpU6tLFmwkg4P5DWU45pTSMoHEuZwzK8">BAT/SOL liquidity pool on Meteora</a> with over 35,000 BAT and 24 SOL currently locked. Fees generated from the pool are being reinvested to deepen liquidity and expand BAT’s presence across Solana DeFi.</p>
<p>Most recently, GuanoCoin was <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/guano">verified on CoinGecko</a>, boosting its visibility and paving the way for GUANO to appear as a recognized asset in the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Born from the BAT Community, GuanoCoin continues to pioneer creative, community-first ways to engage with BAT on-chain. Follow <a href="https://x.com/guanocoin">@GuanoCoin</a> to stay up to date on new quests emerging from the Cave.</p>

 Unstoppable Domains 
<p>Adoption of the .brave on-chain domain continues to climb, with nearly 14,000 domains minted since <a>launch</a> in May. Each .brave domain serves as a decentralized identity asset, enabling human-readable wallet addresses, censorship-resistant websites on IPFS, and more.</p>
<p>Thanks to native support in the Brave browser and <a>Brave Wallet</a> (since version 1.81), .brave domains now resolve seamlessly without extensions, marking a major step toward making Web3 access more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
<p>Fans can still claim their .brave domain using BAT, crypto, or credit card at <a href="https://buy.unstoppabledomains.com/brave">get.unstoppabledomains.com/brave</a>.</p>
<p>And stay tuned for an exciting announcement from Brave and Unstoppable domains the week of October 13, 2025!</p>

<p>It’s almost impossible to talk about privacy coins without mentioning the likes of Monero. You have to hand it to them; they’ve been around since 2014. However, there are many other projects (some arguably better) in the privacy niche. PIVX is one of the OGs that is often overlooked.</p><p>In this article, I’ll scrutinize both privacy cryptocurrencies, exploring their core technology, as well as their pros and&nbsp;cons.</p> Core Technology: Privacy by Default vs. Optional Shielding <p>The most crucial difference between PIVX and Monero lies in their implementation and philosophy of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Monero</p><p>Monero’s privacy is mandatory and built in for every single transaction, ensuring a uniform anonymity set. This commitment to default privacy is, in my opinion, Monero’s greatest strength. It uses three distinct technologies to ensure user privacy — Ring signatures, Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT), and stealth addresses.</p><p>While ring signatures blend the sender’s signature with a group of non-spenders on the blockchain, making it cryptographically impossible to trace the actual spender, a stealth address allows the sender to create a one-time, unique public address for every transaction. RingCT hides the transaction amount, preserving confidentiality even from view-key&nbsp;holders.</p><p>PIVX</p><p>PIVX, on the other hand, combines optional privacy with an energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus and a self-governance model. Its current privacy technology is known as <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/a-practical-guide-to-using-shield-for-private-transactions-c7210e5a9f0a">SHIELD</a>, a highly customized and successful implementation of the zk-SNARKs.</p><p>Short for Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, zk-SNARKs allow a user to prove that a statement is true without revealing any information about the underlying data.</p><p>When enabled, transactions sent from one shielded address to another shielded address (SHIELD-to-SHIELD transactions) have the sender’s address, the receiver’s address, and the transaction amount completely hidden on the public blockchain.</p> Privacy vs. Practicality   Consensus Mechanism: Monero utilizes Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. While this is highly secure and ASIC-resistant, it comes with high energy requirements. PIVX touts itself as the first PoS network to implement privacy features. As we all know, PoS offers lower energy consumption, faster block times, and rewards for&nbsp;staking.  Compliance: Monero is difficult to audit, which is why it has faced severe regulatory scrutiny and delistings from major exchanges. PIVX, with its optional privacy option, allows users to transact transparently if needed for compliance. However, its optional nature may still raise regulatory flags.  Transaction Fees: Like Bitcoin, fees on the Monero network can be higher and less predictable due to congestion and the large size of the private transaction data. Meanwhile, fees on the PIVX blockchain are near zero and more predictable, enabled by the PoS structure.   Conclusion <p>Monero is the choice for the purist. It is a fundamental, uncompromised digital cash system where privacy is a guarantee, not an option. Its strength is in its mandatory nature, which creates the largest possible anonymity set. But the cost of this is high energy consumption and increasing regulatory pressure that limits its accessibility.</p><p>PIVX, on the other hand, represents a more modern, pragmatic approach. By embracing Proof-of-Stake, it offers a fast, energy-efficient, and self-governed network. Its optional privacy (SHIELD) provides users with a choice, catering to both the privacy-minded and those who may need transparent transactions for compliance. However, this optionality is the very thing that, in the eyes of Monero enthusiasts, makes its privacy less&nbsp;robust.</p><p>Ultimately, both projects are essential to the privacy coin ecosystem. Monero defines the gold standard for confidentiality, while PIVX pushes the boundary of what’s possible in an efficient, self-governing chain.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-pivx-monero-debate-b3556510bf96">The PIVX-Monero Debate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Over the past several months, we’ve made significant changes to Zebra’s continuous integration and testing infrastructure. For those new to the project, <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/">Zebra</a> is the Zcash Foundation’s full-node implementation written in Rust, providing an independent, memory-safe, and consensus-compatible alternative to zcashd.</p>

<p>These improvements make it easier for anyone to fork the repository, test their changes, and contribute to the project—without relying on external services or special permissions.</p>

 Why These Changes Matter 

<p>Previously, contributing to Zebra meant dealing with several roadblocks:</p>

 
 Forked repositories couldn’t run most CI tests because they depended on Firebase, external Docker registries, and other services that contributors didn’t have access to 

 Test builds were slow and sometimes rebuilt unnecessarily 

 Complex configuration made it hard to understand which tests were running and why 

 External dependencies added costs and made the CI fragile 
 

<p><br>We’ve systematically addressed each of these issues.<br><br></p>

 What We’ve Improved 
<p>We have made five notable improvements:</p>

 1. CI Now Works on Forks 

<p>The biggest change: if you fork Zebra, the CI just works. We removed all dependencies on external services that required special access:</p>

 
 Documentation now deploys to GitHub Pages instead of Firebase 

 All workflows run on standard GitHub infrastructure 

 Docker images build directly in GitHub Actions, no longer requiring Google Cloud Platform or Docker Build Cloud 

 Removed 19 patch files and 2,900 lines of configuration complexity 
 

<p><br>We also made Zebra’s internal workflows easier to identify by adding a zfnd- prefix, so it’s clear which workflows are specific to the Zcash Foundation’s infrastructure and which ones will work in your fork.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/.github/workflows/README.md">See our CI/CD architecture documentation →</a></p>

 2. Faster, More Reliable Tests with Nextest 

<p>We migrated Zebra’s entire test suite to use <a href="https://nexte.st/">cargo-nextest</a>, a modern test runner that offers several advantages:</p>

 
 Faster execution: Tests run in parallel with smarter scheduling 

 Better reliability: Proper timeout handling prevents false failures 

 Clearer configuration: All 17 test profiles are defined in <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/.config/nextest.toml">.config/nextest.toml</a> instead of scattered across shell scripts 

 Simpler workflows: One NEXTEST_PROFILE variable replaces dozens of environment flags 
 

<p><br>This change eliminated unnecessary rebuilds caused by feature flag mismatches and streamlined how we run different types of tests (full sync, RPC tests, <a href="https://github.com/zcash/lightwalletd">lightwalletd</a> integration, etc.).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/.github/workflows/README.md#test-execution-strategy">See our nextest profiles and test categories →</a></p>

 3. Removed External Build Dependencies 

<p>We used to rely on external services to build Docker images because the builds were resource-intensive. This created two problems:</p>

 
 Contributors couldn’t build images in their forks 

 It incurred in significant costs 
 

<p><br>Now, Docker images build entirely within GitHub Actions using standard infrastructure. We made the builder configurable, so if you fork Zebra, your images will build automatically without any special setup.</p>

<p>The workflow also adapts to your environment—it uses standard GitHub runners in forks and larger runners in the main repository, so contributors aren’t blocked by runner size limitations.</p>

<p><a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/docker.html">Learn more about our Docker setup →</a></p>

 4. Streamlined Testing and Deployment 

<p>We simplified how tests are organized and run:</p>

 
 Single unified workflow: Instead of building Docker images multiple times across different workflows, we build once and reuse it for all tests. 

 Consistent naming: Standardized test names across GitHub workflows, environment variables, and Rust code makes it easier to trace failures and understand what’s being tested. 

 Simplified GCP integration: For tests that do run on Google Cloud Platform (in the main repository), we removed the intermediate container layer and use direct instance creation, which improves reliability and logging. 
 

<p><br><a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/.github/workflows/README.md#workflow-organization">See our workflow organization →</a>5. Better Configuration Management</p>

<p>We replaced the legacy configuration system with a modern layered approach:</p>

 
 Configure Zebra using ZEBRA_ <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/docker.html?highlight=ZEBRA_#configuring-zebra">prefixed environment variables</a> without needing a generated config file 

 Simplified Docker entrypoint that doesn’t need to generate TOML files 

 Clearer separation between defaults, optional TOML files, and environment overrides<br><br> 
 

<p>This makes it easier to test different configurations and reduces the complexity of the Docker entrypoint script.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/zebrad/latest/zebrad/config/struct.ZebradConfig.html">See the configuration documentation →</a></p>
 <br>What This Means for You 

<p>Whether you’re a contributor, a community member running your own Zebra node, or an organization building on top of Zebra:</p>

 
 Fork and test freely: You can fork Zebra and run the full CI suite in your own repository 

 Faster feedback: Tests run faster and more reliably, so you get quicker feedback on changes 

 Easier debugging: Clearer test names and better logging make it simpler to understand what went wrong when a test fails 

 Lower barriers to entry: New contributors don’t need to understand complex external dependencies or request access to special services 
 

 <br>What’s Next 

<p>We’re not done yet. The improvements we’ve made so far lay the groundwork for even more significant changes coming soon:</p>

 Smarter Test Selection 

<p>We’re re-architecting how tests are organized and run so you can choose exactly what to test based on your needs:</p>

 
 Run by test type: Select just unit tests, integration tests, or stateful tests (tests that require a cached blockchain state) 

 Run by quality level: Choose between quick smoke tests and comprehensive test suites 

 Run what matters: If you’re working on RPC functionality, run just the RPC tests. Working on sync logic? Run only sync-related tests. 
 

<p><br>This will make the development cycle faster—you won’t need to wait for the entire test suite when you’re only changing a specific component.</p>

 Regtest for Faster, More Reliable Testing 

<p>We’re considering a shift to using regtest (regression test mode—a local testing environment where blocks can be generated on demand) instead of relying on mainnet or testnet for complex integration tests:</p>

 
 No sync wait times: Tests won’t need to wait for long mainnet syncs to complete before running 

 Predictable test environments: Create custom blockchain states on demand rather than depending on network state 

 Faster iteration: Run complex network interactions without the overhead of full blockchain synchronization 
 

<p><br>This change would make our stateful tests significantly faster and more reliable, especially for testing complex interactions between Zebra and the network.</p>

 Workflow Modernization 

<p>We’re continuing to refactor our remaining specialized workflows, simplifying our infra-related deployment workflows</p>

<p>These changes will follow the same principles: reduce complexity, remove external dependencies where possible, and make everything work seamlessly in forks.</p>

 Continuous Improvement 

<p>The work we’ve completed over the past few months demonstrates our commitment to making Zebra easier to work with. We’ll continue to identify bottlenecks, simplify workflows, and improve the contributor experience.</p>
 <br>Get Started! 

<p>All of these improvements are already live in the main branch. If you’ve been thinking about contributing to Zebra, or if you previously had trouble running tests in your fork, now is a great time to give it another try.</p>

<p>Finally, the surveillance network that tracks your every drive is ready to listen to your existential crises. What could possibly go wrong when we equip a company with a legally questionable technology with auditory access to our&nbsp;streets?</p><p>Flock Safety has introduced a system called Raven. The automated license plate reader (ALPR) company, whose network of cameras operates in over 6,000 communities nationwide, is marketing the product under the slogan, “Safety you can see and now hear.” But here’s the thing, Raven has a “Distress Detection” feature capable of detecting sounds of human distress, such as screaming.</p> A “Drag-Net” for&nbsp;Sounds <p>Digital rights groups have sounded the alarm over the integration of sophisticated audio surveillance into Flock’s already contentious camera network. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) issued a blog post stating that “high-powered microphones parked above densely-populated city streets” pose an imminent threat to civil liberties. The EFF called on cities to cancel existing Flock contracts before the new feature can inflict “civil liberties harms to residents and headaches for&nbsp;cities.”</p><p>The concerns compound the existing controversy surrounding Flock’s technology. The company’s surveillance systems are already under fire for allegations of police misuse, including instances where law enforcement accessed Flock databases from other agencies across the country in searches targeting abortion patients and undocumented immigrants.</p><p>If the company’s current visual dragnet is being weaponized for searches far outside of violent crime, imagine the privacy violations possible with recorded human&nbsp;voices.</p> Legal Challenges <p>Flock’s pervasive surveillance systems are the subject of an ongoing lawsuit against the city of Norfolk, Virginia. In that case, a court filing revealed that a plaintiff’s location was recorded by 176 different Flock cameras 526 times over a three-and-a-half-month period.</p><p>A judge in the case has signalled a potential ruling against the company, asserting that such extensive, secretive monitoring violates society’s objective expectations of privacy and constitutes an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.</p><p>Furthermore, the gunshot detection technology itself, which Raven incorporates, has a documented history of technical failure and misuse. Audits of similar systems in other cities have consistently shown them to suffer from high rates of false reporting, often confusing other loud sounds for gunfire. Critics argue this unreliability often leads to the disproportionate concentration of police surveillance in majority-minority neighbourhoods.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

  <p>In this episode, Sebastien Couture is joined by Benjamin, the founder of CAP, a stablecoin protocol designed to provide insured yield. The protocol features two main products: CUSD, a digital dollar, and stCUSD, its staked, yield-bearing version. Yield is generated through an "allocation engine" where third-party operators borrow from the protocol's reserve to execute yield strategies. To ensure user deposits, these operators must be vouched for by restakers on protocols like Symbiotic. If an operator defaults, the restakers who vouched for them are slashed, protecting the stablecoin holders' funds. This model shifts risk from the end-user to the restakers, who have a bilateral relationship with the operators they underwrite, often backed by legal agreements.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Benjamin's background and perspective on China  Journey into crypto and stablecoins  Hot Take: Stablecoins are not as safe as you think  The evolution of stablecoin models  Has DeFi forgotten about decentralization?  CAP's design: CUSD and stCUSD  How CAP generates yield with operators and restakers  The role of restakers and legal agreements  Integrating with Symbiotic and views on EigenLayer  The best use cases for shared security  Navigating the Genius Act and global regulations  Rebuilding trust in the DeFi ecosystem  Why the stablecoin space is not too crowded  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/Benjamin918_">Benjamin on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/capmoney_">Cap Money</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

We’re proud to back the team, alongside Backed VC, Age1, Lingotto, Kerna Ventures, Norrsken, and Speedinvest.</p><p>Using natural transport receptors on endothelial cells, Aerska’s platform delivers advanced medicines directly to the brain. This enables precise silencing of disease-causing genes while reducing side effects — a breakthrough for conditions such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, which are rising by 30% every decade.

<p>Brave’s 100M monthly users can now manage Cardano assets, swap tokens, participate in on-chain governance—and more easily take part in Midnight’s Glacier Drop claim and future NIGHT redemption—directly in Brave’s built-in wallet</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO and LONDON, 2nd October 2025: <a href="https://iohk.io/">Input | Output (IO)</a>, the preeminent Web3 blockchain infrastructure and engineering firm, and <a>Brave Software</a>, creators of the privacy-first browser and integrated multi-chain Brave Wallet, today announced the successful completion of their Cardano integration. Users can hold and manage ADA and Cardano native assets in their Brave Wallet, send and receive transactions, execute token swaps, and participate in Cardano governance—all natively in the browser, with no extensions required. This end-to-end experience is available on desktop with simple access via Brave’s wallet icon .</p>
<p>“This completed integration advances Brave Wallet’s mission to be the most secure way to access Web3,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave and the Basic Attention Token (BAT). “Cardano support broadens multi-chain choice while improving the everyday experience without extensions or extra steps. We’re pleased to help unlock a smoother path to privacy-centric applications for our community.”</p>
<p>Completion of the integration also makes it significantly easier for eligible users to engage with the Midnight network, the privacy-enhancing blockchain project developed with support from IO, and participate in Midnight’s Glacier Drop, its multi-chain, phased token distribution and community onboarding programme - and to redeem NIGHT, Midnight’s native utility token.</p>
<p>In the claim phase, participants must prove control of an eligible wallet and provide a new Cardano destination address for the NIGHT distribution and subsequent redemption schedule. With native Cardano support live in Brave Wallet, users can create and manage that address in seconds, then receive and handle NIGHT like any other Cardano native asset—all within a single, secure, browser-based wallet environment.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IO, said: “Bringing Cardano natively into Brave Wallet is a win for usability, governance, and growth. It gives millions of privacy-minded users a simple way to hold ADA, use Cardano native assets, and participate in on-chain decision-making. Just as importantly, it lowers friction for Midnight’s Glacier Drop by making Cardano address creation and NIGHT redemption straightforward for newcomers and veterans alike.”</p>
<p>About Input | Output (IO)</p>
<p><a href="https://iohk.io/">Input | Output (IO)</a> is a world-leading blockchain infrastructure and research engineering firm dedicated to building a sustainable Web3 ecosystem. IO is committed to advancing the next generation of blockchain innovation, focusing on scalability, security, and real-world adoption through pioneering research and cutting-edge engineering.</p>

<p>In February 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria launched a centralized biometric identification system for the banking industry called Bank Verification Number (BVN). During the exercise, customer data such as fingerprint, photograph, and signature were collected. And I remember the ensuing frenzy that followed when customers were told that their bank accounts would be closed if they failed to verify them within a given period. But this is not peculiar to just&nbsp;Nigeria.</p><p>More than 86 million accounts will be <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/86-million-people-to-lose-access-to-their-bank-accounts-e58cdda36565">closed</a> in Vietnam due to a lack of biometric verification. Similarly, the Bank of Thailand recently froze 3 million bank accounts overnight and capped daily transfers at $1,300 to&nbsp;$5,500.</p><p>Now, don’t get me wrong. KYC is necessary in the fight against financial crime, but it can quickly become a tool for restrictive surveillance. Imagine having your bank account blocked because it was flagged for a malicious transaction. Honestly, I don’t have an issue with this. The problem usually lies in all the bureaucracies that come with trying to resolve&nbsp;things.</p><p>The bottom line is that governments and financial institutions can monitor, freeze, and control your assets with the click of a button. This is not a distant reality; it is already happening.</p> What Does it Mean to be Your Own&nbsp;Bank? <p>For centuries, banks have been the gatekeepers of wealth, but a new movement is empowering individuals to take control of their finances. This isn’t about hoarding cash in a mattress; it’s about leveraging technology and strategic thinking to become your own&nbsp;bank.</p><p>Being your own bank (BYOB) means freeing your money from the constraints of a traditional financial institution. Instead of relying solely on a savings account that might yield a meagre interest rate, you can become an active participant in your financial growth. BYOB focuses on maximizing returns, minimizing fees, and gaining direct control over your&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Take a minute to ponder on these&nbsp;stats:</p>  According to Bankrate’s Sept. 2025 <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/average-savings-interest-rates/#national">survey</a> of financial institutions in the US, the average savings account yield was 0.63% APY. The best high-yield savings accounts were paying between 4% and 5%&nbsp;APY.  While <a href="https://www.remitly.com/gb/en/landing/money-transfer-remittance-statistics">global remittance fees</a> have trended downward (dropping from 7.16% to 5.89% since 2019), the average cost is still high, running at around 6% of the amount transferred.   The Cryptocurrency Solution <p>Cryptocurrency, built on blockchain technology, provides a set of features that directly replicate and, in many ways, improve upon the services of a traditional bank, all without the need for a trusted, fallible, and costly middleman. Some of these features&nbsp;include:</p> 1. Self-Custody <p>The most significant difference between holding money in a bank and holding cryptocurrency is custody (who is the legal and physical holder of the&nbsp;asset).</p><p>When you place your money in a traditional bank, the bank holds your funds as a liability, making you a creditor to the institution. Your money is protected by deposit insurance (like FDIC/FSCS), but it remains vulnerable to bank insolvency or government freeze and&nbsp;seizure.</p><p>In contrast, with cryptocurrency held in a non-custodial wallet (such as a hardware wallet), you alone hold the private keys. These keys are the cryptographic proof of ownership. No single entity, bank, or government can freeze or seize these funds. Your security rests entirely on advanced cryptography. Furthermore, while banks limit access with hours, withdrawal limits, and bureaucratic processes, your crypto is accessible 24/7/365 and is permissionless, requiring only your private keys and an internet connection. This direct control is the essence of banklessness and financial autonomy.</p> 2. Cutting out the Middleman <p>Cryptocurrencies operate on a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) known as a blockchain. Traditional banks are centralized, meaning all power and data reside in one location. This creates a single point of failure that is inefficient, costly, and censorship-prone.</p><p>Cryptocurrency networks, however, are decentralized. The ledger of transactions is distributed and maintained across thousands of computers, or nodes, worldwide. The result is a network that offers faster, cheaper, and borderless payments.</p><p>When you send crypto on decentralized exchanges, you bypass the entire bureaucratic process of bank reconciliation, compliance checks, and multiple intermediaries. You transact directly with the recipient, peer-to-peer. This makes international transfers practically instant and significantly cheaper, avoiding the high fees and complexities of the traditional SWIFT system, effectively making you your own global payment processor.</p> 3. Programmable Money <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is the ecosystem of financial applications built on public blockchains. This system uses smart contracts, which are self-executing, self-enforcing code, to replace the need for human-run, bureaucratic financial departments.</p><p>With DeFi, you can replicate and improve traditional banking services. Instead of using a traditional savings account, you can deposit crypto into lending pools to automatically lend funds to borrowers and earn a high-yield interest, making you your own asset&nbsp;manager.</p><p>Instead of going through a loan officer, you can use borrowing platforms to take out a loan, using your crypto as collateral and bypassing credit checks to become your own loan officer. Furthermore, Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) allow you to swap cryptocurrencies instantly without ever giving up custody to a third&nbsp;party.</p><p>Your capital is not locked away; it is actively deployed through code to generate returns and liquidity on a global, 24/7&nbsp;market.</p> Conclusion <p>Remember the stats I asked you to ponder over earlier? While there are higher-yield offers from traditional institutions, you can earn an APY of between 13% to 25% on your cryptocurrency holdings. But I must warn you that digital assets are highly volatile and less regulated than their traditional counterparts. Similarly, the cost of sending funds across the globe is near zero on some blockchains like&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>In a future where financial data is a tool for control, the power of cryptocurrencies is about more than just technology. It is about the ability to opt out of the legacy banking system and stand for financial sovereignty.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Brave Search also now at 20 billion annualized queries</p>
<p>As of September 30th, the Brave browser has surpassed 100 million monthly active users (MAU) worldwide across desktop and mobile, officially reaching 101 million users.</p>
<p>We’d like to take a moment to celebrate this achievement, and tease what’s next. We’d also like to thank the 100 million (and counting!) people—whoever they are—who’ve joined Brave’s mission of building a privacy-by-default, user-first Web. We’re grateful for the support of all our users and particularly our vibrant Brave and BAT communities, whose passion and advocacy continue to drive us forward.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“100 million users represent more than a growth milestone—they constitute a movement for a better Web that puts users first. Across the globe, users are choosing privacy and control over their online experience, instead of Big Tech’s tracking and abuse,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every product we’ve launched since our browser—our search engine, our premium products, our ad platform—has been built with privacy protections. As we expand our AI offerings, we will continue to design for privacy-by-default, which will fuel our next wave of growth.”</p>
</blockquote>

 Brave Browser growth 
<p>Over the past two years, the Brave browser has seen an average of about 2.5 million net new users each month. This September, we officially surpassed 100 million monthly active users (MAU) worldwide. At the same time, we surpassed 42 million daily active users (DAU), for a DAU-to-MAU ratio of 0.42, underlining the high engagement that users have with Brave.</p>
<p>This growth has been fueled by a global awareness that Brave is an alternative to Big Tech and that users benefit greatly from a browser that preserves their privacy and is up to 3 times faster than competitors. Also, when users are given a choice, users exercise that choice and switch to new browsers. For example, daily installs for Brave on iOS in the EU went up 50% with the new browser choice panel, following the implementation of the DMA and release of iOS 17.4 in 2024.</p>




    
    
    
      
      
      
    
    


    








    





    
    




    
      
      
    
    
 

 The growth of Brave Search 
<p><a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a> is powered by its own, independent index of the Web. This makes it one of only three truly independent search engines in the western world, and the only one outside Big Tech.</p>
<p>Brave Search is also growing fast, with more than 1.6 billion queries each month, or nearly 20 billion queries per year. On average, Brave Search serves high-quality, independent, private answers for more than 50 million user queries every single day.</p>
<p>Brave Search also serves over 15 million AI-generated search answers daily, as millions of our users seek the convenience of AI integrated into a search engine. Brave also just announced <a>Ask Brave</a>, a new AI chat experience native to Brave Search that consolidates search and AI chat.</p>
<p>And while Brave Search is the default search engine for most Brave users, we’re also seeing increasing usage (about 8% of total daily queries) from other browsers (most notably Chrome).</p>

 Brave as a privacy ecosystem 
<p>We realized early on that people can only stay as private as the tools they use to get online. That’s why we sought to empower the browser as a single privacy super app. That means browsing that blocks ads and trackers by default, but also private search, and a suite of other tools as privacy alternatives to Big Tech offerings. By building these tools directly into the browser, we can remove the need for extensions.</p>
<p><a>Brave Shields</a> provide protection on every webpage you visit. By default, Shields block ads and third-party trackers, cross-site cookies, fingerprinting, and more. Shields can be easily configured to your preferences. And, best of all, these protections are provided without the need to download extensions or other apps.</p>
<p>In addition to Brave Shields, the Brave browser has many <a>advanced security and privacy protections</a> built in. These include <a>reduced network server calls</a>, <a>storage partitioning</a>, <a>Global Privacy Control (GPC) enablement</a>, <a>bounce tracking prevention</a>, and many more.</p>
<p>Finally, we knew that for users to protect their privacy online, we needed to offer usable, private-by-default alternatives. Brave Search never profiles its users. Brave Leo, the integrated AI assistant in the browser, doesn’t retain or share chats, or use them for model training. Brave VPN allows people to mask their location and hide their IP address, even on apps outside the Brave browser. Brave Wallet supports private and transparent shielded Zcash transactions. This kind of privacy-first approach applies to every product and feature we build.</p>

 Brave and AI 
<p>Brave Leo transforms how you use the Web, offering all the power of tools like ChatGPT without the privacy compromises or vendor lock-in. Choose from leading AI models including Claude, DeepSeek, Llama and Qwen, or connect your own local or remote models for better control over your AI experience, and total privacy. As your built-in browser companion, Leo understands your context across multiple browser tabs, PDFs, images, videos and documents, plus accesses real-time information to help you research, analyze, and create without constantly switching between apps. Best of all, Leo does not require an account or profile, and your conversation history is stored on your device. Leo doesn’t retain or share chats, or use them for model training.</p>
<p>The Brave Search “AI Answers” and “Ask” features allow people to ask questions and receive high-quality, current answers right in the search experience. Users can find AI-powered answers at the top of the results page, or even in a full-screen, follow-up chat.</p>
<p>Brave is also planning for the next phase of AI, with Leo’s new agentic experience. Like other AI agents, Leo agentic will be able to take actions on your behalf—drafting messages, responding, handling payments and bookings, and more. But, uniquely, Brave’s agentic experience will be siloed in a specialized browser profile, ensuring the agent has no access to other tabs that may contain sensitive information. It will also ensure you have ultimate say over the actions the agent can take and guard against unwanted actions.</p>

 Brave as a business 
<p>While Brave has seen incredible adoption among end users around the world, Brave has also grown as a sustainable business.</p>

 Brave Ads 
<p>Brave’s first-of-its-kind, privacy-respecting digital ads ecosystem is now working with some of the biggest brands in the world. Brave ads allow brands to reach incremental audiences that aren’t reachable in other channels. They provide unique ad units that appear directly in the browser interface or search engine results page, and provide safety for both brands (premium placement without unwanted collisions) and users (Brave Ads respect user privacy). To date, Brave Ads have been used by some of the biggest brands in the world, including Amazon, Ford, Intuit, eBay, Wayfair, and more.</p>

 Brave Search API 
<p>Brave Search is powered by its own, independent index of the Web. This makes it one of only three independent indexes in the western world, and the only one outside of Big Tech. And unlike Alphabet’s Google or Microsoft’s Bing, or supposedly independent providers like DuckDuckGo (which relies on Bing for its results), Brave doesn’t bias or censor results, or manipulate its search algorithm.</p>
<p>This index is now available to power other search or AI applications, via the <a>Brave Search API</a>. The Brave Search API can power agentic search, chatbots, coding assistants, and AI search engines. It provides real-time data to reduce hallucinations, and excels in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines. Best of all, the Brave Search API is available at no cost for up to 2k queries per month (QPM), and with affordable, transparent paid options starting as low as $5 CPM. The Brave Search API is currently the single source of real-time data for some of the biggest AI LLMs.</p>

 Brave Premium 
<p>While all of Brave’s end-user features are available for free, some may want a more premium experience. To this end, Brave offers affordable, enhanced versions of several of our free features, which we collectively call <a>Brave Premium</a>.</p>
<p>Brave Leo premium offers higher rate limits and access to more models. Brave Talk, our free videoconferencing tool, also has a premium version that brings better moderator controls, call records, and more. And Brave Search premium offers users an ad-free experience.</p>
<p>Our most widely-used premium feature—Brave VPN—now serves nearly 100,000 subscribers. One Brave VPN subscription protects up to 10 devices across desktop, iOS, and Android. With a slew of features meant to enhance both privacy and streaming performance, Brave VPN ensures safe access to the content you want, no matter where you are in the world.</p>

 Brave Wallet, Rewards, and BAT 
<p>Brave also offers great Web3 tools built right into the browser. <a>Brave Wallet</a> is a secure, multi-chain wallet where users can manage tokens, NFTs, and currencies, without the risk of third-party extensions. <a>Brave Rewards</a> is a completely opt-in experience that allows users to choose how (and how often) they see privacy-preserving Brave Ads in the browser. If they choose to opt in and connect a wallet, users can then earn a cut of any ad revenue, in the form of the <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Token</a> (or BAT). Brave Rewards also gives users an easy way to support the millions of websites and content creators registered with <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a>. With over 99% of its 1.5 billion supply in circulation, BAT is ranked as the 14th most distributed token by on-chain holders on Ethereum. This made Brave the first crypto application with more than 1 million users.</p>
<p>Many of the leading names in crypto and Web3 advertise with Brave Ads, integrate with Brave Wallet, or join the <a>Rewards Partner Program</a>.</p>

 A note on how Brave tallies user growth and other metrics 
<p>As a privacy company, we pride ourselves on adhering to a stronger variation of Google’s old (and since abandoned) mantra. When we say “Can’t be evil,” we mean we don’t have access to personal user data in the first place.</p>
<p>To that end, we’d like to explain how Brave even knows data points like monthly active users or daily search queries. We keep basic aggregate counts of how many times the browser is downloaded each day, across desktop, iOS, and Android. These counts tell us only that some computer or mobile device downloaded the browser, and the platform of that device; it does not tell us who or on which exact device.</p>
<p>We’re able to keep a similar count of daily and monthly usage based on something called the “daily usage ping.” At essence, this is a once-per-day ping from the browser client to our servers, telling us that the browser was opened on a device. Along with this ping is included the date Brave was installed on that device; in this way we can calculate retention, and ensure we’re not double counting. All data is collected and analyzed at an aggregate level, and safeguards are in place to ensure no personal data is collected. These safeguards can be reviewed in our open-source codebase.</p>
<p>We use a similar mechanism to tally daily queries in Brave Search—we can know how many queries happened, but not who made them, the text of the query itself, or the query results.</p>
<p>Finally, to understand usage of our individual features, we utilize Privacy Preserving Product Analytics (or P3A for short). This mechanism is also open-source and <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/P3A">can be reviewed by anyone</a>.</p>

     Cross-Border Banking Takes Center Stage     Aspora’s Parth Garg is building modern financial tools for the global diaspora.    
	By Emma Starer Gross	 





Published September 30, 2025
 



 
<p>In the summer of 2022, Parth Garg woke in his Bangalore apartment and realized something was very wrong. For the past six months, 21-year-old Garg and his cofounder had been hard at work on a revenue-based finance company to help Indian software businesses access capital debt. While the company had successfully launched a few months earlier and saw promising initial revenue, Garg and his cofounder were beginning to doubt its longevity. They were also struggling as coleaders with differing management styles, which often led to heated late-night arguments.</p>



<p>Now, as Garg walked through the cramped home he and his cofounder shared with their seven other employees (“Yes, nine of us lived and worked under one roof,” Garg says), he discovered his cofounder was gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the following hours, Garg learned his cofounder had booked a one-way ticket back to the States. Without discussing it with Garg, he had also emailed their investors to let them know he would be returning their seed round. In his eyes, the company was done. “It took a while to even comprehend what was happening,” Garg says. “It was one of the biggest gut punches I’d ever experienced. My team was in shock. Our investors were freaking out. And I had to decide what to do.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It was one of the biggest gut punches I’d ever experienced. My team was in shock. Our investors were freaking out. And I had to decide what to do.”</p>
Parth Garg</blockquote>



<p>Garg knew the company in its current iteration didn’t have legs. The Indian SaaS companies seeking debt capital were largely project based with unpredictable revenue, and the Indian market for bundling these companies and selling them to traditional investors—a strategy he and his former cofounder had discussed—was too premature. But Garg also knew he had a fantastic team, and they had built a strong foundation for a fintech company. What if they repurposed the technology for something else?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the following days, I had to convince both the investors and my coworkers to stick with me while I figured out a new direction for the company, a new business plan, and a case for why they should trust me to be its solo leader,” Garg says. As he considered how he might pivot the company, Garg returned again and again to one problem in particular—a pain point he had long experienced growing up as an expat. Garg went back to his team with a pitch for what would become Aspora.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched in the winter of 2022, Aspora is a financial services platform for the global diaspora, offering tools for immigrant communities to bank across borders and participate in the growth of their native countries’ economies. Aspora is currently focused on remittances for the Indian diaspora—the largest in the world. Just two years into its journey, the company is used by over 700,000 non-resident Indians (NRIs) and processes hundreds of millions of transfers each month. That’s over $4 billion in remittances a year, and 4% of all NRI remittances worldwide. Oh, and his growing team no longer lives under one roof.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Garg’s connection to the global diaspora dates back to his childhood. He was born in India and at age 11 moved with his family to Abu Dhabi. In the United Arab Emirates, a country of 90% expats, the challenges of international banking were all too familiar. Transferring money between accounts in different countries was a slow, bureaucratic process with steep exchange rates and fees. For Garg’s family and other NRIs, the path to invest in the Indian stock market, take out a loan, or purchase real estate back home was riddled with administrative hoops. Certain Indian banks offered NRI-specific accounts, but the process of opening one required visits to public notaries, phone calls with banks, and even trips back to India to finish paperwork in person. “Only 30% of NRIs have these accounts,” Garg says. “So 70% of NRIs that want to participate in their country’s growth just can’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for 11-year-old Garg, entrepreneurship and solving the problem of international banking were a ways off. As a child, Garg was passionate about two subjects; the first was physics. “I was fascinated by cosmology,” he says. “I would stay up late watching YouTube videos and reading works by Carl Sagan and Alexander Friedmann because I was convinced there was nothing more important than learning about the universe. That was my entire goal, to become a physicist.” When he wasn’t heads-down on physics, teenage Garg was busy with his other passion, one that exercised a very different part of his brain: theater.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Theater was my outlet for creative expression,” Garg says. “I was very playful as a kid, and in strict Indian schools, the only place you could really be playful was on the stage or in drama club.” Garg participated in as many school productions as he could, and as a teenager, he took up improv and directing. “Theater was always the thing that recharged me the most,” Garg says. “With directing, I learned how to be a leader and communicate a vision. With improv, I learned to think quickly on my feet. Above all, I think theater in general taught me empathy. When you’re acting, you’re embodying someone else. You constantly have to think from other people’s perspectives, understand what’s going through their mind, and adapt.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“With directing, I learned how to be a leader and communicate a vision. With improv, I learned to think quickly on my feet.”</p>
Parth Garg</blockquote>



<p>When Garg arrived as a freshman at Stanford in the fall of 2019, he fell easily into the campus’s theater community, taking part in the longstanding, annual student-written musical Gaieties. His entry into physics at Stanford, however, led to a personal inflection point. “I realized pretty quickly that while I was good at physics, I wasn’t great,” Garg says. “There’s this statistic that almost every physicist to win the Nobel Prize was awarded it based on work he or she did under the age of 24. There’s only a small sliver of people that have the IQ to be able to do groundbreaking research. I remember this kid my freshman year who never took undergrad physics classes. He was approved to go straight to grad school ones. That’s sort of when I knew, I’m probably not going to be part of that small sliver of groundbreaking physicists. And that was pretty shattering.”&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Garg hit pause on the Russian period drama playing on his laptop and stared up at the ceiling of his childhood bedroom in Abu Dhabi. It was the summer of 2020, and Garg was feeling lost. A few months earlier COVID-19 had hit, sending the world into lockdown and Stanford students home to finish classes remotely. Garg had emailed Stanford to let the university know he was taking his sophomore year off. “I didn’t want to do classes online, but I also just didn’t have a clue what I wanted to do with my life,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garg describes the first half of the year as “a lot of moping around” and cycling through foreign period dramas. One night over dinner, however, his father, who was working in industrial trading at the time, brought up a problem he had observed with grocery stores purchasing bulk food items: The stores would stock their shelves with goods, but when those goods neared expiration, customers were less likely to buy them. The goods were often thrown away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gears in Garg’s mind began to turn—there had to be a solution for this. “I began to think about the food service industry,” he says. “What if ingredients that were close to expiring could be sold to restaurants? The restaurants could buy them at a lower cost than from traditional suppliers, cook with the ingredients day-of, and prevent food waste.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garg texted friends he had collaborated with in high school on a project that helped teenagers find volunteer opportunities. Over the next few months, they built a system that connected Abu Dhabi grocery stores to restaurants. “I really, really enjoyed it,” Garg says. “This feedback loop of talking to users, asking what they wanted, going and making it, and then shipping it back was pure dopamine. I realized I wanted to continue doing this.” In the fall of 2021, Garg re-enrolled at Stanford with newfound determination to become an entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The year that followed was a rollercoaster of twists and turns, highs and lows for Garg. In his first semester back at school, Garg and a classmate came up with their idea for a company that helped businesses access capital debt. On a whim, they pitched it to Y-Combinator and were accepted to its Winter 2022 batch. During their time at YC, the startup shifted focus from American microbusiness to Indian software businesses. “Fifteen percent of India’s GDP is from software companies, but almost none of them have access to debt capital because Indian banks don’t know how to lend against software,” Garg says. “They only know how to lend against tangible assets.” At YC’s Demo Day, they received a seed investment and made arrangements to move to India to launch their company. Just three months after re-enrolling at Stanford, Garg found himself dropping out again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Garg and his cofounder set up shop in their house in Bangalore and hired a team of seven developers to live and work with them, Garg found the challenges of participating in his native economy back on his radar. Although he had credit history in the UAE and in the United States, and although he had Indian citizenship, he struggled to get approved for an Indian credit card. “It was incredibly frustrating,” Garg says. “It was again this problem of when you are living in between host and native countries, you fall into a category where neither really knows what to do with you, and financial life is very hard. I didn’t understand why, in a world with so many modern financial tools, something like opening a credit card in the country where you’re from should be so difficult.”</p>

Parth Garg</blockquote>



<p>As the high of launching the capital debt business in the spring of 2022 gave way to the lows of realizing that Indian SaaS companies lacked predictable revenue and the increasingly tenuous relationship with his cofounder, followed by his sudden departure, Garg began thinking more critically about the problem of international banking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ended up going into this deep rabbit hole of cross-border finance, and I spoke to over 100 people around the world who, like me, were dealing with this broken system,” Garg says. The global diaspora is estimated to be around 281 million people, approximately 3.6% of the world’s population, and the majority of diasporans who work in another country make 10 times the amount of their counterparts back home. In 2023, the World Bank reported $656 billion in remittances globally and that in more than 60 countries, remittances represent 3% or more of GDP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem, Garg observed, was that banking technology hadn’t been updated to meet the needs of today’s global workforce. Banks have traditionally been hyperlocal institutions, operating only in local currencies and under the rules and regulations of local governments. “Banks use these very patchy systems to connect with each other,” Garg says. “I realized there was an enormous market for modern cross-border banking tools, and there weren’t a lot of players in this space. The pitch I made to the investors and to my coworkers was, ‘We should go after it.’ And to their credit, they all said yes.”</p>



<p>Aligned on a new mission, Garg and his team began to look at case studies of other successful global fintech companies. “We read a lot about the early strategies of Wells Fargo and Nubank and learned that if you want to make a consumer financial platform work, you need customers using four to five products with you. Otherwise you’re not going to be able to build a sustainable business from a customer acquisition cost and longevity perspective,” Garg says. “And to get people using four to five products, you need hyper-specific product roadmaps for each ideal consumer profile.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garg noticed competitors in the cross-border finance space—companies like Wise and Remitly—were going after broad audiences: immigrants of many backgrounds transferring money to many countries. “We realized our competitors were actually catering to hundreds of ideal customer profiles,” Garg says. “That’s because every immigrant group is very different in terms of cultural nuances and needs. We felt it would be virtually impossible for us to go after a wide population like our competitors and succeed at deep product integration into users’ lives.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing they needed to hone in on a subset of immigrants, Garg identified the seven biggest diasporas: Indian, Mexican, Chinese, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Filipino and Nigerian. “The seven biggest diasporas are 90% concentrated in seven developed countries,” Garg says, “the U.S., Canada, Europe, the U.K., the UAE, Singapore and Australia. So we then had this question of, okay, do you start off by building services for one developed country and all diasporans within that population? Or do you build tools for one diaspora across seven developed countries?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garg went with the latter, choosing India as its first diaspora and remittances as its first product. “That was the best choice we could have made early on,” he says. “It naturally forced us to get licensed across those seven key developed countries, form relationships and build rails with them, and be multicurrency from day one.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Critically, Garg’s ambitions coincided with the emergence of a new technology: stablecoins. Aspora’s infrastructure is built on stablecoin rails, which allows remittances to be transacted without intermediaries and to be settled instantly. Compared to SWIFT rails, which remain the dominant system for financial messaging, stablecoins offer a faster, less expensive and more transparent system for transferring money internationally. Transactions via stablecoin have exploded in the last few years, with the weekly trading volume of stablecoin USDC growing from $5 billion in 2022 to $23 billion in 2024. The technology is also seeing acceptance by major institutions: The U.S. government passed the GENIUS act earlier this year, creating the first-ever federal regulatory system for stablecoins. Stripe, which acquired the stablecoin platform Bridge in 2024, is just one of the dominant fintech players incorporating stablecoins into its infrastructure. For Aspora, it’s a convergence of the right idea, with the right technology, at the right moment in history.</p>

<p>In November 2024, George Robson—a partner at Sequoia—knocked on the door of an apartment on the outskirts of Dubai. He, along with Luciana Lixandru, another Sequoia partner, had flown to meet with Garg, whose team had launched Aspora’s remittance feature for NRIs living in the U.K. and was now working on it for the UAE. “I had heard about Garg back when he was working on his finance company for Indian SaaS businesses,” says Robson, who had been a product owner at the fintech company Revolut. “I remember thinking that was an objectively bad idea.” But since pivoting the company, multiple sources had mentioned Garg’s name to Robson. “You had this 23-year-old doing something really interesting,” Robson says. “He was using stablecoins to power instant, 24/7 transactions between foreign banks at half the price for consumers. And he had this vision of using remittances as a wedge to own that consumer financial relationship and eventually build a financial super app for the global diaspora.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Garg answered the door and walked the two partners down the hall to a windowless kitchen with three chairs. “No table,” Robson says. “He was just like, ‘Yeah, so this is where we’ll do the four-and-a-half-hour deep dive into the company with potential investors.’ We ended up relocating to a hotel lobby, which was a bit more comfortable, but we realized this is a guy whose priority is execution and output. Being in this apartment, which was set up as this sort of hacker house, we saw that his team shared his dedication. Parth has this ability to inject energy and excitement into everyone around him.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Robson and Lixandru continued learning about Aspora, they observed an intensity not just from those building the product but from those using it. “This is a customer that literally watches the GBP to INR rate like a hawk because they’re moving money home,” Robson says. “And if you’re moving large volumes, it really matters that you get a good exchange rate. There was a period of about two hours where the GBP to INR rate spiked and we broke all records in the company’s history by some order of magnitude for transactions that were processed. Aspora is dealing with a customer that is sophisticated, excited, financially aspirational, and heavily engaged—and I’ve never seen that before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of 2024, Sequoia closed on Aspora’s Series A. In the spring of 2025, they co-led its Series B.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>As of August 2025, Aspora has saved users over $15 million in transfer fees. The next product on its roadmap is a digital bank account for NRIs, one that can be opened entirely online. “No more flying back to India to fill out paperwork by hand,” Garg says. “It’s the most requested feature from our user base, so that’s going to be super exciting for us to launch.” This will be followed by products for NRIs to trade stocks and purchase real estate. The goal is to replicate this blueprint for other diasporas—the team has already begun to look toward the Philippines as their next market.</p>



<p>Garg envisions a world where international money transfer as it once was will be just a memory: hours-long calls with banks, waiting days for payments to go through, bracing for fees taken out of remittances sent to loved ones. Instead, all families will be able to send money whenever and wherever and take advantage of other economic opportunities in their native countries—buying a house for their parents, setting up investment accounts for their children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Garg hasn’t acted in a play since his time at Stanford, he’s putting the skills he learned in his drama club and improv days to work. The exercise is similar: thinking on his feet, directing a team, and putting himself in someone else’s shoes to deliver a meaningful product. If there’s an equivalent of a standing ovation in the startup world, he’s hoping to get one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a testament to the sheer cost of not wanting to be bothered, Google and the popular menstrual-tracking app Flo Health have agreed to pay a combined $56 million to resolve a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that Flo had illegally shared user data with tech giants, essentially turning the most intimate details of users’ reproductive lives into premium ad inventory.</p><p>Google will set up a $48 million fund while Flo will chip in a respectable $8 million. The best part? According to a notice for potential claimants, both companies explicitly denied the allegations, stating the settlement simply allows them “to avoid the risks and costs of lengthy litigation and the uncertainty of additional pre-trial proceedings.”</p><p>This is like saying: “We didn’t do it, but here is enough money to buy a small island. Please go&nbsp;away.”</p><p>The issue involves data collected between November 2016 and February 2019. Apparently, Flo allegedly used software development kits (SDKs) to funnel sensitive health information, such as data on menstrual cycles, pregnancy attempts, and sexual activity, to third parties like Google, Meta, and the now-defunct analytics firm Flurry (which previously settled for $3.5 million).</p> The Meta&nbsp;Loophole <p>The litigation became a bellwether case for the legality of ad tracking, and the jury certainly set a precedent. While Google and Flo settled, co-defendant Meta, which took the allegations to trial, was found liable for violating the California Invasion of Privacy&nbsp;Act.</p><p>Meta, in a move of legal gymnastics that would impress an Olympian, had tried to argue that their collection of women’s health data from the app was merely “secondhand” and therefore not covered by the wiretapping law. A federal judge in California, however, struck down this bid to overturn the verdict, suggesting that collecting intimate health data still constitutes a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>This case should serve as a comforting reminder: When a free app offers to track highly personal health data for you, the trade-off is entirely fair. You get personalized health insights, and in return, billion-dollar companies get the kind of granular marketing data that allows them to perfectly time an advertisement for prenatal vitamins right when your app confirms you’re five days&nbsp;late.</p><p>The next time you’re asked to click “I Agree” on an app’s privacy policy, just remember: your most intimate biological secrets are now safely protected by a $56 million settlement fund… and the good faith of the same entities who still deny they ever wanted your data in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>Today we’re launching Ask Brave, a single interface that consolidates search and AI chat. Ask Brave is available on the <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a> homepage and at the top of the Brave Search results page. It’s free and available on any browser or platform.</p>
<p>With Ask Brave, users no longer have to choose between different tools depending on the action they want to perform, juggling between traditional search engines with their ten blue links, and chat-like interfaces with their walls of text. Brave solves this problem by offering a system that combines the best of both approaches, eliminating the unnecessary back-and-forth between different platforms and cumbersome copy-pasting. Ask Brave provides comprehensive answers to any question, plus all the additional actionable elements–such as videos, webpages, and products–at the click (or tap) of a button.</p>

 The best of both worlds: chat and search 
<p>AI answers are not new in Brave Search—we released the first version of this feature in March 2023 (known as “<a>Summarizer</a>”). Today’s version—AI Answers (originally <a>Answer with AI</a>)—serves over 15 million answers per day, making it one of the most widely used AI products in the market. Ask Brave is the next iteration of this experience, combining the best of both worlds: the simplicity and direct action of the conventional Brave Search engine, and the convenience and time-saving benefits of LLM-generated responses. Ask Brave is available in addition to AI Answers, which are meant to provide users with quick answers, while Ask Brave gives users more extensive results. Users can easily follow up with more queries in chat fashion, thus combining search and chat.</p>
<p>The answers provided by Ask Brave are always grounded in information found on the Web, meaning that the AI is less likely to hallucinate or provide irrelevant information. As a search engine, we ensure the AI limits itself to search results that are relevant to your question.</p>
<p>You can type simple search queries or ask nuanced, detailed questions. Ask Brave will determine which level of resolution best suits your needs and offer you both an answer and follow-up actions typically associated with that answer. Here are just a few examples of what Ask Brave can do:</p>

<p>Following Brave’s commitment to users’ privacy, your questions and conversations are never used for training in any capacity. Chats are encrypted, ephemeral and expire by default after 24 hours of inactivity. We don’t retain IP addresses. For more information, see <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/privacy-policy">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Brave Search was the first search engine to offer free and public access to AI summaries in 2023, and today we  generate more than 15 million AI-powered answers daily with our AI Answers feature. Seeing the engagement of our users with this feature and how much appetite they have for the convenience offered by AI integrated into a search engine, it was a natural step to launch Ask Brave as the evolution of AI Answers,” said Josep M. Pujol, Chief of Search at Brave. “While AI Answers give our users quick summaries, Ask Brave provides longer answers, follow-ups, and a chat mode enhanced with Deep Research, and most importantly, contextually relevant enrichments such as videos, news articles, products, businesses, shopping, and more - in the right place, at the right time. Search makes it possible, LLMs glue it together.  We anticipate that Ask Brave will generate millions more daily AI-powered answers with this powerful combination of search and chat, and look forward to deploying more useful AI-powered search tools for our users.”</p>

 Using Deep Research when thoroughness is more important than speed 
<p>While Brave’s standard search already delivers reliable, comprehensive results for most queries, sometimes a user may want to run longer research sessions on a topic and focus on getting a comprehensive, exhaustive overview.</p>
<p>Ask Brave is built on Brave’s <a>recent grounding technology for the Search API</a>, which achieves state-of-the-art scoring on factual accuracy benchmarks (94.9% accuracy on SimpleQA). This Deep Research technique leverages multiple rounds of Brave’s proven search against our junk-free index of 35+ billion webpages. The system has been designed to iteratively cover blindspots, issuing dozens of queries and analyzing thousands of pages so users receive the most thorough and well-informed responses available.</p>

 How to try Ask Brave 
<p>All AI features in Brave Search are designed with a “when you need them” philosophy. LLMs come in handy, but can also be wasteful and distracting. Here are the ways you can easily try Ask Brave:</p>
<p>Method 1: If Brave Search is your default search engine, you can ask a question directly in your browser—ending that query with a double question mark “??” will direct the query to Ask Brave.</p>




    
    
    
      
      
      
    
    


    








    


    




    
    




    
      
      
    
    
      
        Figure 6: Ending queries with a double question mark ?? - will send the query straight to Ask Brave
      
    
 
<p>Method 2: Click the “Ask” button on <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a> (next to the magnifying glass “Search” button)</p>




    
    
    
      
      
      
    
    


    








    


    




    
    




    
      
      
    
    
      
        Figure 7: Ask Brave button on search input field
      
    
 
<p>Method 3: Click the “Ask” tab on the search results page (SERP) to expand the normal search into a chat search.</p>




    
    
    
      
      
      
    
    


    












    
    




    
      
      
    
    
 
<p>You can also set your homepage to <a href="https://search.brave.com/ask">https://search.brave.com/ask</a>.</p>

 About Brave and Brave Search 
<p>Brave is a privacy-preserving Web browser with over 97 million monthly active users worldwide. Brave Search is the default search engine in Brave, and is also available in any browser at <a href="https://search.brave.com">https://search.brave.com</a>. Brave Search is the third-largest global independent search engine, with an index of over 35 billion webpages and a volume of over 1.5 billion monthly queries.</p>
<p>Brave Search also offers a <a>Search API</a> that helps organizations supply their AI LLMs with real-time data, power agentic search, train foundation models, and create search-enabled software. The Brave Search API is for building applications that benefit from having access to the Web, going beyond the static knowledge of AI models, and is currently the single source of real-time data for some of the biggest AI LLMs.</p>
<p>Note: With this update, we’ve simplified the name of an earlier AI feature: Answer with AI is now AI Answers. All AI features in Brave Search are optional and can be turned off via the settings menu.</p>

<p>Horizen 基金会非常高兴地与社区分享我们与 zkVerify 基金会合作的细节，为 Horizen 支持者和 ZEN 持有者提供赚取zkverify（VFY）奖励的机会。</p>
<p>众所周知，zkVerify 的 TGE 活动即将于 9 月 30 日举行，届时将发行 $VFY 代币，该代币将驱动 zkVerify 网络。虽然 zkVerify 和 Horizen 是两个独立的网络和项目，但它们之间有着密切的联系，因为它们都源自 Horizen 实验室多年的经验和开发贡献。</p>
<p>长期以来，在我们的线上社区论坛以及其他各种线上线下活动中，我们一直在讨论向 ZEN 持有者空投 VFY 代币。今天，我们很高兴分享我们的未来发展方向，我们相信这不仅认可了 ZEN 持有者的贡献和忠诚度，也符合两个基金会的使命，即为各自的项目和生态系统实现长期可持续的增长实同双赢。</p>
<p>在获得 Horizen DAO 社区批准后，Horizen 基金会将从 zkVerify 基金会获得 VFY 代币的分配，并已达成协议运营 zkVerify 网络验证器节点以支持网络运营。这些节点将在正常运行过程中获得网络代币发行以及一定比例的 zkVerify 协议收入。具体金额将取决于验证器运营和技术实现。<br><br></p>
<p>其次，我们也从社区中清晰地了解到，ZEN 质押计划（例如之前存在于 Horizen 旧链上，并随着 ZEN 迁移到 Base 链而弃用的计划）是许多人选择持有 ZEN 并参与 ZEN 社区的重要原因。</p>
<p>今天，我们宣布重新启动 ZEN 质押计划，质押奖励为 VFY 代币，奖励给ZEN 质押者。Horizen 基金会运营的验证节点第一年的 VFY 发行量将 100% 收益直接发放给ZEN质押者作为奖励。这意味着，ZEN 质押者将获得相当于全年由Horizen基金会运行的VFY 节点奖励，这不仅仅是一次性的空投。</p>
<p>ZEN 质押者不仅会从这些VFY代币发行中获得奖励，我们还正在规划一个框架，使ZEN质押者在未来可以获得基于 Horizen主网上更多应用的空投奖励，来感谢社区对Horizen的长期支持。</p>
<p>我们目前正在审查内部和外部的开发方案，以便在今年晚些时候推出这个新的质押平台。我们还将定期对 ZEN 持有者进行快照，以确保在质押解决方案开发完成后，今天的社区成员能够参与该计划。Horizen DAO 的投票将很快向社区开放，以批准该计划。<br><br></p>
<p>我们理解，关于分配机制和时间安排的细节仍需进一步探讨，我们也将着眼于长远发展，致力于促进生态系统和项目的持续成功，从而为网络参与者带来可持续的利益。</p>
<p>未来几周，我们将定期分享更多信息，以便所有相关人员都能清晰地了解这些细节。我们的共同目标是着眼长远，为 Horizen 和 zkVerify 社区构建可持续的生态系统。</p>
<p>我们期待在未来的岁月里与大家继续携手前行。</p>
<p><br><br>对了，关于 Horizen 主网将于第四季度上线，我们还有更多消息……</p>
<p>请注意，本公告仅供参考，不构成任何证券、金融产品或投资建议的要约。任何未来的分配、奖励或代币仍需遵守适用法律、税务义务和技术实施。计划细节、资格和时间安排可能会有所变更。Horizen Labs 不运营或控制 Horizen 基金会和 zkVerify 基金会，这两个项目也均不由 Horizen Labs 管理。</p>

  Partnering with Juicebox: The Recruiting Platform Founders Are Obsessed With  <p>Thousands of recruiters, including our own team, already rely on Juicebox to find and hire the best talent faster.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/abhishek-malani/">Abhishek Malani</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/brian-halligan/">Brian Halligan</a>	 



Published September 25, 2025
  



DAVID, DAVID AND ISHAN.



 
<p>When we first heard about Juicebox, an early-stage founder told us he was “obsessed.” We soon discovered he wasn’t alone. Thousands of recruiters, including Sequoia’s own team, had already adopted the <a href="https://juicebox.ai/">platform</a>, fueling viral growth.</p>



<p>Part of Juicebox’s appeal is that it is useful for companies of all sizes. Early stage startup founders find Juicebox and use it as a default, day-one part of their tech stack. At later stage companies like Ramp and Perplexity, expert recruiters bring Juicebox into the organization to amplify their impact. And finally within big companies, which often have dozens of dedicated sourcers as well as external contingent recruiters, Juicebox agents become just another member of the team, adding to the overall hiring funnel.</p>



<p>Juicebox’s growth has been remarkable. With just four people, the team bootstrapped to $1M in ARR. Today they’ve scaled to $10M and 2,500 customers. One customer told us they built their entire 20-person team on Juicebox; another said they flipped their recruiting day from 80% sourcing to 80% engaging with candidates.</p>



<p>Juicebox’s mission—to help their customers win the talent war—is more important than ever right now. Ask any founder or recruiter and you’ll hear the same story: nights spent sifting through hundreds of profiles, hours lost sending cold outreach and too many great candidates slipping through the cracks. Juicebox flips that script. By automating the grind—from finding to qualifying to engaging—it lets hiring teams spend their time where it matters most: building relationships with the people they want to hire.</p>



<p>How does it work? Juicebox scans thousands of profiles, scores candidates against pre-set criteria and recommends the best matches, all while handling outreach and coordination. Recruiters and hiring managers can run it in Autopilot mode or Agent mode, making it a productivity multiplier for teams of any size. Unlike legacy recruiting platforms that simply organize resumes, Juicebox actively sources, qualifies and engages candidates on your behalf, making it the first true AI recruiting partner.</p>



JUICEBOX ON AUTOPILOT MODE.



JUICEBOX AGENTS.



<p>Our conviction in Juicebox is driven not just by the product, but also by the razor sharp team making this all possible. Founders David and Ishan are both immigrants, David from Germany and Ishan from India. Driven by their own frustrations with traditional recruiting, David and Ishan spent years iterating and became deep experts in both talent workflows and LLMs. Their product reflects a deep level of maturity, earned through their own gritty journey, grinding on this problem for years.</p>



<p>As the Juicebox team and product continue to grow, we’re proud to lead their Series A and support them on this journey. If you’re excited to shape the future of recruiting, Juicebox is hiring—learn more <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Juicebox">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today we’re proud to share that BlueYard led the $24M Series A for <a href="https://corintis.com/">Corintis</a>, a Swiss startup reshaping how chips are cooled at the most fundamental level. We had already led Corintis’ Seed round in 2022, and us leading two rounds in sequence is a testament to the team’s execution and our conviction in the company unlocking the next step function growth in compute power through better cooling of&nbsp;chips.</p><p>The round comes alongside a group of industry leaders, such as Lip-Bu Tan — who joined as a board member prior to beginning his post as CEO of Intel. It also marks a major step forward for a team that is already deployed in data centers on the latest generation of AI chips; and is ramping up production to meet customer orders for millions of cooling&nbsp;loops.</p><p>Why does this matter? Because the future of AI is running into the laws of physics. The chips training today’s models consume an order of magnitude more energy than those that powered the early versions of ChatGPT. The result: excessive heat generation has become a critical bottleneck for chip performance and one of the biggest cost drivers for cloud data&nbsp;centers.</p><p>Corintis met this challenge head on. Their microfluidic cooling technology etches microscopic channels into silicon, guiding liquid coolant to the regions of a chip where it’s needed most. The result is more effective heat removal, lower water consumption, and the ability to bring vastly more powerful chips&nbsp;online.</p><p>Earlier this week, Corintis announced its <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microfluidics-liquid-cooling-ai-chips/">partnership with Microsoft</a> — proving out the value of its microfluidic cooling technology at scale. Together, they demonstrated an in-chip system that removes heat three times more effectively than the best solutions in use&nbsp;today.</p><p>Our conviction in Corintis comes from a simple observation: progress in compute has always run up against physical limits. For decades, Moore’s Law delivered speed and scale. But as transistors shrank, performance stalled under the weight of heat. Cooling was the bottleneck. Corintis is the breakthrough.</p><p>At BlueYard, we seek out the n-of-1 founders who confront mission-critical limits like this one head-on. Remco, Sam, and the Corintis team embody that ethos, turning a constraint that defines the edge of progress into the foundation for what comes&nbsp;next.</p><p>Disclaimer: The information contained in this article has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any entity managed by BlueYard Capital (“BlueYard”).

  LLMs can memorize and leak training data, posing serious privacy risks. We introduce CAMIA, an assessment method tailored to the generative nature of LLMs.

<p>Exposing privacy vulnerabilities in Large Language Models, honored with an oral presentation at the&nbsp;2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>This post describes work by Hongyan Chang, Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Kleomenis Katevas, and Hamed Haddadi, from Brave, and Reza Shokri, from NUS.</p>

 Summary 
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can memorize and leak sensitive training data, posing serious privacy risks. To assess such memorization and information leakage, we introduced <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13745">CAMIA (Context-Aware Membership Inference Attack)</a>, the first method tailored to the generative nature of LLMs, which nearly doubles detection accuracy compared to prior approaches and reveals where memorization truly occurs.</p>


    


 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Why should we care about privacy in LLMs? 
<p>LLMs are increasingly embedded in products we use every day—from chatbots and virtual assistants to search engines and productivity tools. With this integration comes a critical question: can these models inadvertently leak the data they were trained on?</p>
<p>Consider a few real-world scenarios:</p>
 
 Healthcare: If clinical notes were part of training, a model might accidentally reveal sensitive patient information. 
 Enterprise: If internal emails or documents were included, an attacker could trick the model into reproducing private communications. For instance, LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a6278444">recently announced</a> that they plan to use user data to improve their generative AI models (including LLMs), raising concerns about whether internal communications or private content might appear in generated outputs. 
 Education and media: If exam questions or paywalled content appeared in training, the model might regurgitate them verbatim. 
 
<p>These risks matter not just for individual users, but also for institutions facing regulatory, ethical, and reputational stakes. Privacy lapses could violate data protection laws, copyright rules, or undermine trust in deployed AI systems.</p>

 How can we measure privacy risks in LLMs? 
<p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are designed to assess model memorization by testing whether a given data point was part of the training set. In simple terms, an adversary asks: "did the model see this example during training?" If the answer can be reliably inferred, the model is leaking information about its training data—a direct privacy risk.</p>
<p>The core intuition is that machine learning models often behave differently on training samples versus unseen samples. These behavioral differences can appear in loss values, confidence scores, prediction stability, or other model outputs. MIAs systematically exploit these gaps: if an adversary can distinguish members from non-members based on such signals, it shows that the model is memorizing and leaking training data.</p>




    
    
    
    


    








    





    
    




    
    
 
<p>One way to think about this is as a hypothesis test:</p>
 
 H₀: Bob’s record was not used in training. 
 H₁: Bob’s record was used in training. 
 
<p>By probing the model with Bob’s record and observing its behavior, the adversary tries to decide which hypothesis is more likely. If the model’s responses give away this information, it means training data membership can be inferred, revealing a concrete privacy risk.</p>

 What are the challenges in measuring privacy risks in LLMs? 
<p>A simple instantiation of membership inference is the loss-threshold attack, where a sample is classified as a member if the model loss on it falls below a predefined threshold. While this basic method works in many settings, more advanced MIAs probe richer aspects of model behavior—such as output entropy, prediction dynamics, or shadow models—to achieve stronger inference.</p>




    
    
    
    


    








    





    
    




    
    
 
<p>In the context of LLMs, a straightforward adaptation is to compute the model’s loss on a target sentence. If the loss is unusually low compared to the non-training text, this suggests that the sentence might have been memorized. While such naïve adaptations can already reveal leakage, they fall short when applied to LLMs.</p>
<p>This is because most MIAs were originally designed for classification models, which output a single prediction per input. LLMs, however, are generative: they produce text token-by-token, and each prediction is conditioned on the prefix of all preceding tokens. This sequential structure makes memorization context-dependent, meaning that simply aggregating losses across an entire sequence misses the crucial token-level dynamics that drive leakage.</p>




    
    
    
    


    








    





    
    




    
    
 
<p>Consider the example in the graphic above:</p>
 
 When the prefix already contains strong cues—e.g. “Harry Potter is…written by… The world of Harry…”—the model confidently predicts the next token “Potter.” Here, the low loss is due to the prefix providing enough context, not because the model memorized the training instance. 
 By contrast, if the prefix is just “Harry,” predicting “Potter” requires much more reliance on memorized training sequences. In this case, the model’s low loss is a stronger indicator of membership. 
 

 Our method: CAMIA (Context-Aware Membership Inference Attack)&nbsp; 
<p>Our key insight is that memorization in LLMs is context-dependent.</p>
 
 When the prefix provides clear guidance—for example, through repetition or strong overlap with the next tokens—the model can generalize without relying on memorization. 
 When the prefix is ambiguous or complex, the model becomes uncertain, and in these cases, it is more likely to fall back on memorized training sequences. 
 
<p>Therefore, an effective membership inference attack should not depend solely on overall sequence loss, but should explicitly capture how context shapes predictive uncertainty at the token level.</p>
<p>To combat this, we introduced CAMIA (Context-Aware Membership Inference Attack), a new approach that tracks how uncertainty evolves during text generation. CAMIA can:</p>
 
 Measure how quickly uncertainty is resolved across prefixes, revealing when the model transitions from “guessing” to “confident recall.” 
 Adjust for cases where uncertainty is artificially reduced by repetition or trivial patterns. 
 Operate at the token level instead of relying on a single static loss threshold. 
 
<p>By focusing on these contextual dynamics, CAMIA uncovers memorization behaviors in LLMs that traditional MIAs fail to detect.</p>

 Our results 
<p>On the MIMIR benchmark, across six Pythia (70M–12B parameters) and GPT Neo (125M–2.7B parameters) models and six domains including Web, Wikipedia, Medical, News, Mathematics, Arxiv, and GitHub, CAMIA consistently outperforms existing attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAMIA is effective: It increases the true positive rate from 20.11% to 32.00% while keeping the false positive rate at 1% (Higher TPR and Lower FPR indicate better attack performance) when applied to Pythia 2.8B on the ArXiv dataset.</p>
<p>CAMIA is computationally efficient: It requires only the calculation and composition of membership signals. Evaluating 1,000 samples from the Arxiv dataset using a single A100 GPU, CAMIA completes in approximately 38 minutes.</p>

 CAMIA is open-sourced 
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13745">CAMIA</a> is accepted at the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (<a href="https://2025.emnlp.org/">EMNLP 2025</a>) as an oral presentation and is nominated for the outstanding paper award. CAMIA will be presented at the conference between November 4th and 9th, 2025, in Suzhou, China.</p>
<p>CAMIA is also available <a href="https://github.com/changhongyan123/context_aware_mia">as an open-source implementation</a>.</p>
