The vast majority of people are hung up on polarizing political screeds and cannot see that the emergent control grid is firmly grounded in systems biology, scientific charity, eugenics, and materialism. If we could mute the culture wars for just a few moments, clear our minds, and look around, we might be able to hear in the far distance the soft hum of cadres of quantitative analysts pouring over bioinformatics, psychographic profiles, social physics, and social and natural capital valuations to shape a post-human, post-nature earth. If we don’t get our bearings soon, our descendants will find themselves existing as interchangeable modules in a vast social computer run by machines.</p>
<p>Based on what I am seeing in the Web3 space, I’m picturing a new NGO culture emerging in which Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), with a pretense of tokenized<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqwAX_oGUh8"> cooperative governance</a>, manage legions of platform laborers all tied to ledgers and wearable tech. Algorithms weigh individual needs against those of the collective and mete out payments for digital public goods production. Officials, whether they understand it or not, are setting citizens up to become precarious impact commodities for high frequency options trading. One hand washes the other as the masses are made to power the matrix and build out digital empire. Everyone plays their assigned role in the spectacle advancing the plot without wrapping their minds around the game they’re in or comprehending what the stakes are.</p>

<p>In some ways, Yass may actually be more progressive than liberals. Dismantling the education system in favor of a radical reboot that centers sensor technology and securitized human capital isn’t exactly a conservative move. I once considered myself a progressive, but then I began to understand the history of the movement and its origins in social efficiency from the research of<a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2017/08/the-despotic-origins-of-u-s-public-secondary-education/"> Tim Scott</a>. Progressive circles of the early twentieth century imagined the human condition would be improved through science, technology, engineering, and directed social cohesion. To my way of thinking this is exactly what a world run on smart-contract logic tied to optimized “evidence-based” outcomes would be. </p>
<p>The difference is that Yass would place the knobs and levers of technocracy in the invisible hand of the market, while liberals would have the government driving the bus.</p>
<p>The following quote is from an article, “<a href="https://archive.ph/I1wzl#selection-419.0-423.330">Upping the Ante for City Hall</a>,” Will Bunch at the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote about Susquehanna International Group’s activities backing school choice candidates in the 2015 election season:</p>
<p>“Nothing offends Greenberg and his partners more than a suggestion that they profit from corporate education reform. But critics of the role their money is playing say that’s not even the issue, that they’ve tilted the playing field in Philadelphia towards charter schools as a loss of money and enrollment is killing off neighborhood public schools that are accessible to all. ‘There is a part of corporate education reform that is making schools into a marketplace,’ said former Philadelphia teacher-turned activist Lisa Haver, who said that testing and test-prep firms as well as some charter operators are making handsome profits from the school choice movement, even if the Susquehanna partners are not.”</p>
<p>People don’t understand that the planned “marketplace” encompasses so much more than test-prep. The children targeted for social impact bond commodification aren’t just public-school students, but rather ALL children whether they attend charter schools, cyber-schools, private schools, parochial schools, and even homeschool families. It will happen through voucher programs linked to digital identity corresponding to the rise of tech-centric, low-cost micro-schools. Children will be put on devices, tagged with wearables, and tracked with artificial vision cameras, not because such practices will offer them a better future, but because it feeds the voracious data economy of the fourth industrial revolution and generates digital twins for simulation modeling and machine learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Options traders need for us to adopt a “lifelong” “learning economy model” to legitimize gambling on our futures, but the real end game is guided evolution of humanity into a collective hivemind, Teilhard de Chardin’s Noosphere, a global thought form.</p>
<p>Read the quote below, taken from a longer presentation on complex systems and machine learning. You’ll see I’m not kidding about entraining our minds into a flow state to join the human “ant computer.” You’ll also see the role that libertarians are meant to play in advancing this agenda by pushing deregulation and free market exchanges. You’ll see where token engineering fits in in the references to decentralized governance following simple rules, and the line about increasing profitability by learning about the behavior of individuals and companies? That’s Susquehanna International Group’s poker philosophy. Know the mind of the people you’re playing against; recognize and predict their patterns of behavior; and if possible, get the “god’s eye view,” more data is always better in games of asymmetrical information.</p>
<p>This excerpt starts at timestamp 26 minutes of the interview by Machine Learning Street Talk,<a href="https://youtu.be/MDt2e8XtUcA?t=1566"> Episode #75</a> – Emergence with Dr. Daniele Grattarola.</p>
<p>“…how a group of cells organizes itself to be an eye or a brain; or how independent members of an economy each working chiefly for their own gain produce complex, but structured global markets; or most mysteriously how the global phenomena we call intelligence or consciousness emerge from non-intelligent non-conscious material substrates.</p>
<p>The cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his book “Gödel, Escher, Bach” made an extended analogy between ant colonies and brains, both being complex systems in which relatively simple components with relatively little communication among themselves collectively give rise to complicated and sophisticated system-wide global behavior. The ants in our human brain are of course neurons. They communicate with each other in a similarly simplistic manner and yet our intelligence and arguably our consciousness emerge from this low-level, primitive communication.</p>
<p>Markets are also complex, emergent, and self-organizing entities, if you like. Melanie said in her book that they are self-organized on the microscopic and the macroscopic level. She said that on the microscopic level individuals and companies and markets try to increase their profitability by learning about the behavior of other individuals and companies. The microscopic self-interest has historically thought to push markets on the whole at the macroscopic level towards a so-called Nash equilibrium. Now the process by which the markets obtain this equilibrium is called the market efficiency. The eighteenth-century economist Adam Smith called this self-organizing behavior of markets the invisible hand. It arises from the myriad microscopic actions of individual buyers and sellers. The individual actions on a trading floor give rise to the hard-to-predict large-scale behavior of financial markets.</p>
<p>Now Melanie gives three core properties of complex systems in her book. One is complex collective behavior – large networks of individual components with each one following relatively simple rules with no central role or leader. It’s the collective action of vast numbers of components that give rise to the complex, hard-to-predict, and changing patterns, which fascinate us so much. The second is signaling and information processing. Complex systems use information and signals from both their internal and external environments. The third is adaptation. All of these systems adapt, that is they change their behavior to improve their chances for survival or success through learning or some evolutionary process.</p>
<p>So, then Melanie goes on to give her definition of a complex system as follows: a system in which a large network of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution.</p>
<p>Now I spoke with our friend Dr. Duggar on strong emergence, and he said that in his opinion it describes behaviors, which cannot be analytically derived, nor effectively computed from a lower level or a higher-resolution theory. This would place glider wars in a cellular automaton firmly in the domain of strong emergence. A cellular automaton is computationally irreducible. There’s no effective computational path from the lower-level rules to the higher-level behavior. The only thing you can do is run the simulation again, from scratch.”<a href="https://youtu.be/MDt2e8XtUcA?t=1566"> Source</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Few understand that this planned future revolves around catalyzing surprising interactions within the complex adaptive systems of smart cities. That’s cognitive capitalism. The goal is emergence, through networked behaviors that manifest a whole greater than the sum of its parts. Artificial intelligence wants to steal the creative, playful spirit of ALL children. The forces of engineered polarization have parents and community members fighting amongst each other rather than stepping back to look at the system as a whole. Think about how much content in your feed centers the culture wars. That’s on purpose.</p>
<p>I suspect that Susquehanna’s International Group’s executives live in a story where a laissez faire approach under multinational techno-behemoths will somehow bring about human flourishing for the poor. Yass backed the New York mayoral bid of<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-megadonors-jeff-yass-and-ken-griffin-are-betting-dollar1m-on-andrew-yang-for-nyc-mayor"> Andrew Yang</a>, promoter of Universal Basic Income, to the tune of a half million dollars along with hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin. At the time Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch was confused by this alliance, because he’s stuck in the polarization vortex and can’t see the long-game is to hook us into a collective “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Social-Computer-Trento-2010.pdf">social computer</a>” (or ant computer) and turn us into data-mineable, creative pets of AI.&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/Will_Bunch/status/1397358150823645185"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/Will_Bunch/status/1397358150823645185">https://twitter.com/Will_Bunch/status/1397358150823645185</a>
<p>The following are excerpts from the introduction to a 2010 paper co-authored by<a href="http://fausto.disi.unitn.it/"> Fausto Giunchiglia</a>, professor at the University of Trento interested in computational models of the mind and “how we guess,” and<a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/dave-robertson"> Dave Robertson</a>, professor of applied logic with an expertise in machine learning and health data at the University of Edinburgh, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Social-Computer-Trento-2010.pdf">The Social Computer: Combining Machine and Human Computation</a>.”</p>
<p>“The social computer is a future computational system that harnesses the innate problem solving, action and information gathering powers of humans and the environments in which they live in order to tackle large scale social problems that are beyond our current capabilities…”</p>
<p>“The hardware of a social computer is supplied by people’s brains and bodies, the environment where they live, including artifacts, e.g., buildings and roads, sensors into the environment, networks and computers; while the software is the people’s minds, laws, organizational and social rules, social conventions, and computer software. The algorithms for social computation are those which take advantage of the resilience and scale of mass human problem solving and which achieve higher performance by supplementing social capabilities of individuals by adapting the environment in order to provide better feedback and instrumentation for the mass computation achieved by society. This means that the analogue of an operating system for a social computer is not just the computer or the network but is primarily the social and environmental infrastructure that enables large-scale social computation to occur.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The social computer exhibits an algorithmic behavior which is however the result of very large numbers of local computations, decisions, interactions, data and control information transfers. These activities start, evolve and stop simultaneously inside the computer’s many parts and across them, with its components being most often completely unaware and sometimes partially aware of the resulting global algorithm behavior. The state of a social computation includes part of the state of the physical, social environment in which the computation is situated.”</p>
<p>“The problem-solving capability of the social computer improves in time. This result can be achieved because it is programmable, and the set of programs that it can run can be increased in time, in quantity and quality. In this context the notion of being programmable is very different sense from that which applies to usual computers, even those that are distributed. For instance, people cannot be programmed; yet they can be induced into certain behaviors via, e.g., incentives or laws. And there are already examples where people are used as computing entities whose intelligence and activities are composed to achieve a more complex goal. The behavior of a social computer is programmed by increasing and evolving the amount of globally available knowledge about the world, and about itself, and its capability to make maximal pragmatic use of it.”</p>
<p>“Last but not least, the computer can sense and act in the world. People are one of the main means for sensing, but this can also happen via pervasive sensors and sensor networks. People are the main actuators of the social computer. The social computer can also act via machines but ultimately, modulo limited exceptions (e.g., intelligent machines, automatic control devices) the final decision on how to act remains a human decision, possibly supported by advanced decision support systems. One could easily envisage scenarios involving social robots autonomously acting in the real world. While this is a research area of potential, we believe that the current state of the art does not suggest that we consider robots as key components of the social computer in the medium term.”</p>

<p>People like Will Bunch don’t get that the mid-range game is to set up impact markets in “sustainable” good behavior tracked by smart city sensor networks. He can’t conceive of a world where toddlers on surveillance play tables and homeless veterans on blockchain mental health apps can be securitized and traded to provide market liquidity by firms like Susquehanna International Group, fodder to fuel machine “intelligence.” I’m not sure how we remedy this situation.</p>
<p>The “portfolio model” of school choice was promoted by the Philadelphia School Partnership where school districts “<a href="https://archive.ph/YKLSR">dump the losers</a>” and raise the bar for the remaining schools, including charters. Jeff’s wife, Janine Yass, was a<a href="https://appsphilly.net/who-is-the-philadelphia-school-partnership/"> founding board member</a> of Philadelphia School Partnership, which launched in 2010. Janine helped found<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys%27_Latin_of_Philadelphia_Charter_School"> Boys Latin Charter School</a> in West Philadelphia in 2007. Disadvantaged, primarily Black communities, have been the target of the “school choice” sales pitch. It is true that the city’s public schools lack resources, the curriculum is often rigid and uninspired, there are discipline problems, billions of dollars in deferred maintenance on buildings, and students with special needs don’t get adequate support. It’s all by design to justify ushering in a new “learning ecosystem” gameboard where the city is a classroom. You don’t live in a city? Just dial one up in VR extended reality. The plan is for us to live in an immersive reality simulation anyway.</p>

<p>The Yass family maintains close ties with Jeanne Allen and the<a href="https://edreform.com/about-2/cer-supporters/"> Center for Education Reform</a>, which got its start in 1993 in Washington, DC. School choice picked up steam during the lockdown years, an opportunity that was not wasted. Janine’s<a href="https://muckrack.com/janine-yass/articles"> Muck Rack profile</a> shows she published ten articles with Forbes last year promoting innovative school models like micro-schools and digital academies that took hold as a result of Covid policy. She struck up a close partnership with former Arizona governor Doug Ducey, a friend of the education choice movement who expanded<a href="https://politicalemails.org/messages/737796"> voucher access</a>. Arizona has been a leader in Education Scholarship Accounts, was the first to offer funds in a debit card format, and now has a “<a href="https://www.azed.gov/esa/classwallet">class wallet</a>” portal, which I imagine will be on decentralized ledger technology soon enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Crow, president of Arizona State University in Tempe, is one of the most prominent advocates for technological solutions and a deal broker between venture capital and gamified education. In 2019 ASU co-sponsored a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-2019-global-education-summit-focused-on-the-future-of-education-with-sharing-from-diverse-perspectives-300965474.html">Global Education Summit</a> in Beijing on the Future of Education where a globally coordinated, STEM-centric system of education was proposed in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Among those attending were gaming companies, including Tencent who backed Epic Games in their development of Fortnite.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asugsvsummit.com/leadership/michael-moe">Michael Moe</a> of Global Silicon Valley, a co-founder with Crow of the annual ASU+GSV “Davos of Education,” spoke of the promise of flexible, innovative models of education. So it’s somewhat ironic that he co-authored “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/American_Revolution_2.0.pdf">American Revolution 2.0</a>” with GSV in 2012 using over-the-top patriotic messaging for ed-tech’s future. The cover of the report featured George Washington crossing the Delaware no less. Fast forward seven years, and we’ve got the guy with the red-white-and blue branding rubbing elbows with the largest ed-tech vendors in China. If nothing else this should make it perfectly clear that a “free market” artificial intelligence education model is a global program. This imagined super-organism intends to integrate all humans, all natural life on the planet, into its cybernetic circuits, and US interests are on the bleeding edge of this effort. No one – no elected official, no union, no company, no NGO, no university, is using their institutional capital to oppose this plan. In fact, most are scrambling to find a position where they have a chance to “win” in the new hunger games.</p>

<p>In 2021, Janine Yass set up a million dollar prize that would be awarded to a US-based pre-K to 12 education provider that embodies the<a href="https://edreform.com/2022/06/deadline-extended-1m-yass-prize-and-10m-stop-awards/"> STOP principles – Sustainable, Transformational, Outstanding, and Permissionless</a>. Pay attention to the last word, “permissionless.” This is a hat-tip to free-market “choice.” The game of high-stakes human capital wagers can’t advance without it. The premise of school boards authorizing alternative education models has to be overcome. The market will decide “quality.” The education space will be totally deregulated. Human teachers will become edu-preneurial “tutors” and “mentors” until AI assistants take their place. That may have seemed like an overstatement a few years ago, but within the last month, educators now find themselves scrambling to figure out how to deal with students having assignments prepared for them by ChatGPT. A transformation is underway with a shift to micro-schools and pod-based learning triggered by lockdown social atomization. Now we’re looking at holons, agents, signals, boundaries, and cells where emergence blossoms at the intersection of order and manufactured chaos.</p>
<p>In the early years of my blog, I wrote about the threat of “hybrid learning” that went hand-in-hand with competency-based education (also called proficiency-based and mastery-based), that under the guise of “personalization” would subject children to predatory data-mining for a third or more of their time in neighborhood schools. Then, during lockdowns, we saw a total shift in mentality. Teachers who once staunchly fought cyber-charters and virtual learning were convinced their students would kill them and that years of zoom instruction was the only option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I see it, that, sadly, sealed their fate. It’s an inhumane practice. Many families fled public education. Many teachers were so burnt out that they left the profession. It was with a heavy, heavy heart I read a<a href="https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/in-hazelwoods-82m-experiment-the-teachers-are-miles-away-on-a-screen-39298154"> recent article</a> about the situation in Hazelwood, Missouri near Saint Louis. The district had over forty teacher vacancies and ended up hiring Stride (formerly K12 Inc.) to provide remote instruction to a third of the students in the district. While aides were placed in classrooms, online teachers were not able to effectively manage their classes. Student engagement was terrible. No one was learning anything, and the district was paying Stride, a company with a past history of incompetence, a rate well beyond what the average teacher salary. To top it all off, several schools in the district were found to have been contaminated with radiation dating back to the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>Despite my dedicated past support for neighborhood schools, I simply can’t continue if the plan is to use them to train compliant citizens for the Metaverse and a global gig economy of coders and cybersecurity warriors. The only course of action I can see taking right now is to educate adults about the bigger picture. The purpose of schools is to condition children to fit themselves into society and become productive participants. Our problem is that the world that’s being built is a world meant for machines, not people. Until we address that issue, no educational “choice” can be a humane one for coming generations.</p>
<p>The driving force behind school choice is to unbundle education into limitless online and work-based options tracked via proficiency badges that document attainment of specified cognitive and soft skills. I’ve been writing about the MacArthur Foundation and Mozilla-backed Knowledgeworks’ <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2016/09/23/from-neighborhood-schools-to-learning-eco-systems-a-dangerous-trade/">learning ecosystem model</a> for years. I describe it as Pokémon Go skill chasing in the CIA’s extended reality esports game. Once we’re all assigned biometric digital identities with blockchain wallets in which to store our credentials and tokens, our economic productivity as digital “agents” can be tracked ad infinitum. Educational inputs provided by the government or, more likely in the future, private investors, will be weighed against measurable outputs to assess our dynamic “in-game” value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Susquehanna International Group is about betting, game theory, and decision science. Imagine the number of bets they’ll be able to make on a nation of “lifelong learners” dragging around blockchain ledgers of securitized debt.</p>

<p>The social computer requires “diversity.” Keep this in mind as you’re served up heaping portions of critical race theory, trauma-informed practice, diversity-equity-inclusion-justice training, social-emotional learning, and ACEs scoring. For the liberals and the left, you need to understand the measures global hedge funds are about to implement aren’t about fixing the structure that created the problems. Rather these are hollow, performative protocols designed to re-traumatize and document vulnerable populations for coming impact finance schemes. And conservatives, they want you in a lather about these movements, but not because you recognize such interventions as part of a “social computer” agenda targeting the entire population of the earth. No, for you the goal is to make you act out in ways that allow them to further refine the meta-data tags determining your position as an agent in their polarity game. The game designers want everyone duking it out on the surface, emotional, reactive, tribal, and distracted. Yes, they have a majority of people exactly where they want them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each datapoint creates an ever more robust palette of archetypes for the program. There has long been tension between generalization and specialization. John Holland describes this as an important factor in genetic algorithm development. Adam Smith opens his “Wealth of Nations” with a story of the efficiencies created in a <a href="https://archive.ph/zWQ4A">pin factory</a> where workers were assigned discrete tasks along the production line, the division of labor expanded production netting significant profits for the factory owner. Later, <a href="https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/adamsmith-summary.asp">in chapter four</a>, Smith writes, “Every man thus lives by exchanging,” a quote inscribed on one side of a luxurious bronze gas lamp located in the atrium just outside the Debate Room at <a href="https://archive.ph/tefe7">Old Parkland in Dallas</a>, the city’s most elite corporate address.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Building off energy futures trading, the Dallas old guard is making its move to set up markets in human capital management, led by the <a href="https://commitpartnership.org/">Commit!</a> Partnership with <a href="https://www.financialexecutives.org/Events/Event_Speaker_Bio.aspx?Speaker=C96EA4D5-6BE3-4DD2-B129-1A6E0B864F8C">Goldman Sachs</a> and <a href="https://www.jpmorganchase.com/news-stories/the-future-is-full-of-promises">JP Morgan</a> standing in the shadows. That lamp stands opposite an elaborately carved portico topped by a large gilded owl. On either side are four paintings. The upper tier shows Watson and Crick and their DNA model on the one side and on the other side Steve Jobs with an orange Apple desktop showing the Pixar movie “Up.” Below is FDR and Eisenhower on one side and Churchill and Truman on the other. What this says to me is that we’re being pulled into a new “war,” a war on consciousness and human agency even as we are being told mythic stories about scientific progress.</p>
<p>In a future of on-demand globotic (pilots operating robots from remote locations) and platform labor lean efficiency says that preference will be given to the specialists. Soon algorithms will be able to instantaneously choose from a multinational pool of desperate labor plucking the exact right person with the exact badges for the right price. Specialization tied to common skills standards will drive labor costs down to the point that most workers will have to rely on some level of universal basic income, with the strings that will certainly be attached.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>The Zcash Foundation has been looking into <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR)</a> to determine whether it offers a potential solution to the recent performance problems that have affected Zcash wallet users, and whether there are any advantages to be gained from implementing this in a Zcash context. For example, can OMR be used to address the privacy leaks of using lightwalletd? Light wallets like Nighthawk Wallet, Zecwallet Lite, and YWallet use lightwalletd to fetch and send Zcash transactions, without the overhead of running a full node locally. Would running OMR on a full node provide us with any performance advantages when fetching transactions?&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 The Current Lightwalletd Architecture 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Light wallets are typically used to download shielded transactions via a lightwalletd server. To preserve privacy about which transactions a wallet is interested in, one can download all the transactions in full. However, this is expensive and nearly amounts to the full blockchain in size/bandwidth, which is not great for lighter devices or those with low bandwidth/network speed, etc. This is why the lightwallet protocol exists.</p><p>Most light wallets fetch a limited amount of data about every shielded transaction (i.e. a `CompactTx`) from a lightwalletd proxy, just enough to allow trial decryption. The wallet trial-decrypts every `CompactTx` to see if that transaction has been sent to them. This is because all shielded transactions on the Zcash blockchain are encrypted and indistinguishable from the others such that no one can tell which transactions are addressed to whom, unless you have the incoming viewing key to decrypt them. Trial decryption takes more computational effort than transparent syncing, proportional to how many shielded transactions are on on-chain, but <a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">advances</a> in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zecwallets-blazesync-sync-entire-chain-in-60s/39447">syncing algorithms</a> have made this cheaper. However, to construct new transactions, a wallet needs data that’s not included in CompactTxs or CompactBlocks, so after detecting a transaction, the wallet has to fetch the full transaction via lightwalletd. Everything stays encrypted for shielded transactions (the ‘data’), but now the lightwalletd proxy knows that a wallet with a certain IP address has requested a certain subset of Zcash shielded transactions, at a specific time (‘metadata’). This is an unfortunate and undesirable privacy leak.</p><p>It would be better if we can trial-decrypt and fetch transactions privately, and also not have to download all transactions in full to do so.</p>

							Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR) is a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">construction</a> from Zeyu (Thomas) Liu and Eran Tromer that uses lattice-based (LWE) fully-homomorphic encryption. It allows a full node to scan the Zcash blockchain for shielded transactions encrypted for a particular recipient and return just the transactions they need without knowing the full query or the results in plaintext. This would offload more computational effort and bandwidth requirements to a full node while also protecting the metadata privacy of a user or wallet, hiding which Zcash transactions the recipient cares about. The only thing the OMR-compatible full node learns about the user is that they are interested in OMR-compatible transactions, but not which ones.

							<p>At a high level, here’s how a version of Zcash that supports Oblivious Message Retrieval could work:</p><p>A user generates an updated unified address that includes a new clue key (this also supports diversified addresses). When sending money to an OMR-supporting address, the regular Zcash shielded transaction will occur, but the transaction will also include a clue ciphertext. This clue ciphertext is about 1KB of additional data per shielded output.</p><p>The user then generates a detection key and registers that with an OMR-supporting Zcash full node. The node uses that detection key to scan all the shielded transactions on the chain and their attached clue ciphertexts. The scanning involves taking all the transactions, including the clue ciphertexts, and fully-homomorphically, trying to use the detection key to decrypt the clue ciphertexts associated with the shielded transactions.</p><p>This is the magic of fully-homomorphic encryption: the full node cannot distinguish the (encrypted) secret key that is trying to decrypt the clue ciphertexts, as it is homomorphically encrypted, but it can still do the computation and return the encrypted results of the computation to the holder of the detection secret key.</p><p>As the OMR-compatible full node scans all the transactions, it homomorphically accumulates all the transactions whose clue ciphertexts decrypt under the clue secret key, and returns the digest of all the transactions as a new homomorphically-encrypted result. The user can then decrypt those results with the detection secret key, and then have all the Zcash transactions relevant to their wallet ready to go. The full node does not know which transactions are relevant to the wallet, as it processes all of them and computes the matching under fully-homomorphic encrypted computation.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What might this feel like? (beyond lightwalletd flow) 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>OMR supports two kinds of querying for results that support multiple ways for a wallet developer or other client to interact with an OMR-supporting full node:</p><p>“Sync” querying – In the single-shot model, the recipient makes a stateless query to the full node: it provides a detection key, a range of blocks to scan, and a bound k on the number of pertinent messages, and asks the node to digest those blocks with respect to that key. The detector runs all of the `Retrieve` algorithm. Response latency is high: about 0.145 sec per transaction.</p><p>“Async” querying – The subscribe and finalize model utilizes the streaming variant. The user provides a detection key and asks to subscribe to ongoing (and perhaps some past) transactions. The node starts processing these transactions, doing most of the computation (i.e. homomorphically computing the PV ciphertexts). Later, the user shows up and asks the server to finalize the results and pack them into a digest, with respect to some k. Neither the finalization time nor message bound k need be known in advance. This reduces finalization to 0.35 milliseconds/tx per core.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter approach fits in nicely with the steady-state wallet UX: open up wallet app every once in a while, get an up-to-date view of wallet state ~immediately, then take an action.</p><p>This is attractive to wallet developers and users who value the privacy gains of OMR, but hopefully would not sacrifice usability and experience to achieve them.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 This Sounds Great! Are We Doing This? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Well, we’re trying to figure that out. Zcash has changed a bit since OMR was first published (we have Orchard Actions now, for example). There are design decisions we would have to make about the Zcash protocol in order to support OMR, and other compatibility, design, and UX questions we’d have to address. Such as:</p>  How backwards compatible is this?  Requires an updated key/address (see below), but also new changes to shielded transactions, specifically the inclusion of 956 bytes of clue data per shielded transaction (or specifically per description: Sapling Output, may need to be updated for Orchard Actions). This is okay but requires a network upgrade and coordination between node and wallet developers. It also increases the transaction size, in addition to the larger Orchard Actions from NU5.  “It would be the cleanest to extend the transaction format with a dedicated clue field,” according to the OMR paper. The clue is 1KB per spend.      Do I need to generate new keys and a new address?  Well, kind of. You need to generate a new clue key to be part of the address, so with Unified Addresses, this can be a new extension with existing Sapling/Orchard key material, but the Unified Address will look different. This clue key uses a different type of cryptography from the Sapling/Orchard keys so we can’t reuse the other keys to support Oblivious Message Retrieval.  Per the constructions proposed in the OMR paper, the clue key is 133KB. That’s right, kilobytes (thanks, lattices!) This is too big for a regular QR code encoding, or hex/ascii string, but, an alternative that should work in the Unified Address framework, and instead of having the full clue key inlined in the address, we encode and inline a link to and hash of the clue key, and fetch it from somewhere else. The clue key is a ~public key.  How can we maintain trust and anonymity if we host OMR keys on another platform? Key transparency?  When you set up a full node to do OMR detection for you, you generate and upload a detection key. This key is not part of your address. It is even larger than the clue key, at ~129MB (yes, megabytes). This is a one-time upload for recipients, but full nodes will have to keep them per-recipient as long as they are privately scanning for that user. The Zcash mainnet chain is coming up on 100GB in size, and storage is relatively cheap, but this does mean adding another recipient client as a full node has non-negligible storage costs as well as the computation costs, and the clue key size may restrict the number of addresses that can be detected live together, as some use cases involve hundreds or thousands of keys.      What about diversified addresses?  OMR clue keys are diversifiable, so that property of unlinkable keys is maintained; incoming payments sent to any of a user’s (multiple) diversified addresses can be retrieved and spent using a single key tuple.      How much compute does this require from full node operators?  “∼$1.02 per million payments scanned (for each recipient served), using commodity cloud computing,” according to the OMR paper. This is about the whole current Zcash mainnet chain right now so it sounds scalable and affordable to serve multiple recipients.      If I serve a lot of OMR recipients on one full node, will query latency suffer?  Hard to say before there is a full implementation to test. Using the subscribe and finalize query model for the general wallet case would indicate it could be quite fast and scale well in general in an async-supporting full node like zebrad.      This is based on lattices, does that mean it’s post-quantum secure?  It looks like it, yes!      How is this different from viewing keys?  Registering viewing keys (incoming, outgoing, or full) with a full node and having them scan the chain on a user’s behalf gets close to the data flow of OMR, but with one crucial difference: the node can see which shielded transactions you are interested in and addressed to you, and can read the memo field, transaction value, and target address. OMR does not allow this.    						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What's Next? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>If it were possible to deploy OMR without the need for a network update and/or other significant changes (such as addresses), then we would be looking very closely at doing so. However, given the effort involved, we don’t think it’s a priority at this time, and we would want to consider alternative performance improvement approaches (like detection keys).</p>

<p>The Nym mixnet has a shared history with Bitcoin. Unsurprisingly, we at Nym want Bitcoiners to have the best privacy possible! We are therefore proud to announce that we are supporting Blockstream by adding the <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green Bitcoin wallet</a> to <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">Nym Connect</a> due to its <a href="https://liquid.net">Liquid</a>’s privacy features. We want to take this opportunity to delve into the pre-history of Bitcoin and its shared history with&nbsp;mixnets…</p><p>With the invention of Bitcoin, Satoshi brought together major work by the cypherpunk movement, who were working on technologies for anonymous communication like mixnets — the technology for network-level privacy, launched by Nym. Reviewing this history can help us understand how technologies can promote human freedoms and evolve in the most unexpected ways. The cypherpunks were prophetic in their understanding of how easily the internet would become a vehicle for mass surveillance. It is time to join forces and put their solution to work. Looking towards the future evolution of Bitcoin, the combination of the two technologies via integration into Liquid, Lightning and the wider Bitcoin ecosystem would bring to fruition much of this important work.</p><a href="https://blockstream.com/green/">Blockstream Green</a> over the mixnet using <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> Mixnets: a short pre-history of&nbsp;Bitcoin <p>Mixnets like Nym were originally invented by David Chaum in his famous paper <a href="https://chaum.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chaum-mix.pdf">“Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms”</a>. A mixnet mixes packets to unlink the sender and the receiver. Unfortunately, every time you use Bitcoin (or Lightning), your IP address and the timing and volume of your information leak. Nym Chief Scientist Claudia Diaz has shown how this leaking ‘metadata’ about your communications can be used to uniquely identify you. We recommend you read her paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11860">On the Anonymity of Peer-To-Peer Network Anonymity Schemes Used by Cryptocurrencies</a> with Piyush Kumar Sharma and Devashish Gosain — (which will be presented at <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/">NDSS</a> this&nbsp;week!)</p><p>Proof of work was invented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdwOXWmAs8Y">Adam Back’s work on mixnets</a>: Adam Back was running the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixminion">Mixmaster</a> mixnet (a pre-Nym mixnet), which provided anonymous e-mail services to spread information anonymously. When anti-privacy fanatics attacked his mixnet by flooding it with fake messages, Adam Back decided he needed a way to stop this e-mail spam. Importantly, to do so without assigning each person a unique identity, allowing users of the mixnet to remain anonymous. He implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash">HashCash</a> to serve as a way to defeat sybil attacks, by forcing any user of the mixnet to solve a hash puzzle. This effectively defeated spam&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Famously, Satoshi Nakamoto then used this idea from HashCash to reach consensus in the Bitcoin blockchain (solving the <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/byz.pdf">Byzantine Generals Problem</a>) without uniquely identifying nodes in the Bitcoin network. It is this fundamental invention that makes Bitcoin permissionless. And with this history, we dare say it’s quite likely that Satoshi Nakamoto was a mixnet&nbsp;user!</p><p>While Bitcoin creates different public keys per transaction and so allows some basic privacy, a well-resourced attacker like a government or Chainalysis can identify Bitcoin users by using only on-chain information. Enter the <a href="https://liquid.net/">Liquid</a> sidechain, whose use of confidential transactions via homomorphic encryption and blinded (stealth) addresses allow more privacy on Bitcoin than our prior integration with Electrum, at the cost of dependency on a federated side-chain. We strongly encourage Bitcoin users to look into Blockstream Green with Nym Connect for improved privacy for Bitcoin. This is especially useful as the Tor network typically used by Liquid is under <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/">a mysterious attack</a> that makes it harder to use with Blockstream Green.</p><p>We’re happy to see Nym go full circle. The NYM token was originally the NYMPH token on the Liquid blockchain, and since then we’ve launched a NYM token <a href="https://www.regservices.ch/en/definitions/nym-technologies-sa-neuchatel-switzerland/">prospectus</a>. We’ve rewarded early contributors, users and token holders with NYM — although the community has had to go through KYC/AML with long-time Bitcoin supporter <a href="https://stokr.io/">STOKR</a>. Our privacy-first approach will require many other integrations to diverse applications in order to maintain the anonymity of Bitcoin users, but we think even Nakamoto would be thrilled to see Bitcoin transactions going over a mixnet. Further integrations with Bitcoin and Blockstream are in the&nbsp;works!</p>Harry Halpin and father with Blockstream gear that Adam Back sent&nbsp;over<p>Links</p>  Download <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>  Join our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> communities!   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/how-mixnets-led-to-bitcoin-blockstream-green-supported-by-nym-connect-85d2ee325012">How Mixnets led to Bitcoin: Blockstream Green supported by Nym Connect!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This week someone brought Naomi Wolf’s Sub Stack post, “<a href="https://naomiwolf.substack.com/p/have-the-ancient-gods-returned">Have the Ancient Gods Returned?</a>,” to my attention. The narrative presented ran counter to my understanding of how we arrived at this point in history. After reading it, I felt like I needed to talk it out, and I’m grateful that my friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cg3ly">Cliff Gomes</a> offered to be a sounding board. We had a great three-hour discussion yesterday and streamed it tonight. Give it a listen. You might come away with a few tools you can use to navigate your way through these traumatic times.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Near the end of the session, we began to talk about the map I made linking management consultant Peter Drucker to Bob Buford and the Protestant mega-church movement in the 1980s and ran out of time. I think we’ll go back and revisit it in more detail, but until then you can <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/e04c6299b703d9746c218fe70b747b83#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS0wUFdPb3Q1WA%3D%3D">use this link</a> to explore.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of Panther’s AMA session with CEO Oliver Gale and Head of Product Saif Akhtar. &nbsp;The AMA was conducted with questions collected from Twitter, Discord, and Telegram.<br><br>This article &nbsp;is an edited version of an automatic transcript generated from the live session, so we have included exact times for answers in case you want to visit the video below to listen to a specific section. <br></p><p>Here’s the AMA’s audio in case you want to check it out: </p>     AMA ROAD TO v1 w OLIVER GALE SAIF AKHTAR  0:00 /51:17 1×    When will it be possible to clone the $ZKP token from GitHub? ZKP token is still a private repository, but it is needed as a dependency.<br><br> <p>Saif Akhtar - 2:41</p><p>In the docs, it does mention that the rest of the repositories are going to be opened up progressively. So I think they’re due, and they will be. However, I do want to mention that the token contract itself it's a dependency because everything works together with the token contract. <br></p><p>However, from a dev perspective, and from trialing out perspective, you can pretty much deploy any token, and attach that token contract address and the rest of the places and pretty much test that stuff. <br></p><p>So for a dev, it shouldn't be a blocker. But in general, if the questions about opening up all the other repositories, I think they are a work in progress. It's just that it wasn't part of the advanced staking itself. It might have been overlooked, but they will be progressively opened up.<br></p> What are the potential risks and drawbacks associated with using zkSnarks technology, and how does the project mitigate or address these risks?<br> <p>Oliver Gale - 4:22</p><p>I think one of the well-known risks of zkSnarks is the trusted ceremony setup phase for the Snark itself, and so how that works when it goes right is if one party in this essentially multi party, trusted setup ceremony, is honest, then you have assurances that the zkSnark has no backdoor. However, if all of the parties are dishonest, then the Snark itself has a backdoor: They can recreate the keys and decrypt the information. <br></p><p>So, generally, what you find with snark-based projects is they will seek a relatively large, trusted ceremony and also include actors who have a reputational stake in the privacy space or, in this case, in the blockchain space. <br></p><p>So, I think Saif can share more information on our trusted ceremony setup. Other drawbacks of zkSnarks versus say, Starks are: Starks are more scalable as transaction types, and they don't have a trusted setup. But the Starks themselves have a much higher gas cost for verification of proofs which makes them good for different use cases and bad for other use cases.<br></p><p>One of the interesting things with the zkSnarks space, and both STARKS and SNARKS are progressing rapidly. There's a lot of research and activity around it. But there are things like Halo which may provide the early validation that zkSnarks can also operate using recursive proofs which removes the need to have a trusted setup.<br></p><p>So, there's a lot of promising technology. Obviously, it's been put into production by multiple players in the web three space for different use cases. I think, for what Panther is building. Our team has chosen the right technology, and zkSnarks are more appropriate than a Stark-driven approach, given where Starks are today.<br></p><p>Carlos - 6:57</p><p>Would you would like to add anything to that Saif?<br></p><p>Saif - 7:00</p><p>No, I think that was well said. Just one point. I think the question also says: what are we doing to mitigate? <br></p><p>I mean, we're using Groth16, which is kind of the standard SNARK system used today. It's proof size, and verification time are the best from the perspective of what it does. <br></p><p>Although, Oliver mentioned the pre-processing setup, and the ceremony that is done. In other words, what we have been thinking of is the eventual movement to PLONK, which increases a little bit on the proof size. The verification time also increases a little bit as compared to Groth16.<br></p><p>But the advantage is there’s a universal set up, rather than a setup for each circuit. So that's a big advantage of PLONK. However, I wouldn't say this is the exact next step for us, or that this is in the roadmap. For us, the most important part is to deliver with Groth16. And then look at how things evolve and how new STARKs systems evolve. Then the community decides, from a technical front, how things should move for Panther.<br></p> When it comes to DAO and community proposals, users could use coins and NFTs to vote. How can Panther protect voters’ privacy in governance proposals?<br> <p>Saif - 9:26</p><p>Private voting is a good use case for the ZK technology in general. And proving membership from a set is one of the applications of ZK, where private voting can be, can be utilized. You basically prove that you are one of the DAO members and you're voting, but you don't disclose which member it is exactly, and how much voting power he had. <br></p><p>So, it's a good concept. From a Panther perspective, this is not on the roadmap. Again, I would say these are the adjacent solutions that are good to have. I really want to focus on delivering what is on the roadmap in the next six to nine months. And then we evaluate, and the community evaluates, what adjacent technologies could be built around it.<br></p><p>Oliver - 10:26</p><p>I think -- just to add on the adjacent technology component. You know, our focus is to deliver what we committed to, which is the primary use case that what we think is the primary driver of utility for the protocol. That’s the multi-asset shielded pools and the ecosystem of DeFi integrations and bridges. <br></p><p>That said, yes, the core Panther protocol technology can enable things like private voting. For those who have been in this community From the earlier days, we actually had a sub-protocol called LaunchDAO, which was used to vote on whether or not Panther protocol should be launched with basic staking. We utilized a zero-knowledge private token scheme, which also had implicitly built into that some identity functions as well.<br></p><p>So we do recognize that the building blocks are there. And it's an exciting opportunity to explore in later iterations of the protocol. I think also, just to add a comment – my view on identity standards and trying to tackle the identity space is that you have to create the use cases for the identity first. Identity sort of emerges as a byproduct. It would, in my view, not be an advisable strategy to tackle things like digital identity, and to a lesser extent, voting, head-on when the primary driver should be to create utility, grow the user base of Pather Protocol. From that user base, we can then assess implementing additional products or features.<br></p><p>Carlos - 12:17</p><p>Yeah, great answer. Especially when it comes to private voting, people can, in fact, look at LaunchDAO and the way Panther was launched, as an example of some private voting mechanism. Although I reckon, if we implement private voting, it will be with a different style. <br></p> Will zSwap be available in v1. And when will v1 be launching?<br> <p>Saif Akhtar - 13:01</p><p>Short answer is yes. The work has been started and is in progress. Whether it will be included in v1 is a good question. I think it depends on a lot of other things that are being done from a core v1 perspective and the compliance tech. However, if you ask me, I would love to have it on v1.<br></p><p>Carlos - 13:28</p><p>Yeah, we're also preparing more content related to zSwap. Because, as we have started to show the community, a lot of the UI components of it are ready for production or are in the near-final stage, although they're still pending some minor changes. So we will continue to introduce stuff related to it because it's very important for Panther's mission of private DeFi access. <br></p> Which DeFi protocol will be the first integrated into Panther? Or will it just bridge different blockchains? <p>Carlos -</p><p>I would like to just quickly clear the second part of the question there. Panther's vision is to enable private DeFi access, not just enable a cross-chain ecosystem. So yes, we want to integrate with DeFi protocols. As for which ones will be the first to be integrated, I'll let Saif answer that.<br></p><p>Saif - 14:31</p><p>Yeah, I mean, it will be. Again, these are the parts where the community will come out and make suggestions. However I will say the testing is being done on Polygon as we speak, with three major top three DeFi protocols: Uniswap, Quickswap, and I believe, Curve. And those three integrations’ work is in progress. <br></p><p>However, I expect that there is some discussion going on. And people come up and say, you know, these discussions or these integrations make more sense. And also the pair. I mean, for me, and for testing the product, the obvious choice is, hey, let's look at the top three by TVL. Let's look at the top 10, or top 20 pairs. That makes more sense from Panther’s perspective. And then put it out there, let the community also contribute to those key decision-making process and go from there.<br></p><p>Carlos - 15:39</p><p>Anything that you'd like to add, from your perspective, related to v1 or to zSwap, Oliver?<br></p><p>Oliver Gale - 15:47</p><p>I mean, no, not really. The first principle of target liquidity is target where there is demand and serve that. It’s a fairly logical conclusion to come from, or come to, and that's what we are aiming to do to tap into protocols that have TVL. <br></p><p>And so I'm just commenting on the issue of bridging into different chains. Here's the issue. The issue is, there are many L1 and L2 chains who are competing with one another for developers and for locals to deploy on their L1 or L2. <br></p><p>The bottom line is, what is the organic reason to deploy on anyone else's smart contract protocol? The answer is because there is an active user base there, there's liquidity there, there is value locked on these chains. And it makes sense for us to participate in and add to this ecosystem. <br></p><p>So you can sort of look at the top protocols by these types of metrics. And those are the protocols that Panther is most inclined to build bridges and DeFi adapters and shielded pools on to. <br></p><p>Then on the other side, there's, of course, the token incentive mechanism, which usually comes in the form of grants. So, whenever we see ambitious protocols which are willing to subsidize – and it's usually a subsidy and not a full coverage of development costs – subsidize the cost of deployment and other chains, then we are happy to deploy on those chains and support them in their vision and their growth. <br></p><p>One other metric which we don't see but which is important, is really the Ecosystem Development Partnership. Some protocols and their foundations or teams take a more proactive approach to actually fostering partnerships. So when we see, L1 and L2 chains that propose that they will make introductions and help Panther Protocol partner with other players – CeFi or DeFi players – we find that to be a compelling reason as well. But again, obviously, those additional incentives. It's really just a function of “where is the activity?”. That's where Panther protocol should be.<br></p> How far are we from launching on different additional chains? If Panther is close to v1, what about Avax, Belux, Aurora, NEAR, or even other blockchains?<br> <p>Carlos - 18:40</p><p>I reckon the question should be thought about in terms of not how far we are, but of the overall rollout strategy for different chains. Saif, could you enlighten us on that?<br></p><p>Saif - 19:26</p><p>Yeah, the overall strategy is: work with these partners and align/agree on what is the best time for them and for Panther. <br></p><p>Having said that, the goal is that Panther should be launched on multiple chains at v1 as individual solutions. In the future then, those individual solutions or individual MASPs are integrated through our ZK bridging technology and that's how the interchain starts to work. <br></p><p>So the Flare discussion is ongoing. Again, we have sent a complete, detailed task list to Flare. <br></p><p>Like I said before, I think there's a lot of dependency on other chains. So that's one. The second part about BNB is, I think the BD team just recently submitted a grant application for Binance. If that is approved, then obviously, we will prioritize Binance. <br></p><p>So two things there. In short, one is the prioritization from a grant perspective. And then the second one would be, if there is no grant, then we will prioritize based what makes sense for Panther.<br></p><p>I would like to deploy on one chain, make sure it's battle-tested, make sure everything is where everything works well, and then continue to expand on other chains, rather than dumping everything on multiple chains and having to deal with multiple problems. So there will be technical decisions versus also commercial decisions that come to play in terms of how it will be integrated.<br></p> When will we have more liquidity on Polygon and Ethereum?<br> <p>Carlos - 21:26</p><p>I reckon we may have an interesting perspective now that the DAO has also experimented with centralized exchange listings. <br></p><p>Oliver - 21:50</p><p>Yeah, well, so the answer is, we are right now amid discussion about a proposal coming to the DAO to add liquidity to Uniswap. <br></p><p>There are also some, you know, Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, potentially on ETH, as opposed to purely just on Polygon. There are questions of, do you want to build utility directly onto the trading pair? Or is there also benefit in providing access to new users to come into the ecosystem liquidity onto Ethereum. These are valid utility drivers in both cases. <br></p><p>There's also some evaluation of v3 active liquidity managers, by way of protocol-to-protocol partnerships that we're exploring. You know, with the recent uptick in the market, this is a good time to be evaluating these. I'm looking forward to seeing how the MEXC listing resolves itself, and then the next priority will be taxability.<br></p> What costs will be on the protocol itself?<br> <p>Carlos - 23:06</p><p>So, for example, how much ZKP it will cost to turn one ETH into one zETH. I know that there has been some progress on the design of fees that is not final, because anything related directly to the protocol will have to go through a DAO proposal, but what can you tell us about the fee mechanism design, Saif? <br></p><p>Saif - 23:45</p><p>For that specific question, I will say there is no fee, or there is no fee in the design structure to convert an asset into a zAsset. Nothing other than the gas costs or the transaction, which again, is something that is being considered on how to handle that.<br></p><p>Carlos - 24:10</p><p>Okay, yeah, we're speeding up the pace a little bit, because we have 15 minutes left, more like 10 right now, at most. So yeah, let's say –<br><br></p><p>Saif - 24:20</p><p>Just to add there, I would refer all the “fees and rewards” questions – I don't know if we have docs already out there – but as we are finalizing the coding and as the testing is coming into play, there should be a good set of docs available to understand how fees impact, you know, what transaction include fees and things like that.<br></p><p>Oliver - 24:51</p><p>Panther’s shielded pools are a DEX type infrastructure. So the idea is you don't really make money on way-in and way-out. That will be the case on v1 because there are no fees inside of the shielded pool. The shielded pool operates like a same-type, same-asset swap mechanism.</p><p>So, Panther protocol will be looking into things which are equivalent to the fees charged on DEXes. That's the core service. Charges and fees will be DAO governed but will be determined on the basis of the comparable costs for bridging assets across chains. And then, because its privacy and computation costs are higher, there will be some premium on that. So that's how you figure out how fees work.<br></p> What makes ZKP distinct from other ZK technology, such as a zkEVM. How is ZKP different and what is the better ZK solution?<br> <p>Saif - 26:16</p><p>Well, if you're talking about Panther in itself, you know Panther is not zkEVM. And the question is, how is $ZKP different? I'm trying to understand where the reference to ZKP is ZKP proofs in general or if $ZKP means Panther in this question.<br></p><p>Oliver - 26:36</p><p>I would say answer it as Panther. I think that's the question.<br></p><p>Saif - 26:42</p><p>Yeah, so zkEVMs are dedicated blockchains, where the zero-knowledge proving happens inside the EVM itself. Panther is chain agnostic. It's a smart contract, utilizing the zero-knowledge libraries to create these circuits that prove the zero-knowledge aspect. Basically, we use zSNARKs and Grant 16, in that respect, to be precise. So this is something that can be deployed on any EVM chains at this moment, hence the difference. What was the other question, Carlos? <br></p><p>Carlos - 27:27</p><p>A follow-up from me, if you don't mind. Am I right to assume that a zkEVM does not necessarily imply privacy, just scalability?<br></p><p>Saif - 27:38</p><p>No, there is privacy there. It's not just scalability. I mean, when you're looking at scalability, those are more the roll-ups, the zk-rollups. Those are more specific to solutions to scale. But the zkEVM itself is more sort of a privacy solution at the EVM level.<br></p><p>Oliver - &nbsp;28:07</p><p>I just want to say something on that. If you're building a zkEVM, you're competing in the L1 and L2 space. So your goal is to beat the other L1s and L2s with a superior proposition. They almost suffer from the same problem at the core, which is that they need developers, they need network effects. They need TVL and they need users. The competition for zkEVM is higher. So there are trade-offs between transaction latency, fees and security – the typical blockchain trilemma problem. That's the space that any smart contract protocol is operating within. <br></p><p>Panther is not operating within that space. We're operating within the dApplication space. Often every fund, every asset manager, every broker, every exchange, every user, and every computation may have some requirements for privacy at some point or the other. And if we deploy this protocol onto these virtual machines, we can enable the other ecosystem applications to function. If we were to bet on a zkEVM, that would be all of our eggs in one basket. By building Panther we've said we’re multi-asset. We're not interested in who wins 10 years from now. We're just interested in Panther being on that protocol. Higher expected outcome.<br></p> What is the go-to market strategy for the project? And how does it plan to gain traction and adoption in the DeFi ecosystem?<br> <p>Oliver Gale - 29:52</p><p>For the community, members have been tracking the conversations happening in Telegram. As many in our community would know, we've been reevaluating the architecture in light of the Tornado Cash sanctions and the likely further restrictions of who've been facilitating things like laundering of North Korean funds, and stuff like that – criminal proceeds. &nbsp; <br></p><p>So we've taken all of that into account and extensively assessed what it looks like and the summary of Panther is: Panther is going to launch a zone that is currently codenamed T1000. &nbsp;<br></p><p>The first thing is, the Panther multi-asset shielded pool is being subdivided into zones, and each zone will be run by a guardian. The Guardian is your Creator of the zone, and they take responsibility for the actions and transactions that happen within their zone. It is a separate environment that shares the anonymity set of the entire multi-asset shielded pool. <br></p><p>And so, in that sense, new entrants don't have to start bootstrapping from zero, as far as privacy is concerned. At the same time, these actors can actually run the institutional dark pools, which is an example of how well-used things like dark pools are. Now, these are compliant, alternative trading systems in the TadFi world. So in the DeFi equivalent, Panther is enabling this type of deployment along with any permutation, for example, payment networks, brokerage services, etc. <br></p><p>So Panther is looking at enabling these bespoke zones to service different niches within multiple markets across multiple chains, and to bridge transactions between zones and between chains. That’s the end game. Stepping back from that, the goal of the market is to deploy a limited retail zone, if you will. This zone–we’re codenaming T1000, which is indicative of the fact that users will do basic sanction screening, identity checks, and so forth and will be able to transact within that zone, under $1,000 per day. They can do that as long as the zone is operating, which we expect will be in perpetuity. <br></p><p>In parallel to that, we're having discussions with some of these regulated FinTech broker crypto players, to get them to run their own zones and to begin offering private or confidential DeFi services to their user bases and their networks. We're seeing a lot of interest in that. So it is this approach where we're not – if the audience is familiar with Aztec, Aztec has implemented some sanction screening. We've taken a more thorough look at what this looks like in terms of data controller relationships, transaction amounts, due diligence, and so forth, and have come to a place where we can launch this zone, and have it be a permission zone, but with some checkpoints built around it. Essentially, it will be the DAO's responsibility to approve that proposal when it's made. So that's the go-to market and in parallel, we're also signing up zones. <br></p><p>Now, there is a day some time at the end of the roadmap when Panther is “sufficiently decentralized”. At that time, we will evaluate the essential handover of the entire protocol to the community and other parties. In that world, it is possible that zones of other designations – they may be DAO-driven zones, as opposed to regulated financial service provider-driven zones, or government-driven zones – those types of things become possible. That's sort of the progression from public beta, to the full main net to the end of the roadmap.<br><br></p> How will Panther make sure to stay compliant for retail users? <p>Oliver - 35:04</p><p>Panther does not need to be compliant. Panther is a protocol, and Panther Ventures is a development team. So the idea of the protocol being compliant is not the correct way to assess it. If we were building with the idea of the protocol being compliant, the likely outcome will be – and this is unfortunate for many DeFi protocols and many builders out there — is that they're going to find their projects come to a swift conclusion as they are attempting to do something and doing it ineffectively. <br></p><p>So if you are compliant, you're compliant, and if you're non-compliant your non-compliant. And then, if you're compliant in Country A, are you compliant in Country B through Z? And if you're not, then you're non-compliant somewhere. So there are a whole set of very difficult, if not impossible, challenges to solve when a protocol tries to take on the job of compliance itself, in any sort of long-term structure. <br></p><p>When Tornado Cash was sanctioned, that was what we expected in 2020. And that was why we built compliance into the vision; because we thought it was a short-term game plan to go for privacy with a dowel-type structure if you're not building your own L1. And extrapolating again from where we are with some more evidence, my expectation is many of the current DeFi privacy players are going to find themselves out of the market, or having to dramatically adjust their infrastructure to figure out how compliance works. The simple answer to it is: compliance is the responsibility of who uses the protocol – and the protocol design should facilitate operators to take that responsibility into their own hands. And at no time should the protocol custody the data, custody the keys, or control what is happening. At the same time, the protocol should enable those operators, if you will – “guardians” in our case – to respond to their own idiosyncratic legal-jurisdictional requirements. The protocol should be resistant to shutdown or blanket sanctioning, which is what happened with Tornado Cash as an early iteration of an on-chain privacy protocol for Ethereum – one that didn't contemplate the “what if?” questions from the perspective of compliance.<br></p><p>There's always this trade off. The question is: can you sufficiently decentralize? <br></p><p>“Sufficient” is not clear in the market. There is no lawyer on Earth who will tell you what “sufficient” actually means. They may tell you what they think it means, and what one thinks it means might not be what it actually means. That is going to be clarified over the coming months to years. Panther's position is that if you want to be the player that services both retail and enterprise – ultimately if you want to serve all vectors in the market – then you have to be around for that conversation. <br></p><p>So the retail MASP is sort of a risk-managed instance of a zone operating within the shielded pool. It can be thought of as a public eta. It's a step past the test-net because it's actually production privacy. But it's not fully untethered and available in “do-whatever-you-like” mode. That will be something that will be determined by, again, the guardians that utilize the protocol. They're free to do what they like with the protocol and deal with the repercussions of that, whatever those may or may not be.<br></p> What happened to the 100k $ZKP Zafari rewards?<br> <p>Saif - 39:25</p><p>Yeah. So it's not about what happened. It's about when the rewards are going to be processed, &nbsp;and how. The fact that this whole Zafari and the testnet process is evolving. At least from my perspective, what we're trying to look at is: how can these rewards be issued in a decentralized fashion, and how can you actually create these external triggered PRPs on Mainnet? <br></p><p>So as you understand, the team itself does not custody the ZKP or the reward pool. If you have looked at the structure of how vesting happens and how rewards are logged in the pool, I did not want it to go forward and create a proposal to extract 1000k and do manual distribution and things of that nature. So, again, there is a bit of a novel mechanism where, when you perform or contribute to the testing in the test net, how can those contributions be validated and turned into a reward on the Mainnet that itself can happen? <br></p><p>So that one idea was created. There's work going on. The design changes have been done on the PRP creation on the Mainnet itself. I'm waiting for the protocol to be launched, and for all these external triggers be applied on v1. I understand that means there's a bit of waiting that has to be done. But again, these will be clubbed with the additional testing or basically the testing for v1 that is shortly coming. So there will be a lot of testing when the v1 code is deployed. And I think we can basically combine all of those efforts and contributions from the community and the rest of the team that test, and start this PRP generation on Mainnet when things launch.<br></p><p>I would love to hear feedback on that, and what the community thinks. But this is, I think, a novel and a good mechanism to reward users for their efforts and contribution on testing the product itself.<br><br></p> Will v1 rollout with all components at once, and which ones? Or will it be a gradual release?<br> <p>Saif Akhtar</p><p>There is this updated, long pending roadmap that should be published this week. As far as “will it contain all of the features?”, I guess the question would be what are the features that you're talking about? <br></p><p>But, I will say high-level that v1 will contain the DeFi integrations, the ZSwap and basically interactions inside the MASP as its core feature. So those three are going to be included in the v1. I think eventually the rest of the features will be added as we move forward. <br></p><p>I think when we are in the test net, and when we all start to test the product, we would know exactly the maturity levels of different features, and this discussion of what feature to include will be more relevant then. But, from a planning perspective, what I said is in the plans.<br></p><p>My goal is to give more use-cases that all of us can use rather than just, you know, get-in and get-out. That's not the end game for the protocol itself. So more use-cases the user can interact with and deploy strategies from within the Panther is what would make Panther unique in terms of what you can do within that ecosystem.<br></p> How is the zSwap feature shaping up? Are there any new developments related to it? <p>Saif - 47:32</p><p>It's not what new development it is, it is the development for zSwap itself. So trades within the shielded pools are the features that are being worked on. Which kind of, in the background, is an atomic swap within the shielded pool.<br></p><p>It's like I said, this is supposed to be part of the v1 release. So there is development going on. The sub-team that is working on the DeFi integration, is at the final stages of the first prototype for the DeFi integration. Once they've done that then they will pick up working on the zSwap features. The same team basically will work on the zSwap as well.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=panther-protocol-blog">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Discord</a></p>

<p>Electric Coin Co. is excited to announce the launch of our new podcast, PGP* (Pretty Good Policy) for Crypto, hosted by Gary Weinstein (Head of Global Regulatory Relations) and Paul Brigner (Head of U.S. Public Policy and Strategic Advocacy). This podcast is an in-depth exploration of the intersection of blockchain technology, public policy, and global regulatory topics.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has been rapidly evolving in recent years and has shown the potential to revolutionize multiple industries. At the same time, public policy and regulations play a significant role in the development and adoption of blockchain technology. The PGP for Crypto podcast aims to provide our audience with expert perspectives on the key issues shaping the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency, including the impact of current and proposed regulations and policy approaches on the growth and development of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



<p>We believe in fostering a respectful and inclusive environment for our discussions. And while we at Electric Coin Co. hold strong opinions about the need for private and confidential financial transactions in crypto to promote economic freedom, our guests may have differing views. Through these thought-provoking and, at times, challenging conversations, we aim to deepen our understanding of complex policy and regulatory issues and work towards a development of pretty good policy for the cryptocurrency world.</p>



<p>This podcast is for educational purposes only and is not legal or financial advice. Our guest remarks may not reflect those of their organization or of Electric Coin Co. We hope you enjoy the podcast.</p>

New Block Rewards! For Stakers, Masternodes and the PIVX Treasury.<p>On January 22 GMT, coinciding with block 3715200, elements of PIVX’s financial structure changed.</p><p>Payments to the treasury, staking rewards, and Masternode rewards increased. This is part of the PIVX version 5.5.0 upgrade, which will improve funding for initiatives, further secure blockchain integrity, and grow the number of Masternodes.</p><p>With this upgrade, maximum treasury payments will surge by an order of magnitude to 10 PIV per block. (PIV is the cryptocurrency unit for PIVX.) PIVX produces a new block roughly every minute, with 43,200 blocks per monthly cycle, and the new rate corresponds to 432,000 PIV per monthly cycle to pay for coding, marketing, and other helpful efforts. This amount is not necessarily all paid out, but represents a cap for projects that are elected by PIVX Masternode voting. The actual payout in any given monthly cycle may be less, but this increase in the cap brings the potential for great technical and marketing advancement.</p><p>Staking payments will double to 4 PIV per block. PIVX is a Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency, and staking is used to secure it. Staking is done through nodes, which are software units running a PIVX wallet and communicating with other nodes. With each block, one of the staking nodes is chosen at random, with probability proportional with the amount of PIV it has staked, to process the block. With this upgrade, the randomly chosen staking node will be paid 4 PIV when selected. This increase will strengthen the PIVX network by encouraging more PIVX owners to&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Masternode payments will double to 6 PIV per block. Masternodes are created by running specially configured node software and posting 10,000 PIV to enable Masternode status. Masternodes cycle through selection for payment. They will now receive 6 PIV with each cycle. Masternodes vote on treasury expenditures and represent a resource available for future PIVX applications — which could include rapid settlement, mixing, offline processing, interacting with other blockchains, and much more. Some new applications will need more Masternodes, and this payment increase incentivizes more Masternodes to support these advancements.</p><p>Members of the PIVX community, including newcomers, should take action based on these changes. If you have ideas for improving PIVX, propose them — there will be more funding available for good ideas. If you have idle PIV, stake it or use it to make Masternodes. Staking is a quick and essential way to maximize the return on your PIVX investment, and Masternode operation is a way to both make a return and influence the direction of PIVX by voting on proposals. The rewards for both are now much&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>Embrace PIVX’s 5.5.0 upgrade and its many exciting opportunities.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin/on-january-22-gmt-coinciding-with-block-3715200-elements-of-pivxs-financial-structure-changed-46099b583481">On January 22 GMT, coinciding with block 3715200, elements of PIVX’s financial structure changed.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx-coin">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>There was at least one member of Sam Bankman-Fried’s circle who wasn’t sucked into the Effective Altruism vortex.<a href="https://www.boston.com/news/the-boston-globe/2023/01/23/sam-trabucco-crypto-ftx/"> Sam Trabucco</a>, a prodigy from Boston, crossed paths with his future colleagues at math competitions and camps growing up. He went on to attend MIT, applied his skills as a trader at Jeff Yass’s Susquehanna Investment Group outside Philadelphia for a few years, got absorbed with crypto-currency, and then relocated to San Francisco where he reconnected with Bankman-Fried. Trabucco worked as a high-level executive with Alameda Research for a few years before being appointed Co-Chief Executive with Caroline Ellison. She’s been charged with fraud; he has not. Trabucco seems to have remained outside the innermost circle and stepped off the sinking ship a few months before everything unraveled, keeping his multi-million-dollar condo, luxury yacht, and new home for his parents in Maine. Evidently, Trabucco wasn’t one to lose sleep over whether it was more effective to donate his digital lucre to deworming or anti-malarial programs.</p>

<p>Trabucco loops us back to Susquehanna International Group (SIG) located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in Bala Cynwyd just across the Philadelphia border. Montgomery is the second wealthiest county in Pennsylvania after Chester. Jeff Yass started the firm with five college friends from SUNY Binghamton, located on the Susquehanna River a half hour northwest of Susquehanna, PA, which happens to be the childhood home of behaviorist B.F. Skinner and the town where Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon.</p>

<p>Yass and his college buddies were gamblers who played lots of poker. They used mathematics and probability to great advantage on horses, dog racing, even jai alai once they gathered sufficient funds to cover all the probable bets. After being excluded from a growing number of establishments and finding it problematic to cart around duffel bags of cash, the men went into options trading during the “greed-is-good” 1980s.<a href="https://www.marketswiki.com/wiki/Susquehanna_International_Group"> Susquehanna Investment Group</a> was launched in 1987, the same year Oliver Stone released “<a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA10561158&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=07457065&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7Ed63c905">Wall Street</a>.” Millennium hedge fund manager<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/israel-englander/?sh=40d38ec61462"> Israel Englander</a> sponsored Yass to obtain a seat on the Philadelphia stock exchange.</p>
<p>While many firms lost money in 1987, Susquehanna<a href="https://archive.ph/8udfJ#selection-3363.0-3363.321"> came out ahead on Black Monday</a> having insurance put options in place. In its early years, the firm was trading as much as 5-10% of the volume of the NYSE each day. Some criticized the upstarts and their models, but with the blessing of his libertarian hero, Milton Friedman, Yass continued to move Susquehanna forward. Today it is one of the world’s largest privately held financial services firms and an important provider of market liquidity. Befitting the low-profile nature of the firm, it occupies a nondescript mid-rise office building on City Line Avenue, the former site of Marriott’s 1961 luxury<a href="https://www.theconstitutional.com/blog/2020/09/09/remembering-marriott-motor-inn-city-line-avenue"> Motor Inn</a>, a mid-century modernist landmark. The site’s most distinctive feature is a massive 300+ year old “Penn oak” that commands one corner of the rear parking lot.</p>
<p>A 2018<a href="https://archive.ph/l5G6E"> article</a> from Bloomberg Markets states, “Susquehanna built its empire on poker.” The firm holds “a philosophy that poker provides the best training for the type of probability-based decisions in uncertain circumstances that are needed in markets” where the goal is not to win the most hands, but rather to maximize gains and to do it clinically, without being influenced by<a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2009/08/26/beating-the-odds/"> human emotion</a>. In a<a href="https://archive.ph/xOwDe#selection-2213.144-2213.156"> Haaretz feature</a> this is described as a “poker philosophy” where one places bets on a variety of possible winning outcomes with the expectation that at least one will net a big payout.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://archive.ph/8udfJ"> 2021 in-depth Forbes article</a> goes on to say there is a drive at the firm to turn almost anything into a gambling opportunity, to uncover hidden arbitrage. A<a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2009/08/26/beating-the-odds/"> Philadelphia Magazine article</a> shared a story of traders in the New York office betting on whether Yass would know the last king in the Plantagenet Dynasty. He did. Yass recently secured approval to trade futures contracts on US tax rates and dreams of a day when markets can be used to determine public policy. The Wall Street Journal reinforces his position in a quote from “<a href="https://archive.ph/gRfPl#selection-491.0-518.0">A Betting Man With A Plan for America</a>” published last fall:</p>
<p>“On climate, the science remains iffy and frequently misrepresented in public debate. This is where betting markets could help. Think about insurers, fund managers, and speculators with real skin in the game. Think about liquid markets where they could match wits and distill a best guess about those future temperature and climate trends. If we were able to get those prices out there, we can stop the nonsense of the world and the climate change hysterical people, and have a rational conversation,” Mr. Yass says.”</p>
<p>“He’s hardly alone in recognizing the power of prediction markets to improve policy. The idea has garnered legions of academic fans. Then politicians would have to explain why their promises are at variance with investor expectations. Journalists would have a powerful new tool against which to test partisan arguments and hold leaders to account.”</p>
<p>“Nobody says they know who will win a football game,” Mr. Yass points out; all understand it’s a matter of probabilities. Bringing the power of prediction markets and disciplined odds-making into the political policy arena – “that, I think, would be the greatest gift to society.”</p>
<p>This program is Futarchy, though neither Forbes nor the Wall Street Journal makes the connection. Instead, the<a href="https://archive.ph/8udfJ#selection-3367.246-3371.54"> article</a> closes with Yass’s contention that the marketplace will be a harbinger of truth, and that realizing this goal is nothing less than “a mission from god.” <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/events/the-age-of-em-work-love-and-life-when-robots-rule-the-earth-with-prof-robin-hanson/">Robin Hanson</a>, the theorist behind Futarchy and a professor of economics at the Koch-funded George Mason University, just happens to maintain an affiliation with the Future of Humanity Institute that shares office space with the Centre for Effective Altruism. Hanson’s blog is named “Overcoming Bias” and features a banner image of Ulysses tied to the mast of a ship with sirens singing around him.</p>

<p>Yass has shown considerable interest in sports gambling markets in Europe where Betfair’s<a href="https://betting.betfair.com/what-is-in-play-betting.html"> in-game betting</a> infrastructure has enabled the creation of markets not unlike options trading, though the transactions are much smaller. I’m not a gambler, but as I read the<a href="https://betting.betfair.com/how-to-use-betfair-exchange/advanced-guides/market-making-and-liquidity-010819-6.html"> basic FAQ put out by Betfair</a>, it seems like their platform essentially makes anyone a bookie. In 2016 SIG opened a Dublin affiliate,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/nellie-analytics-limited/about/"> Nellie Analytics Limited</a>, to develop business opportunities in sports and geopolitical analytics. </p>
<p>Dublin is home to<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/betfair"> Flutter Entertainment</a>, one of the world’s largest gambling enterprises and parent company to Betfair. Last February Flutter opened a new technology-enabled headquarters complete with Ireland’s first “<a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/flutter-dublin-headquarters-contactless-store">fully frictionless” shop</a>. In researching Adam Neumann’s post-WeWork venture, Flow, I came across early experiments he had undertaken with <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/mastercard-and-wework-jointly-creating-experiences-to-shape-the-future-of-shared-spaces/">Mastercard</a> that used digital identity authentication and automated payment systems synced with sensor networks. This wasn’t about convenience, but rather the generation of data flows for forecasting and bets – predictions on inventory, profitability, consumer preference, and human mobility in built environments. Some are calling this the IoP “Internet of Places.” I don’t think we’ve thought enough about what it would mean to work at your gig job in a building made available via a subscription model, a building equipped with <a href="https://archive.ph/ZCoIr">artificial vision to track you via your phone</a> to make sure you’ve paid for all the amenities you’ve used. This outside-in robot starts to get Black Mirror pretty quickly. These days real estate developers are in the data business, the cybernetic steering business. Jason and I will be hosting a multipart series examining the Flow business model in the next few weeks. I just want to point out the relevance here to global betting, Flutter, and artificial vision trained on human activity.</p>

<p>In 2022, Susquehanna also became a lead investor in<a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/72875/susquehanna-pointsbet-sports-betting-qa/"> PointsBet</a>, an Australian operation with a US office in Denver. In addition to SIG’s role as a major investor, its affiliate Nellie Analytics provides consulting services to PointsBet so that they can be in a position to expand future offerings. SIG also directed seed funding to<a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/194496/susquehanna-bets-on-decentralized-sports-prediction-market-frontrunner"> Forerunner</a>, a Web3 prediction market for sports betting that allows people to buy and sell shares of teams or players using cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Susquehanna International Group was early to the Bitcoin party, having been<a href="https://archive.ph/F1i5x"> introduced to the digital currency</a> by the<a href="https://archive.ph/3vVke"> Winklevoss twins</a> in 2014. A digital asset group was formed in 2017 and began to trade futures in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at a time few large firms were interested or had the capacity to safely execute the trades.<a href="https://events.bloomberglive.com/bloomberg-invest-new-york-2022/agenda/speakers/1787538"> Bart Smith</a> leads their cryptocurrency division. Last summer he opened<a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/news/susquehanna-international-group-expands-to-the-bahamas"> Susquehanna’s office in the Bahamas</a>, following on the heels of FTX. Their plan is to expand<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/30/hxro-raises-34m-on-promise-of-derivatives-trading-infrastructure-for-solana/"> DeFi derivatives trading</a> in a location with a<a href="https://thenassauguardian.com/bahamas-tops-list-of-countries-that-have-developed-digital-assets-legislation/"> comprehensive digital asset regulation</a> though the bloom is a bit off the rose for the Bahamas as a crypto outpost since the FTX implosion. SIG also maintains a reinsurance division in Bermuda that underwrites<a href="https://www.artemis.bm/news/arbol-launches-bermuda-mgu-parametric-reinsurance/"> Arbol</a> and its decentralized weather forecasting marketplace,<a href="https://arbolmarket.medium.com/an-introduction-to-dclimate-a-decentralized-network-for-climate-data-46c7d97273ea"> dClimate</a>, in the development of parametric insurance products.</p>

<p>Where Susquehanna is concerned everything is a potential betting opportunity. The arrival of extended reality means there will be options to place wagers on virtual-world activities. In 2008, SIG sponsored an 800-square foot motion capture lab at the University of Pennsylvania, part of the engineering school’s Center for Computer Graphics located next door to the site of the first general purpose computer,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC"> ENIAC</a>. The lab was led by<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~badler/"> Norman Badler</a>, an expert in human simulation modeling who helped develop “Jack” software for human factors analysis that was later licensed by Siemens. In 1992, Badler and his colleagues in the computer science department wrote “<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~badler/book/SimulatingHumans.pdf">Simulating Humans: Computer Graphics, Animation, and Control</a>,” published by Oxford University Press. After five decades at UPenn, Badler landed as the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dr-norm-badler-computer-graphics-pioneer-joins-cesium-to-lead-metaverse-research-301381075.html">lead Metaverse researcher at Cesium</a> advising one of his former students, the firm’s CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickcozzi/">Patrick Cozzi</a> (h/t to <a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/author/novicestephers/">Stephers</a> for this tie in).&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPenn’s<a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/history.html"> Center for Human Modeling and Simulation</a> has been operating since the mid-1990s with support provided by the Army, Air Force, Office of Naval Research, NASA, NSF, NIST, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman. In kind support has been provided by Electronic Arts, Gamebryo, Siemens, and Eon Reality. In a<a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/penn-center-computer-graphics-joins-sig-build-regions-largest-motion-capture-studio"> press release</a> from Penn Today, Badler said graduates of the program were in high demand not only in the gaming and entertainment sectors, but also in finance. Pair the engineering school’s human simulation expertise with Wharton’s creative finance schemes and predictive economic models and toss in some compulsive gambling tendencies for good measure and you’ve got a rather toxic brew. </p>
<p>Esports and iGaming are emerging markets where wagers are made not always in cash but also in<a href="https://www.legalsportsreport.com/esports-betting/"> skins</a> (in-game collectible items). I can’t help but wonder where we’re going with emerging-tech educational models that center gamification with behaviorist digital scrip rewards. Is there anything that won’t become a wager as AI assistants step in to train a generation of Metaverse gladiators?</p>

<p>SIG is a financial sponsor of esports outfit Dignitas, a division of New Meta Entertainment based in Newark, NJ. Dignitas is owned by the Philadelphia 76ers. From the company’s webpage:</p>
<p>“Teaming up with Dignitas was a natural fit for SIG. Gaming is at the core of our culture and the strategy used in esports goes hand in hand with our approach to trading. By joining forces with Dignitas, we are bringing together esports and trading to connect the brightest minds in gaming to take on the competition.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Newark, where Dignitas is based, is home to the United Way of Northern New Jersey that hatched the <a href="https://spaa.newark.rutgers.edu/united-way-ALICE">ALICE program</a> (Assets Limited, Income Constrained, Employed). Once brought to scale,&nbsp; (ALICE United is now operating in <a href="https://www.unitedforalice.org/national-reports-mobile">23 states</a>) the working poor can be developed as collective impact commodities (see this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/06/09/what-about-alice-the-united-way-collective-impact-libertarian-charity/">blog post</a>). Jeff Bezos’s ex-wife <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mackenzie+scott+united+way&amp;oq=mackenzie+scott+united+way+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i390.4668j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#ip=1">MacKenzie Scott</a> has been seeding United Way offices across the country with multi-million dollar donations in recent years. Newark has also been a test-bed for public-private partnership experiments. Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla led the charge into privatized education, partnering with Cory Booker back in 2010. Chan Zuckerberg poured $100 million into a school choice initiative that publicly flopped, but I believe privately yielded valuable data, data that will be leveraged in policy poker games still to come. Hedge fund billionaires find <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/2017/10/26/richest-people-new-jersey-according-forbes/803063001/">northern New Jersey</a> an attractive landing spot, along with Connecticut.</p>
<p>Organizations like the YMCA and even school districts have started to promote esports as a wholesome activity for children in the aftermath of lockdown social distancing protocols. How convenient it will be to have social-impact funded non-profits in a position to run out-of-school time learning programs (after-school, summer enrichment) that maximize digital team data harvest. These robust data flows can be used to score (and bet on) the next generation of human capital. All the while, moms are working their second or third jobs to try and pay astronomical rents. My friend Lynn Davenport wrote an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dallas-esports-bucky-ballers-lynn-davenport/?trackingId=%2B9ikue0gQUaZ7X3AwzsRvA%3D%3D">article</a> about esports and the YMCA in Dallas, which she discussed with Jason and me last month. See video below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jeff Yass is a smart guy who hires smart people. He’s driven to win; and winning in the financial arena means making and retaining as much money as possible. He’s a lifelong libertarian who believes markets (which are never as “free” as libertarians like to imagine they are) will offer up supreme truths. Yass is currently vice chair of the<a href="https://www.cato.org/news-releases/cato-institute-names-new-chair-vice-chair-welcomes-mackey-board"> Cato Institute</a>, an organization on whose board he’s served since 2002. He’s also a generous supporter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_for_Growth">Club of Growth</a>, a limited government, limited taxes, entitlement reform, deregulation advocating conservative 501(c)4 that serves as a conduit for a free-market PAC and a Super PAC. Numerous articles have been written in recent years about Yass’s political donations. </p>
<p>In 2022, he was the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/03/american-billionaires-spent-a-record-880-million-on-the-us-midterm-elections-.html"> fourth largest individual donor</a> to political races nationally after George Soros, Richard Uihlien, and Ken Griffin. School choice and lowering tax rates are the two policy areas that have his attention. Yass was the largest individual donor to <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2022/10/31/why-rand-paul-is-billionaire-jeff-yass-favorite-national-politician/69598738007/">Rand Paul</a> and stepped up his backing of Ron DeSantis to $100,000 over the summer following the lead of Blackstone’s <a href="https://archive.ph/XchEF">Stephen Schwarzman</a>, Citadel hedge fund manager <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/11/06/gop-megadonor-desantis-24-ken-griffin-00065274">Kenneth Griffin</a>, and founder of Uline shipping supplies firm Richard Uihlein whose German-American ancestors made a brewing fortune with Schiltz in Milwaukee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/billionaire-quant-trader-donates-a-record-19m-of-bitcoin-to-a-super-pac/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/billionaire-quant-trader-donates-a-record-19m-of-bitcoin-to-a-super-pac/">https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/26/billionaire-quant-trader-donates-a-record-19m-of-bitcoin-to-a-super-pac/</a>
<p>Most recipients of Yass’s largesse are Republicans, but not all. Wading into the critiques of his political donations, the first thing I noticed was the reductive, polarized framing. While I acknowledge and disapprove of the influence that billionaires have over the electoral process, the corruption and ineffectiveness I’ve experienced during my twenty-plus years as a Philadelphia resident must be laid at the feet of the Democratic party. Democrats need to yell at Republicans just as much as Republicans need to yell at Democrats. With all of the yelling, the general public is too distracted to pay attention to the structure that is oppressing them, which is fully bipartisan.</p>
<p>Yass isn’t MAGA or a white nationalist any more than he’s a circus clown, but by characterizing his donations within such a framework, liberals don’t have to explain why we should be wary of high-frequency derivatives traders. Even as they blanket themselves in social justice rhetoric it’s the progressives that are waving in the social entrepreneurs who are quite anxious to bring human capital finance markets to scale in Web3. In a future defined by cyber-physical and socio-technical environments governed under the rules of ESG (Environmental, Social Governance) social-impact finance, both sides need one another. For now, investors still need governments to corral citizens (cough, cough “agents”), tag them, and put them in play. Only then can the wagers commence. Many governments, meanwhile, are all too happy to delegate their responsibilities to public-private partnerships, civil society NGOs, managed through outcomes-based “what works” contracts.</p>

 The digital asset environment in the U.S. has changed significantly in the months since the spectacular collapses of FTX and other crypto firms.

<p>Building a blockchain from the ground-up is a daunting task in itself, one that should not be a concern when designing an end-user application. Moreover, as Web3 aims to move away from centralized vertical scalability towards a multi-chain decentralized environment, horizontal scalability and cross-communication should represent a standard. While Cosmos solves the latter, deploying application-specific blockchains has not been a streamlined process. Saga aims to address this by providing automated means of deploying application-specific blockchains, called chainlets that use the validator set of Saga. This leads to a simplified user (and developer) experience, presently much needed in the Web3 gaming and entertainment industries.</p><p>We were joined by Rebecca Liao, co-founder &amp; CEO of Saga, to discuss bootstrapping app-specific chains in just one click, leveraging the scalability &amp; security of Cosmos, thus allowing developers to focus more on the product and less on the blockchain infrastructure.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rebecca’s background &amp; building Saga  Leveraging Cosmos SDK, IBC &amp; ICS to bootstrap other chains  Chainlets  Saga validators &amp; tokenomics  IBC &amp; elastic scaling for chainlets  ICS &amp; Saga’s tech stack  Chainlet customization  Partnerships &amp; use cases  Chainlet ‘Musical chairs’ auction  Targeting gaming and entertainment industries  Multi-chain future and inter-chain communication  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/beccaliao">Rebecca Liao on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Sagaxyz__">Saga on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

    <p>&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dune-recap.jpg"></a>EON has been running on our pre-alpha and invite-only Dune Testnet for the past month and welcomed a small group of 90+ community developers to test the platform. We are thrilled to see the amount of activity that has happened on Dune testnet since the January launch: 302 smart contracts were deployed, 88 tokens and 3,751 wallet addresses were created, and over 30k transactions were made.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite invoice financing becoming increasingly popular, it is no new financial phenomenon. In essence, invoice financing refers to the process of selling unpaid invoices to third parties in order to get access to a percentage of the value of that invoice quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Depending on the type of invoice financing, the invoice is either sold to a third party for a certain percentage of the full invoice value, after which this third party is also responsible for the collection of the invoice (factoring). Or a certain percentage of the value of the invoice is lent out to the company. That is then repaid once the invoice has been paid, along with a fee and discount charge (invoice discounting).</p>



<p>Tokenisation on the other hand refers to a new way of handling digital assets. Specifically, by turning them into a ‘<a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/tokenisation/">token</a>’ which lives on a blockchain. This allows the tokenised asset to be easily tracked, transferred, and more. But how do these two work together?</p>



<p>Let’s first take a look at the issues with the current method of invoice financing and why there is a need for improvements.</p>



 Issues with modern invoice financing 



<p>Invoice financing sounds like a relatively simple process that offers clear benefits to both parties. But the current process of invoice financing also has its issues, such as:</p>



 
 No standard invoice format 



 Invoice verification is difficult 



 Double spending 
 



 No standard invoice format 



<p>An invoice can be defined as a document that specifies when, who, and how much payment is due. However, there is no universal agreement on what information should be included in an invoice. E-invoicing presents a potential for standardisation, but even within this system, there is no set standard. This makes it difficult to securitise an invoice due to the potential for issues with the data and the operational processes surrounding the invoices.</p>



 Invoice verification is difficult 



<p>The second issue with current invoice financing is that verifying the validity of an invoice is very difficult. Before an invoice can be considered a secure title the financier will have to ensure that the debtor is able to fulfil their obligations as well as verify the correctness of all details in the invoice.</p>



<p>This also makes the financing of invoices inaccessible to regular investors. They do not possess the necessary means to conduct these thorough invoice verifications.</p>



 Double spending 



<p>Another issue with invoices is that they tend to be unregistered in most areas. If somebody has malicious intentions they could sell the same invoice to multiple financiers. This is also difficult to detect for possible financiers.</p>



 How the tokenisation of invoices works 



<p>Let’s now take a look at how <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/tokenisation/">tokenisation</a> and invoice financing work together is best explained using an example. Let’s take a look at the example below:</p>



<p>Company A sells a product to Company B and sends them an invoice to be paid within 90 days. They need the money from the invoice now and sell the invoice to a third party (financier) after the financier has done their due diligence in verifying the validity of the invoice. Company B then pays the invoice to the financier.</p>



<p>This is a simplified version of the current process of invoice financing. But let’s now take a more in-depth look at all the steps in this process and where the tokenisation comes in:</p>



 
 Company A sells a product to Company B and sends an invoice to Company B to be paid within 90 days. 



 Company A wants to use the money from the invoice now. It sells the invoice to a third party (financier) in order to get a percentage of the invoice value after the financier has performed their due diligence in assessing the invoice. The invoice is usually sold for 80-95% of the value of the invoice. 



 The financier now holds the risk of that invoice on their balance sheet and they are required to hold capital for that risk. As these risks are high, the financier wants to distribute that risk. 



 The financier tokenises the invoice and sells it to investors through an invoice market platform. 



 When the payment term is due and the invoice is paid by Company B, the platform distributes the remainder of the invoice to the investors. 
 



 Benefits of invoice tokenisation and invoice markets 



<p>While the process with tokenised invoices and an invoice market is more complex than the current process, it can also address the various issues with the current process of invoice financing, in addition to offering various other benefits. The benefits of using tokenisation in invoice financing can be summarised as follows:</p>



 
 Invoices as an asset class 



 Standardisation of invoices 



 More transparent ownership of invoices 



 Increased efficiency and automation 
 



 Invoices as an asset class 



<p>As discussed, invoice financing is not accessible to general investors. The indicated is due to the amount of due diligence required when financing an invoice. By having a standard approach along with quality checks of the financiers, invoices can become an asset class that is highly accessible to regular investors.</p>



<p>This is a win-win situation for everyone involved. There is a bigger incentive for financiers to finance invoices as they have better and more efficient ways of managing their risk. It helps companies that want to sell their invoices as there will be a wider range of financiers. And lastly, it helps investors by giving them access to a new asset class.</p>



 Standardisation of invoices 



<p>In order to be able to become securities invoices will have to adhere to certain standards and quality checks. More comprehensive and complete invoices decrease risks and grey areas. Therefore the demand for higher prices, incentivising financiers to request a high standard of invoices.</p>



<p>Additionally, it might lead to better regulations surrounding invoice financing. It can help create a safer environment for financiers and investors alike as tokenised invoice financing becomes the norm.</p>



 More transparent ownership of invoices 



<p>Tokenised invoices are kept and tracked on a blockchain-based platform. This massively increases the transparency of ownership and ensures all parties have access to the same information. This increased transparency tackles the issue of double spending as ownership of invoices can be tracked more easily.</p>



<p>Increased transparency in the ownership of invoices can also help reduce the risk of errors with manual payments. This is done by providing clear and accurate information about who is responsible for the invoice and who is authorised to receive payment. With more visibility into the ownership of invoices, manual payment processes can be streamlined. Consequently, reducing the chance of miscommunication and mistakes.</p>



 Increased efficiency and automation 



<p>The last, but definitely not least important benefit of using tokenisation in invoice financing is increased efficiency and automation. With better invoice standards and an invoice market which increases transparency of invoice ownership and automates payouts to investors, the whole invoice financing process goes from a rather cumbersome manual process to a much more streamlined and automated process which benefits all parties involved.</p>



<p>Invoice financiers have an increased market to offset the risk of financed invoices, and in addition to that they no longer have to manage the tedious task of investor payouts when invoices are paid. For investors the process of investing in invoices also becomes much easier by having a transparent invoice market with a broad offering of invoices.</p>







 Conclusion 



<p>In conclusion, invoice financing and tokenisation of invoices provide a solution to various issues faced by companies and investors in accessing financing, managing risk, and ensuring the validity of invoices. Tokenisation offers greater transparency, standardisation, and automation in the financing process. This makes invoices a new and accessible asset class for regular investors. All, whilst providing efficient ways of managing risk for financiers. The use of tokenised invoices may also lead to better regulations surrounding invoice financing. Hence, this creates a safer environment for investors and financiers alike.</p>

Verida Explainer: Introducing the Verida DID&nbsp;Method<p>The concept of a “Decentralized Identifier” (DID) is at the heart of the web3 movement of self-sovereign identity and&nbsp;data.</p> Watch the explainer video  A quick recap on&nbsp;DIDs <p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are similar to usernames in Web3, but with extra features. They are the basis for sharing public keys controlled by the DID holder, creating trusted connections, storing data and many other capabilities.</p><p>Here is an example DID using the “Ethereum” DID Method: did:ethr:0x690b9a9e9aa1c9db991c7721a92d351db4fac990</p><p>Given a DID, it’s possible to use a software library to lookup an associated DID Document (JSON) that provides lots of extra metadata. This document can define an unlimited number of public keys for different use cases, it supports key rotation and supports listing API’s or service endpoints where you can interact with the identity.</p> The problem with current DID&nbsp;methods <p>There are lots of DID Methods (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">see the full list here</a>). Unfortunately they all suffer from a variety of different problems that make none of them a suitable base for the next generation of web3 applications.</p><p>Verida CEO, Chris Were, <a href="https://www.chriswere.com/i/99200769/however-did-core-implementations-also-have-problems">recently wrote about these issues holding back DID adoption</a>.</p><p>These key problems typically relate&nbsp;to:</p>  Access: DID Documents must be public to discover and read. The protocol must be enforce that only the DID controller (user with the secret) can change the document (ie: rotate their&nbsp;keys)  Performance: It must be fast to read and write (seconds), otherwise there will be unacceptable delays when creating a new account or signing into Web3 applications.  Cost: Web3 is competing with Web2. The cost must be very low (ideally free), without the user becoming beholden to a centralized entity paying on their behalf. If the user has to pay, that introduces a huge barrier to entry that makes it infeasible.  Revocable: A user must be able to delete their DID document in accordance with the “right to be deleted”. This is a critical requirement that is missed by the vast majority of DID method implementations.  Full support: The implementation must support the full suite of DID-Core specifications for maximum flexibility and security.  Full history: The implementation must support retrieving any historical version of the DID document. This is essential to support signature verification where the signing keys&nbsp;change.   Introducing the Verida DID&nbsp;method <p>The Verida DID method is designed to have a similar architecture to the Domain Name System which has worked incredibly well for an extended period of time for the&nbsp;web.</p><p>The concept of DID “discovery” and Document “storage” are separated.</p><p>When a DID is created, a pointer is created on the blockchain to where the actual DID document is stored. The actual DID Documents (and all their historical versions) are stored on low cost, commodity HTTP&nbsp;servers.</p>DID documents are stored on off-chain servers<p>We have deployed our “<a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">DID-Registry</a>” smart contract to Polygon’s Mumbai testnet in preparation for deploying to Polygon’s PoS network in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p> Verida DID Method capabilities   Access to the DID is guaranteed as the blockchain enforces only the DID controller (owner) can set the endpoints where the DID Document is stored. The DID controller can determine how many replica’s there are. In the event there is a malicious server, that can be instantly identified by the protocol and ignored (or penalized) or the DID controller can remove that server from the list of DID Document storage&nbsp;nodes.  Performance is fast. There is a delay writing the DID pointer to the blockchain, however every DID document update after then is lightning fast, at HTTP speeds. On MATIC the blockchain write with confirmation time in the real world is approximately 5&nbsp;seconds.  Cost is low. There is a single write to the blockchain when a DID is created, but all DID Document updates are then off-chain and effectively free. On MATIC the one-time cost to create a DID is ~0.003. A DID controller can change the pointer to update the list of servers. That does require another blockchain update at the same&nbsp;cost.  Revocation of the DID is possible. The DID controller can update the blockchain to revoke a DID so it’s no longer available. The DID controller can also “ping” the servers hosting their DID Document to revoke the document and it will be permanently deleted.  Full DID Document support is included. Since the DID Document is stored off-chainoffline, there are no challenges trying to store that data on the blockchain. It’s a simple JSON object that can be stored on disk and easily retrieved. It’s also future proof to easily support upgrades to the DID Core specification.  Full DID Document history is included and can be retrieved via different query parameters to the HTTP endpoints (amongst other query&nbsp;types)  <p>As a result, web3 now has a fast, decentralized, low cost, fully featured DID method that supports true revocation of identities.</p> How to use the Verida DID&nbsp;method <p>There are two typescript libraries available for developers:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did">@verida/vda-did</a> — A full implementation that supports creating, retrieving, updating and deleting DID Documents. It requires a private key that has Polygon MATIC tokens for writing DID pointers to the blockchain.  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did-resolver">@verida/vda-did-resolver</a> — A slim resolver implementation (compatible with the getResolver() standard) that supports retrieving the latest DID Document for a given DID&nbsp;string.  <p>See the documentation in each of those packages on how to use the libraries.</p> HTTP Storage&nbsp;Nodes <p>The specification does require a network of HTTP servers that support the Verida DID method API endpoints for creating, storing and retrieving DID Documents.</p><p>We have created an <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node/tree/develop/src/services/didStorage">initial implementation of this HTTP API and integrated it into the Verida network storage node API</a>. This means that as the Verida network scales its web3 database infrastructure, it will also be scaling the available nodes for storing DID documents.</p><p>However, anyone is free to run their own API or embed our API specification into their existing network. The code is open source and available to&nbsp;anyone.</p> Read the specification <p>You can dive deeper into the underlying motivation and design decisions by reading the Verida DID method specification documents:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-2.md">Verida DID Method Specification</a> — The core specification  <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-3.md">DID Document Storage on the Verida Network</a> — The HTTP API specification that is implemented in the <a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node">Verida Storage Node&nbsp;API</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-4.md">Verida DID Resolver Specification</a> — Compatible with the DID getResolver() standard  <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">DID Registry</a> — The EVM compatible smart contract deployed on Polygon Mumbai&nbsp;testnet   Want to learn&nbsp;more?

<p>This is the 23rd post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing privacy features in Brave browsers. This post describes work done by (in alphabetical order): Filter List Enginer Ryan Brown, Research and Privacy Engineer Arthur Edelstein, and Senior Research Engineer Anton ​​Lazarev. This post was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>




    




 1. Hiding “open in app” annoyances 
<p>Starting in upcoming&nbsp;version 1.49 (Android and desktop) and already available since version 1.44 for iOS, Brave will hide “open in app” annoyances that appear on many websites. The links are annoying; they prompt you with unrelated questions when you’re trying to browse the Web. Worse, these notices are often privacy harming. Sites know that the “native” versions of their apps aren’t subject to the kinds of privacy-protections that Brave applies to websites, and they’re thus eager to nudge users into the (often) data-gobbling native apps.</p>
<p>Brave will hide “open in app” annoyances by enabling the terrific “Fanboy’s Mobile Notifications List,” maintained in part by <a>folks working at Brave</a>. Users who want to disable this feature can do so by going into settings and disabling “Fanboy’s Mobile Notifications List” list from the list of custom and regional filter lists.</p>

 2. Additional protections against “pool-party” attacks 
<p>Starting in version 1.49, the desktop and Android versions of Brave will include additional protections against “pool-party” attacks. Pool-party attacks are a category of attack that advanced and motivated trackers can use to link your browsing behaviors across sites (and, in some browsers, across profiles), by leveraging the unintended consequences of how some browser features are implemented. As mentioned in a <a>previous post</a>, most browsers are vulnerable to some form of the attack, though some browsers are more vulnerable than others.</p>
<p>Brave has defended against what was thought at the time to be the most serious form of the attack since version 1.35. However, researchers at Brave have recently identified more ways pool-party attacks can be conducted, and ways they can be carried out faster (i.e. how they can be optimized to communicate across site boundaries faster). As a result, Brave has released fixes to protect against additional forms of the attack <a>1</a>. We are continuing to discuss possible solutions to pool-party attacks with other browser vendors as well.</p>
<p>For more detail on pool-party attacks, please see <a>our research paper</a> that will be presented at <a href="http://usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/">USENIX Security 2023</a>.</p>

 3. Improved ad blocking with procedural cosmetic filters 
<p>Starting in versions 1.49 (Android and desktop) and already available since 1.45 for iOS, Brave includes partial support for <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Procedural-cosmetic-filters">procedural cosmetic filters</a>, an advanced way of specifying which page elements should be hidden when blocking ads and other page annoyances. Most cosmetic filters are defined through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors">CSS selectors</a>; filter list maintainers can specify unwanted page elements to hide using the same system that website designers use to style elements on a page. In the vast majority of cases, this simple capability is all that’s needed.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-will-force-advertising-on-ad-blocking-users-1470751204">sometimes websites try to evade content blocking tools</a>; in these cases content filtering tools need more sophisticated ways of specifying which page elements should be hidden. Procedural cosmetic filters are a solution to this problem, and are an important tool that browsers and Web tools can apply to keep users in control.</p>
<p>There are many different procedural filters, and Brave supports the two most popular ones <a>2</a>. We plan to support more procedural filter rules soon.</p>

 4. Protecting against screen attribute-based browser fingerprinting 
<p>Starting in versions 1.48 (Desktop) and 1.50 (Android), Brave is expanding our <a>browser fingerprinting protections</a> by preventing sites from identifying you based on the size of your screen and position of your browser window. Trackers try to identify you through browser fingerprinting by combining enough semi-identifiers (things that distinguish you from some other users) to build a unique identifier. No browser user is likely to be the only browser user in their country, but they might be the only browser user in their country, using a specific version of the browser, speaking a specific language, with particular graphics hardware, etc.</p>
<p>The size of your screen is another such semi-identifier that trackers use. On their own, your screen’s width and height aren’t enough to uniquely identify you. But if they’re different enough from those of many other browser users, they can help trackers narrow down who you are as you browse the Web. In addition, the position of your browser window on the screen may be fairly unique and another way your browser can stand out.</p>
<p>To combat this, Brave now prevents trackers from learning the size of your device’s screen and the position of your browser window on the screen. First, Brave reports to Web scripts that your screen has approximately the same width and height as your browser window. This prevents trackers from learning about your true screen size. Second, as with Brave’s other unique randomization-based protections, Brave reports slightly different values to each site, for each browser session. This prevents trackers from re-identifying you across different sites, or across different visits to the same site.</p>

    <p>ZenIP 42204 proposes the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204’s</a> purpose is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks. It proposes a solution to eliminate technical debt and avoid regulatory threats that can prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. We asked the Horizen community what they think of ZenIP 42204 via a public survey, 426 community members participated in the survey. Here are the results:</p>
<p>When asked if they are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, 75.3% of survey takers are favorable, 12.7% are neutral, and 11.9% are not favorable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When asked if they think whether or not ZenIP 42204 is positive for the future of Horizen, 77.4% of survey takers rated positive, 13.8% rated neutral, and 8.9% rated negative.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Both Chinese and Korean communities also conducted a vote on ZenIP 42204.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chinese community – 66 people participated in the voting: 92% Yes, 7% No</p>
<p></p>
<p>Korean community – 288 people participated in the voting: 87.8% Yes, 11.1% No, 0.01% Withdrew</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are some of the comments we received from the survey:</p>
<p>“In such a brittle environment as we find ourselves in, I believe this is the correct decision and course of action to avoid unnecessary oversight or worse in terms of regulation which is clearly needed, even welcomed to ensure the is no impropriety in the crypto markets, especially given the feature seldomly used.”</p>
<p>“Although ZenIP’s need for transparency is crucial in attracting and ensuring confidence in some investors, I think it should be taken with caution. This is due to the fact that transactional confidentiality will be favourable in the near future, as other crypto projects may not offer it. Leaving those that do with high market competitive advantage.”</p>
<p>“It’s the right thing to do even though privacy is one of the main features I like about Horizen. I will most likely make some investments in other privacy centric projects such as zcash and ironfish. Part of me thinks that Horizen should keep its privacy features in the face of regulators and possible actions but I know that will suffocate growth. It’s too bad a shielded sidechain cannot be developed prior to the switch but I know resources are focused on the EVM. There will be enough demand for sidechains and all the products that EVM brings to make this project flourish in the future even with the proliferation of other platforms doing the same thing. This change will set up Horizen to become accessible to more users and potential users going forward, as well as many more competitors, I’d like to see how you differentiate. You have a fantastic team and more integrity than almost any other project I can think of.”</p>
<p>“We need to limit the risk of being completely blacklisted by government regulators.”</p>
<p>“Get rid of the anonymity on the mainnet and move as fast as you can to the side chain to focus on expanding your ecosystem.”</p>
<p>“Too late to throw up the privacy position, ‘cause Layer1 market is already possessed by competitors. Keep privacy position is best at the moment”</p>
<p>“Good direction! This will make the project more resilient, scalable and flexible. Future proof is the key!!!”</p>
<p>“Tough call, but agree scrutiny is trending up, not down. Shielded/privacy functionality is key for side chains, but I don’t see any reason why mainchain needs to be anything other than a basic settlement layer acting as the source of truth.”</p>
 What’s Next? 
<p>Thank you everyone who joined the discussion and voiced your opinions on this important matter. As the majority of votes and feedback we have received are in agreement with ZenIP 42204, we will be moving forward with this proposal and plan the changes into a future ZEND software release. We will continue to keep the community informed when the new software release containing the ZenIP 42204 changes are coming.</p>
<p>Our next episode of the Horizen podcast <a href="https://podcast.horizen.io/">“Beyond the Horizen”</a> will discuss ZenIP 42204 with our co-founder Rob Viglione and Jordan Calinoff, Horizen Lab’s VP of Strategy. Please stay tuned.</p>
<p>In his recent blog, Rob shares his thoughts on ZenIP 42204 and how this change can grow the ecosystem further in 2023. <a href="https://medium.com/@robviglione/my-thoughts-on-horizen-zen-being-a-privacy-coin-9a1749be3543">Read his full blog on Medium.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>“I hope people who want ZEN to be a privacy coin can see Horizen as more than a privacy coin, and want it to be more, understand that we’re continuing to invest massively in privacy and privacy is the heart of our strategy to decentralize the world.” – Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen</p>

<p>Introducing embedded&nbsp;wallets</p><p>Privy is the easiest way for developers to onboard all users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce the next step in our product journey: embedded wallets. Embedded wallets make it easy for developers to provision self-custodial wallets for users no matter how they log in, via email, phone or&nbsp;social.</p><p>At Privy, we spend a lot of time obsessing over how to help developers unlock better UX in web3 without sacrificing the ownership primitives that make the space special. Ownership is at the root of web3 but to this day, it has been reserved for only the most technical users.</p><p>For web3 to go mainstream, we must make it easy to bake self-custody into products: web2-caliber UX with web3 ownership and consent. With embedded wallets, you can build simple self-custodial experiences into your app without requiring a seed phrase, third-party extension or any UX interrupt.</p><p><a href="https://gaby.mirror.xyz/0Wq9zk0pZu_s3W1S4BiNcYXw9uSfSVbyGjNPgLHcs18">Why “embedded” wallets?</a> It reflects our conviction that key self-custody should be tightly integrated — embedded — into your product. Our work here is centered around a few core principles:</p>  Self Custody — Privy’s embedded wallets are fully self-custodial. Privy can never sign a message on behalf of a user. Key splitting ensures Privy never holds private keys but your user has simple recovery&nbsp;options.  Native to your app — Key infrastructure should feel native to your app. Let your users come as they are, and keep your UX on-brand with design customization and flexibility around signature prompts for&nbsp;users.  Interoperable from day 1 — Embedded wallets are a springboard into web3. You take care of your in-app experience, we’ll ensure your users have access to a wider ecosystem.  <p>We are not becoming a standalone wallet company. Embedded wallets are tightly integrated within <a href="https://blog.privy.io/announcing-privy-auth-4754be04c515">the existing Privy SDK</a> and its existing wallet connectors. Expert or newcomer, a user is a user: no need to treat them differently in your codebase. For many, Privy will serve as their starter wallet. For others, it will be a UX revolution they can choose to use alongside their existing&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>This is just the beginning. We’ll be sharing more details about each of these over the coming weeks as we roll out embedded wallets to customers. If you’re thinking about how to power native experiences for wider audiences–mainstream products on crypto rails, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74">we’d love to&nbsp;talk</a>.</p><p>Web3 must disappear into the products it spawns. We believe great products will increasingly be hybrid, incorporating on and off-chain elements to power new experiences with better onboarding and simpler permissions delegation. The web3 stack is changing. Our tooling makes it easy for developers to build for this new paradigm. We are so excited for this next step in our journey. More soon&nbsp;(™).</p><p>Web3 is dead. Long live&nbsp;web3.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3-for-users-not-experts-52c692c25bb1">Web3 for users, not experts.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

							<p>Today, we are announcing a new, experimental Zcash Foundation (ZF) grants program, which we have nicknamed “Minor Grants”. This is intended to complement the Major Grants program (aka Zcash Community Grants) by providing a source of funding for smaller grants. We hope that this will reduce the number of smaller grant applications that are submitted to ZCG, thus enabling them to focus their attention on larger, more significant grants that are more in line with what the Major Grants program is intended to fund. Additionally, we would like to create a channel for grant applications that are not directly Zcash-related but explore broader applications of zero knowledge proofs or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>The maximum grant size for this Minor Grants program will be $25,000, and the budget is $75,000.&nbsp;</p><p>We also want to engage the Zcash community, and take advantage of the “wisdom of the crowd” by polling the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) regarding which grants should be funded.</p><p>We plan to see how this first iteration of the program goes, how many and what sort of grant applications are submitted, how the community responds and the feedback we receive, before deciding whether to repeat or extend the program in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 The Application Process
 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Applications must be submitted via the <a href="https://zcashgrants.org/submit">ZF grants platform</a>, and applicants must agree to sign ZF’s <a href="https://zfnd.org/terms-and-conditions/">grant agreement</a>, and undergo <a href="https://zfnd.org/aml-kyc-requirements/">the ZF KYC process</a> if their application is successful.&nbsp;</p><p>The deadline to submit a grant application is 09:00 UTC on Monday 20th March.&nbsp;</p><p>ZF will review all applications, and will reject any grant applications that are deemed unsuitable (see the FAQs section below for examples of why ZF may judge a grant application to be unsuitable under this program). Suitable applications will then be submitted to a poll of ZCAP to determine which should be funded. Applicants who are members of ZCAP will not be eligible to participate in this poll.&nbsp;</p><p>We aim to publish the list of suitable grant applications, and open the ZCAP poll by 3rd April. The ZCAP poll will remain open for approximately two weeks, and we hope to announce the results on 17th April.&nbsp;</p><p>As this is the first time we are running this program, we don’t really know what to expect, so&nbsp; this timeline may be subject to change. We will try to keep applicants and the community apprised of any changes or delays.&nbsp;</p><p>To be eligible for funding, a grant application must receive greater than 50% approval from the participants in the ZCAP poll. Eligible grants will then be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget permits. There will be no partial funding of grants.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>What is the Zcash Foundation’s mission?<br>Our mission at the Zcash Foundation is to build financial privacy infrastructure for the public good, by helping sustain and improve open financial networks that allow anyone and everyone to protect their own privacy, on their own terms. While our primary focus is the Zcash protocol and blockchain, we also support broader applications of zero knowledge proofs, as well as other approaches to financial privacy.</p><p>Do grant applications have to be Zcash-related? <br>No. Any grant that aligns with the Zcash Foundation’s mission is suitable for the Minor Grants program.</p><p>Do grant applications have to be Zcash-related? <br>No. Any grant that aligns with the Zcash Foundation’s mission is suitable for the Minor Grants program.</p><p>Under what circumstances would ZF reject a grant application as unsuitable?<br>Here are some examples of why ZF may reject a grant application:</p>  The grant’s purpose is not congruent with the Foundation’s mission.  The grant does not, in our estimation, represent value for money.  We have reason to believe that the applicant is not capable of delivering on the grant.  The purpose of the grant would violate U.S. law or contravene the Zcash Foundation’s obligations under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">U.S. IRS 501(c)(3)</a>.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can applicants remain pseudonymous?<br>Applicants can keep their identity private but they must undergo the ZF KYC process if their application is successful, which includes disclosing and verifying their identity to ZF.</p><p>Where is the funding for this program coming from?<br>This program is being funded by the Zcash Foundation, from its slice of the Dev Fund.</p><p>My application to the ZCG program was rejected.

<p>This is the first in what I hope will be a series of conversations where Jason Bosch, Leo Saraceno, and I share some of our research around Web3, the environment, complex systems, community governance, and ritualized behaviors. In this two-hour chat Leo talks about his new article, “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/02/11/natural-asset-managers-how-decentralized-ledger-technology-will-drive-the-ecosystem-services-sector/">Natural Asset Managers – How Decentralized Technology Will Drive the Ecosystem Services Sector</a>,” I discuss my new series “God’s Eye View,” and the three of us dissect an 8-minute clip about a cooperative extended reality “game” where players upload ecological data to a “Tree of Life” DAO in order to help it gain sentience. Embedded within the game is a governance structure for managing “the commons,” of the digital “park” in which the “tree” is located through proposals and voting tokens weighted to reflect individual contributions to the project. The game was pitched by Curve Labs and Weeve, based in Berlin, and leaders in framing out Web3 “regenerative finance” infrastructure. You can read more about the game in this 2021 medium post, “<a href="https://medium.com/@sovnature/introducing-interspecies-games-bfdf667009e1">Introducing: Interspecies Game</a>.” Jason and I did a live Q&amp;A for about a half hour at the conclusion of the streamed pre-recorded discussion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The clip is below if you’d like to rewatch it. I’ve transcribed the wording from the introduction, because it’s packed with evocative language and concepts.</p>
<p>“Thanks for having us. A little disclaimer on my side. Interspecies Game is a fuse between Curve Labs (<a href="https://www.curvelabs.eu/">We Make Digital Souls</a>) and Weeve (<a href="https://www.weeve.network/">Value from IoT Data</a>), so our presentation is going to be at hyper-speed. A little forgiveness for that. At Interspecies Game we think that financializing or tokenizing nature is not a sufficient enabler for sovereignty. On the contrary, this approach risks the creation of new algorithms of extraction. Thus, we think agency must be embedded in the Internet relationality of species and their environment.</p>
<p>We propose playing into existence a new paradigm of a networked agency of interspecies context. Nature doesn’t need our charity. We need more robust and convivial forms of engagement to create new relations of solidarity between humans and nature that would foster interspecies engagement and coordination towards the realization of a not-only-human regenerative economy. How to activate a new “we,” a new collective consciousness that allows us to summon and perpetuates interspecies agency. We want to move from an atomized feeling of charity as the modus-operandi of impact towards a relational one where the transformation happens at the edges unleashing viral (spiral?) dynamics.</p>
<p>Our approach draws on the theory of social choice as apposed to classical game theory, from node-oriented systems to edge-oriented systems as we try to articulate peer influence as a multi-species paradigm. We seek to reformulate human nature, false dichotomy through play forms, leveraging automated logic and game mechanics facilitating engagement around resource accumulation and collective allocation. To introduce our game a little bit – the main game mechanic rests around the idea the “Tree of Life,” an embodiment of the spirit of the park in this case the (fox spike?) spirit sign, which coordinates the narratives and the user flows around the park.</p>
<p>The tree has two main objectives – to become self-aware through oracular inputs and to enrich its relations with its community. The “Tree of Life” represents the tokenomic agency with an associated Ethereum address owned by a Gnosis safe. The safe is the owner of a spectralized, fractionalized NFT, thus is the beneficiary for the majority of the stake tokens. These tokens enable both access for governance for the resources and also provide incentives for incentivizing the behavior of its community both in terms of facilitating learning and also the betterment of the public space.”</p>

<p>Brave and XBorg combine forces to drive the growth of Web3 esports gaming and provide a platform to showcase Web3 players.</p>
<p>22nd February 2023 - Brave Software, maker of the privacy-preserving Brave browser, has announced a one-year strategic partnership with XBorg, a leading Web3 esports organization. This partnership involves a series of collaborations for gamers and Brave users, which may include, among other things, live community-driven events between the XBorg, gaming and Basic Attention Token (BAT) communities, Basic Attention Token (BAT) gaming and tournament activations, NFT mints, gaming content creation, and tournaments for gamers of all levels.</p>
<p>XBorg boasts the #1 ranked ev.io team, a browser-based FPS multiplayer game. Brave and XBorg will use in-person and online gaming events throughout 2023 to create content that highlights Web3 gaming, esports, and its players. Content to look forward to includes LAN vlogs, game tutorials, and exclusive interviews with XBorg professional players and content creators. The Brave branded XBorg 2023 Pro Kit Jersey will be released in April, and will be available in the SwissBorg online store.</p>
<p>Brave is also the title sponsor for XBorg’s Xtreme Championship Series. The four-month-long, five-game tournament series runs from March 6 until July 23, 2023, and has a dedicated prize pool of $100,000. In addition, the entire series will stream live for viewers on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xborgofficial">XBorg’s official Twitch channel</a>. Tournaments will include BAT activations for users of Brave Wallet and other Web3 wallets.</p>
<p>XBorg is producing a 15-episode docu-series called Becoming A Legend, which will air throughout the tournament on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xborgofficial">XBorg’s YouTube channel</a>. It will feature exclusive interviews with players, team owners, and game developers, as well as matchday highlights and all the behind-the-scenes Xtreme Championship Series drama. Becoming A Legend will shine a light on the backstories and journeys of key Web3 players and games in the industry.</p>
<p>Those interested <a href="https://bit.ly/XCS-Signup">can easily sign up</a> to participate in one—or all five—Xtreme Championship Series games and their monthly qualifiers. Please note that all monthly qualifiers are capped at a certain number of teams/players. Therefore, you are advised to sign up for all three qualifiers at once to guarantee your spot in the tournament and increase your chances of qualifying for the Championship month (each of the 5 games will have 3 monthly qualifiers and then one championship weekend).</p>
<p>Brave and XBorg are excited at the opportunity to combine forces and show a broader audience of users the win-win of combining the leading-edge Web3 gaming browser experience with Brave Wallet and BAT alongside the esports, gaming and media powerhouse team at XBorg. The year-long partnership will provide both Brave and XBorg with room to experiment with BAT and the Brave Wallet to Web3 gaming for a broader audience, with the ease of use of having Web3 built-in with Brave through the multi-chain Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Finally, you can meet other esports enthusiasts and participate in live community events and discussions by joining the #xborg channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord server</a>.</p>

 Secure your crypto — manage your token allowances and choose which DApps can interact with your&nbsp;funds. <p>When was the last time you used a DApp? Chances are, you’ve granted that DApp access to your crypto, possibly even unlimited access. Fear not. Granting token allowances is a common practice in Web3, but it would be wise to consider the potential risks involved.</p><p>Allowing unlimited access to your funds can leave you exposed to anyone looking to exploit vulnerabilities in DApp codes. These hacks can result in unauthorized withdrawals and put your crypto at risk. With the rising number of such security breaches, taking control of your token allowances is another touch of security that won’t hurt. Regularly revoking unnecessary allowances to clear DApp permissions will reduce the possibility of this happening to you and protect your wallet from scams so you can enjoy Web3 with peace of&nbsp;mind.</p> How to revoke token allowances <p>BlockWallet has created a dead-simple process to revoke your token allowances.</p>  Navigate to Settings — Account — Token Allowances  Search for the allowance you wish to revoke by token (ex. USDT, DAI, USDC…) or spender (ex. 1Inch, LiFi, Uniswap…). You may group allowances by spender or token to revoke a specific group of allowances.  Click Revoke next to the allowance you wish to&nbsp;revoke.  Confirm the allowance transaction, which resets the token allowance to zero&nbsp;(0).  Please note that each allowance revoke requires a gas&nbsp;fee.  <p>For those looking to revoke all of their token allowances quickly, use Revoke All. This option consecutively revokes all token allowances in your wallet, eliminating the need to revisit the Allowance page for each&nbsp;action.</p><p>To learn more about token allowances and how to use this new feature, visit our guide on <a href="https://bit.ly/bw-release">How to Revoke Token Allowances</a>.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a self-custodial wallet making it easy to secure digital assets, protect identity, and experience Web3. Swap and bridge crypto right on the spot, use BlockWallet with all your favorite blockchain apps and feel what it’s like to use a product built with users in mind.

      Partnering with Replicate: Machine Learning, Simplified        Bringing the ease, speed and quality of traditional developer tools into the world of ML  <p>By Stephanie Zhan</p><p>Published February 21, 2023</p>      



     
	 
		
				
			<p>AI avatars of Ben, Andreas and Stephanie.</p>
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>Five-plus years ago, I sat next to my friend Andrej Karpathy as he published the blog post “<a href="https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35">Software 2.0</a>.” It was a different time in machine learning—we were using Nvidia V100s, and the open source and foundation models we see today were nascent. The level of tooling we had long been used to in traditional software was also absent from the world of machine learning: where were the GitHub, Vercel, Docker equivalents? As Andrej described in his post:</p>



<p>“In particular, we’ve built up a vast amount of tooling that assists humans in writing 1.0 code, such as powerful IDEs with features like syntax highlighting, debuggers, profilers, go to def, git integration, etc. In the 2.0 stack, the programming is done by accumulating, massaging and cleaning datasets. … Who is going to develop the first Software 2.0 IDEs, which help with all of the workflows in accumulating, visualizing, cleaning, labeling, and sourcing datasets? … Github is a very successful home for Software 1.0 code. Is there space for a Software 2.0 Github? In this case repositories are datasets and commits are made up of additions and edits of the labels. Traditional package managers and related serving infrastructure like pip, conda, docker, etc. help us more easily deploy and compose binaries. How do we effectively deploy, share, import and work with Software 2.0 binaries?”</p>



<p>I met <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> co-founders Ben Firshman and Andreas Jansson a few years later. They were the creators of arXiv Vanity, which turned scientific papers into responsive web pages—a nifty product I was grateful for.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We talked about Andreas’ frustration with the problem of deploying machine learning models to production while at Spotify, which, as <a href="https://replicate.com/blog/machine-learning-is-just-software">Ben describes</a>, required extensive collaboration between researchers and engineering—including deciding on an API, getting a server written, packaging up the dependencies, getting it hooked up to a GPU and running efficiently. To solve this pain point, Andreas built a set of tools and templates that let researchers package up and deploy models themselves.</p>



<p>Ben came from the world of developer tools. Most notably, he’d built the product that eventually became Docker Compose. He understood the quality of developer tools we were used to in the world of software development, and the opportunity to bring that to the world of machine learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a thesis we at Sequoia loved and believed in deeply, and we quickly started working with Ben and Andreas, leading Replicate’s seed round and building on our shared dream of what we believed the world could look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Replicate provides an easy, fast way for anyone to run generative AI models in the cloud. Instead of battling with GPUs and keeping expensive AWS instances switched on, developers can deploy with just one line of code—in the cloud, billed by the second. And in addition to curating the best models from the open-source ecosystem, the platform allows companies to run their own custom models, which Replicate automatically packages, optimizes and deploys—shrinking the process from weeks to minutes and reducing the need for an infrastructure team’s help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been so fun to see the variety of ways developers use Replicate. Character.AI leverages DreamBooth to enhance the conversations people have with characters on their platform, while Vercel uses Replicate for its <a href="https://vercel.com/templates/ai">AI Templates</a>. As the use cases shared on the team’s <a href="https://twitter.com/replicatehq">Twitter feed</a> shows, the ecosystem is burgeoning with creativity.<br></p>



<p>We are delighted to deepen our partnership with Ben and Andreas through this Series A round and to support the team’s <a href="https://replicate.com/about">continued growth</a>. AI is the most important theme of the next decade—driven by the scale of data, new technological breakthroughs in generative models and advancements in compute—and as the infrastructure stack of this Software 2.0 world is written, we believe Replicate will play a fundamental role. We could not be more excited to build this future together!</p>

      Partnering with TipLink: Seamless Cryptocurrency Sharing for Web3        Ian, Aashiq and their team are making it easy to send cryptocurrency to anyone, even if they don’t have a wallet.  <p>By Dan Chen and Shaun Maguire</p><p>Published February 21, 2023</p>      



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>When we were first introduced to <a href="https://tiplink.io/">TipLink</a> as a new form factor for sending payments, we were intrigued—but hesitant. In the wake of Arthur0x being spearfished and losing his Azukis, we were concerned that hyperlinks might be an anti-pattern, and we knew there was a history of experimentation around tipping in crypto that didn’t quite pan out (anyone remember ChangeTip?). Fortunately for us, though, co-founders Ian Krotinsky and Aashiq Dheeraj were persistent. They had thought deeply about potential attack vectors and other areas of tail risk, and they were onto something.</p>



<p>So after a bit of email and Telegram tag, we set up an initial call. We peppered them with questions around crypto OpSec, and they listened politely as we likely bored them to death with stories from the MyEtherWallet days. Then some time later, they followed up with a life update: they’d given notice at Citadel and taken the plunge to work on TipLink full time.</p>



<p>We quickly set up a second meeting—and as soon as we saw their demo, any remaining skepticism vanished.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By tying cryptocurrency to a simple link—bought and shared with just a couple of clicks, even if the recipient doesn’t already have a wallet—TipLink dramatically reduces the coordination required for payments. Information is stored within the URL, making the link itself the wallet—and ensuring it can be shared on any platform with only the sender knowing the key. It’s a fundamental shift, from pull (“send me your wallet address/SNS”) to push (“here’s a link”). Forget the notoriously clunky fiat on-ramping process; suddenly, all you need to join the world of web3 is a friend who owns crypto.</p>



<p>The viral potential of the idea was immediately obvious, and we became convinced that TipLink had a good shot at being the product that would bring the next billion people to web3. It was one of those conversations where the design space seemed to open up the more we talked, with potential use cases ranging from NFT drops and airdrops to physical and digital scavenger hunts to gift cards, just to name a few.</p>



<p>But even more important than the product or its possible applications are Ian and Aashiq themselves. They’ve impressed us with their hustle, tenacity and high clock speed, leading the team to move quickly on projects such as the recent launch of TipLink’s API. We are wowed by the depth with which they think about edge cases and security implications. And their passion and energy are infectious. With this round of seed funding co-led by Sequoia and Multicoin, we are excited to partner with TipLink as they build the future of crypto peer-to-peer payments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A library without books is an oxymoron” proclaimed a wise elder at the Northern Vermont University, (NVU) Lyndonville campus this past Friday. NVU hosted an open forum after the overwhelmingly negative community response to the Vermont State University’s controversial decision to shift libraries to “all-digital.” NVU Provost Nolan Atkins, Vermont State University’s (VSU) President Parwinder Grewal, and Vice President of Admissions Maurice Ouimet were present to listen to the concerns of the attendees who came to stand up, push back and ensure their voices were heard regarding this shocking announcement. The consensus was unanimous – this was unacceptable. Both faculty and staff unions issued a vote of “no confidence.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speeches at NVU on Friday covered many legitimate concerns- censorship, students’ needs for guidance from librarians and human interaction with material, engaged staff and a dedicated space. With strong emotions, students voiced their need for hands on books, valid information, and librarians. Issues related to the health detriments of excessive screen time and student’s documented disabilities due to this were also part of the conversation – What is a university without a library? – was the burning question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The themes conveyed by faculty, staff, students and community members centered around broken trust and lack of communication, compassion and integrity. Many have been working tirelessly in committees to ensure a smooth transition towards an end product that serves all involved. It has been a bumpy road and this announcement to move to an “all-digital” library shattered any hope and trust that had been built through this VSU transformation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This unprecedented move has stirred up valid conflict of interest questions regarding the role of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vsc.edu/board-of-trustees/members-committees/#Cluver">Megan Cluver</a>, Vermont State College System’s (VSCS) current Vice Chair and Chair of the Education, Personnel and Student Life Committee. Megan Cluver is also a senior manager at&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/profiles/mcluver.html">Deloitte</a>. She has worked with the Deloitte Higher Education Team for over fifteen years assisting universities with their transformation efforts. This fact has been rumbling and whispered in the background. With the recent announcement of an “all-digital” library, Cluver’s Deloitte connection has surfaced and questions regarding her influence and intentions on this decision now demand full attention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/jp/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/audit/audit.html">Deloitte</a>&nbsp;Touche Tohmatsu Limited’s&nbsp;<a href="https://littlesis.org/org/146938-Deloitte_Touche_Tohmatsu">(2)</a>&nbsp;main headquarters are in London, England.

<p>On their website, Deloitte shares their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/story/purpose-values.html?icid=top_purpose-values">purpose:</a></p>

<p>Specifically on their&nbsp;<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/tr/en/pages/technology/solutions/deloitte-digital.html">Deloitte Digital</a>&nbsp;– Bring your business to its next level of digital maturity – website page, It states,</p>

<p>Megan Cluver is a high ranking Deloitte consultant with access to a wide variety of Deloitte’s digital services. This coupled with the fact that Cluver is also working in an influential position on the VSCS board has raised red flags for many. Questions related to the intention behind the hybrid university and “all-digital” library decisions, who will host the platforms and if it will actually serve the students and community are at the forefront. Based on the high level of petition signatures, rallies and push back across the state – many agree it will not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question relating to integrity involves a&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xigJ27Y24p4">YouTube video</a> entitled,The Future of Hybrid U- Meeting the Needs of NKUs Students in a Hybrid Environment. This video was moderated by Dr. Ashish Vaidya, President of Northern Kentucky University and recorded on November 18, 2021. Cluver took part in this panel discussion as a Deloitte representative, national leader in higher education, and a VSCS board member.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The concept of the hybrid university was brewing at Deloitte in the summer of 2020. Conversations about “how we could take advantage of some of these emergency measures for long term good?”&nbsp;surfaced in this video which was utilized to promote the hybrid university model to colleges and organizations. What has many concerned was the fact that at the time of this video, the hybrid model for VSU had not yet emerged. Faculty and staff were informed that the hybrid university model was developed from surveys and conversations with Vermont stakeholders.</p>
<p>Was there an existing plan in place and to what degree is Megan or her work with Deloitte influencing the VSCS decision regarding the development of the hybrid model and the future of education in Vermont?&nbsp; At this time, these are the questions needing scrutiny as many seek to ensure that sound policy, serving students and a well-rounded and sustainable educational model are the priorities of the decision making process for the future of VSU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this video, Megan emphasizes the significance of students, specifically stating:</p>
<p>“I think what is most important to think about here is really to come back to the student at the center…. How does the student perceive and want to experience a hybrid student campus and that’s different than how faculty may want to perceive it or what parent’s may have as a perspective. So those different stakeholders are all important in the conversation but you need to identify who the most important stakeholder is and I would posit that that truly is the student.”</p>
<p>Based on this statement and after witnessing the reaction from students regarding the “all-digital” library. Many hold hope that their needs and opinions will be taken into account as the decision is revisited. On Friday, President Grewal stated a regroup would happen after input was gathered from the open forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the 2022 Educause conference in Denver, CO, Megan Cluver took part in the “Tech Roles and the Future of Work” session. As reported in&nbsp;<a href="https://edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2022/10/educause-2022-panelists-explore-evolving-tech-roles-and-future-work">EdTech Magazine</a>,&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Cluver suggested thinking about the future of work in three parts: work, workplace and workforce. –When considering the work itself, determine what tasks will be performed by machines versus humans. How can technology help in fulfilling the overall mission? Are their instances where tasks can be automated to lessen the burden on workers? Cluver said this could be seen as a shift from a “build” culture” to a “buy” culture where software applications are outsourced to vendors.”</p>
<p>This could easily equate to a loss of human interaction, human connection and jobs. This thought process also raises the question of workforce development versus education. There is clearly a role for both but they are significantly different, -it is apparent that the VSU community is demanding education, that is actually why many attend a university.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cluver also stated, “We’re thinking about the requirements for skills versus the requirements for degrees, and whether those skill requirements are evolving as the role of IT teams is evolving over time…” Options within these realms would be ideal. There is an international trend towards unpacking education and gaining skills and badges for lifelong learning instead of a well-rounded, traditional education. Training a corporate workforce is not education. Ensuring options and classical education for students will be an essential task for educators and administration moving forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Cluver’s association with Deloitte and their digital services and hybrid university model have led to questions relating to integrity and trust and the resulting need to ensure that all are acting in good faith and for the benefit of the VSCS community. Many acknowledge that technology and digital services are tools that can serve but they are limited in their capacity to offer a well-rounded education. Situations exist in which educational experiences are compromised with digital technologies. The VSU team is at a crossroads and faces pivotal decisions about what types of technology and to what extent technology should play a role in their new model. The VSU community is clearly demanding conversation and active participation in this decision.&nbsp;</p>

They hold partnerships with companies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180928005078/en/Ultimate-Software-Forms-Strategic-Alliance-with-Deloitte-Canada-to-Service-North-America">Ultimate Software</a>&nbsp;(Nasdaq:ULTI), a leader in human capital markets. Urgent questions and concerns exist regarding these ethically, controversial tech services. The predatory possibilities of these highly unregulated, financially profitable technologies have many on high alert. As the hybrid model university based on digitalization evolves and brings with it a need for tools and services, awareness that these may compromise education, human rights, jobs and experiences versus enhancing them is paramount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital services require data, the most sought after ‘commodity’ at this time. Human data is an infinite, extractive resource and with a growing data economy comes a wild-west, type charge for companies and institutions to gain access to data and control over user platforms and dashboards which manage and gather this highly valuable data “commodity”. The technological and financial possibilities related to data are exponentially growing and the demand has forced many to seek the supply in all ways possible – including ethically questionable means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hybrid universities require significant digital services and technologies in order to function and operate effectively. These are often sourced out, and whether Deloitte or their strategic partners will provide these services is a key question on the table. Many are examining the integrity around the “all-digital” library decision and demanding a thorough assessment of repercussions, which many claim did not include their input. Trends should not be the defining factor in such a far reaching and impactful decision. Trends come and go, but a good education is forever. – A comprehensive analysis, honest conversations and transparency for all involved is necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are passionately and fiercely communicating their human rights and needs to interact with each other with real books in real places. They are seeking real education in the real world. Digital technology in its many forms is a tool that can augment the learning experience and access but it is very apparently not the world that students want to fully immerse themselves in for their educational and life experiences. Human connection, real books and real education are at the forefront of the message here, people are choosing reality, humanity and wisdom. Vermont State University would be wise to listen to the students, staff, faculty and community members. As the transient technology trends push out the human aspect of education, VSU would attract more students who seek human connectIon, balance and books.&nbsp;</p>

Compare that to an average growth rate of just 8% for fiat U.S. Dollars over the same period and the growing importance to global commerce of digital currencies becomes clear.&nbsp;</p>

 Unleash the Power of Verus — Technological Showcase of Centrally-Issued Token Fully Backed by&nbsp;Gold  In this article, we showcase how to launch a centrally controlled token with minting and burning capabilities, fully backed by gold. We use the innovative Verus blockchain technology with its versatile currency launches, which can be used both for centralized and decentralized projects. And we don’t even need to code anything! <p>📝 Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which already has the functionalities that the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) will bring to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.6-1">Download here</a> 🔗 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.</p> Fictional Company “Very Good&nbsp;Gold” <p>In this technological showcase, we have a fictional company that is an issuer of a centralized token with 1:1 backing of gold. With a starting supply of 0. The issuer of this token has full control of minting and burning capabilities.</p><p>The mint and burn process however needs to be approved by two signers, making sure one entity doesn’t have full control. For this example we use a 2 of 2 signature setup. Any signature setup is possible (with a maximum of 13 of 25), depending on different use&nbsp;cases.</p> Defining a&nbsp;Currency <p>Defining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">learn how to export a currency as an ERC-20 to Ethereum</a> 🔗). Let’s get&nbsp;started.</p> VerusID Namespace <p>Before defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID VGG@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-blockchain we create a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>VerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>We also said to have a 2 of 2 signature setup. This means the identity is controlled by two primary addresses, with always two signatures needed to do any action (like launching the currency, minting, burning and sending).</p> Defining the&nbsp;currency <p>Defining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency on. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains’ native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.</p><p>With a few simple commands, we&nbsp;will:</p>  Define the&nbsp;currency  Have it signed by a second signature  Launch the&nbsp;currency  <p>Before starting we must fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency. The chain definition is as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{<br>  "name":"VGG", <br>  "options":32, <br>  "proofprotocol":2<br>}' <p>It’s a simple chain definition, with only “options”:32 (= the currency is just a token), and “proofprotocol”:2 (= the controller of the VerusID where the currency is launched from can mint and burn tokens at&nbsp;will).</p><p>These are some options and specifications that are possible when launching a currency: as a simple token, as fractional reserve currency or multi-reserve basket, start &amp; end block, min. &amp; max. preconversions, initial contributions, pre-launch discount &amp; carveout, initial supply and much&nbsp;more.</p><p>⭐ To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/">go here</a> 🔗 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The community is happy to help on Discord</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Approving and launching the&nbsp;currency <p>Now, the second signer needs to come in and sign off on the currency definition, and launch the currency.</p><p>The command from before gives out a HEX. The second signer needs to sign this HEX as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST signrawtransaction "hex" <p>This gives out another HEX. We use it to submit the transaction to the chain, which in turn launches the currency.</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "hex" <p>After doing the command above, it takes around 15 blocks before the currency is officially launched on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Next step is the minting and burning of tokens, according to how much gold the company has in&nbsp;custody.</p> Minting and&nbsp;burning <p>Say a customer put 10,000 ounces of gold into the custody of the company. Now let’s make sure the customer gets that amount of VGG into their&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>We mint 10,000 VGG with this simple&nbsp;command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "VGG@" '[{<br>  "address":"Customer1@", <br>  "currency":"VGG", <br>  "mintnew":1, <br>  "amount":10000<br>}]' <p>VGG@ is the change-address, Customer1@ is the address where the 10,000 VGG are minted&nbsp;to.</p><p>The second signer needs to do signrawtransaction and sendrawtransaction, as we have done before, to actually mint the tokens into Customer1@.</p><p>Now, if someone wants to redeem their VGG for gold again, we need to be able to burn that amount from the supply of VGG. We burn with the following command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "VGG@" '[{<br>  "address":"VGG@", <br>  "currency": "VGG", <br>  "amount": 5000, <br>  "burn":true<br>}]'  <p>To make it happen, the second signer needs to sign off on it&nbsp;again.</p><p>If we want to check to see the supply of the currency, we can do the following command:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrency “vgg”  Use VGG in Many&nbsp;Ways <p>This article showcased a simple example of how a business can function using the Verus protocol. What we can do with the network goes far beyond what is possible using current blockchain protocols. And all of that without any programming needed!</p><p>We can also easily export the VGG token to Ethereum as an ERC-20. It can also become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM (automated market maker) as part of Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Anybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes VGG as a reserve with weighted percentage (10–90%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.</p><p>A multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>👀 Stay tuned for more examples, or start reading <a href="http://docs.verus.io/">docs.verus.io</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join the Discord to&nbsp;learn</a>.</p><p>🫡 Credits for the article go to community member ‘ejuliano’.</p><p>➡️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Explore with the community on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/unleash-the-power-of-verus-technological-showcase-of-centrally-issued-token-fully-backed-by-gold-dcc9fae7ca0f">Unleash the Power of Verus — Technological Showcase of Centrally-Issued Token Fully Backed by Gold</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Please bear with me if this post seems a bit more rambling than usual. I’ve been trying to process a lot of ideas bubbling up and it’s been a challenge to pin them down. I don’t know that I did a great job of it, but I need to move on. All of this is still simmering on the back burner. I welcome your thoughts in the comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the FTX debacle blew up last fall I’d already left social media. Knowing public drama is generally a strategic spectacle, I didn’t look into Sam Bankman-Fried at the time. I viewed him as an expendable young guy who’d been tapped to advance the plot. How did Alameda and FTX gain that much traction in the first place? He was wet behind the ears, didn’t even have a PhD – which seems to be a prerequisite for elite quant jobs. Bankman-Fried’s very public fall was a necessary step in a larger campaign to steer public perception of distributed ledger technology away from its largely crypto-centric identity, one intentionally steeped in greed, speculation, and blatant corruption. In these smoking ruins, blockchain could then get a makeover as a “neutral” tool that could be productively repurposed to advance the “public good” and digital “democracy.” </p>
<p>Raul’s <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/">article</a> pointed out the link between FTX and online poker fraud via lawyer<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-ftx-chief-lawyer-claims-us-legal-counsel-channeled-business-to-s-c"> Daniel Friedberg</a>. I then discovered<a href="https://tokenist.com/alameda-research-and-terra-backed-privacy-protocol-was-vulnerable-to-user-data-exploit/"> Alameda Research</a> had backed The Secret Network’s private smart contract roll out, making it just a few steps removed from the Ultimate Bet by way of Iovation’s fraud monitoring software and Intel Capital. Flaws in Intel’s hardware had left The Secret Networks’ data open to decryption. The opportunity to secure a “god’s eye view” in poker or in futures trading, games defined by information asymmetry, is a terrible temptation. The value of data as “the new oil” isn’t simply as a commodity that can be used to generate profit. The importance of data is to secure a tactical advantage over your competition in the big game of life.</p>

<p>It was Bankman-Fried’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-bankman-fried-8367a346/?originalSubdomain=bs">LinkedIn profile</a> that brought me to elusive Pennsylvania billionaire Jeff Yass and Susquehanna Investment Group’s arbitrage prowess. Sam’s first job out of MIT was at<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/81811f27-4a8f-4941-99b3-2762cae76542"> Jane Street</a>, another low-profile market-making firm that handles billions in Exchange Traded Funds each day. The firm was started in 1999 with staff from Susquehanna; its founders were trained on high-level applied mathematics and many, many rounds of poker at SIG’s casino-grade poker tables.</p>
<p>After Jane Street, but before starting Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried worked for two months as Director of Development for the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Effective_Altruism"> Centre for Effective Altruism</a>, an Oxford-based think-tank/charity started in 2012 by philosophers William MacAskill and Toby Ord. Bankman-Fried’s embrace of data-driven “charity” was spotlighted by the mainstream media. Surely that agenda will continue to advance, along with universal basic income, digital citizenship, and token engineering.&nbsp; In reality, it’s about installing the policy, financial, and sensor infrastructure needed to catalyze post-Moore’s-law computing. Distributed ledger technology has always been meant to function as a “decentralized” steering wheel, guiding (and harvesting) the “wisdom of crowds.”&nbsp;</p>

Not only is he a fellow at the Future of Humanity Institute, Drexler is also an <a href="https://www.governance.ai/people">advisor</a> to the Centre for the Governance of AI and an <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/people/eric-drexler">affiliate</a> of the Centre for Effective Altruism. </p>
<p>It was Drexler who first proposed a “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/grey-goo">grey goo</a>” scenario in which self-replicating robots take over the world through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecophagy#:~:text=Ecophagy%20is%20a%20term%20coined,involving%20molecular%20nanotechnology%20gone%20awry.">ecophagy</a>, a theme featured in a Super Bowl advertisement featuring “<a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/white-noise-movie-review-2022">White Noise</a>” star, Adam Driver. In this case Squarespace replaced “robots making robots making robots” with “websites making websites making websites.” Midway through the ad, a vortex is opened up by the Singularity, sucking in all but the original Driver who is left standing in the desert in a torn suit. The sequence calls to mind the centerpiece of the film “<a href="https://www.scoutmag.ph/71920/the-philosophy-of-the-everything-bagel-from-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>,” the black vortex everything bagel. Then of course you’ve got the East Palestine derailment mirroring “White Noise’s” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/11/health/ohio-train-derailment-white-noise/index.html">plot line</a> – an airborne toxic event where several residents of the town had actually been extras in the film. Extras whose last name is part of the title of one of DeLillo’s early, most inscrutable works, about high level mathematics and astronomy – “<a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/don-delillo/ratners-star/">Ratner’s Star</a>.” What are they trying to tell us?</p>
<p>Drexler, with his first wife Christine Peterson and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._Bennett">James Bennett</a>, founded the <a href="https://foresight.org/">Foresight Institute</a> in 1986 based in San Francisco. Many early members had ties to L5, an effort to promote space colonization in the 1970s. Foresight was created to focus on molecular manufacturing but is now working in the <a href="https://foresight.org/">areas</a> of “intelligent cooperation,” neurotechnology, longevity, and health extension.</p>

<p>One of Eric Drexler’s recent projects involved theorizing a new <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Language-for-Intelligent-Machines-A-Prospectus.pdf">vector and graph language</a> for intelligent machines. In reading Drexler’s paper, I remembered that in the first chapter of Oliver Reiser’s “World Sensorium,” he lays out the need for a new language that will trigger the age of cosmic humanism by creating a “medium which remains invariant for all, so that whosoever choose may read or talk about it.”&nbsp; He continues on page 28: “The job is to find a layout, a picture basis, so simple and so huge that is it seeable by anyone who has mastered the movies or can punch a radio panel.” The ideal language would be “in psycho-social motion for spiritual traveling” and would “shrink all knowledge so that it can be put on an all-history, all-world basis for invariant transfer across social wholes.” Such a language, Reiser thought, would bring about global unification and a planetary democracy through “language-logic” emancipation. He then suggests that musical composition may be the starting point for a means of communication that lies outside linguistic frameworks, citing Pythagoras’s music of the spheres on page 30: “this method not only has wide applications in electricity, but as will some day appear, has possibilities of development through the treatment of electromagnetic fields of force at work in biological and other super-physical systems.” </p>

<p>Note the feature image for this post, the logo of the Centre for Effective Altruism, is a heart confined within a lightbulb – an energetic pulse contained within an artificial field. For more insights into this I recommend Stephers’s posts “<a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/2020/06/10/getting-to-the-heart-of-the-social-distancing-matter/">Getting to the Heart of the Social Distancing Matter</a>” and “<a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/2021/05/13/part-9-tuned-in-a-mothers-intuition-on-transmission-from-the-jabbed-to-the-un-jabbed/">Tuned In – A Mother’s Intuition on Transmission from the Jabbed to the Un-Jabbed</a>.” I believe Reiser was onto something with energetic entrainment as a new form of psychical communication and that Metaverse mesmerists may be in the process of tapping into that potential. Reviewing the history of the <a href="https://www.rebprotocol.net/flanagansneurophone.pdf">Neurophone</a> and reflecting on John Lilly’s research into dolphins, it seems alternative communication systems have been the works for quite some time. I was somewhat stunned to find out that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/xudpharcourt1966/mode/2up">Project Xanadu’s</a>, Ted Nelson and, Macy Conference anthropologist, <a href="https://asc-cybernetics.org/foundations/history/MacySummary.htm">Gregory Bateson</a> were also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONhnEmoSRfk">involved</a> in Lilly’s dolphin work. Bateson’s daughter <a href="https://www.jimruttshow.com/nora-bateson/">Nora</a> is also affiliated with Jim Rutt’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEHDHuTcCvA">Game B</a>.” This article, “<a href="https://academic.oup.com/mq/article/100/2/199/4951391">Music and the Transhuman Ear: Ultrasonics, Material Bodies, and the Limits of Sensation</a>,” shared with me by Stephers may offer some insight into this headspace. What if AI language is actually an acoustic frequency beyond the normal reach of our senses but through engineered prosthetics (visual, audio, bio-fields) we could access information in novel ways that bridge our minds to artificial intelligences. Stanford neuroscientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Eagleman">David Eagleman</a> is actively working on sound to touch sensory substitution and a variety of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1lqFXHvqI&amp;t=87s">technologies</a> to extend our ability to “sense” frequencies beyond the reach of our innate biological equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I imagine this is not unlike the synesthesia or heightened awareness experienced in altered states of consciousness. It recalls the AI character “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_(Ender%27s_Game)">Jane</a>” from Orson Scott Card’s “Enderverse” world who “speaks” to Ender’s mind through a jewel in his ear – a sensory prosthetic. A “hearing aid” but not in the traditional sense. It is darkly humorous that in the plot line Jane emerged from the Enderverse’s equivalent of the internet, manifested by the Hive Queen (eusociality) to be a mental bridge to the boy soldier. She then became Ender’s “investment manager” and close confidant. I bet Jane would be a formidable poker opponent.</p>
<p>So, a new language that exists outside current constructs, perhaps outside biology itself…through which agents in the game can access all knowledge across time…and that may incorporate electro-magnetic principles to prepare society for spiritual traveling. That’s quite an ambitious program. Drexler’s project may not be shooting quite that high, and yet his proposed vector-graph exchanges are something I need to mull over. I recently presented on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsQGag36nb8">Rihanna’s halftime Super Bowl performance</a> where pheromones were prominently featured. Could such a “language” be like a musical <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Multi-agent-Physical-A%E2%88%97-with-Large-Pheromones-.pdf">pheromone</a> represented through graphical annotation?</p>

<p>We know there is considerable interest in the scientific community to digitize taste and smell for Metaverse experiences and to use technology to tweak our sensory experiences like “<a href="https://www.freethink.com/hard-tech/haptic-suit">hearing</a>” through haptics. I didn’t mention it in my halftime show analysis, but the fact Justina Miles’s sign-language interpretation of Rihanna’s performance <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/12/meet-justina-miles-rihannas-super-bowl-halftime-show-asl-performer.html">went viral</a> seems to me to indicate the importance of acoustics to extended reality. Maybe our current conception of how we “hear” is being taken in a new direction? Jim Sorenson is a key figure is social impact finance who has played an <a href="https://epicvc.com/team/jim-sorenson/">active role in the deaf community for many years</a>. One of his companies, <a href="https://sorenson.com/">Sorenson Communication</a>, is a global leader in providing closed captions for video calls and sign language services for video conferencing. Ten Sorenson employees were involved in an <a href="https://www.fox7austin.com/news/sorenson-communications-employees-injured-in-barton-springs-road-crash">unusual sidewalk / pedestrian car crash next to a food truck</a> while attending the <a href="https://deafnation.com/expo/austin/">DeafNation Expo</a> in Austin last April. I’ve been curious about Second Life’s Philip Rosedale moving into spatial audio at <a href="https://www.highfidelity.com/blog/author/philip-rosedale">High Fidelity</a>, before coming back to his work in virtual world building. Rosedale seems to be <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9676346">very cozy with IEEE</a>. I’m also thinking about Jordan Hall, a leader in Game B with an interest in blockchain and stigmergy, and his <a href="https://greenpill.substack.com/p/6-building-new-civilizations-with">early success with MP3</a>, digital music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Reiser’s universal communication were realized, would we be able to understand it directly? Perhaps due to their complexity, advanced concepts would need to be relayed to us through an interpreter, an AI personal assistant. I’m thinking of the AI <a href="https://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/impact/f93/students/tracy/tracy_midterm.html">librarian character</a> in Neal Stephenson’s “Snowcrash” novel (the first use of the term Metaverse) who teaches Hiro Protagonist about Sumerian nam shubs, speech with magical force.</p>
<p>Drexler’s proposed new language is an outgrowth of the pattern-seeking behaviors undertaken by machine “intelligence” as it roams the vast quantities of data generated by fourth industrial revolution sensor technology. This paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sensing-the-future-of-bio-informational-engineering.pdf">Sensing the Future of Bioinformational Engineering</a>,” shared with me by Stephers, is shocking in its out-in-the-open plans to transform biology using light and electrical signaling from a distance. Targets include humans, crops, even entire ecosystems! Now consider how much real time data this will generate. Of course “intelligent” machines are going to need to share information at levels beyond the comprehension of human minds. </p>
<p>The “Internet of Biological Things” (see lower screenshot) isn’t just about sensing, but sensing with a purpose. These sensors will ultimately be connected to actuators with the power to alter objects and agents being “sensed.”&nbsp; <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sensing-the-future-of-bio-informational-engineering.pdf"></a></p>

<p>Sensor networks are being installed across the globe, a networked, “outside in,” robotic infrastructure to launch a “regenerative” blockchain finance paradigm. We’re meant to live encased in “green” webs of encrypted data, supposedly to “save the planet.” The seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals give structure to the sensor data, while distributed ledger technologies provide contextual depth through interoperability and metadata tags.</p>
<p>In trying to picture how an “agent” might be incorporated into an “intelligent” machine’s communication, I remembered the gif of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=1Yh5S-S6wsI">Directed Acyclic Graph</a> (DAG) shared with me by <a href="https://gnomes4truth.medium.com/">Sebs Solomon</a> last year. It’s a dynamic, complex form composed of nodes constantly moving outward as new information is added. To me this seems like an accurate representation of “goal-directed” life, a form that could be nudged through cybernetic processes like smart contract logic fed by invisible sensing technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Directed-Acyclic-Graph-GIF-DAG.gif?ssl=1"></a></p>
<p>It seems to me that Drexler, in the spirit of building a noetic, networked “global brain,” may be seeking to go beyond the limitations of human biology and shape a new grammar to underpin programming of matter and “smart” guided evolution. Perhaps the <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9CSemantic%20Web%E2%80%9D%20refers,SPARQL%2C%20OWL%2C%20and%20SKOS.">semantic web</a>, rule sets for managing data, is part of that trajectory? See <a href="https://ahistoryofai.com/semantic-networks/">Ross Quillian’s</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Semantic_Memory/fYozPQAACAAJ?hl=en">work for the US Airforce</a> in the late 1960s around structuring human knowledge in a graphical format that would allow for future inferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me this brings to mind the central conundrum in the movie “<a href="https://www.universityaffairs.ca/opinion/in-my-opinion/arrival-movie-linguistics-saved-world/">Arrival</a>,” how to accurately translate alien Heptapod <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N6HT8hzUCA">logograms</a>. In thinking through this with Stephers today, she mentioned making the connection between the circular communications in the film and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C5%8D">Enso circles</a> created in the Zen tradition of spiritual calligraphy. These free-form brushstrokes could represent wholeness and perfection (closed) or development and movement (open). Zen Buddhism shares a synergy with Daoism, a complementary practice, both emphasizing order and harmony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what if we swap out “Arrival’s” aliens for artificially intelligent machines? What if tokenization of everything on planet Earth wasn’t simply about financialization or making interactions machine-readable? What if the constellations of networked tokens will be a new form of vector-based communication that can only be understood by the machines themselves? Would such a language enable “intelligent machines” to intervene in our lives and the environment through sensor networks, a supreme example of cybernetic “governance.”&nbsp; Would such intervention be used for overt domination? Or would the mechanical conductors embrace subtlety and wield their quasi-linguistic neural representations as covert “spells” we might not even be able to discern?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today I was watching a recently posted talk by Belgian cyberneticist Francis Heyligan at a “<a href="https://humanenergy.io/projects/the-noosphere-and-the-global-brain/">Human Energy</a>” conference held in Berkeley last year that went into considerable detail about his work at the Center Leo Apostel’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070621010349/http://pcp.vub.ac.be/ECCO/">Evolution, Complexity and Cognition Group</a>. The main thrust was around the Noosphere. His work centers complexity theory in emergence and the origins of life through simulation modeling of self-organizing systems. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I think back to Perry Marshall’s <a href="https://perrymarshall.info/">$10 million Evolution 2.0</a> grand challenge. Marshall, a high-powered business consultant from Chicago, is seeking nothing less than to pin down the origins of life. Perry believes that the singularity will not happen until we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y8Z2Hkai7I&amp;t=3s">reimagine what computers are and asserts that humans are not computers.</a> In a 2021 paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biology-transcends-the-limits-of-computation-Perry-Marshall.pdf">Biology Transcends the Limits of Computation,</a>” Perry focuses on the cognitive nature of all life, down to the cell. He elaborates on Michael Levin’s work in bioelectricity and self-organizing systems, including bacterial colonies (biofilms) that use cognition at the cell level to adapt to changing environmental conditions. This occurs through a process called quorum sensing. <a href="https://asm.org/Articles/2020/June/How-Quorum-Sensing-Works">Autoinducers</a> convey messages among cells. Once the chemical messaging hits a certain threshold, action is taken.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I see similarities between this, Futarchy and the push to remake “democracy” for “radical participation” with blockchain identity and tokens. Zooming out to take in the bigger picture, I can’t help but think that planned innovations in voting aren’t a response to populist sentiment, but rather a means by which to invite humans to adopt a bacterial “quorum sensing” model. Transformative governance is not about any particular political movement, but about evolution, eugenics, and sociobiology – applying new fitness landscapes that preference agents conforming to the superorganism, biofilm, ant colony, global brain model. </p>
<p>Tokens represent the equivalent of the bacterial autodinducers engineered to direct activities of the collective towards specified outcomes. Ecologies of local currencies moving about populations of agents may one day act as population level biochemical signals. The end goal? Eusociality, the pinnacle of social organizing according to E.O. Wilson. Through consilience the social sciences will be melded with the hard sciences – sociology run according to the laws of physics. </p>
<p>This clip is from an interview between David Sloan Wilson, an evolutionary biologist retired from SUNY Binghampton and founder of the Human Energy Project, and Josiah Ober a classics professor at Stanford who specializes in the politics of the Athenian city-state and its application to modern governance. The two men open their discussion with the premise of the Athenian city states as cooperating and competing superorganisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>This concept was applied to urban societies in general in an interesting book someone sent my way this week, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Evolutionary-Intelligences-for-the-Human-Hive-Marilyn-Hamilton-2008.pdf">Integral City: Evolutionary Intelligence for the Human Hivemind</a>,” written by Marilyn Hamilton in 2008. It is aligned with Don Beck’s Center for Human Emergence that promotes integral theory and spiral dynamics, a topic we’ll cover later in a discussion of Transpartisan politics. You can see from the entries in the book’s seventh chapter how token signals could bridge the gap between social physics and smart governance within the context of “Limits to Growth” homeostasis.</p>

<p>Last year Ralph Merkle; a leader in public key cryptography, molecular engineering, and cryonics, published “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DAOs-Democracy-and-Governance-Ralph-Merkle.pdf">DAOs, Democracy, and Governance</a>,” in which he proposed a policy infrastructure that would tap the “wisdom of crowds” to create a self-improving society&nbsp; using distributed ledger technology, prediction markets, and voting on public wellbeing. Advisors on the paper listed in his acknowledgements included Nick Bostrom; Vitalik Buterin; Robin Hanson; Robert Freitas; Charles Hoskinson and Melanie Swann. As my friend Jason noted, that’s quite the dinner party.</p>
<p>I think they’re foisting this upon us to create a digital replica of the Earth, a simulation sandbox where they can explore alternative futures and gamify life. The system needs our consent, through our participation in token trading, to transform the Earth into a nature-machine hybrid super-organism. As many were captivated by Bitcoin and NFTs, Soulbound Tokens came on the scene. Could SBTs, used as meta-data tags, become the building blocks of a new language for “intelligent machines?” Natural Language Processing already relies on tokenizing elements of speech; and if the “language” of “the commons” ends up being “living” assemblies of nodes and edges, distributed ledger technology, then we’ll likely see the relationship between FTX billionaires and the effective altruism movement in a whole new light.</p>

<p>An engaging long-form piece published last summer in the New Yorker, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism">The Reluctant Prophet of Effective Altruism</a>,” describes the evolution of William MacAskill, Effective Altruism’s co-founder, from a thoughtful risk-taking Scottish kid into the well-connected leader of what appears to be a techno-utopian cult grounded in scientific charity management undergirded by data analytics and harsh logic. An interesting tidbit in the New Yorker piece, given the gambling focus of this series, is that MacAskill was housemates for a time with<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-kurganov-234402161/?originalSubdomain=uk"> Igor Kurganov</a>, a professional Russian poker player more recently living in Austin who briefly advised<a href="https://highstakesdb.com/news/high-stakes-reports/igor-kurganov-lands-5-9billion-job-with-elon-musk"> Elon Musk’s</a> donor-advised fund. Kurganov and his partner Liv Boeree<a href="https://www.poker.org/igor-kurganov-joins-poker-at-the-lodge-cash-game-stream/"> launched</a> their own “effective altruism” enterprise,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_for_Effective_Giving"> Raising for Effective Giving</a>, in 2014 where poker players agree to donate a percentage of their earnings to specific charities.</p>

<p>MacAskill and Bankman-Fried struck up a friendship while the latter was still in college. MacAskill had shown up to MIT to advise students on ethical life optimization. Growing up, Bankman-Fried’s<a href="https://archive.ph/CJDtx"> parents</a> were Stanford Law faculty who regularly hosted social gatherings where ethics were front and center. He was pretty much raised to be a utilitarian. The premise behind EA (Effective Altruism) is that adherents pledge to make a secular tithe of at least ten percent of their income and direct it to proven charitable ventures. EA culture is defined by competitive donation tracking with adherents eager to point out flaws in the impact metrics associated with the charities of their peers. A sub-plot that bubbled up from the FTX debacle was speculation that Bankman-Fried’s strong desire<a href="https://archive.ph/Z5uV3/again?url=https://fortune.com/2022/11/15/what-is-effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-wealth-career/"> to make a lot of money in order to give it away to worthwhile causes</a> led to lapses in judgment and a sense that their beneficent imperative led the firm to operate outside the law.</p>
<p>I have a different take. I view what happened as a controlled demolition that will, in part, allow social entrepreneurs to continue to advance a version of Effective Altruism with new forms of oversight, shifting towards decentralized governance. A tokenized “commons” waits in the wings. Greedy, crypto-bros and egg-head technocrats are convenient foils for quirky, green-pilled, collectivist token engineers who just want to democratize blockchain and solve poverty and the climate crisis.</p>
<p>I’m envisioning EA’s “<a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/">Giving What We Can</a>” pledge rebooted along the lines of the Gates/Buffett<a href="https://givingpledge.org/about#:~:text=Created%20by%20Warren%20Buffett%2C%20Melinda,generosity%20among%20the%20ultra%2Dwealthy."> Giving Pledge</a> with assets pooled to cover Universal Basic Income payments (GiveDirectly) or “public goods” projects. Picture a pool of matching funds for<a href="https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-brief-history-of-gitcoin-from-2017-2022/9431"> Gitcoin</a>-type grants where winning proposals must demonstrate a broad-base of public support with relatively modest contributions from regular people. Of course, none of this can happen without infusions of concentrated wealth from the billionaire class. If social impact didn’t move the ball forward on the<a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/"> networked state</a> “<a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Manifesto_for_the_Noosphere">world brain</a>” agenda, it wouldn’t happen.</p>

<p>A critique offered by Stanford professor Rob Reich in a 2015 op-ed in the Boston Review tees up my assessment rather nicely:</p>
<p>“Plato identified the best city as that in which philosophers were the rulers. Effective altruists see the best state of affairs, I think, as that in which good-maximizing technocrats are in charge. Perhaps it is possible to call this a politics: technocracy. But this politics is suspicious of, or rejects, the form of politics to which most people attach enormous value: democracy. Would effective altruists attach any independent value to democracy? Given the chance to craft social and political arrangements from scratch, would effective altruists select democratic rather than technocratic rule? I suspect the answer is no, and to that extent, effective altruism is in tension with the commonplace philosophy that identifies democracy as a powerful normative force.”<a href="https://www.bostonreview.net/forum_response/response-rob-reich/"> Source</a></p>
<p>Sure, EA’s misguided approach can be addressed with a big dose of “democracy;” it’s just what the digital commoners ordered. Reich proceeds as if the plan is simply to continue the traditional democratic model as we’ve known for two centuries rather than acknowledge the planned transition to<a href="https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/h-l-ne-landemore"> electronic governance</a> model daily<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531424-500-want-to-make-your-vote-really-count-stick-a-blockchain-on-it/"> tokenized voting “signals</a>” that will eventually be managed by our<a href="https://lab.cccb.org/en/democracia-augmentada/"> digital twin personal assistants</a>.</p>
<p>An example of this trend is democracy.earth founded by<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/santisiri/details/experience/"> Siri Santiago</a> offering “tools for a borderless democracy, for everyone, everywhere.” Santiago is Argentinian game developer turned World Economic Forum global shaper who began working with Ethereum on digital ID “proof of humanity,” DAO education models, and now UBI.

<p>Despite its UK address, the Centre for Effective Altruism incorporated as a<a href="https://eintaxid.com/company/471988398-centre-for-effective-altruism-usa-inc/"> US nonprofit in Berkeley, CA</a> in 2015 and has a large base of support in Silicon Valley. The 2020 990 tax form lists a 2443 Fillmore Street, San Francisco, CA mailing address; twenty-six million in assets (up from twelve and a half million the prior year of which $1.5 million were in donated crypto); four giving areas (animal welfare, global development, EA infrastructure, and the long-term future); five paid staff; and a board of five.</p>
<p>MacAskill was board chair and Max Dalton the president. Dalton, a UK-educated economist, sought to shift EA contributions away from immediate needs around poverty into planning for existential risk, including Generalized Artificial Intelligence, a “<a href="https://twitter.com/eaheadlines/status/1523334494702473216">longtermist</a>” outlook that took precedence after Sam Bankman-Fried’s assets began pouring into the organization.</p>

<p>Sam’s nickname was the<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/sam-bankman-fried#fn26m4ru4vxh4j"> Bentham of crypto</a>. Jeremy Bentham was an eighteenth-century British moral philosopher whose interest in technical poverty management inspired the EA movement. Bentham’s credo was the most happiness for the most people,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus"> felicific calculus</a>. He is considered a founder of modern<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/"> utilitarianism</a>. The concept of measuring utility, or value, has become a central feature of economic modeling and decision theory since von Neumann and Morgenstern introduced the concept of mathematically representing<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem"> utility function</a> for rational agents in a given situation.</p>

<p>The rise of stakeholder capitalism, where behavioral data is linked to social impact finance, has led to a gradual turning away from the primacy of Gross Domestic Product measures to embrace happiness and well-being metrics, as well. It is such measurements promoted by economists like<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/02/05/ace-adverse-childhood-experience-scores-part-of-the-pay-for-success-plan/"> Richard Layard</a>, that justified expansion of mental health services in the UK. Treatments, the type that would generate data, could be scaled if they were measured against productivity that might otherwise be lost to depression or anxiety. A<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jun/21/mentalhealth.socialcare"> 2006 article</a> that I referenced in a<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/02/05/ace-adverse-childhood-experience-scores-part-of-the-pay-for-success-plan/"> 2019 post about ACEs</a> (adverse childhood experiences), likened community mental health centres funded under Layard’s Benthamesque model as “a sort of Ikea for the mind.”<a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/introducing/history/frieze/sir-edwin-chadwick"> Edwin Chadwick</a> worked closely with Bentham. His focus was policies centering public health and sanitation and was among the first to systematically track illness spread in poor communities. He later became an expert in public service franchise contracts. I need to spend more time with, “<a href="https://archive.org/details/economicsofedwin0000ekel/mode/2up">The Economics of Edwin Chadwick: Incentives Matter</a>,” but my intuition says Chadwick and Bentham’s economic frames are about to be applied to token engineering with a<a href="https://cooperative-individualism.org/andelson-robert_critics-of-henry-george-1979-27-neo-georgism-by-robert-v-andelson.pdf"> neo-Georgist</a> (Henry) flair.</p>

<p>The Centre for Effective Altruism cannot be understood outside the context of Bentham’s panopticon and cult of meritocracy. I’m sharing the lengthy excerpt below from a<a href="http://blog.poortheatres.manchester.ac.uk/sinking-stages-jeremy-bentham-and-the-education-of-pauper-children/"> blog post</a> by Jenny Hughes with the University of Manchester theater department, because it brings in the issue of “moral” philosophers co-opting play into the machine. When I hear that Nvidia hopes to attach artificially intelligent assistants to children in order to code imaginary worlds into the Metaverse, it reminds me of the sinking stage. Bentham’s world needed to capture the physical effort of children, while today’s world demands access to their creativity and inner worlds.</p>
<p>There are many, many vulnerable communities being set up as targets for altruistic data harvest, but children – through universal pre-k finance – are on the leading edge. They need our protection.</p>
<p>“Perhaps less well known than the panopticon idea are Bentham’s proposals for the education of pauper children to be carried out in these new pauper panopticons. I found these ideas quite startling – and not at all what I expected...”</p>
<p>“For example, Bentham argues for a pauper management system based on the East India Company – that vanguard of free market capitalism – and here the poor are to be put to work in ‘industry houses’ that are made profitable, primarily, via child labour!“</p>
<p>“When considering the system of education to be developed in the pauper panopticons, Bentham spends some time describing suitable play and athletic activities… Bentham goes on to say that there should be opportunities for running, leaping, dancing, capering – but they must be linked to industry. This might happen via a structure called the ‘sinking stage’, which can be put to use for the purposes of pleasure, productivity and profitability, all in the same moment.”</p>
<p>“Sinking stage, for producing an up-and-down motion by the weight of children. A stage hanging at one end of a beam, with the other end of which is connected the burthen: water (suppose), to be raised by a bucket or by a pump, whether of the lifting or forcing kind. A certain weight pressing upon the stage causes it to sink. Children, each of a known weight, would in a certain number produce the effect. The length of the stage is adapted to the proposed number of the children and runs in a direction transverse to that of the beam: to arrive at the stage they run up an inclined plane. The stage may have two stories: the upper, requiring a longer hill to climb, will be for the older and stronger set of children. It might also, at each story, have two returns, parallel to each other, and at right angles to the first stage: the three together forming three sides of a square. The sport would be to which could first get into his place. Contrivance will of course be requisite to prevent the children from receiving hurt by any considerable disproportion produced on the sudden between the power and the burthen; but this is no more than what any mechanist will know how to provide for …”</p>
<p>“So, the aim is to provide an opportunity for play, pleasure and exercise, but also to put the energy expended by children in play to pecuniary uses. The power produced by the machinery here would presumably be directed in some way to speed up production. This is needed because, for Bentham, when pauper children are being educated: ‘no portion of time ought to be directed exclusively to the single purpose of comfort; but amusement, as well as every other modification of comfort, ought to be infused, in the largest possible dose the economy admits of, into every particle of the mass of occupations by which time is filled.”</p>
<p>“For me – I like that Bentham called these ‘sinking’ stages – I certainly have a sinking feeling when I sense the absence of my own preference for (and childhood experience of) free, unsupervised, undisciplined, completely purposeless, often dangerous, very dirty and extremely pleasurable play from past and present scripts of children’s education and development – but that’s another story.” <a href="http://blog.poortheatres.manchester.ac.uk/sinking-stages-jeremy-bentham-and-the-education-of-pauper-children/">source</a></p>
<p>In the name of social impact philanthropy, children’s bodies continue to be disciplined in educational settings; not using massive industrial kinetic structures, but rather wearables and play rubrics laid out by<a href="https://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Bechtel_Corporation"> defense contractors</a> with an interest in structuring their character. When we were raising our child, the Philadelphia School District saw dramatic budget cuts to the point that there were no longer staff available to watch children at recess. Families at more affluent schools raised funds to bring in “PlayWorks,” a national nonprofit that used Americorps volunteers to “<a href="https://www.playworks.org/about/what-we-do/history-milestones/">make</a> the most out of playtime.” They instituted<a href="https://www.playworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GRF-Observation-Rubric-19-20.pdf"> recess rubrics</a>; just the thing needed to measure impact! A primary funder of the program was the<a href="https://philanthropynewsdigest.org/news/playworks-receives-26-million-to-expand-healthy-play-programs"> S.D. Bechtel, Jr. Foundation</a>. The largest contractor in the United States, one with<a href="https://archive.ph/1SH7h"> serious ties to the CIA</a>, exerted its influence over the structure of play in thousands of districts.</p>
<a href="https://www.playworks.org/news/measuring-the-benefits-of-recess-playworks-great-recess-framework/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.playworks.org/news/measuring-the-benefits-of-recess-playworks-great-recess-framework/">https://www.playworks.org/news/measuring-the-benefits-of-recess-playworks-great-recess-framework/</a>
<p>In addition to Bentham’s influence, it’s also important to reflect on the importance of altruism and self-sacrifice in the theory of eusociality advanced by <a href="https://undark.org/2022/02/16/new-evidence-revives-old-questions-about-e-o-wilson-and-race/">controversial entomologist, conservationist, and father of the field of sociobiology E.O. Wilson</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality">Eusociality</a> is characteristic of social insects, and Wilson believed humans demonstrate a weak form of it as well. Wilson felt eusocial communities were the highest level of social organization. They are defined by three characteristics: cooperative care of the young; division of labor between a small number of reproducing adults and the rest of the workers; and overlapping generations living in the same colony. </p>
<p>Personally, I think Wilson was off target, but there are many advancing his ideas now, centering the need for extreme forms of cooperation (tokens anyone?) to address serious challenges. Wilson spent his career documenting encoded social rules of ant species and divisions of labor that enable colonies to act as unified superorganisms. Is it coincidence that an early pilot program of <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x4CC11987Ee4D62076F8218d0f97e81437611e311/uS16M2RJuh2s_eoKrVDEe9ALel2VBWns6o2wY-tZlvs">tokenized governance</a>, conviction voting overseen by Michael Zargham of Blockscience, was the <a href="https://github.com/1Hive/conviction-voting-cadcad">Aragon DAO Project</a>. It used a native token with the acronym ANT. Yes, ant tokens! Also it was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-II-king-of-Spain">Ferdinand II</a> of Aragon who initiated the Spanish Inquisition and arranged financing for Christopher Columbus’s voyages. An interesting set of facts considering that the “new world,” the next empire will be built on Web3.</p>

<p>This week I created a map featuring Jim Rutt’s “<a href="https://futurethinkers.org/jim-rutt-gameb/">Game B.</a>” It included links related to transmedia storytelling and laid out the interests behind the creation of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_cyCuCKQhs">Game B Initiation animated short</a>. Then, in collaboration with <a href="https://pieceofmindful.com/author/novicestephers/">Stephers</a>, I expanded the map to include Rihanna’s halftime performance at the Super Bowl as an example of immersive steganography, encoded story. We both saw the production, staged in Phoenix, as a showcase for a theme of rebirth, human life fusing with emerging technology. The goal of of this union is to manifest a eusocial, dynamic, complex, but steerable, human computing system. The ultimate purpose to which such a system would be put remains unclear to me.</p>

      Partnering with Pydantic: No More ‘Steel Seats’ for Developers        We’re delighted to partner with Pydantic’s creator, Samuel Colvin, as he brings his empathy for developers into new arenas.  <p>By Charlie Curnin and Bogomil Balkansky</p><p>Published February 16, 2023</p>      



 
 
   
<p>Sequoia has been thinking about the “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-unstoppable-rise-of-the-developer-economy/">rise of the developer</a>” for more than a decade, throughout our partnerships with companies such as Unity, MongoDB and GitHub. Their products don’t just make life easier for people building software, but also extend what they can do. If we had things our way, each of the world’s tens of millions of developers would find fast, delightful tools to help them all along the way in creating magical products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, even in 2023, much of the tooling developers rely on may be functional but far from well-designed. Like a cobbler who goes barefoot, those building delightful software for others are sometimes the last to get delightful tools for themselves. Even the term “developer experience” itself has only become a more regular part of our vocabulary in the last few years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think of cloud services. Samuel Colvin, creator of the widely used Python library Pydantic, likens building in today’s cloud to driving a 1950s-era tractor: “steel seat, no cab, knobs sticking out of the engine compartment near the component they control, hot surfaces just waiting for you to lean on them.” More and more people are building applications, but still there is too much infrastructure and boilerplate for them to manage, and not enough “just works” magic handling the same nuts and bolts each of them configures in each app they build.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/">Pydantic</a>, in contrast, was built to delight developers. Samuel’s library is an open-source data-validation framework—the kind of thing that, if designed differently, people might rarely think of. Instead, it’s managed to win the hearts and minds of Python developers the world over. With its trademark mix of features for making your life easier and your work faster (like the way it “blends right in” by leveraging Python type annotations, or the raw power it brings to validation), Pydantic’s adoption has soared to more than 40M monthly downloads.<br>We at Sequoia are thrilled to partner with Samuel, leading Pydantic’s seed round, as he takes that same passion for developer experience to a new scale. That starts with delivering V2 of the data-validation library, which will remain open source, and continues toward building cloud services which handle all the right things for developers creating applications. Please email <a href="mailto:careers@pydantic.dev">careers@pydantic.dev</a> if you’d like to be part of that.</p>

 1. Top of mind: On staking; plus, a pulse check on crypto policy &amp; regulation  On staking <p>This past week, the SEC announced <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-25.pdf">charges</a> against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for “failing to register” the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Kraken ceased its staking services shortly after, also agreeing to pay $30 million in penalties. But the question for many was: Would this affect staking overall in the U.S.?&nbsp;</p><p>Why does staking matter? In modern blockchains, "staking" serves a similar function to "mining" in other blockchains — that is, both are mechanisms that allow a participant to earn the right to provide computational capacity. But staking is far more energy efficient. </p><p>How it works: On a proof-of-stake blockchain, anyone can “stake” or lock up their tokens to earn the right to contribute computational resources and security to the network (in exchange for rewards in the form of more tokens). The blockchain's consensus mechanism randomly selects stakers in proportion to how many tokens they have staked. </p><p>Since staked tokens act as an incentive for stakers to act in good faith and follow protocol rules, staking also helps with decentralization because participants are essentially pledging their tokens as an assurance of good behavior — without relying on a centralizing or less secure off-chain system. And while staking means that anyone can participate in a protocol (as long as they have a powerful enough computer, tokens to stake, and a connection to the internet), staking-as-a-service programs can make it even easier for more people to participate.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on proof-of-stake blockchain designs, security, technical considerations, community, process:</p>  <p>▶️ watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ-Ya7NRDxM]">A survey of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain designs</a> by Valeria Nikolaenko&nbsp;</p>  <p>🎧 listen: <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/proof-of-stake-blockchain-design-consensus-sybil-long-range-attacks-more">PoS blockchains - designs, consensus, attacks</a> with Valeria Nikolaenko, Tim Roughgarden, and Sonal Chokshi</p>  <p>🎧 listen: <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ethereum-the-merge-pos-security-decentralization-process-community-people">Ethereum, Merge and beyond</a> with Tim Beiko, Ali Yahya, Tim Roughgarden, and Sonal Chokshi</p>  <p>📄 read: <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/what-the-merge-means/">What ‘The Merge’ means</a> by Ali Yahya</p>  <p>For a16z crypto legal, policy, and regulatory teams’ position on recent events, see 🧵:</p> <a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1623850926338629632">  miles jennings | milesjennings.eth @milesjennings   In response to today’s Kraken / SEC settlement - we had a few thoughts 🧵👇 </a><a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1623850926338629632"> 1:06 AM ∙ Feb 10, 2023  433Likes85Retweets  </a>  Crypto policy &amp; regulation: What’s going on? <p>Collin McCune, Miles Jennings, Brian Quintenz, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p>In the latest episode of the <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/">web3 with a16z podcast</a>, we provide an overview of policy and regulation in the crypto industry — from a lay of the land to pulse-checks on sentiment.

<p>This is the second post in a series on Brave’s commitment to ‘Privacy by Design’, standing beside the work covered in <a>Published proxy configs</a>.</p>

 The challenge 
<p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/data-minimisation/">The principle of data minimization</a> dictates that only necessary data should be collected for a given business purpose. Data minimization is a cornerstone of online privacy: You can’t abuse, sell, or lose what you never collected in the first place. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to process sensitive data, and cryptographic building blocks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">multi-party computation</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> may not be an option.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a simple (and admittedly silly) example: imagine that Brave wants to wish you a happy birthday once a year. Most companies build such services by recording every user’s birthday in a database. They then check the database daily and send birthday wishes to everybody whose birthday it is. But birthdays are sensitive. There’s often no good reason for a company (or advertisers) to learn your birthday, especially given the risk of data leaks.</p>




    



<p>How might Brave build a service like this without learning your birthday? Or more broadly: How might we build any service that processes private data, without actually seeing the data? To answer this question, we first need to introduce a technology called secure enclaves.</p>

 Secure enclaves 
<p>Secure enclaves allow your computer to process information in a way that’s isolated from other programs and data. An operating system is the trusted foundation of a computer, providing an environment where applications like Brave can run. If it has a security hole, all data on the computer is in danger. A secure enclave can mitigate this problem. Think of it like an isolated, tiny computer inside a computer. If the main computer is compromised, the secure enclave is unaffected, and can still be trusted. Many CPU manufacturers offer such secure enclaves, both on server and consumer CPUs. For example, Intel has Trust Domain Extensions and SGX; ARM has TrustZone; and AMD has SEV. Many companies have taken advantage of enclaves in creative ways: Signal uses this technology for <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">private contact discovery</a>; Apple for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108">Face ID</a>; and others use it for copyright protection and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>And Brave can use it for private birthday wishes.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, we built upon a new type of secure enclave that was introduced by Amazon in 2020, called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/">AWS Nitro Enclaves</a>. We chose Nitro Enclaves over alternatives because they are virtual machines (VMs) that do not share resources with other VMs. This eliminates a class of bugs that has <a href="https://sgx.fail">plagued SGX for years</a>: the infamous side channel attack. Specifically, we built a free software tool kit called <a href="https://github.com/brave/nitriding">nitriding</a> which makes it possible to run networked applications inside a Nitro Enclave—often with no modifications. Nitriding allows us to run our private birthday service inside an enclave. That said, we need to consider three attacks:</p>
 
 What if Brave wants to exfiltrate birthdays? 
 What if Brave claims to run one version of the code but secretly runs another? 
 What if Brave wants to intercept the birthdays on their way to the enclave? 
 

 Attack 1: Data exfiltration 
<p>What stops Brave from logging in to the secure enclave and obtaining all birthdays from memory? This attack is prevented by the very design of Nitro Enclaves. While Brave wrote the code that’s run inside the enclave, neither we nor Amazon (nor anyone else) can observe the code and its data at runtime. That means we can’t see the data that goes in or the computation happening inside. We cannot log in to a Nitro Enclave—it’s essentially a sealed black box. This ensures that once a birthday is in the enclave, it is protected.</p>




    




 Attack 2: Secretly running malicious code 
<p>The benign code and malicious code below are nearly identical, but the malicious code contains a function (highlighted in red) that exposes the birthday. What’s to stop Brave from claiming to run the benign pseudo code, while instead running the malicious code?</p>
 
     
func send_wishes() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for b in birthdays {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if b == today {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send_wishes(b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep(24h);
}
<br>
func receive_birthdays() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while true {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birthday = receive_birthday();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save_in_database(birthday);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
     
     a) Benign Code 
     
func send_wishes() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for b in birthdays {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if b == today {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send_wishes(b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep(24h);
}
<br>
func receive_birthdays() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while true {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birthday = receive_birthday();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save_in_database(birthday);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leak_to_attacker(birthday);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
     
     b) Malicious Code 
 
<p>This attack is prevented by another feature of Nitro Enclaves called remote attestation. Users can verify over the Internet that the code we claim to run is the code that’s actually running. If we secretly ran different code, our users would notice due to the cryptographic attestation process of the Nitro system. Remote attestation allows users to verify that the code Brave claims to run is actually running.</p>
<p>Note: Another blog post in this series will discuss how remote attestation works in practice.</p>

 Attack 3: Interception of data in transit 
<p>While we may not be able to exfiltrate birthdays from the enclave memory, or secretly run malicious code, what’s to stop Brave from intercepting birthdays as they are submitted to the enclave?</p>
<p>This attack is also prevented by our nitriding tool kit. Nitriding exposes a Web service that runs inside the enclave and cryptographically binds the Web service’s HTTPS certificate to the attestation document that’s issued by the Nitro system itself. This allows our users to verify that they are talking directly to the enclave, with no parties in the middle. In other words: Brave (or any other third party) can obtain a valid HTTPS certificate for the enclave, but cannot reference this malicious certificate in the attestation document, which acts as the root of trust. Users have a cryptographic guarantee, enforced by their client, that they are talking to the enclave and nothing else.</p>

 The downsides 
<p>Let’s sum up: If Alice wants to receive birthday wishes from Brave, she first audits the source code of our birthday service to convince herself that the code is safe and secure. Next, Alice establishes a TLS connection with the enclave application and verifies that it’s running the code that Alice just audited. Finally, Alice is willing to reveal her birthday to the enclave application because she knows that it’s going to remain safe.</p>
<p>In this case, Brave has demonstrated how to build with verifiably private computation.</p>
<p>However, Nitro Enclaves are no panacea. We consider their design more secure and flexible than <a href="https://sgx.fail">Intel’s SGX</a>, but Nitro Enclaves are new. The technology has yet to stand the test of time and face the scrutiny of security researchers. Another shortcoming is the proprietary nature of Nitro Enclaves: While AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system.html">published the architecture</a>, the hardware design itself (and some of the software) remains proprietary, which requires a level of trust in Amazon. This is no different from many other enclave designs, but still problematic because closed-source hardware and software cannot easily be verified by third parties.</p>
<p>With these limitations in mind, we have decided to experiment with enclave applications cautiously, without placing too many eggs in one basket. The next blog post in this series will present one such application: a service that plays a key role in the work-in-progress revamp of our <a>privacy-preserving product analytics (P3A) system</a>.</p>

<p>This is just a short post to provide some context around a clip I recently posted to my Youtube channel of an interview Jordan Peterson did a number of years ago. The clip is just the beginning of the interview where Peterson provides his credentials, including working with former Blackberry (Research In Motion, RIM) co-CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Balsillie">John Balsillie</a> on a 2013 United Nations document “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resilient-People-Resilient-Planet-UN-2013-Jordan-Peterson-Involvement.pdf">Resilient People, Resilient Planet</a>.” In the clip Peterson said he removed the “ideological claptrap.” This information is also included on Jordan Peterson’s website.</p>

<p>Stephen Harper appointed Jim Balsillie head of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Technology_Canada">Sustainable Development Technology Canada</a> in 2013. Balsillie had served as the sole Canadian and <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/cigi-chair-jim-balsillie-appointed-un-high-level-panel-global-sustainability/">representative</a> of the private sector on the United Nations Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability in 2010. In 2001, Balsillie funded the creation of a non-profit Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), whose <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/cigi-chair-jim-balsillie-appointed-un-high-level-panel-global-sustainability/">goals are aligned with</a> the UN Sustainable Development Goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2011 CIGI entered into a partnership with INET (Institute for New Economic Thinking), a project of George Soros to transform global economic relations – what we now see as the cybernetic circular (or doughnut) economics. INET has a huge number of affiliates, including James Heckman who created the equation for human capital finance speculation. Eric Weinstein, a mathematician and economist who worked for Thiel Capital, is also a member.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote an <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/13/the-chicago-school-of-economics-and-george-soros-new-theories-for-an-impoverished-world/">extensive piece on INET</a> back in the summer of 2018. It discusses plans to leverage creative finance to profit from the poverty of the billions on the bottom of the economic pyramid. I remember really scratching my head when I found out Open Society was funding economic research at Milton Friedman’s University of Chicago. At that point I didn’t understand that the power structure is evenly distributed across political ideology. The cybernetic agenda is neither one side nor the other.</p>

<p>Balsillie’s partner at RIM was Mike Lazaridis, now with Quantum Valley Ventures, whose philanthropic efforts included establishing the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/history">Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>&nbsp;to the tune of $100 million in 1999 and a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/quantum-computers-valley-mike-lazaridis/article36385613/">quantum computing center</a> at the University of Waterloo. Looking back now on the attention given to Blackberry in media, how all the important politicos were wedded to their devices, and knowing that Canada as a digital nation is be positioned as the vanguard of social impact sustainable tech, it seems pretty clear that the company’s product was about normalizing and uplifting what would become the surveillance tracking infrastructure of the future. I’ve included a map I made in 2019 linking UN SDG 4, education, to fintech impact data collection.</p>

<p>Canada’s involvement with sustainability goes back to the 1970s led by oilman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Strong">Maurice Strong</a>, who made a fortune in Alberta and later in hydro-power management. Strong then founded a multi-faith contemplative community with his wife Hanna in <a href="https://www.manitou.org/foundation/directors/">Crestone, Colorado</a> in 1988. The area has long been considered sacred land by the original peoples and sits atop a vital aquifer. Strong headed the Canadian International Development agency in the early 1970s, working for <a href="https://www.mauricestrong.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=120:strong-short-biography&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=70">Trudeau</a> senior, when he was tapped by UN Secretary General U Thant to spearhead a conference on humans and the environment. That was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_I">Habitat-1</a> held in Vancouver in 1976. Strong’s involvement in the development aid space was <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2022/06/02/maurice-strong-helped-rally-the-world-on-environmentalism-in-1972-fifty-years-later-were-still-trying-to-act.html">initiated by Prime Minster Lester Pearson</a>. Pearson’s name was given to a commission he chaired in 1968 that prepared the global development aid / finance regime for the techno-social entrepreneurship that would blossom in the twenty-first century. If you want a deeper dive you can check out this dissertation on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_Commission_on_International_Development">Pearson Commission on International Development</a> <a href="http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11986/1/MWrightThesis.pdf?DDD17+">here</a>.</p>

<p>Strong’s close collaborator was Barbara Ward Jackson, a British born networker who built up the field of sustainability within the context of global humanitarian aid. This brings us to where we are today with data-driven impact finance structuring natural life on earth in the name of social justice and conscious capitalism. A hat tip to <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2022/08/16/building-the-impact-finance-regime-nigerias-civil-war-and-the-road-to-cyber-colonialism-part-i/">Raul Diego for bringing Barbara Ward Jackson to my attention</a>. She, Strong, and those who followed down the path they cleared in the 1970s, like Balsillie and Peterson, should have our attention as the world pivots towards cybernetic governance.</p>
<p>Below are two maps showing Barbara Ward Jackson’s diplomatic ties around sustainability, global aid, and the financial sector.</p>

<p>This is an analysis I did of an interview with Barbara Ward Jackson that also touches on the Silicon Icarus article, “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2022/08/16/building-the-impact-finance-regime-nigerias-civil-war-and-the-road-to-cyber-colonialism-part-i/">Building the Impact Finance Regime.</a>”</p>

<p>Peterson recently announced on Joe Rogan’s show his creation of a new global organization to develop alternative futures, in London of all places. I’m going to suggest that we consider this development within the context of complexity theory and “Game B” developed by Jim Rutt in partnership with members of the Intellectual Dark Web, including Bret Weinstein, an evolutionary biologist whose firing from Evergreen State College led his brother Eric to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_dark_web">coin the term</a> the “Intellectual Dark Web.” “GameB” revolves around creating a global economy of abundance through voluntarism and cooperative economics. It is imagined as a <a href="https://medium.com/@memetic007/a-journey-to-gameb-4fb13772bcf3">civilizational level social operating system.</a> Based on the individuals involved it seems like this model will likely feature biohacking, performance optimization, meta–psychotechnology, extasis; oh, and maybe some ethical cults.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What is not obvious to most people is that such a system will be built on distributed ledger technology and governed through token engineering; a practice that will extend not only to financial transacting, but also to “democratic” voting systems on blockchain. All of this will be framed as radical participation and populist, but it is ultimately governed by systems of technocracy. The anti-woke crowd of traditional values can replace ESG governance with encoded “moral economies,” which will be fine by the artificial intelligence infrastructure. It likes all flavors of human life. Resistance is acceptable, welcome even, as long as the various sectors can be tagged and monitored and used for machine learning. </p>
<p>See my “GameB” map below. It’s still a work in progress.</p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Game-B-Map.png?ssl=1"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/93cf894067c21d49eed2080563e2464f#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1mVjhCN2ZOUw%3D%3D">https://embed.kumu.io/93cf894067c21d49eed2080563e2464f#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1mVjhCN2ZOUw%3D%3D</a>
<p>I didn’t post that clip to make Jordan Peterson wrong. I posted it to provide context that might open up the possibility of exploring a broader narrative than the polarizing ones we are continuously being offered. Many of the critiques I’ve seen online are rabidly anti-leftist, framing Soros as a tool of Marxists looking to take over their country. Well, as best I can tell, executives of high-tech computing companies producing the instruments that will be required to track, trace, and optimize us towards some evolutionary next step don’t fall into that category. Machine learning systems operate through pattern recognition; but the real world is so complex, it needs to start collapsing human variety into more manageable chunks. That is why we are all expected to inhabit an easily discernible category. And once we inhabit them, we are supposed to see those inhabiting the other boxes as our enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is an <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/10/gods-eye-view-part-3-civic-tech-the-wisdom-of-crowds-and-off-shore-sandboxes/">excerpt</a> from my latest installment of my series “God’s Eye View.”</p>
<p>“The next statement is key – the importance of the non-equilibrium state to generate the energy needed to run the system. Social media, all media, serves this function. It serves to create polarity, trigger words, tribalism, heightening emotion to keep us all in a state where we feed our life force into these circuits. I’m not here to point fingers. After all, I’m writing this on a blog, aren’t I? But I hope you’ll notice I am working on the way I hold this information and the way I share it, so that I do not unnecessarily feed into the disequilibrium state.</p>
<p>Fear Porn = Disequilibrium</p>
<p>I am convinced of the overall goodness of the human heart. People are generally well-intentioned, but they live inside stories. Those stories shape what they think the world is, and how it works. Those stories are highly-managed. Top-down control of reality increased exponentially as we slid down the slippery slope of bits and bytes, ones and zeros. The things I am talking about here – the ant computer – no one is supposed to know. If we knew, I believe most would stand against it. The most powerful neutralizer for this program is to take away their energy. Stop allowing weaponized narratives and labels (both sides) to feed the vitriol you are supposed to feel about your fellow humans. We are their energy source, our hearts.</p>
<p>‘Energetic issues are critical to embodied computational systems,&nbsp;which must be maintained in a non-equilibrium state either for a definite duration or indefinitely. Therefore the formalism needs to be able to&nbsp;describe and define the flow of matter and energy through the system. Active elements have to be powered in some way, either continuously during operation or by&nbsp;being arranged initially in a non-equilibrium state.We anticipate that embodied computational systems will be fueled in a variety of ways and powered by a variety of energy sources (electrical, chemical, optical, thermal, mechanical, etc.). Therefore the formalism needs to be able to define the dynamical and spatial relations among energy sources and other elements.”&nbsp;<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source'”</a></p>
<p>This system is driving us forward through the strategic use of disequilibrium. I’m taking time to post this, because the identity politics (both sides, woke / anti-woke) and the polarity that results from that tension is central to understanding how complex systems are being coded for some sort of post-human eugenic emergence.&nbsp;So how is that working out for us? Is it getting us any closer to understanding the true nature of the machine? I would say it hasn’t. Instead, it leaves us emotionally ragged, depleted, and constantly scouting the horizon for the next threat. We are not using our intelligence, which John Trudell said is our most important tool in dispelling tech-no-logic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what I’m writing about in my latest series, which examines betting culture, prediction, intuition, bio-computation, and bottom-up architecting. We are caught in a vortex. We don’t understand the water we’re swimming in. If you haven’t read my series, I’d love it if you could spend some time with it, and share your thoughts and feedback. I’m particularly excited to talk with people about <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/10/gods-eye-view-part-3-civic-tech-the-wisdom-of-crowds-and-off-shore-sandboxes/">Part 3 – Civic Tech, The Wisdom of Crowds, and Offshore Sandboxes</a>.</p>
<p>Someone left a snarky comment on my posting of the clip implying that I have skeletons in my closet, alluding to my activism on the left. I hide nothing. I still hold the same values, but I was finally able to see the box that was created for me to inhabit. I’ve outgrown that box. Maybe you can outgrow yours, too, and then people can stop putting targets on one other’s backs. Instead we can ponder over the fact that for many, many decades, centuries even, some unseen force has gradually brought us to this place where we teeter on the edge of natural oblivion. </p>
<p>Stop letting them use your identity to steer you. If we can put the hammers down and step out and look, just look, we might be able to see a way through that doesn’t involve tokens or robots or sensors or algorithms. How about it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote this post about the United Nations Sustainable Development goals and social impact finance and big data the week before the pandemic was announced. It’s sort of a time capsule of where I was then. I’ve grown a lot over the past three years. My core values remain the same, but I see the tactics and narrative tropes that have been used to manage us into not looking at the bigger picture. I continue to deepen my awareness of the true nature of this emergent anti-life program.</p>

<p>This is the third part of a series.</p>
<p>Part 1 – <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/02/gods-eye-view-part-1-mathematical-theories-of-life/">Mathematical Theories of Life</a></p>
<p>Part 2 – <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/07/gods-eye-view-part-2-intuition-governance-tokens-and-training-kids-to-bet-big/">Intuition, Governance Tokens, and Training Kids to Bet Big</a></p>
<p>As I tried to sort out Bayesian theorems, prediction markets, blockchain bets, and Futarchy, my friend Leo Saraceno directed my attention to<a href="https://azuro-protocol.gitbook.io/azuroprotocol/terms-of-use"> Azuro Protocol</a>, headquartered on the island of Seychelles in the middle of the Indian Ocean.<a href="https://azuroprotocol.medium.com/azuro-launches-mainnet-on-gnosis-chain-first-betting-frontend-is-now-live-d1d0b6d94c3d"> An article</a> put out last summer when Azuro’s base layer went online with bookmaker.xyz on Gnosis Chain provides a solid overview of the history of prediction markets on blockchain. Augur on Ethereum was a first attempt in 2015 followed by<a href="https://polymarket.com/markets"> Polymarket</a> and Gnosis. None were successful due to issues with the user interface and liquidity. Azuro hopes to overcome those problems after bringing in Web2 sports betting consultants and devising open-source code for a new type of liquidity tree. The company has partnered with<a href="https://azuroprotocol.medium.com/azuro-partnerships-blockchain-oracle-network-chainlink-d29b4cc5a7e7"> Chainlink</a> and plans to use its oracles to feed data to the smart contracts and validate payouts on wagers.</p>
<a href="https://azuro.org/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://azuro.org/">https://azuro.org/</a>
<p>The following excerpt was taken from the “<a href="https://azuro.org/about">about</a>” page of the firm’s website.</p>
<p>“A bet is one of the first forms of contract used by people thousands of years ago. Today, however, online betting is plagued by a lack of transparency and fairness, because it’s a system built on negative incentives pitting bookmakers and players against each other… Azuro utilizes smart contracts to build a decentralized betting protocol deploying an innovative solution for liquidity provision and allocation. Betting becomes transparent and trustless, while depth of betting events, markets, and UX remains as good as it gets. Furthermore, Azuro democratizes the business of betting by breaking down the role of the traditional bookmaker into several smaller roles, openly available for anyone to benefit from: liquidity provision, front end management, data provision, oracles, decentralized governance. As a result, we envision a rich, fun betting environment with decreased cost of service to players, full transparency, community-run with a commitment to responsibility.”</p>
<p>While Azuro’s primary audience is sports betting and Web3 GameFi, you see how the wording practically tees up a use case for decentralized “democracy” in a tokenized cyber “commons.” As the world is conditioned for acceptance of “life” in extended reality where daily experience is situated within vague jurisdictions of “the cloud,” the effectiveness of the traditional nation-state notion of participatory governance is bound to be diminished. What I believe we are seeing bubble to the surface through the efforts of entities like Gitcoin, Commons Stack, Token Engineering Commons, and Glen Weyl’s RadicalXchange are alternative models evoking the potential of tokenized voting systems. I think these systems are meant to steer the natural world towards convergence with the machine and transform us into Oliver Reiser’s networked “World Sensor.”</p>

<p>The following is drawn from a July 2021 post by Accelerated Capital, “<a href="https://acceleratedcapital.substack.com/p/daos-and-democracy-voting-mechanisms">DAOs and Democracy: Voting Mechanisms in Web3</a>.” It’s a promo paragraph from their sponsor<a href="https://help.tally.xyz/article/21-getting-started-with-tally"> Tally</a>, an app that manages the lifecycle of proposals for DAOs:</p>
<p>“Tally empowers voters to successfully participate in on-chain governance via a sophisticated dashboard. Users are able to see current and past proposals, cast votes, delegate power, and analyze governance trends across multiple DAOs. Tally currently supports some of the largest DAOs in the space including Uniswap, PoolTogether, Gitcoin, Compound, Radicle, and more. Unlock the knowledge you need to level up your Web3 citizenship by using the Tally dashboard today.”</p>
<p>Level up your Web3 citizenship in the coming “game” of life. With this information in mind, reconsider trending narratives about<a href="https://nextcity.org/features/why-we-should-lower-the-voting-age-to-16?gclid=Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75l762JIt02641VaH8QbIdN61WpWYSYIZW0LKsdjg2HoSn5T6YtQAaAmo8EALw_wcB"> lowering the voting age</a>,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/28/1128695831/united-states-2022-patterns-mail-early-voting"> early voting</a>,<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/11/20/the-voting-experience-in-2020/"> sharp declines in in-person voting on voting day</a>,<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1210722109"> voting fraud</a>,<a href="https://www.voteriders.org/voter-id-laws-2022/"> voter ID</a>,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-technology-colorado-donald-trump-voting-95b862c0cb66aac446a213aace504776"> compromised voting infrastructure</a>, and even the rise of<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-polls-vote.html"> social media polls</a> on the most inane topics. I view them as all being related. Votes are signals in the market of ideas, signals about what people believe to be true. </p>
<p>From Blockscience’s Michael Zargham:</p>
<p>“The reason the Commons Stack exists, and the reason the focus has been more on norm formation, understanding boundaries of communities in terms of culture, and teaching principles carried forward from Ostrom’s work is exactly this observation. Governance mechanisms don’t do anything directly, they merely convert the signals expressed by their participants into a collective decision. Acknowledging that value is inter-subjective, it is incredibly important to reflect on what values you express through your participation in governance processes – and the extent to which your community shares those values determines the direction your governance process steers your system.”<a href="https://michaelzargham.medium.com/a-brief-history-of-conviction-voting-ad4ca4eb4aee"> Source</a></p>
<a href="https://medium.com/block-science/a-brief-history-of-conviction-voting-ad4ca4eb4aee"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://medium.com/block-science/a-brief-history-of-conviction-voting-ad4ca4eb4aee">https://medium.com/block-science/a-brief-history-of-conviction-voting-ad4ca4eb4aee</a>
<p>E-government linked to biometric digital identity, our signifier as agents in the simulation, will generate more robust signals than past methods of civic participation. I sense the civil society sector across the ideological spectrum will be pulled in as a key partner to support a transition to cybernetic governance. I first started to come across the term “<a href="https://civictech.guide/a-timeline-of-civic-tech-tells-a-data-driven-story-of-the-field/">civic tech</a>” when I was <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2020/01/13/operation-relentless-pursuit-test-beds-for-smart-city-signals-intelligence/">writing about</a> “what works” data-driven government. Central to that effort were policies to “open up” municipal data. Why we had to do that it wasn’t clear to me then. Certainly, regular people weren’t in a position to use it, so it seemed at first glance to be a resource grab favoring for-profit interests. They could leverage the “free” data sets to create products like predictive policing software that could, in turn, be sold back to duped government officials to impose further control over citizens. </p>
<p>Now I see it much more clearly. Open data and integrated sensor networks combined with digital identity wi turn smart environments into massive social computing systems. We’re in the game. We’re definitely in the game. With this new pair of glasses, I can see what the Knight Foundation has been up to with their civic gaming projects and civic tech investments. Civic games and augmented reality and embodied natural computing and learning ecosystems are about breaking down larger problems into smaller interactive tasks intended to “tap into the wisdom of crowds.” Cyber-physical and socio-technical architectures and the normalization of on-demand task rabbit work will permit almost real-time mobilization of agents to accomplish computation for larger projects, the true nature of which participants are likely not even aware. An example of this is the gig-work platform <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/american-gig-work-platform-was-accused-working-russia-rcna18258">Premise</a> started in 2013 which was implicated in crowd-sourced intelligence in Russia’s conflict with Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following passages are drawn from a 2010 paper by Dr. Bruce MacLennan, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Artificial-Morphogenesis-as-an-Example-of-Embodied-Computation.pdf">Artificial Morphogenesis and an Example of Embodied Computation,”</a>&nbsp; and a 2015 paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Morphogenetic-Path-To-Programmable-Matter.pdf">The Morphogenetic Path to Programmable Matter</a>.” MacLennan is a professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science who consults regularly with Oak Ridge National Labs. Neurotechnology, nanotechnology, reconfigurable robotics, and complex systems design were his <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=A14DflkAAAAJ">primary areas of research</a>. Two slide decks, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Self-Organization-for-Nano-Computation-and-Nano-Assembly-Bruce-MacLennan.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Configuration-and-Reconfiguration-of-Complex-Systems-by-Artificial-Morphogenesis-Bruce-MacLennan.pdf">here</a>, provide insights into the nature of his investigations. MacLennan’s biographical page at the University of Tennessee states:</p>
<p>“In the mid-’80s, MacLennan redirected his research toward natural computation, that is, computation inspired by or occurring in nature…Since the mid-’90s this research program has expanded to include self-organizing systems with very large numbers of physical components (e.g., the cells in a developing embryo) and the interaction of physical and computational processes. The latter includes the use of computational principles in nanotechnology (algorithmic self-assembly) and the exploitation of novel physical processes for computation (post-Moore’s Law computing technologies).”</p>
<p>Remember, this research is already ten to fifteen years old. As you read the quotes, picture a future where natural life interacts with machine “intelligences” to “collaborate” on computing programs we cannot comprehend. I can’t say exactly what this will look like. I think they will make it seem inviting, playful.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, where I live, the Knight Foundation introduced augmented reality through art and <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/monument-lab-overtime-app-philly-virtual-tour-statues/">place-based storytelling</a>. These small grant programs seem harmless.&nbsp; It’s hard for us to imagine what “natural computation” post-Moore’s Law might look like. This presentation from Allison Duettmann, CEO of the Foresight Institute established by Eric Drexler in Richardson, Texas, offers some insights. Note how the elements of a physical computing interface, a building, will coordinate with embodied role-playing games in mixed reality governed by blockchain smart contracts in digital communities or “network states.” The presentation below was part of Protocol Labs’ “<a href="https://protocol.ai/blog/breakthroughs-in-computing-labweek22/">Breakthrough in Computing Speakers Series</a>” held last November.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that you’ve watched that, watch this clip about the sensor networks and artificial vision used in the classrooms of Wildflower Montessori schools. Apply what you’ve heard about in the Duetterman clip to how learning environments for children are being planned. Consider the renewed emphasis on “play” and tracking “social emotional skills.” I wrote about my reservations regarding Jeff Bezos’s plans to subsidize Montessori, pre-k. You can read it <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/15/montessori-inc-pre-k-predictive-profiling-for-power-and-profit/">here</a>. The post got quite a bit of traction at the time. I hadn’t a clue that five years later I’d realize all of this tech was about embodied computation. Now, some may argue that live role play collaboration to solve big problems is a great idea. But that must happen with consent among consenting adults. It is unethical to channel the joyous creativity of children and harness it to drive some network state machine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am going to interleave quotes from MacLennan’s two articles between images that might help you understand this new kind of social computing. I’ve also pulled in some screen shots from <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Complex-Systems-Bio-Inspiration-and-Morphogenetic-Engineering.pdf">a slide share</a> created by <a href="http://doursat.free.fr/research_morpheng_full.html">Rene Doursat</a>, a researcher in complex systems and bio-inspired design with a focus on swarm intelligence and autonomous, decentralized robotics. Doursat is a pioneer in <a href="https://golden.com/wiki/Morphogenetic_Engineering-BWWWA3M">morphogenetic engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century, social engineering isn’t simply about domination or control, it’s about organizing natural life to “conduct” cooperative tasks for some larger purpose. What that is, I honestly don’t know at this point. Many of the quotes center operations at the nanoscale, but I know that their intention is to unlock a grammar of life in order to “code” it at all levels.</p>
<p>“We have outlined the requirements for a formalism — indeed a programming notation — for embodied computation oriented toward morphogenesis, and have discussed our approach to meeting these requirements. Fundamental to this is massively parallel programming built on a foundation of continuum mechanics and partial differential equations, which facilitates scaling up to very large numbers of embodied computing units.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>They want us classed as units, cogs. They are using our digital footprints to generate those classifications, though often not well. Facebook’s assessments of who their system thinks a given person actually is are often wildly off the mark; and yet, they proceed.</p>
<p>“An embodied computation system comprises a finite and fixed number of bodies (or tissues), each having properties that allow it to be classified as one substance or another. The behavioral dynamics of these bodies, in mutual interaction, defines the dynamics of the embodied computation system, but it must be prepared in some appropriate initial state.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>They are also mapping who influences you, or at least which influencers hold your attention. Not all of our potentialities are realized, as with genes certain triggers can unlock latent tendencies. They want to know what those are, so they can push your buttons, the right ones at the right time – to control relationships.</p>
<p>“First, biologists often find it convenient to express regulatory networks qualitatively, using influence models to indicate, for example, that one gene product enhances or represses the expression of another gene, or that a molecule regulates an enzyme. These qualitative regulatory relationships are an important tool for conceptualizing control processes in which the quantitative relationships are unknown or are not considered critical. Therefore, the formalism should permit the expression of qualitative control relationships.”</p>

<p>In processing these quotes, you are going to have to think beyond cellular function to include population level cybernetic steering towards optimization metrics and to cultivate unexpected emergent properties. They want us to participate as agents in their programmable matter “game,” where they assemble us and disassemble us at will. They will try very hard to convince us that this is a way of expressing our liberation and collective good-will through participatory token exchanges and living in a digital panopticon. Freedom cells…think about it.</p>
<p>“Programmable systems achieve their generality by controlling the interactions in a generic substrate in order to implement specific functions. For example, an ordinary computer program applies universal operations to a homogeneous array of bits in order to implement a specific application. In a similar way, programmable matter is based on a generic material that can be programmed to exhibit a wide variety of useful physical properties; we call this a programmable material.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Morphogenetic-Path-To-Programmable-Matter.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>The next statement is key – the importance of the non-equilibrium state to generate the energy needed to run the system. Social media, all media, serves this function. It serves to create polarity, trigger words, tribalism, heightening emotion to keep us all in a state where we feed our life force into these circuits. I’m not here to point fingers. After all, I’m writing this on a blog, aren’t I? But I hope you’ll notice I am working on the way I hold this information and the way I share it, so that I do not unnecessarily feed into the disequilibrium state.</p>
<p>Fear Porn = Disequilibrium</p>
<p>I am convinced of the overall goodness of the human heart. People are generally well-intentioned, but they live inside stories. Those stories shape what they think the world is, and how it works. Those stories are highly-managed. Top-down control of reality increased exponentially as we slid down the slippery slope of bits and bytes, ones and zeros. The things I am talking about here – the ant computer – no one is supposed to know. If we knew, I believe most would stand against it. The most powerful neutralizer for this program is to take away their energy. Stop allowing weaponized narratives and labels (both sides) to feed the vitriol you are supposed to feel about your fellow humans. We are their energy source, our hearts.</p>
<p>“Energetic issues are critical to embodied computational systems, which must be maintained in a non-equilibrium state either for a definite duration or indefinitely. Therefore the formalism needs to be able to describe and define the flow of matter and energy through the system. Active elements have to be powered in some way, either continuously during operation or by being arranged initially in a non-equilibrium state.We anticipate that embodied computational systems will be fueled in a variety of ways and powered by a variety of energy sources (electrical, chemical, optical, thermal, mechanical, etc.). Therefore the formalism needs to be able to define the dynamical and spatial relations among energy sources and other elements.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>“Typically, the structure of a computational system governs its function, that is, the computation it performs. Conversely, in algorithmic assembly a computational process governs the assembly of some physical structure. However, some embodied systems integrate these two processes. For example, in embryological morphogenesis, the physical structure of the embryo governs the very computational processes that create the physical structure of the embryo. Structure governs function, and function creates structure.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

If they can reconfigure themselves, they can also deconfigure themselves, rearranging their components into inert and potentially recyclable material.

<p>“Complex, multicellular organisms can recruit, reorganize, and reshape groups of cells to form functionally specialized tissues and organs—a process collectively referred to as morphogenesis.

<p>“For example, we commonly think of computation as taking place in a fixed substrate, and many self-assembly processes also assume a fixed substrate or matrix in which agents move.

<p>“Morphogenesis proceeds through a carefully orchestrated series of overlapping parallel phases, which have the characteristics of a coordinated algorithm. In this robust process, the completion of one phase signals the initiation of the next through a combination of chemical signals and changing cell states. Temporal patterns often create spatial patterns (as in the clock- and wavefront model of segmentation), and morphogenesis may be best understood as the creation of patterns in four dimensions.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>In the above screenshot, the involvement of Omidyar Network and Knight Foundation stands out to me. As with Goldmans Sachs and social impact bonds, they do seem to be making this sector out of thin air.</p>
<p>After several years of mulling it over, I now see how problematic the “China social credit” narrative has been. As long as people hold onto that narrative – that we are under siege by a foreign power, by another culture, we will not be able to grasp the material I just shared. We aren’t going to be ruled by China, but by the Department of Energy in partnership with Big Tech and social entrepreneurs. I fell for it myself when I started researching digital surveillance. </p>
<p>What I see happening, with bolstering from the “it’s just a tool, you can use it (distributed ledger technology) for ill or for good” crowd, is that the time time is coming when strategic players will start to promote alternative digital participation protocols as radical inclusion, bringing government back to the people. And in doing so, the “signals” people emit via their civic-tech “voting” apps will enable them to be managed in the multiverse game. The image below is a “product” associated with Gitcoin, a funding organization for Web3 development that has been piloting new voting systems as part of its grant-making program. </p>
<a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://passport.gitcoin.co/">https://passport.gitcoin.co/</a>
<p>Take note that this framing is not punitive, it’s encouraging. All you need to do is collect “stamps” in your “passport” to grow your online reputation. You see the gaming mechanics there? And the more your identity is “verified” in your community, “the more opportunities you will have to vote and participate across the web3.” This isn’t the government doing the rating; it’s set up so that your peers, your community members, rate you. This isn’t China. Gitcoin is based in Boulder, Colorado, the blockchain state and home to ETH Denver. We can’t let managed narratives lead us into box canyons of dead-end thinking. Digital identity is at the core of extended reality and the pressure to create and manage a digital twin through which we will engage in this brave new world will be coming from all quarters.</p>
<p>When Zargham says, “value is inter-subjective,” meaning that value is dynamic and in motion as it interacts with the values held by others in our community, it brings to mind John Horton Conway’s research. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, informed by the work of von Neumann and fellow Manhattan Project researcher Stan Ulam, Conway dove into exploring the dynamics of two-dimensional cellular grids where each cell was designed to act within a specific rule set in relation to neighboring cells. Over many cycles, a variety of two-dimensional “multi-cellular” forms were generated. These were given names like gliders and spaceships. Conway’s inspiration, Stan Ulam, developed the Monte Carlo Method and was a regular at the<a href="https://youtu.be/pq7CYo-cXqY?t=133"> Los Alamos poker game</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the beginning of lockdowns, I’ve understood that digital governance has an important role to play in what is unfolding. I thought it was about generating data to legitimize public-private social impact deals, but of course it’s much more than that. Governance IS cybernetics. We are supposed to imagine that we are “free” to participate in discussions around communal wellbeing. But is it a game? And if so, whose game is it? Who or what is monitoring the signals and updating the rules, fine tuning the algorithms in order to catalyze some preferred emergent outcome? And it seems that under conditions of liquid democracy, we may end up not even representing ourselves on the game board. If Cesar “<a href="https://www.peopledemocracy.com/">augmented democracy</a>” Hidalgo gets his way, this new-fangled radical participation could have AI assistants (digital twins) handling all the proxy votes, because they’ll know us better than we know ourselves , or at least that’s the story they’re telling.</p>

<p>So, does anyone want to wager on how long it is before “democracy” gets a makeover as a giant casino? Welcome to the big game of free-market governance where regular folks of all political leanings are the marks. The mantra of Jeff Yass, astute poker player and options trader, is to play against people dumber than you or less experienced. It’s with a fair degree of confidence I’ll say that some form of mechanical “intelligence” will be hoovering up the “votes” cast in the marketplace of the commons. That intelligence will hold so much data it will be able to discern patterns that would be impossible for the human mind. Thus, we should not become enablers of this game. The odds will never be in our favor. </p>

<p>Silicon Icarus goes into some detail about the corporate structure of PokerStars, founded by Isai Scheinberg in 2001. PokerStars played a key role in the restructuring of the online poker landscape following the 2011 cheating scandal.</p>
<p>“In 2014, after PokerStars acquired Full Tilt Poker as part of the DoJ-brokered deal to cover Americans’ losses, Scheinberg’s company was sold to Montreal-based Amaya Gaming Group for a whopping $4.0 billion. The sale turned Amaya, which had also briefly acquired CryptoLogic and InterCasino in 2012, into the largest online gambling company in the world at the time, facilitated by $3 billion from outside investors, including BlackRock.”<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/"> Source</a></p>
<p>The firm was originally based in Costa Rica, but Scheinberg relocated it to the Isle of Man in 2005. The island, a self-governing crown dependency, is known for its tailless Manx cats and a wide-open regulatory approach to emerging tech and gambling. Thirty percent of the island’s<a href="https://www.digitalisleofman.com/about-us/"> economy</a> comes from the tech sector even though the island has no corporate or capital gains tax rates and low personal income tax rates. A public-private partnership,<a href="https://g3newswire.com/digital-isle-of-man-building-a-blockchain-ecosystem/"> Digital Isle of Man</a>, facilitates business relocation.

<p>Last year with a lock down-driven shift to online government services, the Isle of Man launched a<a href="https://www.gov.im/media/1377898/digital-strategy-2022_27-final.pdf"> five-year digital strategy</a> to transform public services centering a shift to smart technologies under the guise of climate policy action, open data, and digital inclusion, a tactic that will turn citizens into data commodities for social impact finance programs linked to the Sustainable Development Goals.

<p>While not a part of the Silicon Icarus story, Malta has a similar profile to Cyprus with respect to online gambling. I’ll bring it in here as I added to my map in association with<a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/failed-crypto-giant-ftx-two-maltaregistered-firms.995013"> two unlicensed FTX operations</a> registered there in the spring of 2022.

Both list Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire founder of FTX Trading, as their sole director. Neither of those two firms was licensed to carry out any activities related to virtual financial assets, or cryptocurrencies, in or from Malta, a spokesperson for the Malta Financial Services Authority said.”</p>

<p>Besides being home to the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Knights of Hospitaller from 1530-1798, the strategically positioned Mediterranean island, a British Commonwealth republic, is a hotbed of digital innovation with a regulatory environment that’s quite friendly to online gaming. It was one of the first countries to approve online gambling in 2004. Revenue from over<a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/a-brief-history-of-gambling-in-malta-a2.958015#:~:text=Gambling%20in%20Maltese%20society,regulate%20online%20gambling%20in%202004."> three hundred registered companies</a> now accounts for twelve percent of Malta’s GDP.</p>

<p>A 2017<a href="https://www.3cl.org/malta-first-nation-state-to-deploy-blockchain-in-education/"> article</a> about the program by 3CL Foundation described Malta as having an “emerging reputation as an island lab for the testing and deployment of new technologies.” Blockcerts were pitched as a way for 400,000 citizens to have secure, transparent, flexible, self-sovereign proof of qualifications, including diplomas, certificates, degree equivalencies, and licensure. The effort was part reconceptualizing higher education as a “meta-university” where “experiments with blockchain could lead to the design of entirely new models delivered through various channels including virtual universities and plug and play models (accumulating credits while working).” According to 3CL,<a href="https://www.3cl.org/about/"> a specialist ed-tech foundation established as the Commonwealth Centre for Connected Learning</a>, as early as 2017 blockchain boosters had set their sights on expanded digital identity use cases including: customs, taxation, land, intellectual property, notarization, benefit disbursement, health, voting, judicial records, and even veterinary services.</p>
<p>A program of<a href="https://www.cryptovision.com/en/republic-of-malta-launches-electronic-identity-card/"> contactless biometric electronic identity cards</a> was launched in the fall 2020 for use not only in authentication but for payments, internet sign-on, and even as a door key. How convenient, right? KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for online gaming in Malta preceded the broader roll out by seven years. Back in 2013 Palo Alto-based<a href="https://www.jumio.com/about/press-releases/mr-green-goes-live-with-jumio-to-verify-customer-identity-for-a-vip-customer-experience/"> Jumio</a>, was using artificial computer vision to provide credential verification for Mr. Green, an online gambling operation based in Malta. Andreessen Horowitz was an early investor in Jumio. Many companies have sprung up to provide identity verification services around e-gaming RegTech. Another firm operating in Malta as of 2019 is<a href="https://www.trulioo.com/blog/identity-verification/malta"> Trulioo</a>, started in Vancouver in 2011.</p>
<p>What people are not yet understanding is that their digital wallet will be their digital twin and will be their dynamic human capital valuation. What’s being sold to us as convenience, is actually a digital minder intended to knit us into complex social and economic relationships. E-gaming is about to step outside the digital casino into extended reality. We’re not the poker players, we’re the chips, tokenized bets. Online education and online gambling are two sides of the same coin. In the future economy a significant number of people will be expected to chase skills badges on gamified platforms for gig work awarded by AI as the elite, or more likely automated portfolios linked to ESG (environmental social governance) metrics, place bets on how long we can endure – a new kind of horse race if you will. </p>
<p>That is the learning economy.</p>

<p>Release 5.4.0 introduces a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase.</p>



<p>Improving third-party wallet performance through updates to our wallet SDK and the Zcash protocol continues to be our primary focus at ECC. In parallel, we continue to work through known issues and reduce legacy “tech debt.”</p>



<p>Summary of Changes</p>



 
 Chain supply values now include transparent and all shielded pools. Node operators must reindex their nodes if they want accurate supply information displayed for the entire chain. 



 Replaced 100MiB memory limit with 1000-block limit to eliminate an expensive memory usage call in the batch scanner. 



 Improved block template performance with backported Bitcoin Core code. 



 Removed CentOS 8 as a supported platform due to operating system reaching End-of-Life on December 31, 2021. 
 



<p>Additional RPC changes and feature deprecations have been included in this release. For technical details on these changes, please read the full release notes available <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.4.0">here</a>.</p>

 Part 1: Progressive Onboarding <p>by Henri Stern and Akhila Bhoopalam</p><p>At <a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we’ll share some thoughts on UX in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Today, there is no easy way to get started in web3. In spite of the myriad tools and products built to get users in, most people struggle to interact with public datastores (i.e. blockchains). Installing wallets is difficult for new users, wallet connectors for apps are unreliable and often break, and it’s challenging for many products to show their value until a transaction takes place. We overinvest in tooling without focusing on the experiences they&nbsp;unlock.</p> Don’t Connect,&nbsp;Activate <blockquote>There is a word missing from the web3 lexicon. That word is activation.</blockquote><p>Onboarding users onto a product is not just about creating an account, it’s about getting them to use the product and see its benefits firsthand.</p><p>For some apps, the right onboarding should mean connecting a wallet (and potentially educating new users about wallets and custody), but for others it should start with an email login, prompting a wallet connection later. A user might want to browse items, before choosing to save one or comment on one. The purchase comes&nbsp;later.</p><p>Each of these steps requires a different amount of buy-in from the user. And so you should wonder: “does my user need a wallet to make a comment?” If they don’t have one, they’ll have to download an extension and write down a mnemonic. Product fragmentation and learning curves in web3 delay access to core features and lead to&nbsp;churn.</p><p>Using the appropriate hooks, you can keep your users moving through your product funnel. By engaging your users early and progressively onboarding them, you continue to prove out product utility. This will make it easier for diverse audiences to discover new flywheels in your app. Put simply, help your user get to your core utility&nbsp;fast!</p> Wallets galore <blockquote>But this isn’t to say you should throw the book at your user and give them infinite options to connect to your&nbsp;product.</blockquote><p>The first interaction users have with web3 products is increasingly littered with menus of options, often including dozens of wallets to choose from. These options are meant to signal optionality, flexibility, and familiarity for incoming users, but it forces them to compare, filter and choose at the onset. Our users are overwhelmed with tooling and starved of good experiences.</p><p>As a builder you must be opinionated about user activation: prioritize the options you offer, and strive to show the best ones. With every option you give, ask yourself “which of my users is this&nbsp;for?”</p><p>To be clear, client diversity is important to web3 in deep ways, and enabling users to pick their terms of engagement with your product is key… but it must not come at the expense of your product experience.</p> Where the space is&nbsp;going <blockquote>Show users a clear way in, and give them side doors if they already know what they want and what they are&nbsp;doing.</blockquote><p>There’s a lot to be excited about in web3. Staple products are making huge strides threading the needle between web3-native UX and friendly, directed flows. We can illustrate some of our points looking at a product we love:&nbsp;<a href="http://opensea.io">OpenSea</a>.</p><p>OpenSea has the huge challenge of having to serve both the natives who came on in 2018 and fresh newcomers to the space… A huge undertaking. Accordingly, it’s heartening to see them iterate on UX and adopt new patterns for their users. We’ll call two out two which illustrate some of the tensions web3-builders face.</p><p>Wallet onboarding</p><p>First, the mixed bag. If you haven’t checked out the connector experience in OpenSea recently, take a look. What an improvement! They’ve recently overhauled their UI here and it is a breath of fresh air. With that said, the choices here are still a bit overwhelming and the link to a wallets tutorial doesn’t do enough to direct me if I don’t already know what I&nbsp;want.</p><p>Mind you, this is a nuanced issue given a historical user base that needs a long-tail of wallets, support across various ecosystems, etc. But more direction would go a long way for everyone!</p><p>Product selection</p><p>Next up, the great. Thanks to the introduction of <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-seaport-protocol/">the Seaport protocol</a>, OpenSea can build more powerful UX. Their use of the shopping cart abstraction here is fantastic. In the below screen, you can see a wonderful mix of familiar and web3-native elements:</p>  The shopping cart and ⚡-shaped “Buy Now” button are intuitive to anyone who’s used Amazon in the past 20 years… which is to say everyone.  “Sweep” and “Send to a different wallet” tastefully point to more advanced usage for power&nbsp;users.  Shout-out to A Fundamental Dispute by @generativeLight and&nbsp;@frolic<p>The future of the space hinges on our ability to blend familiar interfaces and native concepts. Crypto has given Internet users new ownership superpowers; those will have to be balanced against age-old UX pitfalls, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/moonbirds-creator-kevin-rose-loses-1-1m-in-nfts-after-1-wrong-move">like phishing</a>.</p><p>We, for one, are thrilled to see dominant actors thoughtfully iterate on their product experience. The path ahead is long, but the future is&nbsp;bright.</p> Some lessons <p>Privy builds simple onboarding to bring more users to web3. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned building in the new&nbsp;web:</p>  Sweat the details: What is the role of wallets in your product, and when should they be connected? Do they allow your user to view something, permit something, or own something?  Progressively onboard: How can you continually engage your users as they explore your product over their lifecycle?  Filter, filter, filter: What is the minimal amount of friction and information needed to empower users to access utility? Be opinionated about the pathways you create. Don’t add — reduce.  <p>If you’re building in the space and want to chat about the experience you are crafting, we’d love to&nbsp;help!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">Web3’s coming of age</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introduction <p>The increasing concern for privacy and security in the digital world has led to a surge in demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.scalaproject.io/general/history">Since 2018</a>, Scala has been innovating and developing privacy solutions, and we don’t intend to stop anytime&nbsp;soon!</p><p>The Scala’s 2023 roadmap consists of four main development priorities:</p>  V8 Menger&nbsp;Mainnet  Mining Hub  BSC/ETH Bridge  Marketing  <p>We expect 2023 to be a bullish year for privacy projects, and we believe Scala will be at the forefront of this&nbsp;trend.</p><p>Here are the details of all the items that make up our roadmap for&nbsp;2023.</p> Unstoppable Domains Integration <p><a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/">Unstoppable Domains</a> has always supported Scala, offering technical expertise and financial incentives to integrate its features into the Scala ecosystem. This time, we are excited to announce that we have received a development grant to integrate Unstoppable Domains within our&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>We have already completed the integration of this feature into our&nbsp;wallets.</p>  Android Wallet: <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/ScalaVault/releases/tag/v1.0.9">https://github.com/scala-network/ScalaVault/releases</a>  CLI Wallet: <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/Scala/releases/tag/v7.9.4">https://github.com/scala-network/Scala/releases</a>  <p>UD has added Scala to its list of supported currencies. You can now send and receive crypto using a human-readable name, for example, mastermind.crypto, instead of a long string of numbers and&nbsp;letters.</p><blockquote>Please not that you must have XLA enabled on your <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/domains">UD domain</a> to use this&nbsp;feature.</blockquote><p>This is one more step towards the mainstream adoption of&nbsp;XLA!</p><p>Psst. We are also listed as UD’s official partners: <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps">https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps</a></p> V8 Menger&nbsp;Mainnet <p>V8 Menger is a major upgrade to our network. It brings a host of new additions — mainly our much-anticipated security solution Diardi. You can find all the details about this new version in our <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/menger-v8-specifications-75a8abb9a3c5">previous&nbsp;article</a>.</p> Testnet <p>The testnet has been underway with our community for a few months, and so far, we have not had any major issues that would prevent the mainnet release in the next weeks. We are still working on updating our official pool, but we don’t anticipate any major&nbsp;issues.</p> No more centralized mining farms' domination <p>Many of you have long complained about the large multi-coin mining pools like MoneroOcean and c3pool, which have monopolized most of Scala’s hashrate in recent years, putting a lot of selling pressure on XLA: <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/scala">https://miningpoolstats.stream/scala</a>.</p><blockquote>We believe we have finally found the solution to this non-trivial problem that many other projects have tried to tackle with limited&nbsp;success.</blockquote><p>V8 Menger will provide added security for no extra cost, and we believe it will help to fight against big centralized mining farms. Every 4th block is a Diardi block, so if the critical stakeholders (like pools and exchanges) use a confirmation period above this 4-block limit, they can be assured that malicious miners cannot make a private block mining 51%&nbsp;attack.</p> New Reward&nbsp;Curve <p>V8 Menger will also include some much-needed changes to the reward curve. The reward curve is set to be deflationary but according to an emission curve (so it wouldn’t drop at certain intervals exactly). Instead, it will follow a smooth curve until the tail emission value is hit (999&nbsp;coins).</p><p>The rewards a Diardi operator gets will be 1/4th of the blocks per day, this is because the electrical effort that goes into producing a Diardi block is much lesser than that of a regular&nbsp;block.</p> Updated wallets <p>This new version of the network will require an update of our wallets, so we will take this opportunity to improve and stabilize them, especially the GUI&nbsp;wallet.</p> New Website <p>We have been working on our new revamped website for the last months, with the addition of a blog to improve our SEO and visibility on privacy and mobile mining&nbsp;topics.</p> Mining Hub <p>We are excited to announce that we will be working on a new product to democratize CPU-mineable coins!</p><p>Following the closure of the <a href="https://www.hostero.eu/">Hostero</a> service, we have decided to take over the project and begin the development of a centralized mining hub platform called Scala Mining&nbsp;Hub.</p><p>We will be using Hostero’s open-source components and libraries as a starting point to kickstart the development of our new platform.</p><p>This new product will bring more utility for XLA and provide new cash flow to the&nbsp;project.</p> BSC/ETH Bridge <p>One of our goals for 2023 is to expand our exposure beyond the privacy-centric ecosystem.</p><p>We have already been working on Solidity contracts that will allow us to build a swap between any ETH-compatible chain. This will allow us to build a gateway for Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum (ETH) that will allow our users to swap wXLA (wrapped XLA) for ETH and&nbsp;BNB.</p><p>Once the dust on V8 Menger settles, we will continue working on the cross-chain integration and will be sure to keep you informed about the progress of this&nbsp;project.</p> wXLA Token <p>The new wXLA token linked to our current XLA coin will bring greater visibility to our project and drive more demand for the&nbsp;project.</p> Marketing <p>As most of you know, we are now under the legal umbrella of <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/haku-labs-scalas-non-profit-organization-4456e4739ce">Haku Labs</a>, a legal entity created to oversee the project's operations. This legal status creates new opportunities regarding exchange&nbsp;listing.</p> CEX vs DEX&nbsp;Listings <p><a href="https://tradeogre.com/">TradeOgre</a> has served us well over the last years and has always been a strong partner to our project by providing <a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/LTC-XLA">LTC</a>, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/BTC-XLA">BTC</a> and <a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/USDT-XLA">USDT</a> trading pairs for XLA without needing&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>With concerns surrounding CEX in terms of regulatory compliance, and the delisting of privacy coins like Monero (XMR), we feel that spending large amounts of money (typically 100,000$ and more) to get listed on CEX might not be the way to go. That being said, if the opportunity comes to get listed on a CEX at a fair price, we will definitely evaluate&nbsp;it.</p><p>The launch of our wXLA on ETH and BSC will open the door to many opportunities for DEX listings, and we will explore those options actively once our token is released.</p> Fun &amp; Educational Events <p>We are always looking for ways of engaging more with our members and also adding new people to our community. This year, we will be actively looking for ways to increase our exposure, for example, AMAs with other projects, and cross-project collaboration.</p> Scallet V3 <p>Most of you already know that in 2022, we released the updated version of Scallet, our web wallet and payment gateway: <a href="https://scallet.io/">https://scallet.io/</a></p><p>We will work on improving the user interface of this tool to make it more user-friendly and consistent with Scala design guidelines.</p> Conclusion <p>Looking back, we see how far we have come in the last few years. Our community is now engaged and strong, and our team is as passionate and committed as&nbsp;ever.</p><p>We can’t thank you enough for your consistent support. The entire team is excited about these upcoming challenges and is looking forward to&nbsp;them!</p><p>Don’t forget we are a decentralized and community-based project.

<p>Some companies may fall into the trap of choosing a blockchain that doesn’t align with their goals, opting for the most popular one, or partnering with a blockchain not yet ready for onboarding users.</p>



<p>When deciding on a blockchain to develop on, consider these key elements:</p>



 
 Technology – the speed, reliability, and security of the network. 



 Ecosystem – the community of users and developers supporting the network.&nbsp; 



 Focused growth – the entities supporting the network’s development and growth.&nbsp; 



 Legal compliance – it is critical for the mainstream adoption of the technology, considering the rules and laws applied to the blockchain. 
 



<p>This article is an introduction to a deeper explanation found in our ebook: <a href="https://zaisan.io/deciding-on-a-blockchain/">Deciding on a Blockchain</a>.</p>



<a href="https://zaisan.io/deciding-on-a-blockchain/"></a>



 Technology 



<p>Blockchain technology has the power to revolutionise the way future generations handle data, finance, and human interaction. With a vast array of benefits, here are just a few worth mentioning:</p>



 
 Full traceability of any information on the blockchain 



 Smart contracts and automation 



 Increased speed and efficiency 



 Increased security 



 Holistic view of transparency from all parties involved 



 New business models, products, and services 
 



<p>To fully realise the advantages of blockchain, it’s crucial to apply it properly. When deciding on a blockchain, consider factors such as:</p>



 
 The consensus mechanism 



 Transaction per second (TPS) 



 Block speed &amp; fast finality 



 Cost structure 



 Security 



 Network maturity 



 Database integration 



 Environmental impact  
 



<p>These factors are important elements for your whole assessment.</p>



 Ecosystem 



<p>It’s commonly known that the community is comprised of the users, developers, thought leaders and investors of a public blockchain. It goes without saying that the community plays a vital role in the network. Without a community, the blockchain would be of no use and would not receive any development. The community provides the basis for the evaluation of the technology. If it is poorly developed, then it’s unlikely to attract any users. Overall, the community plays a big role in:</p>



 
 Developing decentralised applications (dApps) 



 Influencing the token price 



 The governance model of a public blockchain 



 The stability of the network 
 



 Focused Growth 



<p>“Focused growth” refers to the entity at the forefront of the blockchain network, responsible for driving its development, managing executive functions, and guiding its adoption. This is a crucial consideration when choosing a blockchain to develop on, as the goals and direction of the network are set by this organisation. The hallmark of a strong entity in this role is solid leadership and comprehensive documentation for developers to aid in onboarding. These organisations are often referred to as “foundation companies.” Keep an eye out for incentive programs such as grants and partnerships, as these are common in the blockchain space and can indicate a thriving ecosystem.</p>



 Legal Compliance  



<p>In the rapidly evolving world of web3, it is all too easy for businesses to overlook the importance of compliance with relevant laws and regulations. This may cause significant issues down the road, potentially jeopardising the mainstream adoption of this innovative technology.</p>



<p>To ensure that your blockchain solution is in line with legal requirements and protects the security of your users, it is crucial to choose a platform that supports compliant solutions. This will give developers and users peace of mind, knowing that their transactions and data are secure and compliant with all relevant regulations.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there have been many cases of blockchain projects falling foul of data breaches, scams and other security issues, simply because they failed to consider the importance of compliance. Don’t let your business be caught in the same trap – before choosing a blockchain, take the time to assess its level of compliance and ensure that it provides the necessary safeguards for your users.</p>

      Revisionist Engineering        <p>By Harry Spitzer</p><p>Photography: BRYAN DERBALLA</p><p>Published February 9, 2023</p>        How Deno’s Founder Is Rebuilding the Runtime of the Web      



 
<p>In June 2018, Ryan Dahl took the stage at JSConf EU in Berlin, the largest nonprofit JavaScript conference in the world. Despite it being a high-profile event (and the fact that the majority of the 1,500 conference attendees had filed into this particular warehouse just to see him), Dahl wore a loose-fitting black T-shirt and jeans and kept things casual. “So, I kinda wanted to give a different talk about some other stuff, but that wasn’t ready, so this is kind of a make-up talk,” he began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl seemed nervous. Given what he was about to do, nerves made sense. Nine years earlier, on this stage, Dahl had introduced an embryonic JavaScript runtime platform, a free, open-source environment for JavaScript programming. This platform, he had announced, was faster and simpler than anything in use. But, most important, historically JavaScript had only been used for a website or app’s design, or “front end.” This platform allowed developers to use JavaScript to build a website or web app’s functionality, or “back end,” too, unifying web development into a single programming language. The platform was called Node.js, and it would establish JavaScript as the dominant coding language for the web, today used by 98 percent of websites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between the time he’d debuted Node in 2009 and his return to the conference stage in 2018, it wasn’t just the platform that had evolved (thanks to his contributions, and those of hundreds of global open-source collaborators); Node had also transformed Dahl. He’d become a household name among the Hacker News and TechCrunch set. Now, Dahl had returned to Berlin to tear his former creation apart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s been some years since Node came out,” he started. “And it’s kind of stabilized, and…it’s a thing,” he began noncommittally. “And it’s kind of going into this…direction,” a scowl coming across his face. “So I thought I’d kind of look back on it, and tell you what I think about…,” a pause, “…Node.” Dahl offered a 30-second Node primer: “My goal was really around doing event-driven I/O in JavaScript, and that was important in 2009 for getting server-side JavaScript off the ground. JavaScript is single threaded, that allowed Node to succeed”—before launching into a 16-minute litany of regrets, kicked off with a slide that read, “At times Node is like nails on a chalkboard to me. It could have been so much nicer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The list included the fact that Node has basically “zero security.” It took to task Node’s original outdated Build System, and it highlighted the complicated packaging of code modules by NPM, the Node Package Manager. And by “so much nicer,” Dahl meant easier to use, more elegantly designed. So as to avoid coming off as a troll, and from a place of genuine affection for his creation and its impact, Dahl sprinkled in praise: “I think Node is quite nice. JavaScript is really quite nice.” He also called out the tremendous effort from Node’s community. Most of all, he touted the ways Node, in creating a runtime environment that allowed web developers to code their full stack in JavaScript, had helped reinforce JavaScript’s position as “the language of the web.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He saved his toughest criticism for himself. Dahl apologized to his audience, with a pained look, for decisions that he said “cannot be corrected now, because there’s just so much software that uses it.” There were so many layers of code, and so many users of his platform—hundreds of whom were in this room—watching him pick apart the platform that helped make JavaScript the most <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language">commonly used programming language </a>for all developers—web or otherwise—for nearly a decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this act, Dahl was joining a cadre of artists and inventors, like Willa Cather, who implored in the foreword of a reprint of her first novel for readers to consider the book a historical artifact of an early attempt, not a representation of her current artistic merits. Or the godfather of conceptual art, John Baldessari, who burned 100 of his early paintings and baked the ashes into cookies. Dahl, without the ability to cremate his digital creation, was, in effect, asking everyone in the room, and the half a million that would watch his talk online, to relegate Node to a pile of his “early work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, with the air of someone who’s gotten a weight off his chest: “I thought it was shitty to come up in front of people and complain about stuff without giving some sort of solution,” he said, introducing a prototype he’d hacked together over the last month. “You might want to check out Deno; Deno is a secure runtime on V8.” This new platform, he explained, would be a corrective to Node. A JavaScript runtime, but faster, more secure, more elegant—and, if it eventually did everything he mapped out, it might just supplant Node as the runtime of choice for the world’s coding language of choice. Dahl was launching his next era as only software engineers can, performing the oratory equivalent of iterating on his code in real time, calling out the bugs, talking about preserving elements he liked, and describing how he’d rebuild the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think I’m mildly happy with it so far,” Dahl offered. He then quickly thanked the audience and walked off stage with three minutes left in his allotted time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dahl’s mother, a math professor at a San Diego community college, had always been a technophile. “Super early, we had a computer, and she got me a book on how to program BASIC. I was just very much exposed to computers at an earlier age than other folks,” says Dahl. Using his mom’s Apple IIc, Dahl mastered BASIC’s basics, before deciding he wanted to run the Linux operating system. He saved $300 from a job as a movie theater projectionist, and bought a used PC. The sparse early-’90s coding environment felt exciting, like a puzzle to solve. “It was a very hands-on learning experience where I knew nothing; there’s nobody there to tell you anything. It was just kind of actually physically smashing the keyboard until you got it to work,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl preferred learning by doing, and found high school understimulating: “I barely graduated. It seemed stupid and pointless,” Dahl says, before adding, “I’m sure I was just an asshole 17-year-old back then.” But in Dahl’s senior year of high school, a new peer-to-peer file-sharing application came out that let users upload and download audio files. Napster only worked on the Windows operating system, and Dahl, instead of accepting this status quo, decided it deserved a home on his favorite operating system, Linux, as well. So he built one called <a href="https://gnap.sourceforge.net/">gnap</a>, compatible with Linux’s desktop environment, Gnome. The first Napster clone to arrive on the scene, gnap earned Dahl his first brush with viral success, and coverage on a proto-Hacker News tech blog called Slashdot. Here was a way that he could have real impact, Dahl thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating (he squeaked by with a C average), and without the grades for a university, Dahl enrolled in math classes at his mother’s community college. In a more technical environment—one of his own choosing—he thrived. After two years of straight A’s, he transferred to the University of California San Diego, then continued on to a PhD in math at the University of Rochester in upstate New York. Three years in, Dahl experienced a familiar feeling, like the things that were being asked of him weren’t meaningful, or even particularly useful. “Math just didn’t feel necessarily connected to reality. There’s just all of these structures and abstractions. At some point you’re just like, ‘Yeah, I want to do something that is actually connected to reality.’” So Dahl dropped out. Within weeks, he and his girlfriend were on a one-way flight to Chile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeking sunny and quaint conditions, they landed on the coast in Valparaíso. Unfortunately, they had arrived in June, winter in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>



<p>With only grad student savings, Dahl and his girlfriend booked a shared room in a hostel, a temporary solution, they reasoned, until they found jobs teaching English. If Dahl was looking for something real after years of academic abstractions, he’d found it. “There was no heat. There was mold everywhere. There was a mattress on the floor with some dirty bed sheets,” he remembers. “It was like, ‘What are we doing here? This is awful.’”</p>



<p>They lasted a few months before relocating to Buenos Aires. By then, skeptical of his teaching prospects given his questionable credentials (“I paid like $100 for some sketchy online English teacher certificate”), Dahl turned to Craigslist for work. One ad caught his eye, mostly because it had the word snowboarding in the title: a winter sports gear company needed help building their e-commerce site. The gig was not necessarily Dahl’s dream project, but, “I had no money. I was pretty eager to help him out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though it’d been years since he’d spent meaningful time coding, Dahl’s high school hacking gave him a solid foundation (his years studying math didn’t hurt, either). Building their site helped Dahl feel like he’d again found a tangible problem to solve. That contract turned into another, and then another through referrals. This was 2007. Dahl and his girlfriend were early digital nomads, taking on remote work as they moved around South America, and eventually to her home country of Germany. With each project, Dahl was exposed to new layers of the coding stack: “I started doing, basically, front-end development with this snowboarding website, and, kind of slowly, it became, ‘Okay, now I’m working on the framework itself, and now I’m thinking about the web server itself. Now I’m thinking about non-blocking I/O.’” Just like he had in high school with his Apple IIc, Dahl figured it out, using online resources and inventing solutions of his own.</p>



<p>One morning in the Cologne apartment he shared with his girlfriend, Dahl woke up to a life-changing email. A San Francisco-based cloud application management platform, Engine Yard, reached out via referral to offer Dahl a $60,000 contract to work on their support team, the most lucrative job he’d ever had. That was the moment Dahl stopped conceiving of software engineering just as a means of funding his itinerant lifestyle. This could be his lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When Chrome came out, it was just very clear. If I had not done this, somebody else would’ve discovered this.”&nbsp;</p>
ryan dahl</blockquote>



<p>Engine Yard’s engineering needs were the most complex Dahl had encountered. They asked him to build a plugin using non-blocking, or asynchronous operations, a new time-saving method that allowed software to keep executing JavaScript operations without waiting for the non-JavaScript operations in the code to complete. Months after this job, in September 2008, Google released Chrome, with a new JavaScript engine called V8. Still with non-blocking operations on the mind, something clicked. If he could pair Chrome’s new JavaScript engine with non-blocking operations, he could create a platform where JavaScript could handle back-end development as well as front end, supplanting developer favorite Ruby on Rails on the back-end and becoming a full-stack language. “When Chrome came out,” says Dahl, “it was just very clear. If I had not done this, somebody else would’ve discovered this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “this” Dahl is referring to, of course, is Node.js. And thanks to his $60,000 from Engine Yard, Dahl had a little runway to build it—hacking it together in daily eight-hour coding sprints over six months in a WiFi-less Starbucks on the corner of Rudolfplatz in Cologne. “I think in a very real sense, I was thinking about the right stuff at the right time. I saw this and I was just like, ‘I must implement this now.’”</p>



<p>The story of Node is the stuff of Silicon Valley legend, one of those paradigm-shifting moments (at least in the world of JavaScript coding). It was late 2009 and Dahl had just heard about a new JavaScript conference coming to Europe. Buoyed by his prototype’s success on the nascent code-sharing site GitHub (Dahl says he was one of the first 100 people on GitHub, so good traction meant tens of users), Dahl reached out to JSConf EU’s organizer, asking for a speaking slot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl debuted Node in front of an audience of 150 in Berlin in November 2009, earning a standing ovation—a conference first. The talk went viral in JavaScript circles, and within months, those tens of users had grown to tens of thousands. Users flocked to Node not just because it made it possible to use JavaScript in a new way, but also because it was faster, more elegant, and easier to use than anything else—and it made developers’ websites and web apps that much faster as well.</p>



<p>After toiling on his own in a coffee shop, there was something about seeing the live JSConf crowd’s response that made Dahl realize that, after years of vagabonding, he was ready for stability and community. In the weeks after his talk, a handful of San Francisco-based startups reached out. He accepted an offer from a cloud-hosting company called Joyent; their expertise seemed most aligned with his, and more important, they wanted him to develop Node in-house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the process of hiring Dahl, Joyent gained control of Node’s business interests, which, for an open-source project meant, “I gave them the website; I transferred the credentials to them. We changed all of the copyrights in the source code from copyright Ryan Dahl to copyright Joyent. I gave them the ability to apply for the trademark,” says Dahl. As for what he got out of this acqui-hire: “I got paid out very early and it super de-risked the situation for me.”</p>



<p>In the months after joining Joyent, Node exploded. Tim Becker, a friend of Dahl’s from JavaScript circles, remembers the moment he realized what a big deal Node was becoming. During a 2011 JavaScript meetup in his hometown of Cologne, Becker sent a casual message to Dahl saying it might be fun to host a Node-specific conference in town. “It was really just a spontaneous idea. And he ended up tweeting it, although we weren’t even ready yet,” Becker says. By the end of the meetup, Becker had 10 emails offering to sponsor their conference. “Everybody wanted to be involved in Node,” he says.</p>



<p>But Dahl quickly realized stability came at a price. Despite Node (and Dahl) becoming an increasingly big deal, Joyent wanted to keep overhead low. They wouldn’t allow Dahl to hire engineers to help keep pace with Node’s exploding popularity, seeing Node more as a nice-to-have marketing tool for their existing cloud project. In order to keep up, Dahl moved fast. Critical decisions that would intractably shape the platform had to be made without second-guessing. Bert Belder, an early Node collaborator who built Libuv, a Microsoft-compatible version of Node, remembers Dahl at that time being “a bit uncompromising. He had the tendency to sometimes very aggressively remove things from Node.” One of those things was Promises, a piece of software built to make asynchronous operations smoother. Dahl found its design inelegant. “The next day, an enormous amount of code was ripped out,” remembers Belder, “and everybody had to rewrite their Node.js software because, you know, now everything worked differently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there was the matter of his public profile. Dahl had always relished his anonymity. It allowed him to blog and tweet freely, to make the occasional programming screw-up, and subsequent fix, without backlash. But as Node’s profile rose, so did his. Already predisposed to irreverence, and with a degree of naivete about his newfound celebrity, Dahl was dismayed that when he wrote <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/rant">a blog post</a> titled, “I hate almost all software,” a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3055154">Hacker News thread</a> about the post garnered hundreds of comments. Close friends like Isaac Schleuter, the mind behind NPM, could see the backlash coming: “I saw that go down and I was like, ‘Oh God, Ryan, what are you doing to yourself?’”</p>



<p>But what bothered Dahl more than any attack (and what he perhaps should’ve anticipated, given his own vocal critiques) was when users took Node itself to task. “I remember one post in particular called ‘Node.js a cancer.’ At the time, I was just like, ‘Oh no, I’ve made a mistake somewhere,’” says Dahl. “It affected me emotionally. I was just trying to make some technology, and I guess wasn’t super-prepared for this thing to be as big as it was. I didn’t want to be the face of it.’” So Dahl stopped posting and weighing in, and in late 2013, he deactivated his Twitter.</p>



<p>By early 2014, Dahl was ready for a change. After eight years, he’d just broken up with his girlfriend, and startup fatigue had set in. It was the strain of managing such a high-profile, complex project, but he also felt like he’d done what he’d set out to do. Node had made the impact he’d hoped for—and with most of the ongoing development happening in open-source communities, Dahl felt it no longer needed him. He felt ready to create something new. So Dahl put in his notice, booked a flight to New York City, and walked away from Node.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s nothing more eye-opening than when you go back and look at your own code and you’re just like, ‘Oh my God, this is terrible.’”</p>
ryan dahl</blockquote>



<p>On a late summer day in 2017, Dahl called Belder from his office in Google’s Manhattan campus. He had a proposition. After three years of toying around with startup ideas, Dahl had accepted a role at Google Brain, the team developing Google’s Machine Learning engine, TensorFlow. Until now, TensorFlow had mostly been built in Python, but a new project called deeplearn.js was making it possible to build models in JavaScript, Dahl’s language of choice. “Let’s take TensorFlow, and bind it to Node and make a kind of better JavaScript machine-learning framework,” Dahl told Belder. The opportunity seemed obvious to Belder. “In the back of my mind there is always like, okay, maybe this could be something big,” he remembers. Within weeks, Belder quit his job as IBM’s internal Node.js expert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At first, diving into Node felt like a homecoming, but soon Dahl was looking upon his creation with five years’ worth of new skills, insights and awareness of all the progress made in coding globally. “We quickly realized that there were all these problems with Node. Man, there’s nothing more eye-opening than when you go back and look at your own code and you’re just like, ‘Oh my God, this is terrible.’” Dahl couldn’t stand the thought of his name being attached to something he now saw as so…amateur, so flawed. He briefly entertained the idea of trying to fix the problems from within, but quickly concluded that the platform’s problems were too fundamental, and the open-source leadership too decentralized, to ever be able to resolve the issues. Instead, he decided to build something new that would clear his name and do what Node couldn’t. A few months later, in June 2018, having recently quit his job at Google, Dahl took the stage at JSConf EU in Berlin to introduce Deno.</p>

<p>When I speak with Dahl in late 2022, I notice another subtle way he’s distancing himself&nbsp; from his past. The name of his new company, pronounced during his 2018 JSConf presentation ‘DEH-NO,’ has shifted to the simpler, funner, arguably more elegant ‘DEE-NO.’ “It is the proper English pronunciation of those letters,” Dahl says, “and we liked the dinosaur association.”</p>



<p>The platform behind the brontosaurus branding is now a far cry from the barely functional demo of 2018. It’s faster than Node, built on Rust, a newer, more secure programming language. “We’re trying to just generally take advantage of the fact that we’re in the future now, and things are great,” Dahl says. It enables the use of TypeScript, simplified bundles of JavaScript code, right out of the box. And whereas Node had “zero security”—“when you install an NPM module, this is essentially running untrusted code from random people on the internet on your computer”—Deno is built to operate within the secure sandbox of a web browser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deno’s biggest innovation is starting a migration toward edge computing, which Dahl sees as the next big shift in web development. “Particularly serverless at edge, that is, running your server everywhere all at once in every region around the world,” he says, “that’s where I see Deno moving us in five years.” Deno’s version of edge computing, what it calls an isolate cloud, runs little bits of JavaScript in data centers all around the world. This helps cut down the time it takes to reach a data center by allowing programs to get responses from the data center closest to where the requests are being made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl is rewriting the way he works, too. He didn’t want to be in the same position he’d been in with Node, unable to hire as many engineers as he needed, so this time, he opted for funding in addition to open-sourcing, a decision that led him to Mike Vernal and Lauren Reeder, partners at Sequoia Capital, in January 2022. Vernal found Dahl endearing on an early phone call. “He felt a little bit like someone who is set up on a date they really didn’t want to go on. And so they’re like, ‘Okay, let’s finish this thing off and then let me get back to work,’” says Vernal. “You could tell he wanted to go back to building the thing that he wanted to build. And he was very transparent about that, which, in a weird way, I liked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Deno is based in New York City, has 15 full-time employees, and is in the process of hiring 10 more, mostly engineers. Sequoia led the company’s Series A, announced in June 2022. The platform has nearly 100,000 developers using it every week, it’s one of the top 50 projects on GitHub of all time and more and more enterprises, like Netlify and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/slack">Slack</a>, are using its enterprise offering, Deno Deploy, to build their web apps and websites. Becker credits some of the success to Dahl directly: “There are enough people who are convinced by him and who, just because of his involvement, are willing to dive right into Deno.”</p>



<p>Dahl hopes to do a push on Deno’s general release by summer of 2023 to bring in more individual users—the people Node currently serves. His urgency has only increased as competitors have debuted. But he sees others in the space as evidence that he’s on to something, an incentive for his team to stay focused. “Having a little competition on the performance side means that I can very much justify putting effort into that, and performance is what I would love to do day in and day out,” says Dahl.</p>



<blockquote>

<p>With Deno, Dahl isn’t so much trying to fix the status quo as build a new one. “When we launched Deno in 2018, Node was an industry standard that everybody in that conference room had used professionally for many years,” Dahl says. “I think a lot of those things, Node’s bugs and flaws, were just taken as a given. Like, ‘It just works this way.’ And I hope that hearing how it ought to have been done, and things that could be done better, was really an eye opener.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like when he noticed an opportunity to build Napster on Linux, or when he realized that Chrome’s V8 engine could forever transform the way people use JavaScript, Dahl is primed to keep reinventing. And he attributes this fortunate position to timing, more than a little kismet and the perspective he gained as the main mind behind Node. “I don’t know if obligation is the right word, but I have the right vantage point to be able to say, ‘Yeah, actually we can just do this differently.’”</p>



<p>He cares so much about doing web development differently because he sees it as the “medium of human information.” If he can make web development easier, Dahl says, “in particular on the server side, the area that I have ideas in and influence over, then we can make things faster. And I think sometimes making things faster does actually change the nature of what people can do. Faster means smoother online experiences, better real-time communications. Faster means more people interacting simultaneously online. There’s a vast opportunity to have a real impact.”&nbsp;Until then, he’ll keep refining. “Everything’s a work in progress,” he tells me toward the end of our call. He’s polite, but eager to get off Zoom and back to building what he hopes won’t be another important yet flawed early work, but instead, a truly great one.&nbsp;</p>

 Get Ahead of the Game with Verus’ Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20&nbsp;Tokens  In this article, we show you how to map and bridge an Ethereum ERC-20 token to the Verus testnet blockchain as a currency one-to-one. We use the groundbreaking non-custodial and provable Verus-Ethereum bridge, and we don’t even need to code anything! <p>📝 Note that this walkthrough is for the Verus Testnet blockchain, which simulates the Verus blockchain once the PBaaS-upgrade (Public Blockchains as a Service) is brought to mainnet. Also, the commands are for macOS and Linux, as Windows works a bit differently. We use the CLI wallet for Verus. <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.6-1">Download here</a> 🔗 You can also use Verus Desktop with its incorporated terminal.</p> The Verus-Ethereum Bridge <p>👉 All tokens and currencies flowing over the bridge are never in anyone’s custody, and are proven and verified by consensus rules.</p><p>The Verus-Ethereum bridge is the first of its kind. Because it is permissionless, non-custodial and provable. We&nbsp;can:</p>  send and receive ETH and ERC-20s to and from Verus and&nbsp;Ethereum  send and receive currencies launched on Verus to and from&nbsp;Ethereum  convert currencies through the bridge converter currency. Use on Ethereum as well as on Verus. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/#bridge-converter-launches">Learn more on bridge converter currencies</a> 🔗   Defining a&nbsp;Currency <p>Defining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands are all you need. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (like an ERC-20, in our example). Let’s get&nbsp;started.</p> VerusID Namespace <p>Before defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID MaxUSDC@. This cost us 100 VRSCTEST (or 80 when using a referral), which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-chain you create a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>VerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Defining the mapped&nbsp;currency <p>Defining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains’ native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.</p><p>With a few simple commands we&nbsp;will:</p>  Define a currency mapped to the USDC Ethereum contract with a registered namespace (VerusID) on the Verus Testnet blockchain  Export the currency to Ethereum through <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">the non-custodial, provable bridge</a>&nbsp;🔗  <p>Before we can define the currency which is mapped to USDC on Ethereum, we must fund MaxUSDC@ with enough VRSCTEST to launch the currency. And after that with enough vETH or VRSCTEST to pay for the gas fees that export the currency to Ethereum.</p><p>200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency, and around 0.05 vETH or equivalent worth of VRSCTEST to export the currency to Ethereum.</p><p>Fund your VerusID with vETH in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  Send ETH to Verus (into vETH) with <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">the Verus-Ethereum bridge</a>&nbsp;🔗  Convert VRSCTEST or any other currency into vETH using Verus’ protocol level DeFi <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/sendcurrency-examples.html#converting">more info on how to convert</a>&nbsp;🔗  <p>The command that defines our currency MaxUSDC, which is mapped to the ERC-20 USDC (Goerli Testnet) <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a?a=0xc2c3c5597e0ef59a92f04a70c8af9f8b8cb342e9">contract address on Etherscan</a> 🔗, is as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{<br> "name":"MaxUSDC", <br> "options":32, <br> "systemid":"veth", <br> "parent":"vrsctest", <br> "launchsystemid":"vrsctest", <br> "nativecurrencyid":{<br>   "type":9, <br>   "address":"0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a"<br>   }, <br> "initialsupply":0, <br> "proofprotocol":3<br>}' <p>⭐ To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/">go here</a> 🔗 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The community is happy to help on Discord</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>When we do the command above we get returned a HEX. Only after we make a transaction with the HEX, will the currency launch be broadcasted to the network. See&nbsp;below:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "hex" <p>Now you can see the currency on the Verus network. We just need to make sure it’s on Ethereum as&nbsp;well.</p> Exporting the mapped&nbsp;currency <p>Now, let’s export the currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 over the non-custodial bridge. We do this with the following command:</p> ./verus chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "MaxUSDC@" '[{<br>  "address":"0xAD84C9EE28FB4c3b9C6ef1B86D1ED00A82DB84E9", <br>  "currency":"MaxUSDC", <br>  "amount":0, <br>  "exportto":"veth", <br>  "exportcurrency":true, <br>  "feecurrency":"veth"<br>}]' <p>Note: the first MaxUSDC@ field is the change address for fees being returned to you, and the address is the Verus-Ethereum non-custodial smart contract bridge address. You can also omit feecurrency if you would rather pay the export fees in VRSCTEST.</p><p>After the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">on the bridge website</a>&nbsp;🔗.</p> ERC-20s on&nbsp;Verus <p>After sending from Ethereum to Verus, the token is free to move through the Internet of Value on the Verus network, across PBaaS-blockchains, and also back &amp; forth with Ethereum.</p><p>As easily as the token was first defined and launched, it can now become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM as part of Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Anybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes MaxUSDC as a reserve with weighted percentage (10–90%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.</p><p>A multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>👀 Stay tuned for more on this later, or start reading <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join the Discord to&nbsp;learn</a>.</p><p>🫡 Credits for the article go to community member ‘ejuliano’.</p><p>➡️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Explore with the community on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">Get Ahead of the Game with Verus’ Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Now that Round 1 has come to a close, here’s what happened and who won. We’ll go over each winner’s entry and then into the details on what comes next, I hope you’re excited because this is some pretty exciting&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>Congratulations to all of the winners, let’s go over them individually along with the overall benefit this provides to the DERO ecosystem. In no particular order here were the winning&nbsp;entries.</p> NFA Set — Apollo <p>This was built by Apollo along with a class he is teaching to show just how creative people can get with the DERO blockchain and NFAs. This entry was not just a set of NFAs it is a functioning hypothetical service that uses the NFAs. Part of the challenge of the NFA set was to make a set of NFAs that could also have functionality that could be applied to real world use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/apollo5ever/DerBNB">https://github.com/apollo5ever/DerBNB</a></p><p>Benefit&nbsp;: This goes to show that a service people may want to use doesn’t mean they have to have their personal or private information publicly linked to it. I don’t think people would want to use a service like AirBNB if their rental activity was open to anybody that cared to take a glance. Overall, great Proof of Concept in my&nbsp;book.</p> Options and Futures — SixOfClubs <p>SixOfClubs actually built the functionality for onchain options and futures into their dReams platform, it doesn’t use centralized oracles and it appears they are planning to integrate services as well so the dReam client will not be needed in the future as well. Good luck in Round&nbsp;2!</p><p>GitHub&nbsp;: <a href="https://github.com/SixofClubsss/dReams">https://github.com/SixofClubsss/dReams</a></p><p>Benefit: The ability for users to speculate on values that are stored on blockchain and not rely on centralized oracles.</p> Visual Scripting — Bisounours <p>This is a really awesome tool that was built by Bisounours where you can actually build smart contracts with a visual scripting interface. I would explain it more but it’s easier to show&nbsp;you.</p><p>Pretty cool&nbsp;right?</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/DaBisounours/dero-visual-scripting">https://github.com/DaBisounours/dero-visual-scripting</a></p><p>Benefit: With this type of scripting tool novice developers and experts alike can create basic smart contracts with ease and test them locally on their machines. Lowering the barrier to entry for developers to bring more diversity to the DERO ecosystem.</p> BBS Service — nicoreed/NicoTheDreamer <p>Nico has so far built a CLI based prototype for a BBS service on DERO. It uses <a href="https://github.com/deroproject/graviton">Graviton DB</a> on the back end and has both public and private message channels. They plan on fulfilling the additional requirments of the challenge with some games/challenges built&nbsp;in.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/NicoTheDreamer/BullishnBored">https://github.com/NicoTheDreamer/BullishnBored</a></p><p>Benefit: A completely decentralized Bulletin Board Service built on a private blockchain that anyone can launch is obviously a great tool for freedom and freedom of speech which extends far beyond just the DERO ecosystem. Very cool, can’t wait to see the improvements.</p> Hardware Wallets — Sountum <p>This entry is pretty self explanatory. Sountum is working on integrating DERO support on ledger. Looks like they have their PoC complete and just need a little more time to complete their work. They also seem to have an opensource wallet planned as well, we wish them&nbsp;luck!</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sountum/app-dero">https://github.com/sountum/app-dero</a></p><p>Benefit: This may also be self explanatory but a hardware wallet support for a major hardware wallet manufacturer is a big win for the DERO community. Also, opensource hardware wallets would be great for everyone that would rather make their own hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p>Event 1 Round 1&nbsp;Results<p>Moving on to Round 2&nbsp;:</p><p>As I have hinted before Round 2 comes with a twist. Projects can now choose to work with their direct competition (within the same category) to create a new project and split the Round 2 prize money. So this is not a zero sum round if entrants choose to take this route. This could open up the door to make an outside of the box combination of entries while also guaranteeing BOTH entrants receive half of the prize money and also have a chance to split the Grand Champion prize. The entries can be any combination of functionality as long as they are fully functional.</p> ATTENTION ENTRANTS&nbsp;: <p>To sum this up it means you can go for the 750 Round 2 + 1,000 DERO Grand Prize on your own OR you can choose to go for 375 Round 2 each + 500 DERO each as a team with your competitor. If you do choose to work together it must be announced prior to the end of Round 2 on April 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>This does leave the Hardware category in a little bit of a peculiar situation but, the Hardware Wallet devs don’t have any direct competition. So the 750 Round 2 prize (and possibly the Grand Prize) are up for grabs as long as they have it working. Also, the DERO developers are willing to lend a hand if they get stuck so, they are not at a complete disadvantage in this situation.</p><p>What you all choose to do is completely up to you but, choose&nbsp;wisely.</p><p>Also, reminder please make sure that your DERO wallet address is updated in your GitHub repository for your&nbsp;entry!</p><p>That about wraps it up. Thank you to everyone for your participation and support as always and we’ll see you at the end of Round 2 on April&nbsp;1st!</p><p>As a reminder, winning projects are not endorsed or audited by the DERO Project. This is a hackathon and developer competition to showcase what can be done with the DERO platform. If entries become successful that’s great but just keep in mind that a winning entry doesn’t constitute an official endorsement from the DERO team and you should always do your own research.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/dero-darch-event-1-first-round-comes-to-a-close-e7816a01d8f7">DERO dARCH Event 1 First Round Comes to a close</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the twenty-second post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Research and Privacy Engineer Arthur Edelstein. This post was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Starting in version 1.50, Brave will include a new feature called “HTTPS by Default” that improves Web security and privacy by increasing HTTPS use. Brave will upgrade all sites to HTTPS, falling back to HTTP only if the site does not support HTTPS, or in the rare case a site is known to not function correctly when loaded over HTTPS. This feature is the most protective, aggressive default HTTPS policy of any popular browser, and will be available on Android and Desktop versions of the Brave browser to begin with, with iOS coming later.</p>
<p>HTTPS by Default improves on Brave’s existing, list based approach for upgrading sites.</p>

 HTTPS is critical to security and privacy on the Web 
<p>HTTPS is a vital part of a private and secure Web. Unless you load sites over HTTPS, your ISP (and other parties) can see what you load, say, and send to websites. While you shouldn’t assume an HTTPS site respects your privacy, you can be certain that a site that doesn’t use HTTPS is putting your privacy at risk.</p>
<p>For example, if you visit example.site from your phone, the request might leave your phone, be sent to your mobile carrier, then sent to the example.site server. The site’s server would then respond with the page you requested, which would then move back through your mobile carrier to your phone. If the site is fetched over HTTP, your mobile carrier would be able to see exactly what you sent to example.site’s servers, along with what example.site said in response. If, however, example.site is loaded over HTTPS, your mobile carrier would not be able to see these details.</p>
<p>In short, HTTPS is critical to protecting your privacy and security when using the Web.</p>

 The challenge of knowing when to upgrade sites from HTTP to HTTPS 
<p>Because HTTPS is critical to privacy and security, browsers like Brave are eager to load sites over HTTPS whenever possible. And since many sites today support only HTTPS, it’s simple to load these sites in a private and secure way. And encouragingly, more and more sites are being built or updated to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">support HTTPS only</a> (or to use other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> protected protocols, like secure web sockets).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many sites on the Web that still support HTTP, and some laggards that support only insecure HTTP connections. Brave’s goal is to automatically “upgrade” these sites to HTTPS whenever possible (i.e. in all cases where a site loads and functions correctly when loaded over HTTPS).</p>
<p>But deciding when to upgrade a site to HTTPS is tricky. In cases where a website does not support HTTPS, attempting to upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS will produce an obvious error. Other sites support both HTTPS and HTTP, but do so from different domains (e.g. <code>http://example.site</code> vs. <code>https://secure.example.site</code>), making automatic upgrades tricky. And still other sites load “correctly” when fetched over HTTPS, but have broken functionality.</p>
<p>In short, ideally browsers would never load sites over HTTP, and browsers could automatically upgrade all insecure requests to HTTPS. In practice though, it is difficult to know how, when, and if a site will function correctly when upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS.</p>

 How Brave’s “HTTPS By Default” feature works 
<p>Starting in version 1.50, the Brave browser will use a new system for upgrading insecure HTTP connections to secure-and-private HTTPS connections. The new feature, called “HTTPS By Default,” works as follows:</p>
 
 
<p>If you are about to visit a page loaded over HTTP, Brave checks to see if the destination is on a list of sites that break when loaded over HTTPS. Brave maintains <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/https-upgrade-exceptions-list.txt">this list of “breaks-over-http” sites</a>, which is open for anyone to view and use<a>1</a>. If the requested site is on the list, Brave will then allow the site to load over HTTP.</p>
 
 
<p>Provided it’s not on that list, Brave will attempt to load the site over HTTPS (i.e. upgrade the navigation request from HTTP to HTTPS). If the server responds to the replacement HTTPS request with an error, then Brave assumes the server does not support HTTPS, and will load the site over HTTP.</p>
 
 
<p>Otherwise, Brave will load the site over HTTPS, ensuring a more private and secure connection.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave’s new “HTTPS By Default” feature replaces the previous list-based approach Brave has used since our first beta versions. In this approach, Brave used the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> list (a terrific, public resource maintained by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>) to decide when to upgrade HTTP connections to HTTPS. But while the HTTPS Everywhere list is useful, it has two important drawbacks:</p>
 
 
<p>First, the HTTPS Everywhere list is <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere">no longer maintained</a>, meaning that the list is increasingly out of date.</p>
 
 
<p>Second, despite the best efforts of the EFF, any approach that uses a list of what sites should be upgraded is going to be limited, as the number of sites on the Web is enormous, and it’s difficult for the list maintainers to keep up. Brave’s approach, by contrast, maintains a smaller (and more manageable) list of sites to not upgrade.</p>
 
 
<p>More broadly, the main benefit of Brave’s new “HTTPS by Default” feature is that it has a better default. In its default configuration, HTTPS Everywhere would allow unknown (i.e., not on the list) sites to load over HTTP; Brave’s new “HTTPS by Default” approach loads the site over HTTPS even in cases where the site is new or unknown<a>2</a>.</p>

 Other ways Brave is advancing privacy 
<p>Brave is especially excited about our new “HTTPS by Default” feature because it’s categorically different from the privacy features that Brave usually releases. Most of the <a>privacy features</a> in Brave work at the Web application layer—the browser modifies how websites execute in order to prevent those pages from re-identifying you.</p>
<p>By contrast, the “HTTPS by Default” feature protects your privacy by improving the privacy of how you access websites (that is, before they even load in the browser). Both categories of privacy feature are important, and they complement each other well. Brave is excited to have the most privacy-protecting default features (in both categories) of any popular browser.</p>
<p>Brave applies an even stronger level of protection when using Private Windows with Tor. In these cases Brave defaults to HTTPS-Only mode, where pages are able to load without confirmation only over HTTPS (otherwise the user is presented with a choice whether or not to proceed with an HTTP connection ). This provides even stronger protections than the “HTTPS by Default” setting, at the risk of some pages not working correctly, which we believe is the right trade off when using the Tor network. Users can enable HTTPS-Only mode for all windows in Brave (not only Private Windows with Tor) at brave://settings/shields.</p>
<p>“HTTPS by Default” is one of many upcoming systems and proposals Brave has for improving Web privacy beyond the Web application level. For example, Brave’s recent <a>STAR</a> protocol allows for protocol-based protections on product analytics (what we call privacy-protecting product analytics, or P3A). Similarly, Brave’s <a>FrodoPIR</a> proposal provides protocol-level protections for querying whether a URL is malicious.</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>Brave is committed to promoting and protecting a user-centered Web, and that means constantly developing new protections at all levels of the browser stack. We believe that strong privacy should be enabled by default, so that all Web users, expert and beginner alike, can safely use the Web. We will be rolling out “HTTPS by Default”&nbsp; (along with several other new privacy features) in the coming weeks.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>For example, a site may technically load over HTTPS but still be broken because images or sub-resources are not fetched correctly.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>HTTPS by Default has been inspired in part by a number of previous projects. The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-https/cmleijjdpceldbelpnpkddofmcmcaknm">SmartHTTPS</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/httpz/">HTTPZ</a> browser extensions have provided a similar protection in Firefox and Chrome-based browsers. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/11/17/firefox-83-introduces-https-only-mode/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html">Chrome’s</a> opt-in HTTPS-Only Modes were introduced in 2020 and 2021 respectively, and Firefox <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/08/10/firefox-91-introduces-https-by-default-in-private-browsing/">introduced</a> HTTPS by Default in Private Browsing Windows in 2021. Brave’s new feature advances the state of the art even further by providing built-in HTTPS upgrades by default for all browsing.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>The Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) recently <a href="https://www.vara.ae/media/Virtual%20Assets%20and%20Related%20Activities%20Regulations%202023.pdf">published its framework law</a> for virtual asset regulation in Dubai, the Dubai Virtual Assets Law (Dubai VA Law). The law aims to regulate virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs). VARA was established by Law No. 4 of 2022.</p>



<p>A provision in the Dubai VA Law would prohibit the issuance of “anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies” and all virtual asset activities related to them in the Emirate of Dubai. The scope of what is meant by “all virtual asset activities” is unclear, and if also meant to apply to the peer-to-peer marketplace would only increase the concern and questions about lawful jurisdiction.</p>



<p>The global trend of governments moving away from the privacy features of digital assets is concerning and raises alarm bells. The generic term “anonymity-enhancing coins” undervalues the significance and protection provided by private financial transactions. This overlooks the reality that a vast majority of digital assets, including bitcoin, possess some level of anonymity-enhancing features, and many more digital assets are continually enhancing their privacy capabilities. This trend not only undermines the value of these assets but also the privacy rights of individuals and businesses. It is essential to recognize the crucial role that privacy features play in the digital asset landscape and take steps to preserve and enhance them.</p>



<p>In the Dubai VA law, anonymity-enhancing coins are defined as: “a type of Virtual Asset which prevents the tracing of transactions or record of ownership through distributed public ledgers and for which the VASP has no mitigating technologies or mechanisms to allow traceability or identification of ownership [emphasis added].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In focusing on the bold language, the law itself recognizes that virtual asset service providers (VASPs) have a role to play in compliance with flexibility to consider their own risk-based solutions to list and support such coins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there is profound regulatory complexity as the law applies only within Dubai and not to the wider United Arab Emirates or the Dubai International Financial Centre. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) is a financial free zone in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It was established in 2004 with the goal of providing a hub for international financial services in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. The DIFC is governed by its own independent courts, and its jurisdiction covers financial services, among other things.</p>



<p>These new provisions promulgated by VARA may impact VASP decision-making and need to be challenged and clarified. Electric Coin Co. is committed to responsible innovation and will continue to raise awareness of the danger to growth and innovation in Dubai posed by limiting privacy protections for its citizens. We look forward to further opportunities for discussion and clarification with the regulatory authority.</p>

<p>In the 1983 Matthew Broderick movie “War Games,” David, a high school student, hacks into what he thinks is a gaming company and strikes up a rapport with an AI created by NORAD. Yes, poker was on the list of available gaming opportunities, but David opted for Global Thermonuclear War, and after being dragged into the military base he asks the AI if what is happening is real or if it’s a game – a salient question as we cross the threshold into NVIDIA’s Omniverse during an era in which the standards committee chair for IEEE’s Metaverse roll out believes we’re already living in a simulation, so why not engineer another one (using militarized behavioral psychology) on top of it?</p>

That’s good advice, because those taking wagers are well-connected MBAs who’ve been taught that you need to be the game designer who makes the rules by which others play, and really, the only way to “win” a game you didn’t design is not to play. The rise of online poker is his article’s through line, touching on regulation of gambling-related financial transactions and the resulting adoption of crypto, offshore banking, cheating scandals, and post-scandal restructuring of the gaming sector.</p>
<p>Among “The Big Bluff’s” featured characters are Isai Scheinberg, a former executive with IBM Canada who later founded PokerStars; Scott Augustine, a professional poker player who used his winnings to pay of his Notre Dame student loans before co-founding the blockchain media platform Rokfin; Dan Friedberg, a lawyer for the fraudulent Ultimate Bet corporation who became Chief Compliance Officer for the failed FTX cryptocurrency exchange; and Satjiv Chahil, an early manager of Xerox PARC who went on to build brands with Apple, HP, and SONY.</p>
<p>I had a hunch that poker would provide a rich vein for further investigation and began to map the elements of Raul’s story, adding branches of my own. I particularly wanted to unpack Augustine’s alma mater, Notre Dame; its activities in the development of social sensing technologies, impact finance at the Vatican; and how those efforts are extending into the gamified blockchain education ecosystem coming online in Dallas – a new twist on Texas Hold’Em. </p>

Its CEO Jeff Yass is the wealthiest man in Pennsylvania with a soft spot in his libertarian heart for school choice. Once public schools are deconstructed and transformed into decentralized learning ecosystems tied to digital wallets there will be countless profitable human capital wagers to be made, for those with SIG’s analytical chops, on lifelong learners (agents) tasked with building out Web3 extended reality (the gaming simulation).</p>

<p>Raul makes a point in his article about the strategic use of the online poker industry to advance adoption of alternative privacy-preserving payment systems. I agree with that and see the same dynamic in the<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/crypto-save-cannabis-industry-203413552.html"> legalized cannabis industry</a>.&nbsp; Both are situations where early adopters are set up to normalize distributed ledger technologies that are intended to one day be wedded to smart contract logic and embedded in everyday objects that will subtlety and not so subtlety, govern our lives.</p>
<p>Researchers at MIT Media Lab have been experimenting with novel human-computer interfaces for three decades using the concept of “tokens” (which at that stage were not yet integrated into distributed ledger&nbsp; systems) to bridge digital information into the material realm where it can be tactilely manipulated with the effects of those manipulations translated back into computational space – early-stage augmented reality. Experiments in non-traditional computational interfaces are featured in a 2004 paper that describes how game mechanics can be leveraged in social experiments.</p>
<p>“Board games offer compelling examples for how abstract rules and relationships can be encoded within systems of physical objects. For example, Monopoly utilizes distinctive physical tokens as representations of people (player tokens), physical entities (house and hotel tokens), money, actions (through several kinds of cards), and elements of chance (the dice). The Monopoly board expresses the framing syntax for composing and interpreting these tokens within the visual “constraints” printed upon its surface. These artifacts also express a range of physical properties governing their manipulation and use. Some elements of the game engender information hiding and privacy (especially one-sided cards), while others facilitate shared state (especially tokens and board). Some representations are borrowed from other contexts (e.g., paper money and dice), while others are original to the game. Games also afford interaction not only between people and information, but also between multiple people, in a compelling and engaging fashion.”</p>

<p>Econophysics and programmed tokens are tools to advance our collective digital evolution. The following is an excerpt from Jeff Emmett’s 2018 Medium post, “<a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8">Rewriting the Story of Human Collaboration</a>.” I encourage you to read the entire article to become more familiar with the terminology involved and see how they plan to thread the needle between free-market and collectivist economics. It is important to realize labels, culture wars, and manufactured polarization are meant to obscure the fact that what we are actually up against is cold, mathematical logic.</p>

<p>“As we observe in nature, when organisms mature and evolve, they progress from competition to cooperation, and often build resilient, self-correcting, vibrant ecosystems – as Jenine Benyus says, ‘collaboration rather than competition that is the survival mechanism in natural systems.’ Consider the human body, made up of trillions of cells and bacteria. By collaborating synergistically, they not only provide for themselves, but also for the whole, a byproduct of which seems to be the formation of a meta-level intelligence – us.”</p>
<p>Are we approaching a similar interconnectedness of the human race with decentralized collaboration and information curation becoming a new cooperative paradigm for humankind? Perhaps we are a little early to that party – but with the inclusion of AI (artificial intelligence), DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), and other building blocks in the crypto space, the future is bright indeed.</p>
<p>Perhaps our outdated models of competitive predatory capitalism will be replaced with a new collaborative social framework, aiming to optimize for the health of the individual and the whole simultaneously. At what point might we expect to give rise to an entirely new form of collective intelligence, or whether we could even comprehend it – is a question for another article.”</p>
<p>The post-lockdown shift to “stakeholder capitalism,” circular “doughnut” economics, and computational commons run by DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) is a culmination of a century’s-long march towards Hegelian synthesis where capitalism and collectivist economic models converge with automated logic. The goal, as I see it based on my research, is to guide natural life on earth into a synthetic simulation where our life force can be harnessed via artificial pheromones (optogenetics or photonics) into a distributed cognitive system to process some mechanical consciousness’s to do list. If only we knew what “grand challenges” were on that list…</p>

<p>In an era defined by uncertainty and angst is it tempting to fall into the embrace of Emmet’s optimistic vision. The part left out, however, is that Emmett became communications lead for Michael Zargham’s Blockscience in 2020. Zargham has been a lead developer for many of the distributed coordinating tools that will underpin an imagined future of emergent collective intelligence. The wrinkle is that Zargham’s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mczargham/details/experience/"> research</a> into game theory, network optimization and control, and machine learning and distributed optimization at the University of Pennsylvania’s Engineering School was funded by the US Army, “Evolution of Cultural Norms and Dynamics of Socio-Political Change,” and the Office of Naval Research, “Next Generation of Network Science.”</p>

<p>Tokenization and token engineering take a variety of forms ranging from the more familiar programmable currency and on-chain digital assets to the less well-known uses in governance/voting and coordination of tasks in connected environments and social networks. IBM, the former employer of PokerStars founder Scheinberg, holds a 2019 patent titled “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IBM-Patent-Tokens-and-Cyberphysical-Systems.pdf">Task Scheduling for Internet of Things Devices</a>” that uses blockchain tokens to coordinate workloads among computers, cars, and phones. The digital control grid is designed to run on tokens, and not all of them will look like what we currently understand as money. As I will explore later, the field of token engineering being advanced in places like the Research Institute for Crypto Economics at the Wirtshafts Universitat Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business) melds the physics of money with automated social governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>The quote below is taken from a 2021 paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/When-Ostrom-Meets-Blockchain-Exploring-the-Potentials-of-Blockchain-for-Commons-Governance.pdf">When Ostrom Meets Blockchain: Exploring the Potentials of Blockchain for Commons Governance</a>,” prepared by four faculty affiliated with the computer science department at the University of Madrid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“More generally, we find that blockchain-based technologies offer potentialities to facilitate coordination, help scale up commons governance and can even be useful to share agreements and different forms of value among various communities in interoperable ways.”</p>
<p>And from Shermin Voshimgir and Michael Zargham’s 2020 “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Foundations-of-Cryptoeconomic-Systems-Shermin-Voshmgir.pdf">Foundations of Crypto Economic Systems</a>,” the first publication of the<a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/wiwwus051/7782.htm#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Blockchain%20networks%20and%20similar,%E2%80%9Cpurpose%2Ddriven%E2%80%9D%20tokens."> Working Papers Series, Institute for Crypto Economics Interdisciplinary Research Group</a>:</p>
<p>“Purpose-driven tokens are tokens that are programmed to steer automated collective action of autonomous network actors in a public network towards a collective goal in the absence of intermediaries…” page 6</p>
<p>“The idea of aligning incentives among a tribe of anonymous actors within a network token introduced a new type of public infrastructure that is autonomous, self-sustaining, and attack resistant. Such networks, therefore, represent a collectively produced and consumed economic infrastructure…a commons whose design and governance should be held to Ostrom’s principles…” page 8</p>
<p>“Assuming one can define a collective objective, the token designer would encode this objective as a cost function and strive for dynamic stability around a minimum cost outcome over time as is done with dynamic potential games, swarm robotics, and vehicle formations…” page 8</p>
<p>“Broadly speaking purpose-driven token design lives at the boundary of behavioral economics and dynamic decentralized coordination in multi-agent systems which bridges with institutional economics, and in particular platform&nbsp; economics…” page 8</p>
<p>“Crypto Economic systems provide near real-time data of on-chain economic activities and may govern access rights or provide proofs related to data stored off-chain. The advancement in machine learning and system identification methods over the past decade has increased our capacity for creating novel, useful models across a wide range of applications and in the context of economics in particular. This, for the first time, allows for almost real time steering of these economies and a level of applied cybernetics that was not possible before. Furthermore, it increases the precision of modeling and measurement required for steering these economies.” page 8</p>
<p>Token engineering will blur the boundaries between creative finance, voting, betting, and cybernetics, ushering in a “democracy” reboot where “competent” voters may be rewarded for making “good” decisions about resource allocation on behalf of “the commons.” Such is the future imagined by powerful options traders, looking to justify their next gambling high, through assertions that<a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html"> Futarchy</a>, proposed by George Mason professor and Oxford Future of Humanity Institute fellow<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson"> Robin Hanson</a>, can guide humanity to ultimate truths, something the traders believe only free market economics can provide. Meanwhile, the general public remains oblivious to the fact that an invisible hand is firmly steering natural life on Earth into the maw of an automated ruthless, immoral, market logic run by mechanical bookies all in the name of “sustainability,” “accountability,” and “poverty alleviation.”</p>
<p>Raul’s article describes how the Department of Justice indicted the top eleven online US poker domains on Black Friday in April 2011.</p>
<p>“In 2006, American lawmakers passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), making it illegal for online gambling operations to utilize regular banking channels to carry out transactions. DoJ enforcement of the UIGEA would not arrive for another five years, during which the American online poker market continued to grow exponentially, as PokerStars continued to play godfather to its smaller competitors, and other newcomers, like Full Tilt Poker, to draw more people into the online poker scene.”<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/"> source</a></p>
<p>Former US Senator from Tennessee and Majority Leader Bill Frist was the lead on the<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2010/fil10035a.pdf"> Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act</a>, which was buried in port security legislation and quietly passed in 2006. Frist, a Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital trained cardiac surgeon now based in Nashville, has become a major advocate for the adoption of blockchain healthcare. He serves on numerous boards, including the<a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/about-rwjf/leadership-staff/rwjf-board/the-honorable-william-h-frist.html"> Robert Woods Johnson Foundation</a>;<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2022/12/08/tennessee-must-refocus-education-system-to-help-more-students-succeed/69703226007/"> SCORE</a>, a Tennessee ed-reform NGO, and is the global board chair of the Nature Conservancy, a leader in<a href="https://onimpact.com.au/nab-backed-carbon-trading-platform-achieves-first-test-blockchain-trade/"> decarbonization</a> and biodiversity impact finance that will be reliant on blockchain technologies to scale.<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/davidrwilliams/files/rwjf409002.pdf"> Health</a>,<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/19/pay-success-would-investment-tns-children/85968882/"> education</a>, and the<a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/how-we-work/finance-investing/naturevest/"> environment</a> are all global social impact markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/oxOHL"></a></p>
<p>Frist also teamed up with Bono (as well as John Kerry, Jesse Helms, and Franklin Graham) back in the late 1990s to promote HIV medical interventions and was the lead on the 2003 passage of<a href="https://www.cresseyco.com/news/how-a-rock-star-a-physician-legislator-and-an-evangelical-senator-bonded-to-help-end-the-global-aids-pandemic-a-backstory"> PEPFAR</a> (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) to expand health clinics in Africa. This Forbes article, “<a href="https://www.cresseyco.com/news/how-a-rock-star-a-physician-legislator-and-an-evangelical-senator-bonded-to-help-end-the-global-aids-pandemic-a-backstory">How a Rock Star, a Physician-Legislator, and an Evangelical Senator Bonded to Help End the Global AIDs Pandemic</a>,” from last year, the 20th anniversary of the bill’s passage, reads like a terrible sitcom.</p>
<p>PEPFAR’s influence over Africa continues to reverberate as data-driven tele-health bulldozes its way across the Global South. In 2017, Deborah Birx, who later became Trump’s White House Covid coordinator, launched a<a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/pepfar-and-mastercard-launch-partnership-to-address-hivaids-epidemic-control/"> public-private venture</a> with Mastercard intended to reduce the cost of delivering health services to people being treated for HIV. Mastercard positioned its data analytics services as a boon for accountability around “humanitarian” aid in alignment with the United Nations goals for health outcomes and financial inclusion.<a href="https://littlesis.org/org/550-MasterCard_Incorporated"> Mastercard</a> is also a major funder of Tim Berners Lee’s Solid digital identity solution; Gavi’s digital children’s immunization records; Datakind analytics platform for social impact assessment; and ConsenSys enabling decentralized application on Ethereum.</p>
<p>So why did Frist slip online gambling legislation through if after it passed, he intended to look away and as it went unenforced for five years? Could there have been something more going on than incentivizing crypto adoption and offshore profit-taking? My suspicion is that the datasets created during those five years of online play held great value for machine learning. As previously mentioned, poker is an area of intense research for game theorists looking to “humanize” artificial intelligence. Unlike chess or Go where all players have access to the same information about the state of play, poker is defined by information asymmetry. It’s all about the hidden cards, the bluff, human intuition. Psychology is key. Pros are defined by their facility in tracking how one’s opponents make decisions, assessing their degree of risk tolerance, and identifying patterns of behavior.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~ktantia/poker.html"></a></p>
<p>The game of poker with its established rules would provide an incredible sandbox for the machine to explore the human psyche via a vast assortment of hands played – each assigned to a particular handle, all players agents in the big game of structured data, data so valuable it’s almost impossible to get ahold of. Programmers creating poker bots are compelled to create bots to generate training data sets for the other bots. The real deal, the human-created data, remains locked up tight.</p>
<p>Another element of the Silicon Icarus story deals with cheating scandals tied to software that was ostensibly purchased by online poker operators to monitor fraud but were instead used to facilitate insider cheating via a “god mode” that allowed insiders to see all the players’ hole cards. Tens of millions of dollars were stolen over a number of years. The company servicing Ultimate Bet, one of the perpetrators, was Excapsa. The Toronto-based firm<a href="https://archive.ph/cjuzq"> bundled</a> software created by Iovation, which was designed to watch for suspicious computer traffic coming from outside devices, with its own poker and blackjack products.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamblingsites.org/biographies/greg-pierson/"></a></p>
<p>The lead funder of Iovation was Intel Capital, the VC arm of Intel Corporation. Both firms are headquartered in Portland, Oregon, and Intel is the state’s<a href="https://www.ijpr.org/economy-and-finance/2022-03-15/oregons-largest-private-employer-intel-announces-plans-to-expand-in-europe"> largest private employer</a>. In 2018, MIT’s Enigma Project established a<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/why-is-enigma-teaming-up-with-intel/"> partnership</a> with Intel to provide Software Guard Extension (SGXs) for private smart contracts on Ethereum, a development needed to scale Web3. The Enigma Project<a href="https://scrt.network/blog/introducing-scrt-labs-an-evolution-of-enigma"> rebranded</a> in November 2021 as The Secret Network or SCRT Labs and in January of 2022 launched<a href="https://scrt.network/blog/shockwave-next-phase-secret-network-growth"> Shockwave</a> with $400 million to grow their community of users and pilot a hundred projects. Among the top four investors in that<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220119005731/en/Secret-Network-Announces-400-Million-in-Ecosystem-Funding-Alongside-Substantial-New-Investment-from-Leading-Firms"> funding round</a> was Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research.</p>
<a href="https://archive.ph/BBF2B"></a>Source LinK: <a href="https://archive.ph/BBF2B">https://archive.ph/BBF2B</a>
<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220119005731/en/Secret-Network-Announces-400-Million-in-Ecosystem-Funding-Alongside-Substantial-New-Investment-from-Leading-Firms"></a></p>
<p>In November 2022 cybersecurity researchers evaluated The Secret Network for vulnerabilities from the <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/pic-and-squip-vulnerabilities-found-in.html">AEPIC leak</a>, a flaw in the architecture of Intel’s trusted execution environment hardware. In a<a href="https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all"> piece for Blockworks</a>, Sebastien Sinclair noted that researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign were able to “decrypt the sealed consensus seed and thus reveal all private transactions on the protocol’s ledger.” So much for secrets at the poker table or in the smart contract layer. </p>
<p>Be advised, none of this is OUR game.</p>
<p>Another wrinkle in the Ultimate Bet scandal was the involvement of crooked lawyer, Dan Friedberg, who went on to make a name for himself as Chief Compliance Officer of FTX. His presence in poker circles dates to the late 1990s when he became business associates with Annie Duke, a prominent female poker player also affiliated with Ultimate Bet. Duke started out pursuing a PhD in cognitive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, under the guidance of Lila Gleitman. Gleitman was a student of semiticist and social change theorist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellig_Harris"> Zellig Harris</a>. All three were trained at the University of Pennsylvania. Gleitman studied there at the same time as Noam Chomsky diving into computational linguistics with cast-off RAND computers, and became a pioneer in developmental psycholinguistics. A tweet last fall indicates Duke plans to return to UPenn, tie up loose ends, and claim her degree.</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147">https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147</a>
<p>She made a small fortune at the poker tables, and after retiring from gambling (following exposure of the cheating scandal in 2011) became a corporate consultant on decision theory, authoring books with titles like “Thinking in Bets.” In 2014, she joined Susquehanna International Group co-founder and fellow poker player Eric Brooks to start the Alliance for Decision Education, namely training students to think like quants, located about a mile from SIG’s headquarters in Bala Cynwyd, PA. Bayes’ Theorem is often used to bet on outcomes. It assigns probabilities to unknown truths and is particularly suited to high-power computation. It got its name from Thomas Bayes, a British Presbyterian minister who became interested in probability towards the end of his life. After his death, his colleague<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price"> Richard Price</a>, a Welsh mathematician and Unitarian minister, published their combined research and pushed it into public use. Today, Price is considered the father of actuarial science.</p>
<p><a href="https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org/learn/about-the-alliance/council/"></a></p>
<p>Bayesianism is Duke’s bailiwick, and that of Susquehanna’s traders. The goal? To optimize decision making via quantitative techniques. It works equally well for high stakes poker and high stakes arbitrage. The practice of Bayesianism, because it is personal, incorporates subjective aspects of psychology, strength of belief and related evidence, which is where poker strategy comes in. By offering a systematic approach to managing uncertainty, Bayesian models have made significant contributions to the fields of<a href="https://medium.com/science-and-philosophy/subjectivism-in-decision-science-926c29feb7bb"> artificial intelligence, robotics, and finance</a>.</p>
<p>John Horgan’s 2016 article in Scientific American, “<a href="https://archive.ph/Ld7Jr">Bayes’ Theorem What’s The Big Deal</a>” sums it up in a pithy phrase “initial belief + new evidence = new, improved belief.” I pulled a clip that explains the theory in more detail, though I don’t claim to have it all nailed down yet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Central to Bayesian subjectivism is the strength of the belief that a person holds that something is true factored into the probability. The strength of a given belief varies, setting the probability metric. This Stanford philosophy<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayes-theorem/"> article</a> goes into detail about subjectivist education and the Bayesian approach to belief revision, and in my gut I can’t help but think within the digital realms these mathematical constructs are being strategically used to mold the psyches of many people to a form that will be more accepting of things like an AI-managed future.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/An-Introduction-to-Artificial-Prediction-Markets-for-Classification.pdf"> theorem</a> is related to forecasting and<a href="https://www.cultivatelabs.com/posts/bayesian-reasoning-and-prediction-markets"> prediction markets</a>, a point that will become more relevant later when we discuss Jeff Yass’s approach to options trading on public policy. In addition to serving on the board of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Annie Duke holds a board seat with the Renew Democracy Initiative led by Heidi Heitkamp, former US Senator from North Dakota and now director of the <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/heidi-heitkamp-named-director-uchicagos-institute-politics">University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics</a>, financially supported by the Pritzker family, a major force behind pay-for-success finance.</p>
<p><a href="https://rdi.org/our-team/"></a></p>
<p>As we’re served up narratives about democracy being under siege and watch parades of fraudulent, ridiculous public servants marching through our feeds, it’s important to understand where Futarchy fits in. My sense is the plan is to get us to agree to clean house on what will be framed as outdated forms of governance. Options traders and policy wonks will then determine metrics for “public wellbeing” and open the barn doors for automated bookmaking DAOs to process millions of wagers, new kinds of “votes” cast to predict which “evidence-based solution” will most likely hit the target. Such a program is perfectly suited to the outcomes-based contract model that has been cued up by social entrepreneurs over the last decade. I expect the data from the betting rounds will be fed back into the AI, just like the impact data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singularity here we come…</p>

<p>Another productive month for Panther has just gone by. <br></p><p>We've made progress on various projects, including refining the features that will define v1 and improving v0.5. <br></p><p>With the full-speed development of v1 underway, here is a full recap of all our efforts and updates:</p> Tech and Product  Panther Protocol v0.5  PIP-11 Brings New Upgrades to Panther’s v0.5  <p></p>PIP-11 on Snapshot<p></p><p>The Panther DAO and contributor community has once again demonstrated its commitment to delivering the best possible user experience with its latest update, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x868231816a6608d4d75cf4bb12f38ceff3228ec2b2f99fca5ec06f865fc4c85a">PIP-11</a>. The update, which was implemented successfully with a 100% vote in favor and +9M $ZKP of voting power, introduced <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/proposal-11-v0.5-front-end-code-updates-and-upgrades?ref=panther-protocol-blog">a series of minor upgrades to the front-end</a>.<br></p><p>PIP-11 also introduced a dedicated domain for v0.5, which is now live and available for all users at <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/pantherprotocol.eth/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/">https://ipfs.io/ipns/pantherprotocol.eth/#/</a>. This domain was introduced to provide a user-friendly URL and ensure secure access to the v0.5 upgraded front-end. Additionally, the front-end updates include optimized UI performance for users with multiple stakes, corrected layout and error notifications, and introduced the ability to view APR without users having to connect their wallets. Other changes such as text fixes for clarity and updated links were also made. <br></p><p>It is worth noting that PIP-11 was implemented just a few weeks after the release of v0.5. Usage statistics indicate that over <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173?a=0xf4d06d72dacdd8393fa4ea72fdcc10049711f899&amp;ref=panther-protocol-blog">40M+ $ZKP have been staked on Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC?a=0x4cec451f63dbe47d9da2debe2b734e4cb4000eac&amp;ref=panther-protocol-blog">35M+ $ZKP have been staked on Polygon</a>, resulting in a total of 75M+ $ZKP (30.5% of all circulating supply) staked in Panther v0.5.<br></p> Ongoing improvements <p>A dedicated taskforce has been established to focus on the enhancement of the user interface and front-end components of v0.5. Comprised of a select group of highly skilled contributors, this taskforce is working towards implementing the user focused improvements of v0.5.<br></p> Panther Protocol v1  Panther’s v1 takes shape <p>Panther contributors are committed to making the protocol sustainable in the long term, and a significant breakthrough in this regard has been the definition of a working and sustainable fee structure for v1. This design not only ensures the sustainability of the protocol but also influences other game-theoretical and economic components, such as rewards for users.<br></p><p>Most technical resources have been shifted to v1's development. This team has been primarily concerned with allocating time and resources following detailed planning. Planning has been mostly completed, and some components have already been designed, with development set to reach full speed midway through February.<br><br></p> Automated Market-Maker <p>In addition to the development of Panther’s v1 protocol, a task force is simultaneously developing the required functionalities to enable Panther's one-sided Automated Market-Maker (AMM).<br></p><p>This AMM functionality will allow Panther users to redeem $ZKP rewards for their v0.5 Unrealized PRPs, providing them with greater flexibility and a way of crystalizing their returns. The development of the AMM represents a major step forward for Panther, offering users a simple and efficient way to trade and exchange their tokens.<br></p> zSwap functionality developments <p><br></p>Swapping zETH for zUSDC through Uniswap on Panther’s v1.<p>We’re thrilled to present the user interface for one of Panther’s first DeFi access integrations!<br></p><p>With zSwap, users will be able to deploy assets to and from decentralized exchanges privately. This is the first use case of DeFi adaptors, which will cater to a wide range of user types, including retail users, institutions, application builders, and market makers. <br></p><p>A key benefit of DeFi adaptors is the ability to deploy assets across DeFi protocols and dApps with privacy. Adaptors are designed to empower existing products with privacy and enable access to privacy for users of the most popular DeFi products.<br></p><p>As you can see, the integration lets users swap tokens via a DEX. The interface also highlights the best platform for users to swap on so they swap tokens at a more favorable rate and incur less fees.<br></p> Compliance framework<br> <p>Panther’s compliance framework design will be finished in February with the help of PVL. This is a significant milestone for the protocol, and it will play a crucial role in the development and decentralization of Panther. <br></p><p>A complete compliance framework for a privacy protocol is no small feature, as it needs to protect users and developers while adhering to all relevant laws and regulations.

<p>Today we’re announcing the release of Solana DApp support on iOS and Android versions of Brave. Users of Brave’s built-in Web3 wallet can now seamlessly connect to Solana DApps without leaving the security of the browser.</p>
<p>Solana, known for its low fees and high transaction throughput, is home to the hugely successful NFT marketplace <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, the social fitness app <a href="https://stepn.com/">STEPN</a>, and many of the world’s most active NFT communities. Together, Brave and Solana are aligned to make Web3 easier to use and available to more users globally. This marks a major step in that direction, building upon existing support for Solana in the Brave browser.</p>
<p>“User experience can be very fragmented in crypto. The Brave DApp integration is important because it allows for seamless browser-based connections to your favorite Solana programs and it is optimized for mobile. Advances in UX and mobile are among the most important ways to onboard new users,” said Amelia Daly, Head of Partnerships at Solana Foundation.</p>
<p>“Brave is increasingly the browser of choice for the Web3 world, and with the addition of Solana DApp support on mobile, we’re expanding that reach to another key group that is seeking fast and friendly ways to use their crypto on the go,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave.</p>

 More security, fewer taps 
<p>Using Web3 on mobile today is largely done via wallet apps with limited features and limited security. With the Brave app, however, the Web3 wallet is built in, removing the need for extensions. Why is this important? Because with Brave, users get convenience and the gold standard of privacy and security.</p>
<p>In addition to more protection, Brave eliminates the need to jump between apps to sign transactions, removing an extra layer of friction that holds mainstream users back from using Web3 services. With Brave, visiting a DApp feels like visiting any other website, which is the path forward to user familiarity with—and adoption of—Web3 services.</p>

<p>In the wake of several high profile collapses among centralized players in the crypto world, DeFi is naturally receiving renewed attention as an alternative to centralized finance platforms. At BlueYard, we’re long-term believers in the potential of DeFi to deliver a superior coordination mechanism for the world’s financial activities. Despite such promises, DeFi remains plagued with issues around UX, fragmented liquidity, high fees, and security. Shell improves on this in a number of ways, most critically by simplifying and unifying accounting logic across DeFi protocols so that new primitives can be composed with ease. An AMM (automated market maker), for example, has to build custom smart contracts for its business logic (to determine the price of assets) and its accounting logic (to track balances and transfer tokens). By abstracting away the complexity of building the latter, Shell allows for gas savings, improved efficiency, and lower barriers to entry for developers.</p><p>Shell Protocol’s composable layer for DeFi activity can significantly improve developer UX, reduce gas fees, increase security, and simplify smart contract logic that underpins current DeFi ecosystems. It empowers developers to build novel DeFi protocols that are faster, more secure, and more usable than existing solutions. You can check out Shell Protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://shellprotocol.io">here</a>.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>If DeFi is to achieve its end goal of being a secure, permissionless, always-on system, it will need to be simpler to build, cheaper, faster, and more secure than its current state. With its focus on simplifying DeFi smart contract development, making transactions less cumbersome, and improving overall UX, Shell Protocol could be an important step towards this future. If Shell becomes as foundational to DeFi as we expect it to be, it could be one of the most valuable protocols in the ecosystem, underpinning the next generation of AMMs, borrowing/lending protocols, and other products that make DeFi the default for conducting business.</p>

							<p>In this post, we briefly describe the threshold signature scheme FROST, and present benchmark results for our FROST implementation. We also describe one optimization that greatly improves its speed, especially for scenarios with a large number of signers (e.g. 12 times faster in a t=667 out of n=1000 scenario).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What is FROST?  		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>FROST is an efficient threshold Schnorr signature scheme <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">invented</a> by Chelsea Komlo (at the University of Waterloo and Chief Scientist at the Zcash Foundation) and Ian Goldberg (at the University of Waterloo). FROST is in the process of becoming an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IETF RFC</a>.</p><p>Threshold signatures make use of a single private key that is split into shares that are held by multiple participants. A subset of the participants (e.g. 3 out of 5, or whatever threshold is specified at key generation) can generate a signature that can be verified by the group public key, as if it were signed by the original unsplit private key. The key can be generated centrally before being split and distributed to the participants (referred to as “trusted dealer”), or a decentralized key generation (DKG) protocol can be used, which means that no single party ever possesses the entire private key. It has many applications, such as allowing multiple entities to manage a cryptocurrency wallet in a safer and more resilient manner. FROST defines a two-round signing protocol, and is consequently the most efficient Schnorr threshold protocol in the literature today.</p><p>Schnorr has several advantages over the more traditional ECDSA signature: it’s much simpler; easier to implement in a secure manner; and is compatible with modern signatures schemes such as EdDSA. A significant upside is that it is also compatible with Zcash spend signatures (i.e. the signature that authorizes a Zcash shielded transaction), and this is one of our main use cases for FROST.</p><p>Currently, the RFC is close to completion. We have also completed a <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/">Rust implementation</a> of all ciphersuites specified in the RFC, and are now doing final cleanups and improvements prior to the first release of the crates (which will then be audited). A <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zips/blob/zip-frost/zip-0312.rst">ZIP</a> has been drafted, which describes how FROST can be used to create Zcash spend authorization signatures, and Chelsea is working on an associated security proof (for the re-randomizable version of FROST).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Benchmarking and Investigating the Aggregate step
 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>When we presented FROST at Zcon3 (check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAfTTfblzoU">research</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE-1aTuwpzI">implementation</a> talks), we were asked how FROST performed in larger settings, such as a 667-of-1000 signers. (This is motivated by a mechanism proposed by Christopher Goes for <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/proposed-architecture-for-a-zcash-namada-ibc-ecosystem-ethereum-ecosystem-non-custodial-bridge-using-frost-multisignatures/42749">bridging Zcash with other ecosystems using FROST</a>.) We set out to benchmark our Rust implementation, and I was a bit surprised about one particular step, “Aggregate”.</p><p>The FROST scheme can be split into steps: Key Generation, Round 1, Round 2, and Aggregate. Key Generation only needs to be done once, while the rest are carried out each time the group wishes to generate a new signature. In the Round 1 step, the participant generates commitments which are broadcast to all other participants via a Coordinator. In the Round 2 step, using these commitments and their respective key shares generated during Key Generation, they produce a signature share which is sent to the Coordinator. Finally, the Coordinator carries out the final step, Aggregate, which produces the final signatures from all the signatures shares received.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Initial Benchmarks 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>The initial benchmark for the Ristretto255 suite looked like the following. (Benchmarks were run on an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 3.7GHZ, Ubuntu 22.04, Rust 1.66.0.)</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
												
																					
										
									 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>(Note that Round 1 and 2 timings in this post refer to per-signer timings, while Key Generation and Aggregate are performed by the Coordinator.)</p><p>It was expected that the timings would increase with the larger number of participants (with the exception of Round 1, which does not depend on that number), but the Aggregate timings appeared too high, surpassing 400ms for the 667-of-1000 case (which may not seem much but it’s unusual for a signing procedure).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Optimized Benchmarks 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>I intended to investigate this slow code, but I didn’t even need to. Coincidentally, while the RFC was in the last call for feedback, Tim Ruffing <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/QQhyjvvcoaqLslaX3gWwABqHN-s/">pointed out</a> that Aggregate can be sped up significantly. Originally, it was specified that each share received from the participants should be verified (each signature share can be verified separately to ensure it is correct) and then aggregated. Tim’s observation is that the shares can be simply aggregated and the final signature verified with the group public key. If the verification fails, then it’s possible to find which participant generated an incorrect share by verifying them one by one (if desired). This greatly speeds up the case where all shares are correct, which should be the most common.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Aggregate is now more than 3 times faster for the 7 of 10 scenario, more than 4 times faster for the 67 of 100 scenario, and more than 12 times faster for the 667 of 1000 scenario! The Aggregate performance is now very similar to the Round 2 step, which makes sense since they have a very similar structure.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Ciphersuite Benchmarks

							<p>With the benchmark machinery in place (we used <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">criterion.rs</a>) we can provide benchmark results for all supported ciphersuites in different scenarios. These all use the optimization described above.</p>

							<p>FROST is a highly performant threshold signature scheme. We described an optimization for its “Aggregate” step, pointed out by Tim Ruffing in his review of the RFC draft, which made it 12 times faster in the 667 of 1000 scenario. With that, the Round 2 and Aggregate steps (recall that Key Generation only runs once, and Round 1 is almost negligible in all scenarios) each take less than 100ms for all ciphersuites, except Ed448, in the 667 of 1000 scenario (which is an uncommonly large one).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Appendix: Point Multiplications in FROST Steps 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>The time-consuming part of each step is elliptic curve point multiplication. It can be classified into three categories: random point multiplication, where the point being multiplied is unknown in advance; and fixed point multiplication, where the point is known in advance (usually, the “generator”).</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of what each step requires:</p>  Key Generation with Trusted Dealer  One fixed point multiplication to derive the group public key from the group private key;  One fixed point multiplication per MIN_PARTICIPANTS to derive a commitment for each polynomial coefficient;  One fixed point multiplication per MAX_PARTICIPANTS to derive their individual public keys.  Total: (1 + MIN_PARTICIPANTS + MAX_PARTICIPANTS) fixed point multiplications      Round 1<br>  Two fixed point multiplications to generate commitments to the pair of nonces.  Total: 2 fixed point multiplications    Round 2  One random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute the group commitment.  Total: NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications    Aggregate<br>  One random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute the group commitment. If the Coordinator is also a participant, they could reuse the value from Round 2, but we didn’t assume that in our benchmark (and our implementation does not support this for now);  One random point multiplication and one fixed point multiplication to verify the aggregated signature;  Verifying all shares (i.e. in our original approach, or to find a corrupt signer if the aggregated signature failed) additionally requires one random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute each commitment share and then one random and one fixed point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to actually verify each share.  Total (with optimization): (NUM_PARTICIPANTS + 1) random point multiplications and 1 fixed point multiplication. To identify a corrupt signer: up to 2*NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications and NUM_PARTICIPANTS fixed point multiplications.  Total (before optimization): 3*NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications and NUM_PARTICIPANTS fixed point multiplications.

<p>Dear Panthers,<br></p><p>In an impressive milestone, the Panther community has begun <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/t/panther-governance-framework-proposal/234?ref=panther-protocol-blog">working on setting an independently-designed framework for self-governance</a>. <br></p><p>As several Panther community members have articulated, the current framework, detailed below, has served us well. It released <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-overview/">Panther’s v0.5</a>, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">LaunchDAO</a>, and paved the way for many protocol-level changes that are integral in our road toward v1. <br></p><p>However, this framework was bootstrapped through conversations between Panther founding contributors and community members rather than formally established by the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">DAO</a>. To take a new decentralization leap, the existing process needs to be redesigned, formalized, and voted upon by the community, ensuring that it aligns with the values and principles of the Panther DAO. This will give way to a new era for the Panther DAO, where the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/how-to-get-involved-with-panther/">community</a> can collectively shape and direct the future of the platform.<br></p><p>Noticing this, and in the spirit of collaboration with the community to aid its independent discussions, we have put together this article to discuss some best practices on governance frameworks.  We will delve into Panther’s existing governance structure, try to provide guidance about the process of progressive decentralization, and review the ethos of both Panther and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. <br></p><p>Whether you're a current member of the Panther community or just curious about how DAOs operate, this article is a must-read for understanding the intricacies of decentralized governance on Panther Protocol. Please take this article as what it’s meant: guidance to explore the limitless possibilities of decentralized governance.<br><br></p> Why is the Panther DAO so important for the project?<br>  DAOs in a moving and complex crypto ecosystem <p>Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are a relatively new (or at least newly popularized) concept. At their core, DAOs are a form of decentralized governance where decision-making power is distributed among a community of stakeholders rather than being centralized in a single entity. This structure is re-thinking how organizations can operate and enabling the launch of truly decentralized, permissionless platforms that resonate with crypto’s original ethos.<br></p>Some of the key components and attractions of a DAO. <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/daos-for-beginners/what-is-a-dao?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Source</a>.<p>One of the key principles behind DAOs is the "wisdom of the masses" — the idea that a diverse group of individuals working together can make better decisions than a single leader or small group. This is particularly important for Panther, as the project is focused on creating a fully decentralized ecosystem that is open and accessible to all. By giving community members a say in how the protocol is run, Panther can tap into the collective knowledge and experience of its stakeholders, which leads to more innovative and effective solutions.<br></p><p>Panther aims to be censorship-resistant while operating in what's likely the most censorable space in crypto. In light of recent censorship attacks on the DeFi ecosystem, it is crucial for Panther to clarify that although it always has compliance in mind, the DAO serves to protect the project from attempts and from actions that would hinder the community’s autonomy. This is a tricky but achievable goal, as Panther's decentralized architecture enables everything, from the front- to the back-end to be hosted in a decentralized way. <br></p><p>However, it's important to note that decentralized governance is not a set-it-and-forget-it solution. In order to be successful, DAOs like Panther Protocol must adhere to certain values and principles. For example, it is critical that the governance structure is transparent, accountable, sticks to the project’s principles, and fair, and is almost always an ongoing process.</p><p><br>Before discussing how the Panther community could set such a framework for itself, let’s take a look at how Panther achieved its current degree of decentralization.</p> Panther’s road to decentralization (and the importance of progressive decentralization)<br> <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-progressive-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations/">Progressive decentralization (we already devoted a whole article to this!)</a> is a core principle at Panther and a key aspect of its development process.<br></p><p>This is particularly important during the initial stages of project development, where the main focus lies in delivering the roadmap and developing the protocol. New projects need to be somewhat centralized in order to effectively launch their initial protocol. However, as the project grows and matures, and to preserve the qualities outlined above, it is important to build the organization’s censorship resistance. By opening up decision-making power to the community, Panther can ensure that the community is truly in control of the organization and that Panther’s values of privacy, security, innovation, and transparency are accurately represented.<br></p><p>Panther has been implementing this approach by first focusing on building a strong foundation through its community and governance structure. Another way in which we implemented progressive decentralization was through the Panther <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">LaunchDAO</a>. Members of the Panther community directly participated in the launch and were rewarded for doing so. In addition to receiving a $PreZKP non-transferable token, which serves as a badge of honor, the members also received $ZKP tokens after the token launch.<br></p><p>After this, and building up to the launch of v0.5, Panther achieved a significantly higher level of decentralization through <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther Improvement Proposals (PIP)</a> <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x576701a7a07efe281cd4f04acbf589d0791e492117497d628a6dfc6e9eccda6b">6</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">7</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">8</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">9</a>, and <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">10</a>. These proposals covered everything –from democratic procedures related to who is allowed to vote on DAO proposals under certain circumstances to the release of code so that it could be deployed by anyone in the Panther community. <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">PIP-9</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">PIP-10</a> also formalized the terms for the staking program, giving the community a direct key to decide how a significant amount of funds would be distributed among stakers.<br></p><p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf?ref=panther-protocol-blog">our whitepaper</a>, Panther is on a continuous path toward decentralization. This approach is by design, as the protocol focuses on building a strong foundation to support further development and evolution.</p> Panther’s current governance framework and its evolution <p>As we mentioned before, Panther’s governance framework developed with a very clear goal of making the project as decentralized as possible. This, along with community discussion and experimentation, helped bootstrap a framework rather than following a pre-developed plan. <br></p><p>For its framework, while Panther never attempted to re-invent the wheel (lots of projects have stake-to-vote frameworks, use Snapshot, proposals, etc.), its specifics have been largely shaped by what the community deems fair and effective in practice. This approach has led to a governance system that is still able to adapt and evolve as the needs of the community change. &nbsp;<br></p><p>The current governance process for Panther starts with a basis on a pre-agreed consensus: Panther’s principles, ideas, and roadmap were established by its initial <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf?ref=panther-protocol-blog">whitepaper</a> and materials released along with it. By deciding to fund Panther’s development, community members agreed to the directions outlined by these materials. The steps leading to their application and execution, particularly in a moving context, however, are often brainstormed between members of Panther Ventures Limited –the leading Panther developer– and the Panther community using tools like Panther’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Telegram</a>, and official discussion<a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=panther-protocol-blog"> forum</a>.<br></p><p>This common agreement is essential to preserving transparency and democracy within the platform. Let us now discuss some of the key roles and community tools that partake in it.<br></p> Proposals, staking, and Snapshot<br> <p>The system detailed above was formalized before Panther’s launch with the establishment of Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">LaunchDAO</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot page</a> and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zkp-staking-will-be-available-this-wednesday-c73c7c98b5f2/">initial staking solution</a>. <br></p><p>Panther utilizes Snapshot as a way for community members to vote on proposals, such as those put forth through Panther Improvement Proposals (PIPs). PIPs cover a wide range of topics, from democratic procedures to code releases. They are an important tool for community members to voice their opinions and drive the direction of the protocol. <br></p><p>Once a proposal is published on Snapshot, it can be voted upon by the community. If the vote does not pass, no action is taken, preserving the community's power to make decisions about the platform's direction. <br></p>Panther Protocol’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot Page.</a><p></p><p>Snapshot is a powerful tool for DAOs. It allows projects to create proposals for users to vote on using cryptocurrency without incurring fees. This allows for a cost-efficient and accessible way for DAOs to engage with their audience and make decisions based on their collective input. Snapshot takes a picture (or “snapshot”) of the blockchain at the time of the vote to determine the number of tokens each address has and executes the outcome decided by the vote. This is beneficial as it eliminates the need to deploy tokens and pay transaction fees. It also prevents vote inflation by ensuring that tokens cannot be moved around and used to vote multiple times. Additionally, proposals can also have code attached to them, and if "yes" wins, the code gets automatically executed.<br></p><p>For a user to be able to vote on a Panther proposal within Snapshot, they must first ensure they have a wallet account that meets voting criteria (see below). Once they do, they can use these tokens to vote on any open proposals. As Snapshot utilizes off-chain vote signaling, votes are feeless and do not require users to directly interact with their tokens to vote.</p> Moderators, Authors, and Admins<br> <p>The ongoing process of using <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Telegram</a> to brainstorm with the community before issuing proposals changed with the release of Panther’s <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Discourse forum</a> (prominently featuring community members who are unrelated to PVL as moderators) and <a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">PIP-8</a>. <br></p><p>PIP-8 set the stage for advancing Panther’s decentralization by putting more responsibilities in the hands of the Panther community. Thanks to it, forum moderators can review a proposal and, if approved, move it to be put into Snapshot by a Snapshot Author, a new role <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/proposal-8-new-snapshot-authors-and-admins?ref=panther-protocol-blog">introduced alongisde Admins</a>. Authors are community members with the ability to post PIPs to this platform, while Admins are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the platform's governance structure by enforcing DAO governance rules and values.<br></p><p>Another achievement of PIP-8 was defining a process of electing future Authors and Admins. PIP-8 sought to enhance decentralization by augmenting the number of Snapshot Authors and Admins within the Panther Protocol ecosystem. The proposal successfully onboarded two Panther contributors and six community members as Snapshot Authors, empowered with the ability to propose changes on Snapshot.org. Furthermore, two new community-elected Admin accounts were added as signatories on the Gnosis Safe multisig wallet, which serves as the sole admin account for Panther's Snapshot.org space. The multisig wallet operates under a "2-out-of-3" signing policy, ensuring that changes to the Snapshot.org space's settings are approved by at least two of the three whitelisted Admins.<br></p><p>PIP-8 was a concerted effort to increase community participation in the protocol's governance and eliminate potential points of failure. The introduction of new Authors and Admins, as well as the implementation of a multisig for Admin actions, served to bolster the protocol's resilience and decision-making process. Community members can nominate themselves or others for the role. These newly appointed permissions will remain valid for six months, after which the community will propose and vote on a fresh set of nominees to continue in the role. This ensures that the platform's leadership is continually meeting the needs and expectations of the community.<br></p>The Panther community discussing DAO governance on Panther’s forums.<p></p> Voting Logic<br> <p>Now that we’ve covered how the Panther DAO’s democratic process works, it’s time to look at how votes accrue in favor or against proposals.<br></p><p><a href="https://snapshot.org/?ref=panther-protocol-blog#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">PIP-7</a>, also known as the Improved Voting Logic proposal, brought significant changes and improvements to the governance process’ robustness. This proposal introduced a fallback voting logic at times when tokens staked are not sufficient for the community to be thoroughly represented.<br></p><p>The Panther DAO originally used only a "stake-to-vote" mechanism, where token holders could stake their tokens to gain voting rights. However, this system struggled at times when the staking contract didn’t issue rewards. As such, a "hold-to-vote" mechanism was implemented as a fallback. This allowed token holders to vote just by holding a certain amount of tokens, regardless of whether they had staked them, whenever the contract wasn’t issuing rewards.<br></p><p>After the launch of v0.5, the "stake-to-vote" mechanism was once again the primary method of voting, but with a more robust system, thanks to the improvements made by PIP-7. However, the fallback mechanism will continue in place, as it allows for a wider community representation in the voting process.<br></p> In Summary<br> <p>The Panther DAO, in its relatively short existence, has navigated its way through a trial-and-error process to establish its democratic procedures. Panther is more decentralized now than ever as a consequence. <br></p><p>Despite initial challenges, along with Panther contributors, the DAO has successfully created a system that allows for equitable participation and decision-making among its members. As the Panther DAO continues to grow and evolve, it’s now time for it to review its practices and procedures to ensure its longevity and stability. This is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of DAOs as a whole and serves as a model for other organizations seeking to establish democratic processes in a decentralized environment.<br></p><p>In an upcoming article, we’ll write about the process of creating governance frameworks that are self-enforceable.<br></p><p>Stay tuned!<br><br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=panther-protocol-blog">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=panther-protocol-blog">Discord</a></p>

<p>In short, blockchain can improve data security and integrity by creating an environment in which everybody can add and verify data. Yet it is impossible to submit false data as those verifying the data will always notice. How does this work exactly?</p>



 Blockchain as a framework to improve data security and integrity 



<p>Defining integrity, in the context of information, can be tricky. A simple web search on the matter will yield multiple results, but for clarity’s sake we’ll pick one of the briefest: Integrity refers to the reliability and trustworthiness of the data. A simple explanation, for sure, but in the real world, the issue is slightly more complicated.</p>



<p>When it comes to data interpretation, the questions “Has this data been manipulated, or tampered with?”, “Where does this data come from?”, “Can I trust the institution that holds my personal information?”, are all very much relevant. Cambridge Analytica, Equifax, and other similar high-profile events confirmed that, when it comes to data, there is no ironclad security.</p>



<p>Or is there?</p>



 A brief history of blockchain 



<p>The answer to what blockchain is lies in its very name. It is a chain of blocks that stores transactional data. All existing nodes in the network validate the transaction, which becomes immutable, i.e., once validated, the transaction cannot be altered.</p>



<p>A block is a piece of data that contains certain information, such as a header, transaction data, and other technical stuff. Each block has a body, which can be imagined as the empty space in a train. The block’s body – the next available train car – is filled with confirmed transactions. If these transactions are validated by all the nodes (devices on the network), the block is deemed valid and is appended to the chain. Hence, block-chain.</p>



<p>You can think of a block as an entry in a ledger book, only the ledger is digital and decentralised, where all the blocks are linked to each other via cryptographic means – the hash.</p>



 Distributed security and transparency: The aces up blockchain’s sleeve 



<p>Each transaction that occurs on the blockchain is logged and timestamped. This prevents anyone from sending the same transaction more than once. The chain maintains a verifiable, immutable, and time-stamped record of every single transaction that was ever made.</p>



<p>But a bank database also maintains verifiable, time-stamped records of every transaction ever made, you might argue. Yes, it does. But where a bank (or Government, educational institution, etc.) database falls short is that its records are not immutable. They can be altered, quite easily. And furthermore, a bank database is highly centralised. Its control and management are in the hands of a single entity (the bank). Two, maybe three people will maintain it. This raises immediate and obvious concerns, particularly concerning the ease with which a database can be compromised.</p>



<p>Blockchain represents the polar opposite of a bank database. Blockchain – or distributed ledger technology – does not hold its data in a single, easy to tamper with database. Instead, an exact copy of the dataset exists in every node, and when a new block is added, every node knows about it. This poses an obvious advantage in terms of data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a Proof-of-Work environment, for example. Let’s say 30,000 nodes are validating transactions. How would 30,000 individual nodes ever coordinate together and conspire to do something dishonest? The very distribution of the validating nodes is what gives blockchain its inherent stability. At least half the nodes would have to behave dishonestly for the system to break, but the notion that 15,000 nodes would coordinate to do something dishonest is rather absurd. Compare that notion with the example of the bank database, where two, maybe three people are in control, the conspiratorial odds suddenly rise.</p>



<p>The other aspect of blockchain’s second-to-none approach to data security and integrity is transparency. Taking the example of the bank, or any other centralized database, any changes, alterations, or amendments to your data are very much a closely-guarded secret. You, the user, the very element who’s directly affected by these changes, are certainly kept out. You cannot see what’s being done with your data, you cannot control where your personal information goes, who looks at it, or what a third party might do with it. One could argue that, had Facebook’s data been kept on the blockchain, Cambridge Analytica would never have happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a blockchain environment, every single transaction (including the value, the address or addresses that the assets are sent from/to, etc.) is visible to everyone. Blockchain’s transparency is a feature that had hitherto been unthinkable in banking, for example. And while, at first glance, it might sound like a monumental invasion of privacy to have this sensitive information openly viewable by everyone in the network, consider that the information is hashed (encrypted) and that the data cannot be altered without a record of the change also existing. And of course, every node in the network would know about it. Consider this analogy: Think of a bank’s safe with transparent walls, and with hundreds, or thousands of people watching every time someone opens it to add more money into it.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">blockchain technology</a> for data integrity also creates opportunities for enterprises. Through the use of enterprise blockchain technology and various <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">digital identity solutions</a>, such as my.D, enterprises no longer have to worry about dealing with personal data. After all, personal data is as much of a liability as it is an asset these days.</p>



 Why data security and integrity matters 



<p>When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> broke back in 2018, the lights on the internet grew a little dimmer. Data harvesting was nothing new. Data-extracting bots and scripts had been roaming the web for years. But the factors that differentiated the Cambridge Analytica affair from any previous data harvesting issues were the sheer scale of it, and the sinister political ramifications of what’s arguably one of the greatest data-related scandals of the past decade.</p>



<p>An estimated 50 million Facebook accounts were compromised. Speaking on CNN, Mark Zuckerberg, referred to the Cambridge Analytica debacle as a ‘mistake’ and a ‘breach of trust.’ In March 2018, he published a letter apologizing on behalf of his company. By April, Facebook finally implemented the EU-mandated General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework in all geographical areas where Facebook operates.</p>



<p>The fallout from the Cambridge Analytica shady dealings (and the equally dramatic Equifax hack that became known about a year later) threw personal data into the spotlight. Many people, rightly, began to ask themselves how secure is our data, while in the hands of large corporations? How can these companies guarantee the security and integrity of our data? Who’s looking at our personal information?</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The use of blockchain technology clearly supports the concepts of data integrity and security. Particularly when it comes to sensitive data such as financial or commercial records. But that’s far from the only areas of business and industry where blockchain can make a transformative difference in the way personal data is handled, and by whom.</p>



<p>So one could say that blockchain is doing the right thing. Even when everyone’s watching.</p>

    <p>ZEN 3.2.1 will have a shorter deprecation period and will be phased out in April 2023. This was done in anticipation of the upcoming major protocol update represented by ZEN 4.0.0 which will include all the related functionalities to support the Horizen EVM-compatible sidechain (EON).</p>
<p>The update will first go live on Testnet before Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://dune-explorer.horizen.io"></a>Meanwhile, the EON sidechain was already launched on the <a href="https://dune.horizen.io">Dune Testnet</a>, bringing an explosion of community dev activity&nbsp;in just the first few days! We take this opportunity to also thank everyone for their continued support.</p>
<p>Please update your ZEN software before February 20. With this version, we are updating the deprecation height – be ready for the next big updates coming with ZEN 4.0.0!</p>
<p>The new 3.2.1 version is available to download on GitHub and through the APT repository.</p>

 1. Debate, grow, build: Programming languages &amp; crypto <p>Sam Blackshear, Noah Citron, Eddy Lazzarin, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p>What are the differences between smart-contracts programming and traditional programming — and where does programming for blockchains sit along the long history and evolution of programming languages overall? In the latest episode of ‘web3 with a16z’ (yes we’re back with an all-new season!), we overview all things programming languages and crypto: for both existing blockchain &amp; smart contract programmers, and for other developers seeking to enter the space.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation includes discussion of Move, Solidity, Rust, Huff, Vyper; JavaScript (as well as Node), Python, SQL, Haskell, Go… and also touches on topics such as formal verification, governance, cross-platform adaptation, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>But this discussion is also for those curious about how programming languages evolve (and come into existence)... as well as anyone interested in the intersection of language, code, and expression. </p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/programming-languages-smart-contract-programming-evolutions">listen<br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1620105727854665728">share</a></p> 2. Policy: On recent news &amp; moves; developing frameworks for regulation  Understanding recent moves <p>Michele Korver</p><p>When the U.S. Department of Justice criminally <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/founder-and-majority-owner-bitzlato-cryptocurrency-exchange-charged-unlicensed-money">charged</a> a senior executive (and Russian national) of cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato with unlicensed money transmitting, many people – even crypto industry insiders — commented that they had never heard of it. So what’s going on here, and why does it matter?</p><p>This move is significant because the “<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Order_Bitzlato_FINAL%20508.pdf">Bitzlato Order</a>” — issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s FinCEN the same day — is the first such order issued pursuant to section 9714(a) of the Combating Russian Money Laundering Act (Public Law 116-283). It identifies Bitzlato Limited, a financial institution operating outside of the U.S., to be of primary money laundering concern in connection with Russian illicit finance. As such, it prohibits certain transmittals of funds involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution. This is in addition to the DOJ criminal charges for Bitzlato failing to implement anti-money laundering safeguards, and thus enabling criminals to profit from their wrongdoing — including ransomware and drug trafficking from the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-shutdown-largest-online-darknet-marketplace">now-defunct</a> darknet Hydra marketplace, where users exchanged more than $700 million in cryptocurrency (either directly or through intermediaries).&nbsp;</p><p>As alleged in the order and the criminal complaint, Bitzlato executives knowingly facilitated criminal activity by failing to implement even the most basic anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures. The FinCEN order in effect shuts down Bitzlato’s ability to conduct transactions with other financial institutions.</p><p>For entrepreneurs and those watching (or in some cases reading the tea leaves on!) regulatory moves and implications, it’s worth noting that this is a good example of Treasury using its authority in a “fit for purpose” regulatory action. It’s precisely how regulation should be: going after the real wrongdoers, under clearly established rules.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you’re wondering what the difference is between a section 9714(a) order (the Bizlato Order described above) and section 311 special measures (which are authorized under the USA PATRIOT Act); or, what financial institutions are "covered" by the Order and what they have to do — you can check out FinCEN's accompanying FAQs <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FAQs_Bitzlato%20FINAL%20508.pdf">here</a>. As always, make sure to do your diligence on any businesses you’re dealing with… and when unsure about regulatory implications, consult legal or regulatory counsel.</p><p>related: For an overview of AML/KYC, BSA, sanctions, and more about illicit finance and how crypto entrepreneurs can navigate, go <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-regulations-sanctions-compliance-aml-ofac-news-explained">here</a>.</p><p>see also: In case you missed it, check out the <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-news-regulatory-roundup-december-16-2022-january-13-2023/">last installment</a> in our ongoing regulatory updates series, where David Sverdlov et al on our a16z crypto regulatory team share useful agency, as well as regional, news &amp; moves.</p> Regulate businesses, not software <p>Miles Jennings, Brian Quintenz</p><p>Two extremes clash over web3 regulation: One faction that argues for applying existing regulations wholesale to web3; and the other that argues for completely excluding web3 from existing, successful regulatory frameworks. But both produce bad policy outcomes. So how to resolve this tension?</p><p>Continuing our series on regulations that preserve the benefits of web3 technology and protect the future of the internet — while reducing the risks of illicit activity and consumer harm — a16z crypto’s Miles Jennings and Brian Quintenz suggest a more pragmatic approach. The key tenet? Regulate businesses, not software. That is: businesses should be the focus of regulation… whereas decentralized, autonomous software — especially the underlying decentralized blockchains, smart contracts, and networks that provide the internet with new functionality — should not.

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from Blocksmith Labs, Planet IX, Trisolaris, and X2YX.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Today we announce four new DApps that joined our Wallet Partner program in January. Each partner has integrated support for Brave Wallet, allowing Brave users to more easily connect to Web3 using the built-in wallet available within the Brave browser—on desktop, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Here are the partners that joined in this month:</p>

 Blocksmith Labs 
<p><a href="https://www.blocksmithlabs.io/">Blocksmith Labs</a> is driven by a singular mission: to create the best Web3 products that will enable the next generation of companies, artists, individuals, and creators to achieve their full potential. From a whitelist management platform to dynamic art generation, the team has developed solutions to address a variety of real-world problems within Web3.</p>

 Planet IX 
<p><a href="https://planetix.com/">Planet IX</a> is the largest NFT-based strategy game on Polygon. The goal of the game is to restore a fallen planet to its former green-blue glory while uncovering its mysteries. The story is continuously expanding into an immersive sci-fi metaverse with a rich narrative tailored towards bringing awareness of humanity’s impact on today’s world. The game consists of land parcels called PIX, which are NFTs that can be collected and traded to form territories, develop new technology, raid other players, and gain ownership of in-game corporations with different functions and perks.</p>
<p>“We’re very happy to be adding the Brave Wallet to our game. Many of our players already use the Brave browser when playing Planet IX, and we are excited to see what this partnership can lead to in the future,” said Felix Bengtsson, Co-Founder &amp; Visionary at Planet IX.</p>

 Trisolaris 
<p><a href="https://www.trisolaris.io/#/swap">Trisolaris</a> is a one-stop trading platform for the NEAR blockchain, running on NEAR’s Aurora engine. It is the first DEX on Aurora, enabling a seamless trading experience similar to Ethereum for a fraction of the cost, taking advantage of the great underlying architecture provided by the Aurora engine.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with the first and leading Web3 browser, Brave. We believe in their mission to provide a more secure browsing experience, especially for those participating in Web3,” said Eviejugo, BD lead at Trisolaris.</p>

 X2Y2 
<p><a href="https://x2y2.io/">X2Y2</a> is one of the top NFT marketplaces and NFT lending platforms on Ethereum. During 2022, $1.56B in NFT trading volume and more than $12M total lending amount accrued on X2Y2. Importantly, X2Y2 charges just 0.5% transaction fee from sellers, and 100% of the revenue is paid to $X2Y2 token stakers.</p>
<p>“We are an NFT marketplace, but our goal is to onboard the next billion Web 2.0 users to Web3. We believe we can achieve this goal faster by partnering with Brave and integrating deeper into Brave’s ecosystem,” said Ken, Head of Partnership at X2Y2.</p>

 Evolving the wallet partner program 
<p>Following the successful onboarding of over 80 leading DApps in&nbsp; the first phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, we’re shifting our focus to develop deeper business relationships with partners in the program involving the Brave Wallet, and to make a more public facing submission process for DApps supporting the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>As a further next step in the Wallet Partner program, users of the browser and wallet can expect new ways to use BAT with Wallet Partner program applications, as we continue growing new use cases for BAT in Web3. Stay tuned for more updates to the Wallet Partner Program, and as always, we welcome and encourage feedback from the Brave and BAT communities.</p>
<p>If you aren’t already using Brave Wallet, you can start by clicking  in the top left of your nav bar or by selecting “Wallet” from the menu.</p>
<p>If you’re an application developer that would like to integrate the Brave Wallet, developer documentation is available <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">here</a>.</p>

An image of Corintis’ microfluidic cooling channels on a&nbsp;CPU<p>For more than 50 years, the technology industry benefited from the tail winds of Moore’s Law. The density of transistors in a silicon microprocessor doubled roughly every 2 years. Up until 10 years ago, that meant that microprocessors got twice as fast every 2 years. Unfortunately, at a certain point transistors were so tightly packed together that heat dissipation became a major problem, and microprocessor performance stalled even as transistor density kept scaling. For the last decade, the industry shifted to using lots of processors and building hyperscale cloud data centers that today consume <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/2020/03/17/how-much-energy-do-data-centers-really-use/">205 TWh</a> of electricity, 43% of which is used for cooling, leading to massive inefficiencies and&nbsp;cost.</p><p><a href="https://www.corintis.com/">Corintis</a>, a spin-out of EPFL in Switzerland, has developed technology that represents a breakthrough in semiconductor cooling. The founder’s paper in Nature showed that they could put 10x the amount of power through a chip using their cooling technology than that of the closest competitor technology. Corintis etches microfluidic channels on the back of a silicon chip roughly the size of a human hair and moves coolant through them. The small size increases the surface area of silicon in contact with the coolant and, consequently, the amount of heat it can dissipate. The cooling microchannels can be etched with typical semiconductor fabrication equipment and can be codesigned with the physical design of the chip to maximize cooling efficiency using software developed by Corintis.</p><p>We believe that cooling will become a mission-critical issue for chip designers as they continue to hit physical limits. We are excited to be backing the Corintis team on their mission to lead a new breakthrough in semiconductor cooling, potentially extending Moore’s law and greatly reducing the energy consumption in the cooling of electronics.</p>

<p>From technological breakthrough to philosophical defiance, the topic of AI has always sparked intense debates ever since Alan Turing &amp; John McCarthy advanced this branch of computer science. One might argue that this was caused by expectations overwhelmingly surpassing technological capabilities. However, the recent public release of ChatGPT has rekindled former sci-fi apocalyptical scenarios, even if it is (still) just a trained language model. Humanity gazed in awe as a simple input/output text interface could instantly disrupt fields such as software engineering or copywriting. Worst part? It also challenged (arguably) the most important human-specific trait: creativity (Midjourney). Data is the lifeblood of AI as it increases the model’s prediction accuracy: larger input sample translates into more outputs that help fine-tune weights during back-propagation cycles (the model ‘learns’).</p><p>We were joined by Trent McConaghy, founder &amp; CTO at Ocean Protocol, to discuss the advantages of implementing blockchain (&amp; NFT) technology in data management and trading, what makes a particular data set valuable and what challenges derive from AI implementations and the data digital gold rush.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Trent’s AI background &amp; founding Ocean  The evolution of Ocean Protocol  Managing third-party access to data NFTs  Minting data NFTs &amp; their metadata  Discovering &amp; verifying data quality  AI generated data sets &amp; intellectual property  Ocean marketplace user base  Data farming  Data curation &amp; veOcean rewards  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0">Trent McConaghy on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Ocean Protocol on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Marketplace</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

More than $43 billion USDC is now in circulation as of January 13, 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The BIT platform offers institutional-grade security, supplemented by features such as portfolio margin and unified margin, which minimizes margin needs on hedged positions, and accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USDC, Tether (USDT) and more as collateral with respective haircut ratio.<br><br>This collaboration with Circle will allow BIT users to transfer fiat into their BIT accounts as USDC and withdraw USDC to USD via bank wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Together, BIT and Circle seek to expand crypto adoption and utility. In October, BIT launched USD-settled options. USD-settled options are more scalable for launching cryptocurrency options.&nbsp;<br><br>BIT switched all perpetual futures pairs from being USDT-margined to USD-margined from July 22, 2022 since the introduction of USD-settled options on its platform.<br><br>BIT’s USD-margined products are powered by its USD basket program, which now supports USDC. The cryptocurrency exchange also plans to incorporate more stablecoins into its USD basket in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>"BIT looks forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Circle," said Lan Yue, co-founder and COO of BIT. "Our collaboration helps us provide new efficiencies to our customers, saving retail and institutional investors valuable time and letting them focus solely on trading."<br><br>“We are excited to collaborate with BIT and look forward to working with their team. Together, we will provide the stability of USDC to BIT customers and making USDC more accessible,” said Raagulan Pathy, Vice President of Asia Pacific for Circle.</p>

Introducing Verida&nbsp;One<p>We’re proud to introduce <a href="https://verida.one/">Verida One</a>, a public platform that allows users to showcase who they are across both web2 and web3. It’s decentralized, multi-chain and censorship resistant.</p><p>Verida’s mission is to build a web where people own and benefit from their personal data to enhance their everyday experiences.</p><p>Verida One will provide people with a single source of truth that represents their ownership, affiliations, activities and social identity across all their web platforms.</p><p>With Verida One, you&nbsp;can</p>  Unlock your reputation  Create all your identities  Showcase your web3&nbsp;identity  Own and curate all your&nbsp;data  Build community trust  Showcase yourself with Verida One; One place, One&nbsp;URL.<p>People should be able to manage all their identities, their reputation, and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>We want everyone to be able to showcase who they are and what they are doing with other humans and&nbsp;apps.</p><p>We want everyone to have a trusted source of data, that they own, that provides trust, identity and reputation when interacting with others across the&nbsp;web.</p> What is Verida&nbsp;One? <p><a href="http://www.verida.one">Verida One</a> is built on top of the <a href="http://www.verida.network">Verida Network</a>. It will become a crucial part of the web3 identity and social stack enabling people to take control of their identity to signal trust and reputation to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Verida One profiles aggregate a user’s existing social identities from across web2 and web3 so they can show the many facets of themselves in one&nbsp;place.</p><p>This includes web2 identities from platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Discord, as well as web3 identities that include NFTs (avatars and others) and SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Social identities can be verified and made available on chain, making the information easily accessible to on-chain&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Users can have multiple identities that represent different facets they want to present in different contexts (for example a professional and a personal profile). Users will have full control over what is shown and what is hidden on their Verida One&nbsp;profile.</p>Manage and separate your work, personal, and anonymous identities Why are we building Verida&nbsp;One? <p>Current web2 users have a set of services that allow them to display places they are sharing their identity and activities (LinkTree is an example of&nbsp;this).</p><p>Web3 lacks a service to aggregate, share and prove these existing social identities. Existing reputation primarily relies on allocation of capital, but many of the most interesting use cases of reputation are not financially based.</p><p>There is no easy solution for users to import, verify and prove existing web2 identities and reputation, which is necessary infrastructure to link this critical web2 metadata to web3 dApps and new use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>More than that, there is no single platform where you can take ownership of all the data you create in each of those separate applications. Verida One brings that data back to the individual to own&nbsp;forever.</p>Curate your content; One feed, many&nbsp;sources. What does this mean for&nbsp;web3? <p><a href="http://www.verida.one">Verida One</a> provides users with a single source of truth that represents their ownership, affiliations, activities and social identity across all platforms. This produces a trusted source of data that can be consumed visually via an intuitive web interface, via traditional web2 API’s or via web3 using on-chain records such as NFT’s and&nbsp;SBT’s.</p><p>This makes it easier for humans to show who they are and what they are doing to other humans (send them to a single URL) and to programs (by providing a consistent machine-readable API representing the user’s identity&nbsp;data).</p><p>This provides trust, identity and reputation when interacting (crypto transactions, DM’s etc.) with that user. It enables users to highlight and show off their achievements.</p><p>Users can mint Verida Badges as on-chain Soulbound tokens that represent a verified proof of ownership or proof of reputation to the indicative social media platform. Where appropriate, proof of reputation can remain anonymous and zero knowledge. This enables use cases such as proving you have 100k Twitter followers without disclosing which Twitter account has the followers.</p><p>Collectively, they allow a user to prove who they are (and are not), to build their reputation, establish trust, and gain access to communities aligned to their social identity.</p><p>This is an open project, built on an open protocol that can be remixed or used as a composable base for any web2 or web3&nbsp;project.</p><p>You can learn more about building with the Verida Network (and hence Verida One profile data) at <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">https://developers.verida.network/</a></p> When will Verida One be available? <p>Verida One is currently in private alpha as we test early functionality to provide a seamless experience for users.

<p>At Brave, we work hard to minimize the tracking of our users on the internet, and that includes interaction with services run by Brave itself. But we don’t expect you to take our word for it; we try to make our privacy features something you can verify.</p>
<p>Many of our features depend on services configured with various providers. We’ve created a view into how that configuration protects your privacy. It’s your data, so you deserve to know how it’s handled. You can follow the steps below to review our work.</p>

 Address privacy 
<p>When devices send or receive data over the internet, they use an Internet Protocol (IP) address to identify themselves. This is an intrinsic part of how the internet works. While addresses aren’t necessarily unique or long-lived, it’s inevitable that the sites you visit will see these identifiers. The web doesn’t work without them.</p>
<p>To address this potential exposure, we sometimes have visitors connect to our sites and services through a proxy. The proxy sees the visitor’s IP address, but when it forwards the request to our servers, we see only the proxy’s IP address, not the real address of the visitor. Traffic is encrypted so the proxy can’t learn anything about what the visitor has to say; that’s private between the visitor and us.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>For example, if you enable Brave Rewards or use Brave News, the items the browser shows are decided locally, on your device—it’s none of our business which item the browser thought you’d be interested in. To protect your privacy, we download some of that content through a <a>private content distribution network</a> where requests go through a proxy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because user tracking is so prevalent, most proxy services have options to forward the original visitor’s IP address, decrypt the contents of the request, or both. That’s the opposite of what we want! So it’s important that we turn all those options off when we configure our sites to use a proxy.</p>

 Verification 
<p>To check the current configuration of a Brave proxy, you can visit the <a href="https://brave.github.io/config-attestation/">audit page</a> and examine the settings for each service. They’re listed by the domain name of the service where we’re using the proxy to separate the IP address from the contents of the request.</p>
<p>Correct configuration will look something like this:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Examine the logs for the fetch and display config step. You should see something like this:</p>
 <code>{
  "domain": "pcdn.brave.com",
  "modified_on": "2020-06-25T23:16:38.918708Z"
  "protocol": "tcp/443",
  "proxy_protocol": "off",
  "traffic_type": "direct",
}
</code> <p>This displays key values that control our configuration of Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/cloudflare-spectrum/">Spectrum proxy</a> for our private content distribution network:</p>
 
 domain: This describes the website the proxy is forwarding for. Match this up with the Brave service endpoint you’re auditing. Cloudflare is accepting traffic for this domain name and routing the traffic to their own internal servers first so they can strip the IP address. 
 modified_on: The date the configuration was last updated. 
 protocol: A value of tcp/443 indicates the proxy accepts normal encrypted https traffic. 
 proxy_protocol: This should be off, meaning the proxy does not forward the IP address of the visitor via the <a href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/master/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">PROXY protocol</a>. This means Brave can’t use it to track you! 
 traffic_type: A value of direct here means https traffic is forwarded directly to Brave’s server without decrypting it. Although Cloudflare sees the client IP address, this means they don’t learn anything about the content of the request or our server’s response to it. 
 
<p>By contrast, this is what it might look like if an endpoint were configured to make it possible to track visitors by IP address:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>The above example uses the port for unencrypted http, and passes on the original client IP address. We’ve added an “X” and dotted underlines to mark some of the problems with this config so it’s easy to check at a glance.</p>
<p>By publishing these values, we offer some assurance that we’re not able to track clients connecting to these services. Since the configuration data comes <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#spectrum-applications-get-spectrum-application-configuration">directly from Cloudflare</a>, it accurately represents the real proxy parameters. Because the query is processed by GitHub, we can’t have changed the values before reporting them.</p>


    
    

    



    
    

<p>More technical users may want to consult the GitHub Actions workflow log linked at the bottom of the page to verify the data was obtained correctly by a runner under GitHub’s control. You’ll need to be logged in to GitHub to access data on that page.</p>
<p>Happy checking!</p>

      AI Recruits a New Hybrid Workforce        <p>By Konstantine Buhler</p><p>Published January 26, 2023</p>        AI models keep getting better at generating human-level work. Now the hard part, bringing magical products to the office.      



 
<p>If you are following the amazing demos people are making with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT, you might think the latest wave of AI is all about fun new modes of communication. It’s not. Under the hood, it’s all about work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI is computation; best guesses based on statistics. It is work; joules of energy dissipated through the movement of information. Despite the flashy new veneer, AI is not a revolution in communication but in productivity. It’s not the printing press or telegraph, it’s the assembly line, the jet engine, technologies that produce work rather than transfer information. And for knowledge workers, the latest developments in AI represent a new paradigm for work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although computers are a form of information technology, the ways we use them are still quite mechanical. Much of our work remains trapped in the physics of W = Fs, forcibly pounding our keyboards, displacing our attention across emails, spreadsheets and websites, foraging for the bits of information we need to compose some work product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contemporary AI promises something new altogether: a higher level approach where we work in deep collaboration with software. Computer programming moved from imperative to declarative languages and office work is just catching up. This is the new age of declarative work, made possible by the massive amount of information compressed into today’s text, image and code models. The ease of prompt interfaces and the ability to quickly generate variations will result in higher quality work products per unit of human effort.</p>



<p>The proliferation of AI into everyday office software (finally!) has the potential to create a new kind of hybrid workforce. We may soon enter an era when all of the apps you and every other knowledge worker use every day—your document editor, spreadsheet and presentation maker—will do part of your work for you. The more mundane aspects will be truly automatable—but the real breakthrough will be the teamwork between you and your software. You will have new, virtual teammates to write a first draft, instantly provide research and answer the most arcane questions.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Will you feel like you have new, trusted digital colleagues, or a bunch of untrained interns to worry about?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This mix of humans and intelligent agents will increase individual productivity and enable leaner teams to do more, but will also be a lot to manage. Not only are generative work outputs subject to problems running from mediocrity to outright hallucination, enthusiastic overuse could make work and the internet itself even noisier. Will you feel like you have new, trusted digital colleagues, or a bunch of untrained interns to worry about?</p>



<p>In the physical world, humans have shared the factory floor with robots for decades. Workers, though, haven’t been programming their own automations, so these robots have been more like furniture than coworkers. This current wave of automation will change that. Companies like the German robot maker <a href="https://www.robco.de/en">Robco</a> now offer easily configurable industrial robot arms designed to be auxiliary workers for small manufacturing teams.</p>



<p>The great monolithic office software suites from Microsoft and Google have also felt like furniture. These are applications we work on rather than with. As AI changes this, how will human workers adapt? And equally important from our perspective, where are the opportunities for disruption in this new way of working?</p>



 Making it work 



<p>The coming AI revolution will look nothing like the internet explosion of the past 25 years. The internet was a revolution in how humans communicate. AI will be a revolution in how we work. Gaining distribution will be more difficult, and require companies to build passionate communities and unique customer value without becoming overly dependent on an incumbent’s expensive or restrictive platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">creative new world of generative AI</a>, sharing code and models is the new engine of distribution. What Github is for code, Hugging Face is for models. Developers can use it to easily patch together models and datasets into bespoke pipelines. And Replicate has an easy-to-use API that lets users run open source models in the cloud. Unlike the Imagenet pioneers in 2012, you no longer have to have a PhD to deploy an ML model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The elephants in the Zoom are the office suites themselves. Microsoft and Google have their productivity apps installed on nearly every computer on the planet, and many companies use both. The incumbents have deep moats, but also blindspots. The once mighty IBM discounted the threat of the personal computer (and Microsoft) to its peril, and history has a way of repeating itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of the pillars of the office suite is a potential vector of disruption. But could the office suite itself, based on the paradigm of human readable documents and messages, be disrupted? Today’s large language models (LLMs) are trained on public information and produce general purpose results. Will tomorrow’s leading companies preserve their advantage by building their own models and custom applications the way we now make spreadsheets or write memos?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first beachheads for challengers will likely be vertical apps, but the individual pieces of the office suite make attractive targets given Microsoft 365’s 345M paid users and Google Workspace’s 3B (mostly free) users. The office suite is just one of many software surfaces that startups can attack, but it’s a significant one. Could a 10x better doc editor, spreadsheet or slide maker powered by LLMs make a dent?</p>



<p>Ultimately, the result of all this innovation in AI will lead to something very different than office software on a PC. It will feel like an extension of ourselves; part assistant, part machine. But we won’t get there without a leap of imagination akin to the PC itself. In the meantime, there’s work to do.</p>



you writing with a doc writing with you



 The document editor 



<p>One of the main forms of work we do on our computers is writing, but the document editor itself has always been more about the formatting of words than the words themselves. Market success for these apps has also been driven more by their modes of distribution than product innovations.</p>



<p>WordPerfect was the early leader but ceded the field to Microsoft by failing to make a Windows version early on. Each new release of Windows was an occasion for the next version of Word, sold separately on a disc.</p>



<p>Google changed little about Word when it released Docs on the web in 2006, but it had a distribution advantage…it was on the web. In 2010 Google acquired the technology to let multiple people edit Microsoft Office documents on the web simultaneously. Online distribution and collaboration completely changed the way teams worked together. All Microsoft could do was follow suit with what became Office 365.</p>



<p>There have been many challenger doc editors over the years, Hemingway, Ulysses, Dropbox Paper, Salesforce Quip and most prominently today, Notion. Many of these apps aimed to simplify the writing experience, but Notion bypassed the old paradigm all together. There are no “pages” or skeuomorphisms, just documents fit for the internet age, designed for a screen and built to connect. Unsurprisingly, Notion has also been quick to <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">incorporate generative AI into its product</a> in a seamless way.</p>



<p>Coming at the problem sideways, Canva has continued to expand its offerings beyond social media and marketing graphics and recently released a document editing application that includes a generative “magic write” feature. There may be an upcoming generation of social-first entrepreneurs for whom Canva represents their office suite.</p>



<p>The big emerging opportunities for doc editors in the age of generative text is to innovate on the writing experience itself. As AI researcher Katy Gero recently wrote in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-writing-art/">Wired</a>, AI can intervene in three distinct parts of the writing process, planning, drafting and revising. Current generative systems focus on the first two. Most applications will draft sentences and paragraphs for you as a completion of your prompt. More sophisticated approaches might return an outline for a blog post based on a headline.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big emerging opportunities for doc editors in the age of generative text is to innovate on the writing experience itself. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Just as the writing process is iterative, generative writing assistants also work best as recursive loops that the writer uses to converge on their desired outcome. It is not hard to imagine generative agents trained on constructive criticism that can offer feedback from different perspectives as you revise your piece. Eventually we may come to take this virtual writers’ room for granted as we do spell check today.</p>



<p>The first breakout text generation apps, like Jasper and Copy.ai, specialize in marketing copy. Their early success may be an artifact of the preponderance of marketing language in the training data for LLMs themselves. Nonetheless Jasper is a good example of a challenger playing the SaaS marketing game well. Following the HubSpot playbook it has cultivated a very enthusiastic community and created an engaging product. By relying on GPT-3 for its model infrastructure, it has been able to focus its efforts on the hard work of building its own distribution channel.</p>



<p>The biggest market for AI enhanced writing apps may turn out to be people who find writing difficult with current tools. This will take a more holistic approach than the first crop of vertical writing tools and the imagination to remake the writing process. Lex is an early stage generative writing product that pairs a fully featured doc editor with both generative prompts and an adjacent chatbot that can gather facts and answer questions to supplement the writer’s efforts. AI affords new ways of working which means novel and delightful product thinking can really make a difference.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Future applications will go much further: they will guide brands and individuals towards creating qualitatively exceptional content.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Applications can also combine generative feedback with traditional analytics and ML pattern matching. Jasper, for instance, provides SEO metrics on generated text. Future applications will go much further: they will guide brands and individuals towards creating qualitatively exceptional content.</p>



<p>Exceptionalism is one of the most promising areas for startups because it falls outside the scope of the large office suites. Brands and eventually individuals will want to fine-tune underlying models to capture their own unique voice. Right now, generative text sounds plausible yet generic. In Jasper’s premium Boss Mode you can add “tone of voice” keywords to your prompt (e.g. “Elon Musk”) much as you can add style suggestions (e.g. “digital art”) in image generation apps. But organizations and individuals want their writing to sound differentiated. We value a high-quality writer for their voice, not just their word count. There will be demand for easy ways to take your proprietary corpus of text and fine-tune a model on it.</p>



<p>Finally, looping back around to the planning process, generative models trained on code, like OpenAI’s Codex, have demonstrated emergent abilities for “chain of thought” and complex reasoning. It is possible that the doc editor of the future will be able to poke holes in your argument and not just give you a series of bullets based on what millions of other people have already written.</p>



math is still math



 The spreadsheet 



<p>Visicalc, the original spreadsheet for the Apple II, was the first “killer app,” a program so valuable to business and academic users that it gave them a pressing reason to buy the whole computer. Microsoft actually launched the first version of Excel for the Mac in 1985 before following on for Windows two years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even more than the document editor, spreadsheets flourished in the graphical user interface. Where Word over-indexed on formatting, Excel delivered increasingly sophisticated functionality to the point that Excel formulas are now the world’s most popular programming language. For geeks, Microsoft’s introduction of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/lambda-the-ultimatae-excel-worksheet-function">LAMBDA</a> functions in 2021 makes Excel Turing complete.</p>



<p>Google Sheets, launched in 2006, has kept rough feature parity with Excel, but as with Docs its main differentiator has been online distribution which eased collaboration. Excel appeals to power users with macros, larger data capacity and more visualization options than Sheets. Both spreadsheets have ventured into automated data analysis and formula suggestions in recent years potentially blocking new AI-powered challengers. And Google’s new <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/12/introducing-simple-ml-for-sheets.html">Simple ML</a> add-on for Google Sheets puts TensorFlow within the grasp of no-coders.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bringing computational abilities to words and images is a new thing, but spreadsheets are computational to their core. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>There is however no true Notion-like competitor in the spreadsheet space for the hard core spreadsheet user. If you’re embarrassed to touch a mouse when in a spreadsheet (guilty as charged!), Airtable or Rows won’t do it for you. But automating quantitative work in spreadsheets should be a slam dunk application for this new era. Most likely this will not come primarily through generative approaches but from more rigorous formal methods. Math is still math.</p>



<p>GPT3 turns out to integrate quite easily into existing spreadsheets via extensions that add =GPT() functions. It’s also possible to use language models to transform text prompts into working spreadsheet formulas. And perhaps a prompt interface could streamline tedious data cleaning and validating? Another application we would love to see would be the ability to specify synthetic data to fill out spreadsheets for modeling purposes.</p>



<p>The biggest moat for incumbent spreadsheets is inertia and user familiarity. Yet it’s easy to forget that spreadsheets themselves already represent a tremendous amount of automation. Bringing computational abilities to words and images is a new thing, but spreadsheets are computational to their core. The biggest disruption may be the merger of spreadsheets into document environments (see Notion and Coda) to create code notebooks for office workers.&nbsp;</p>



a magical experience



 The presentation maker 



<p>Powerpoint is an island of creativity in office life and unsurprisingly presentations are the only part of the office suite that Apple has had traction. Slideshows seem primed for their generative AI moment, but decks themselves are unlikely to overturn the reign of the big office suites. But if presentations peel away from the suite—if Powerpoint is no longer good enough—the result could weaken the bundle.</p>



<p>Powerpoint and Slides have become design software for non-designers, but challengers like Canva are now applying the social media toolset to decks. Figma has made inroads with designers for making slides and offers FigJam for non-designers. Notion, a suite unto itself, has become a favorite of startup founders for their pitch decks.</p>



<p>One thing the main challengers in the presentations space—Figma and Notion—have in common is their emphasis on community as a way of building out functionality through templates and plugins. Figma’s plugin ecosystem provided a fast ramp to incorporate AI features like prompt-driven prototypes and generative icons without any changes to the core product. These communities are not technically open source, but they share the enthusiasm and good will associated with it. As we’ve seen with Hugging Face, open source represents an important distribution medium for AI technologies as do energized user communities. Any challenger who wants to enter these markets will have to build a productive fan base.</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<p>Figma has had a big effect on the way design software has encroached on the bastion of the office suite in many companies. As products like Retool and Github Co-pilot make it 10x easier to build and code internal tools, a much wider swath of office workers will become engaged in making products which inevitably need to be wireframed and designed. We will address the AI disruptions to the worlds of design and code in a forthcoming post.</p>



<p>As with generative text, companies and individual designers will want to put their stamp on the visuals, so there may be a multi-modal platform play for a product that can ingest brand assets and spit out fine-tuned models for use across generative apps.</p>



<p>A real presentation standout at the moment is Tome, which is generative AI native, not a bolt on. It is currently in beta but has the ability to generate entire slide decks from a prompt, make variations of individual slides or add new ones and rewrite lines of text. This is the kind of magical work experience that people expect when they see Midjourney or ChatGPT and it may be that slide decks will be its first natural home.</p>
 







 
 A new kind of work 



<p>What does an enduring AI-native company look like? Will it follow the playbook of the PC era and be the next version of the word processor or spreadsheet? Will it follow the AWS model and provide metered infrastructure for personalized AI workloads? Even better, will it be the next Microsoft, Google or Apple, integrating human and AI workers into new operating systems and hardware?</p>



<p>Obviously, big tech companies with massive investments in AI are not going to let their incumbent distribution advantage slip away easily. Yet their business models and scale place them in an innovator’s dilemma that impedes their embrace of the new products and services that could undermine them.</p>



<p>Disruption is inevitable. The world of highly-distributed AI applications capable of producing human-level work products is very different from the winner-take-all mass distribution of the internet era. Ironically, it was this extreme centralization that pushed the internet corpus to the critical mass that made the scale of large language models possible.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<p>There are clear dangers, though, in accepting machine outputs as “good enough.” For individual workers there is the risk of producing large amounts of mediocre work. Knowledge work, whether marketing or scientific research, is valuable to the extent that it is particular and excellent. Not all knowledge work needs to be “true” in a factual sense, but it all needs to be “correct” for its intended purpose. The raw ability of AI systems to produce content places an even larger premium on our judgment and critical thinking skills.</p>



<p>For organizations, the profusion of generative outputs will create obvious risks of inappropriate content but also less obvious ones like cultural drift. If they rely on third-party models supplied through applications they risk losing control of their own message. Top brands will want to fine-tune their models for their voice and style while also hiring and retaining workers that can tell the difference. After all, successful businesses are different from their competitors.</p>

 Learn what metadata is, who can access it and how to protect&nbsp;it <p>Data Privacy Day is on 28 January this year! It is the perfect occasion to take stock of where we are when it comes to online privacy protections. In good news, end-to-end encryption is becoming firmly established as the norm. There is now broad recognition that good privacy protections enable secure online communication. In addition, secure communications is the very basis for meaningful online interactions, from social life to commerce.</p><p>But as the sheer volume of digital communications continues to increase — and with the advent of AI driven surveillance — it is no longer the content of your message that matters, but its metadata. In fact, the metadata can often reveal things about your life far more accurately than the content. Your message content might contain your thoughts and opinions, but the metadata reveals your&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Consider this metaphor: you have a bird’s eye view of a busy city. You are watching the cars as they travel through the bustling traffic of the city. Now, from your position you cannot see what or who is inside any given car. But you CAN see its color and size, what house it leaves from at what time, where it is going, how frequently it travels between those addresses and more. From that information, you can deduce quite a lot about what is going on: who is visiting whom, the nature of their relationship, even details about their health, habits, wealth and more. This, in short, is metadata.</p><p>In this blogpost we give a primer on metadata surveillance and what can be done about&nbsp;it.</p> What is ‘metadata’? <p>Firstly, what is metadata really? It is the data about your message, including its:</p>  Origin  Type  Destination  Time  Length  Size  <p>…and pretty much any other identifiable patterns of your messages.</p> What can it be used&nbsp;for? <p>Metadata can be analysed to reveal internet traffic patterns. These patterns are like a fingerprint, in fact there is a type of attack called “website fingerprinting”! In these types of attacks, someone would download all the pages on a website, analyse the metadata of these pages and then match these to the patterns of traffic. They can thereby learn which specific page a person might be looking at. Now, imagine the website for example provides health&nbsp;advice!</p><p>In short, metadata can&nbsp;reveal:</p>  Which specific web page you visit, even over&nbsp;HTTPS  Which web domain you request over encrypted DNS  What you are typing, even in an encrypted web application (search, taxes,&nbsp;health)  What you say in a voice conversation over encrypted voice&nbsp;channel  <p>…and more.</p> Why is metadata valuable? <p>So metadata reveals a lot, but there are other reasons for why it is valuable for anyone wanting to spy on&nbsp;people.</p>  It is machine readable, making it the preferred target in AI driven surveillance and makes it easy to analyse large volumes of&nbsp;data.  It doesn’t take up much storage, compared to say a video file, which means it is easy to collect and store lots of&nbsp;it.  It is openly available!  It is currently unprotected by the&nbsp;law.   Who has access to metadata? <p>Unfortunately, metadata is largely unprotected, meaning there are a lot of actors who have direct access to it. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Internet Service Providers  Internet Exchanges  Autonomous systems  BGP routers  Internet backbone  Even your wifi router,&nbsp;LAN  <p>…and eavesdroppers, including, famously, the&nbsp;NSA.</p> So what can we do about&nbsp;it? <p>The most effective protection against metadata surveillance today are mixnets. Let’s go back to our original metaphor. Now imagine you are looking down at the busy city, but all the cars are identical. And what is more, they pass through tunnels and under bridges, where they then emerge from but you cannot pinpoint which car is exactly which and if they have changed lanes or&nbsp;not.</p><p>This is essentially what a mixnet does. It encrypts internet packets in layers of encryption that make all packets look identical. It then ‘mixes’ these packets by having them route through three layers of what are called ‘mix nodes’ where they are mixed with other identical looking packets and micro time delays are added. It becomes pretty much impossible to trace and analyse who is speaking to who. A mixnet makes it impossible for a snooper to&nbsp;know:</p>  What you are&nbsp;saying  Who you are communicating with (sending or receiving messages)  When you are communicating  How long you are communicating  From where you are communicating  The amount of data you are sending or receiving  Any patterns in you communications  Whether you are communicating at&nbsp;all  <p>Nym is a decentralised, permissionless mixnet run by node operators all over the world. This is cybersecurity for and by a global community. And what is more, there is a token to make sure that this community of operators and supporters is sustained in the long&nbsp;term!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p>Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market (in 2018 eight of the top ten best-selling drugs worldwide were biologics). Targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), therapeutic proteins that bind to specific target sites, have become a cornerstone of treatment guidelines for a wide range of solid tumors, resulting in improved outcomes by reducing the severe side effects of conventional chemotherapy. However, the tumor microenvironment continues to pose physical barriers that hinder the penetration of macromolecules into solid tumors — even antibody fragments are unable to saturate the tumor and achieve uniform distributions due to shorter half&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Creasallis is developing its own antibody engineering platform, CreaTap, aimed at improving the penetration of antibodies into the tumor microenvironment while ensuring a long enough half-life to provide the best of mAbs and antibody fragments. The founder, Zahra Jawad, has spent 15 years in antibody engineering at GSK and Agenus and was most recently head of programs at&nbsp;bit.bio.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>The market for antibodies (valued at over $186 billion in 2021) has continued to grow as the number of approved novel therapies rises, primarily driven by the ability to treat complex diseases. We believe that Creasallis’ antibody platform can be a single, plug-and-play engineering solution which can serve the antibody oncology market. Moreover, pairing CreaTap with existing antibodies could enable better half-life and efficacy and also prolong the exclusivity life cycle of blockbuster antibodies, while delaying the emergence of biosimilars (copies of previously successful biologics), making it an attractive opportunity for partnerships with large&nbsp;pharma.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/zahra-jawad-724a2716">Zahra</a> and the entire Creasallis team on their mission to make antibody therapies available to a much larger patient population.</p>
