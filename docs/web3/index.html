  Partnering with Reflection: Toward Superintelligence, with Autonomous Coding  <p>Misha, Ioannis and their team are building the AI dream: superintelligent agents capable of doing knowledge work, starting with autonomous coding.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published March 7, 2025
  



Reflection co-founders Misha Laskin and Ioannis Antonoglou.



 
<p>“It’s not a human move. I’ve never seen a human play this move … so beautiful.”</p>



<p>That was Go champion Fan Hui’s reaction to Move 37—a moment that left the world in awe. It was the move that defined the 2016 showdown between Go legend Lee Sedol and DeepMind’s AI agent, AlphaGo. In that historic match, AlphaGo dominated, winning four out of five games, marking a pivotal milestone for artificial intelligence: that AI could reach superhuman levels of capability.</p>



<p>Ioannis Antonoglou, Reflection’s cofounder and Deepmind founding engineer behind AlphaGo, recalls the moment vividly: “Move 37 was spectacular … a brilliant, unconventional move that showed the system had a deep understanding of the game. It had creativity. It could think of things that people hadn’t thought of before.”</p>



<p>Ioannis continued pushing the frontier. He extended AlphaGo’s capabilities with AlphaZero—an AI that learned entirely from self-play, mastering the game without human guidance. Then, he led the development of MuZero, an even greater breakthrough: an AI that conquered Go, chess, Shogi, Atari and more—all without even being told the rules of the game.</p>



<p>These weren’t just incremental advances. They were seismic shifts in AI that showcased the significance of reinforcement learning in building superhuman agentic systems. Even today, AlphaGo, AlphaZero and MuZero remain amongst the most powerful AI agents ever created.</p>



 From AlphaGo to Reflection AI 



<p>At DeepMind, Ioannis went on to play a key leadership role in post-training efforts for Gemini, where he met Reflection cofounder Misha Laskin, who was leading reward model development. Together, they continued to push the boundaries of two of the most critical fields in AI: reinforcement learning and large language models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their shared vision for superintelligence, and their elite domain expertise in building both the most capable agents and the most powerful LLMs, led to the birth of <a href="https://www.reflection.ai/">Reflection AI</a>.</p>



<p>The vision of Reflection is to build superintelligent agents to conduct all knowledge work. Crucially, Reflection is built on two core beliefs:</p>



 
 That autonomous coding is a crucial step toward superintelligence. 



 That real-world evaluations—not just benchmarks—matter most. 
 



<p>The company’s first focus? Building autonomous coding agents.&nbsp;</p>



 Autonomous coding agents 



<p>We’ve seen the incredible benefit of coding assistants in enabling developers to work with 10x speed and productivity. In parallel to this, we believe that the next leap forward is autonomous coding agents that handle workloads autonomously.</p>



<p>Reflection’s autonomous coding agents integrate directly into an organization’s codebase and engineering workflows, and autonomously tackle well-scoped engineering tasks entirely end-to-end. They read, write, test and deploy code, handling all the infrastructure on your behalf, relieving the burden of entire engineering workloads from developers and teams.</p>



<p>The reality is, rather than writing new code, most engineers spend the majority of their time buried in refactoring, debugging and fixing bugs; code reviews, standups and sprint planning; updating documentation and learning new tools, languages and frameworks; and managing infrastructure, devops and testing. Reflection’s autonomous coding agents start with these sets of tasks: important, yet tedious, time-consuming work that often sits in an engineering team’s backlog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucially, Reflection is centered on reliability. To start, Reflection’s agents are not all-encompassing software engineers. Rather, they are agents that engineering teams and leaders design to handle specific sets of tasks and workloads, with trusted performance:</p>



 
 Refactor legacy code safely, without breaking dependencies 



 Generate and run test cases automatically 



 Optimize memory usage across pull requests 



 Find and fix security vulnerabilities before they cause problems&nbsp; 



 And more! 
 



<p>As the team advances model intelligence to increase its scope of capabilities, Reflection’s agents take on more responsibilities. Imagine autonomous coding agents working tirelessly in the background, handling workloads that slow teams down. These agents understand your entire codebase, no matter how large or complex. They execute autonomously: planning, writing, testing and deploying code independently. They work continuously, spotting and solving problems proactively, and they improve over time, learning from real-world use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are superintelligent coding agents, deployable instantly and in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a fundamental shift in how software is built and maintained. It’s one massive leap towards a future where developers become directors of autonomous coding agents who build and maintain code on our behalf … and long term, a future where we all become directors of superintelligent agents that conduct knowledge work on our behalf.</p>



 The elite team building this future 



<p>In just one year, Reflection has assembled a world-class team—made up of the very researchers and engineers who pioneered some of AI’s greatest breakthroughs:</p>



 
 Deep Q Networks, AlphaGo, AlphaZero and MuZero—landmark achievements in reinforcement learning. 



 PaLM, Character AI, ChatGPT and Gemini—cutting-edge advances in large language models. 
 



<p>But what makes Reflection truly unique isn’t just its elite technical expertise—it’s the tight integration of research and product, combined with a customer-first approach to AI development.</p>



<p>They’re not just building frontier intelligence; they’re building the future of AI-driven software engineering with real-world impact.</p>



 



 Join us 



<p>Legendary companies are built on solving the most ambitious problems of our lifetime. As CEO Misha puts it:</p>



<p>“We’re working on the root node problem of our lifetime.”</p>



<p>Reflection AI is on a mission to achieve superintelligence, starting with autonomous coding agents that will redefine software development. We have deep conviction in their potential and are honored to have been their first and long-term partner in this journey.</p>



<p>On a personal note—working with Misha and Ioannis has been one of the greatest adventures of our lives.</p>

<p>Telegram, often touted as a bastion of secure messaging, appears to be making radical changes to its data sharing policy. Recent reports indicate a dramatic surge in data disclosures, raising serious questions about the platform’s commitment to user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Following a September policy update, Telegram’s 2024 <a href="https://te-k.github.io/telegram-transparency/">Transparency Report</a>, along with 404 Media’s <a href="https://www.404media.co/telegram-hands-u-s-authorities-data-on-thousands-of-users/">reporting</a>, revealed that the app fulfilled 900 U.S. government requests, affecting 2,253 users, with most occurring in the final quarter of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>Telegram saw a spike in data requests during the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. U.S. requests skyrocketed from a mere 14 in the first three quarters to 886 in Q4, an increase exceeding 6,000%. Similarly, the UK saw a rise from 3 to 139 requests, representing an increase of over&nbsp;4,500%.</p><p>India, which enacted stricter data laws in 2022, saw the highest volume of requests, with a major spike in Q4, culminating in a total of 14,641 requests for the year, impacting 23,535&nbsp;users.</p><p>Although the platform has long emphasized its encryption and commitment to user security, these figures suggest a significant shift in its operational practices.</p><p>Telegram’s data-sharing policy has undergone a notable shift, following the August arrest of CEO Pavel Durov in France for refusing to assist in a child abuse investigation. The platform now provides user phone numbers and IP addresses under valid legal orders, a change from its previous focus on terrorism-related cases.</p><p>This policy adjustment comes as Telegram faces scrutiny for its role in facilitating criminal activity, including the trading of stolen data, cryptocurrency laundering, and the sale of illegal goods, as well as the presence of unlicensed crypto exchanges advertising <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/criminal-networks-southeast-asia-flourish-telegrams-underground-markets-un-says-2024-10-07/">money laundering services</a>.</p> Navigating the&nbsp;Divide <p>While it is crucial to apprehend those who use Telegram for criminal purposes — from trading stolen data and laundering cryptocurrency to facilitating the distribution of illegal goods — the line between necessary surveillance and unwarranted intrusion is thin. The risk is that in the pursuit of criminals, the privacy of law-abiding users may be compromised.</p><p>The challenge lies in finding a balance that allows for effective law enforcement while safeguarding fundamental privacy rights. Transparency and accountability are paramount. Clear guidelines, strict oversight, and robust legal frameworks are needed to ensure that data requests are justified and proportionate. Without these safeguards, the fight against crime could inadvertently lead to a gradual erosion of privacy, affecting not only those suspected of wrongdoing but also the broader user&nbsp;base.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/telegrams-data-sharing-so-much-for-secure-messaging-637fc03796eb">Telegram’s Data Sharing: So Much for Secure Messaging</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with Freed: An AI-Powered Clinician’s Assistant  <p>Erez and his team are transforming medical scribing to give doctors more time for their patients—and their lives.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a>

Team Freed.



 
<p>Imagine a gifted student whose goal in life is to help people. Her path takes her to med school, and eventually to residency. She begins to see the patients she had always dreamed of helping. But instead of devoting her energy to their care—and to her life outside work—she finds herself buried in documentation and administrative tasks, spending hours charting over late nights and weekends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was the experience of Dr. Gabi Meckler, a family physician in Santa Rosa, California. She wasn’t alone. <a href="https://pnhp.org/news/physicians-spend-two-hours-on-ehrs-and-desk-work-for-every-hour-of-direct-patient-care/">Studies</a> show that for every one hour of patient interaction, clinicians devote two hours to documentation. Almost 50% of doctors reported symptoms of burnout in a <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/physician-burnout-rate-drops-below-50-first-time-4-years">recent AMA survey</a>, and <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/6-specialties-desire-step-away-or-scale-back-common">nearly one-third</a> are considering leaving the field altogether.</p>



<p>Dr. Meckler knew there had to be a better way—and so did her husband, Erez Druk, then an engineer at Facebook. Erez wanted to free his wife and other clinicians to spend less time on paperwork, so he and co-founder Andrey Bannikov designed a solution: <a href="https://www.getfreed.ai/">Freed</a>, an AI-powered clinician assistant. That solution quickly took off, growing in a product-led motion among small- and medium-sized independent practices around the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Freed completely transforms the daily lives of clinicians. During a patient visit, clinicians use Freed to transcribe audio and generate draft medical notes. They can quickly review and edit the output, and the platform learns as they go, adapting style and terminology for each user—including preferences for phrasing, template layouts and specific medical vocabulary. After the patient leaves, Freed charts the visit and integrates the record into the EHR system. Doctors get less after-hours paperwork, more time and attention for their patients—and more space in their lives. The reviews are glowing: “Thanks to Freed,” one doctor said, “I close my computer and I’m done for the day. My kids get all of me.” Another: “I can focus on what really matters—my patients.” In many ways, Freed is a love letter from Erez to his wife Gabi, giving her—and doctors like her—precious time back.</p>



<p>When we first met Erez and Andrey, we were impressed by their customer obsession and velocity. Erez does everything with 200% intensity. Learning the saxophone at the age of 10 led to a scholarship from the Berklee School of Music; at the Israel Institute of Technology’s prestigious Technion University, he was at the top of his class. After graduation, he joined the team at Facebook—where he and Andrey met on his first day on the job. Their shared passion for innovation led to a years-long partnership, and now to a shared mission to help clinicians and their patients.</p>



<p>Today Freed serves more than 17,000 providers in small- and medium-sized practices across nearly 100 specialties, from mental health to pediatrics, giving doctors peace of mind and hours of time for what matters most. We at Sequoia are proud to support Erez, Andrey and their <a href="https://www.getfreed.ai/careers">growing team</a> by leading their Series A.</p>

<p>The Zcash ecosystem is embarking on a new chapter, and with it comes both challenges and opportunities. As we navigate this transition, I want to take a moment to express gratitude, outline our immediate priorities, and share my approach to ensuring the Zcash Foundation (ZF) operates at the highest level possible throughout this process.</p>



 Thank You, Jack 



<p>First and foremost, I want to extend my sincere thanks to Jack for his four years of service to ZF and countless contributions to the Zcash ecosystem since inception. Leadership transitions are never easy, but Jack’s dedication to ZF and the broader Zcash ecosystem has left an indelible impact that will ensure ZF’s momentum continues as we move forward.</p>



 Appreciation for the ZF Team and Ecosystem Partners 



<p>Also, I am incredibly grateful for the ZF engineers who continue to push forward each day, solving complex challenges and keeping Zcash at the cutting edge of privacy technology. Your expertise and dedication are critical to the success of Zcash, and I deeply appreciate your work.</p>



<p>Beyond ZF, I want to recognize the contributions of other key engineering teams and community organizations in the ecosystem. Zcash’s success relies on collaboration, and the work happening across the broader network of contributors is invaluable. Thank you ECC, Shielded Labs, ZCG, grantees, Zcash communities around the world, and individual contributors for your efforts in making privacy-preserving financial tools a reality.</p>



 My Role and Priorities as Interim Executive Director and COO 



<p>As Interim Executive Director and COO, my primary focus is ensuring that ZF operates smoothly and effectively during this transition period. With the support of the ZF board, I am committed to providing the resources and structure needed for the team to continue their important work without disruption.</p>



<p>One of the most critical tasks ahead is co-leading a strategic planning process with the ZF board. Before we can recruit a new Executive Director, we need to clearly define what skills and experience are required to lead ZF into the future. This process will be collaborative, thoughtful, and designed to ensure the best possible outcome for ZF and the Zcash community.</p>



<p>Additionally, the board seat vacated by Jack will remain open until the new Executive Director is in place, ensuring that the future leadership of ZF is properly aligned with the organization’s long-term vision.</p>



<p>During this interim period I will continue to provide transactional support to ZCG and ZecHub via FPF and I will no longer hold a leadership role within the organization. As of March 1st, the FPF board of directors is solely responsible for all future-focused decision making and strategic planning to ensure there is no conflict of interest across my roles.</p>



 My Approach: Coordination, Communication, and Execution 



<p>I strongly believe that Zcash does not have the time or resources to waste on inefficiencies or misalignment. My approach to leadership during this period is guided by three key principles:</p>



<p></p>



 
 Coordination – We need to maximize the impact of our efforts across the Zcash ecosystem. That means avoiding duplication of work, streamlining decision-making, and ensuring that every resource is used as effectively as possible. 



 Improving Communication – Both within ZF and across the broader Zcash community, communication must improve. ZF will be taking a closer look at how we share information and coordinate efforts, making necessary adjustments to ensure clarity, timeliness, and a cooperative approach to tackling challenges, both new and longstanding. 



 Execution – If you’ve worked with me over the past three-plus years, you know that I take a “get shit done” approach to everything I do. This transition period is no exception. We will move forward with focus, ensuring that ZF remains a strong, reliable, and effective organization. 
 



 



<p>While transitions like this inevitably come with uncertainty, I am committed to ensuring that ZF not only remains stable but continues to move forward with clarity and purpose. We are not here to dwell on the past—we are here to build the future.</p>



<p>To everyone in the Zcash community: I appreciate your work, your effort, and your commitment to our shared mission. Let’s move forward together.</p>



<p>—Alex Bornstein, Interim Executive Director</p>

<p>My first involvement in Zcash was nearly ten years ago. At the time, Zooko was trying to raise funding to build Zcash, and I gave him some feedback on his investor pitch. We stayed in contact, and I became an advisor to the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (as ECC was then known). About a month before Zcash launched, I joined the ECC team full-time, and so I was there when we launched Zcash from the kitchen of an Airbnb in the Bay Area, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/business/dealbook/zcash-a-harder-to-trace-virtual-currency-generates-price-frenzy.html"></a>The New York Times’ coverage of the Zcash launch



<p>For the next four years at ECC, and then for another four years at the Zcash Foundation, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside some of the smartest and most dedicated people I’ve ever met. In that time, I’ve watched the Zcash ecosystem grow and become decentralised. As well as ECC and the Foundation, we now have QEDIT, Shielded Labs, the Financial Privacy Foundation, ZecHub, ZingoLabs, and a bunch of other teams that are funded by the Zcash Community Grants program, all of whom contribute to or support the Zcash mission in a variety of ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Zcash ecosystem and community grows and evolves, so must the institutions that steward and support it, and that is especially true of the Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Executive Director, it has been my responsibility and privilege to serve the Zcash Foundation team, the Zcash community, and the Zcash mission for the past four years. One of my responsibilities as ED is to recognise when the time is right to step aside, to allow someone else to take the helm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe that time has come, and so I am stepping down from the role of Executive Director of the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alex Bornstein is taking over as interim ED. Alex is eminently qualified, with prior experience as ED of a 501(c)(3), and nearly four years as ZF’s COO. In that role, he has ably supported and advised me, and I look forward to returning the favour while the ZF Board begins the process of recruiting a permanent ED who will lead ZF through the coming evolution of its role.</p>



<p>I want to thank the Zcash Foundation team and Board members — past and present — for granting me their trust, support and patience over the past four years.&nbsp;I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work full-time on a project that aligns as strongly with my principles as Zcash does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To preempt any speculation or rumours: I am not leaving to take up another role, and there is no rancour or disagreement between the ZF Board and me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will continue to support the Zcash Foundation in any way I can, and I will continue to support and contribute to the broader Zcash mission as a community member.</p>

This strategic move positions Panther within a jurisdiction renowned for its stability, regulatory clarity, and leadership in blockchain innovation, privacy protection, and self-sovereignty, providing a solid foundation for long-term growth and development.</p><p>Why Switzerland?</p><p>Switzerland has built a reputation as a leading global hub for blockchain and financial innovation. It offers a well-defined legal framework that supports decentralization and privacy-conscious technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond regulation, it is home to a deep ecosystem of blockchain pioneers, institutional players, and research initiatives that drive industry advancement. The Foundation’s new home places Panther in an environment that fosters compliance and meaningful innovation, ensuring it remains at the forefront of confidential DeFi infrastructure and global adoption.</p> Key Developments:&nbsp;   Establishment of a Swiss-Based Foundation – The Panther Protocol Foundation will drive the protocol’s long-term development.  Intellectual Property Transfer—In the coming days, ownership of Panther’s codebase will be transferred from Panther Ventures Limited (PVL) to the new foundation.  Asset Consolidation – Resources from the Gibraltar-based foundation will be merged into the newly established Swiss entity.  Canary Network—Amongst the Foundation’s earliest priorities is the launching of Panther’s inaugural Canary Network, introducing real tokens to Panther’s platform for the first time. The Canary Network will provide valuable test results and insights under real-world conditions.  Leadership Appointments—Panther welcomes Reuben Yap and John Marshall as council members. Together, they bring a wealth of expertise in privacy-preserving blockchain systems, decentralized governance, regulatory strategy, data ethics, and cybersecurity.   What This Means for Panther <p>With the new framework in place, Panther is now well-positioned for privacy-focused DeFi innovation. The move to Switzerland provides an optimal regulatory framework for PF’s future growth and helps to sustain focus on privacy and compliance in DeFi.</p><p>The foundation will oversee the protocol’s ongoing development with more updates to follow.</p> About the Panther Protocol Foundation <p>The Panther Protocol Foundation is dedicated to supporting the adoption and sustainability of the Panther Protocol across the decentralized Web.

<p>While legacy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are steadily carving their niche within mainstream finance, privacy coins are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>This divergence raises a critical question: in an era where data is king and surveillance is commonplace, can we realistically reconcile the need for robust regulation with the preservation of individual financial privacy?</p> The Core Conflict: Privacy vs. Surveillance <p>While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous (linked to public addresses rather than identities), they remain traceable on the blockchain. Privacy coins like Monero and PIVX employ various technologies to obscure transaction details.</p><p>Monero, for instance, uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) to hide sender, receiver, and amount information. PIVX, on the other hand, employs its famous SHIELD, an implementation of zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). However, these inherent privacy features, while appealing to individuals seeking financial autonomy and anonymity, raise serious concerns for regulators.</p><p>There have been countless assertions from critics suggesting that cryptocurrencies are primarily used for fraud, a claim that has already been <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/money-laundering-facts-fiat-vs-crypto-810a4ad29771">debunked</a> with facts. Sadly, this has done little to stop regulators from clamping down on digital assets, with privacy coins getting a tighter&nbsp;leash.</p><p>Regulators generally argue that the anonymous nature of privacy coins can facilitate illicit activities by making it harder to trace the flow of funds used for criminal purposes. Tax authorities also struggle to track cryptocurrency transactions for tax purposes, especially when privacy features are employed.</p> Global Regulatory Approaches <p>Different countries and regions have taken a different stance on privacy coins. While some have remained silent on the tech, others have issued an outright ban or rolled out measures to checkmate the activities of privacy-centric projects.</p> United States <p>U.S. regulatory pressure on privacy coins has intensified significantly in recent years. In May 2019, FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) issued a binding guidance mentioning “anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies” as potential AML risks. Under the rules, any exchange or business handling privacy coins must register as a Money Services Business (MSB) and implement full KYC/AML compliance.</p><p>In 2022, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) awarded a $1.25 million contract to Chainalysis for developing Monero tracing capabilities. The agency also offered bounties of up to $625,000 for contractors who could break Monero’s privacy protections.</p><p>The next year, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Tornado Cash mixer, demonstrating a willingness to target privacy-enhancing technologies. While not directly targeting privacy coins, this action signaled increased scrutiny of anonymizing technologies.</p><p>In general, major U.S. exchanges have systematically avoided or removed privacy coins. Coinbase has never listed Monero, citing regulatory concerns. Kraken delisted Monero, Zcash, and Dash for U.S. customers in December&nbsp;2023.</p> European Union <p>Unlike the United States, the EU has implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework affecting privacy coins. Implemented in July 2024, MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) requires Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to implement risk-based procedures for privacy coins. While not explicitly banning privacy coins, MiCA mandates transaction monitoring that contradicts privacy coin features.</p><p>Similarly, the implementation of the “travel rule” in October 2024 requires exchanges to collect and share sender/receiver information for transactions exceeding €1,000, directly conflicting with privacy coin functionality.</p><p>On the exchange side, many European crypto trading platforms have implemented tiered verification systems. Binance Europe, for instance, requires video verification for privacy coin trading above&nbsp;€1,000.</p> Asia-Pacific <p>In the Asian-Pacific region, countries like Japan have placed a ban on privacy coins. No licensed Japanese exchange currently offers privacy coins. After the Special Financial Transactions Information Act took effect in March 2021, all major Korean exchanges delisted privacy coins. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) explicitly requested the removal of coins that “pose high money laundering risks.”</p><p>In Hong Kong, the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) implemented a licensing regime for exchanges in June 2023 that effectively prohibits privacy coin trading through strict AML requirements.</p> The Privacy vs. Compliance Conundrum <p>We are already witnessing growing tension between regulatory compliance and privacy. On one hand, regulatory compliance emphasizes transparency and traceability, especially in areas like financial transactions. Privacy, on the other hand, prioritizes anonymity and control over personal information. Privacy, on the other hand, prioritizes anonymity and control over personal information. These goals can inherently clash.</p><p>However, the possibility of coexistence exists through the development and implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies that allow for selective disclosure of information, balancing transparency with anonymity. A risk-based regulatory approach, focusing on high-risk activities rather than blanket surveillance, can also minimize privacy intrusions.</p><p>Privacy-centric projects like PIVX excel in this regard by giving users the option to turn on&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Clear legal frameworks that define the boundaries of both regulatory compliance and privacy are also essential to establish a balance. Ultimately, the successful coexistence of regulatory compliance and privacy will depend on ongoing dialogue, technological innovation, and the development of legal frameworks that adapt to the evolving digital landscape.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>In the digital networked age, people’s attention often overlooks local problems in favour of global ones, which don’t necessarily impact them in their daily lives, or over which they don’t have a say due to the skewed Pareto distribution of power in modern day societies. Puja Ohlhaver, in her recent research paper ‘Community currencies’, proposes a dual-currency model that prices attention and influence in each community, with the ultimate goal of creating a Gaussian distribution of power, either locally, or globally through the dynamic interaction of multiple local communities. This model allows community members to stake their currency to earn non-transferable governance rights, creating a substrate for decentralised societal coordination that favours social innovation.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Puja’s background  Web3 research  ‘Community currencies’  Pareto vs. Gaussian distributions  Global vs. local power distributions  The community currencies model  Meritocracy vs. influence  Quadratic funding  Governance, bribery and the crisis of legitimacy  Experimenting with community currencies  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/pujaohlhaver">Puja Ohlhaver on X</a>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5136037">'Community Currencies' Research Paper</a>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">'Decentralized Society' Research Paper</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

 Episode 4: The Fall&nbsp;Guy <p>The mahogany door of Victoria’s office loomed before Mark like a judge’s bench. He steeled himself, pushing it open to find Victoria perched on her leather throne, her expression a chilling blend of fury and icy calculation.</p><p>“Mark,” she began, her voice a razor’s edge, “this… fiasco… has cost us dearly. Clients are fleeing, our stock is plummeting, and the sharks are circling.”</p><p>Mark met her gaze, a flicker of defiance in his eyes. “It wasn’t just the vendor, Victoria. Our own negligence — “</p><p>“Enough!” she snapped, cutting him off. “Damage control is paramount. We need a scapegoat, someone to absorb the blame. And that someone, Mark, is&nbsp;you.”</p><p>The blood drained from Mark’s face. “But I — “</p><p>“You raised concerns,” Victoria interrupted, her voice dripping with false sympathy. “You were the whistleblower. It’s a tragic irony, a noble sacrifice. The narrative writes&nbsp;itself.”</p><p>Mark felt a wave of nausea. He was being thrown to the wolves, sacrificed to protect the very system that had enabled this disaster.</p><p>The following weeks were a blur of carefully orchestrated chaos. John Doe Wealth, with the complicity of a compliant media, spun a tale of a rogue employee, a well-meaning but ultimately reckless advisor who had inadvertently exposed the company to risk. Mark’s concerns, once dismissed, were now amplified, and twisted into a narrative of personal responsibility.</p><p>He was ostracized; his reputation tarnished. Clients, once trusting and friendly, now regarded him with suspicion and anger. Some, driven to desperation by their financial losses, resorted to desperate measures. He heard whispers of bankruptcies, families torn apart, and even a suicide linked to the breach. The weight of their suffering bore down on him, a crushing burden of guilt he couldn’t&nbsp;escape.</p><p>Meanwhile, John Doe Wealth emerged relatively unscathed. The stock price rebounded, the media frenzy subsided, and the executives responsible for the systemic negligence escaped with their fortunes intact. The breach became a footnote, a cautionary tale of individual error, not a systemic&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Mark, stripped of his career and reputation, found himself adrift. He sought solace in anonymity, moving to a small town, and taking on odd jobs to make ends meet. He haunted the internet, researching privacy coins — decentralized currencies that promised anonymity and security, a stark contrast to the centralized financial system that had betrayed&nbsp;him.</p><p>One evening, while browsing a cryptocurrency forum, he stumbled upon a thread discussing the John Doe Wealth breach. To his surprise, it wasn’t filled with condemnation of the company, but with praise for its swift action in identifying and punishing the “culprit.” The comments were chillingly familiar, echoing the carefully crafted narrative spun by John Doe and the&nbsp;media.</p><p>Mark realized then that the truth didn’t matter. In the age of information overload, perception was reality. He had become a symbol, a convenient scapegoat, a cautionary tale to distract from the deeper rot within the&nbsp;system.</p><p>But as he delved deeper into the world of privacy coins, a spark of defiance ignited within him. He saw a possibility, a chance to build a new system, one based on transparency and individual empowerment. He began to envision a future where financial privacy wasn’t a privilege, but a right, protected by technology, not controlled by institutions.</p><p>The fall guy had fallen, but he wasn’t broken. He was rising, armed with knowledge and a newfound purpose. The system had tried to silence him, but it had inadvertently given him a voice, a platform to challenge the status quo. What could possibly go wrong? He was about to find&nbsp;out.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Last year we launched Brave Search Ads in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Today we share an update on our rapidly growing advertising business on Brave’s independent and privacy-preserving search engine, and preview our plans for expansion in the coming year.</p>
<p>From January to December of 2024, Brave grew search advertising clicks by 15x alongside organic search query growth of 80% (656 million in January to 1.19 billion in December). This initial customer success is the result of targeting the top 1% of paid search advertisers in our primary target regions. These are brands that are hitting the limit of efficiency with Google Ads, and who see Brave Search as a means to unlock additional reach. In most cases, the added conversion volume is in line with Brave’s market share in the region, but in some cases brands see as high as 5% growth on total paid search spend while maintaining their target rate for return on ad spend (ROAS).</p>
<p>Today, over half of the top 20 largest paid search advertisers worldwide are customers of Brave Search Ads, including Amazon Ads Sponsored Products, B&amp;H Photo, Booking.com, CompareCredit, Nerdwallet, Stubhub, and Wayfair. Partnering with these leaders in paid search has been of tremendous value to the development of Brave Search Ads. With their help, we’re discovering new ways to achieve scale and improve the effectiveness of our advertising platform.</p>
<p>Our customers have been overwhelmingly supportive of our entry into the paid search market. Brands unanimously agree there should be more competition. At 90% of market share, Google wields pricing power that their customers have no choice but to accept. Our customers know that by buying on Brave Search, they are contributing directly to the development of a more competitive and fair search advertising market, and reaching engaged users and tech early-adopters who value privacy and independence. Importantly, first-movers on Brave Search Ads have benefited from category exclusivity in what is otherwise a highly saturated market, giving them an edge over competitors who exclusively buy Google Ads.</p>
<p>Overall, Brave Search advertisers are extremely satisfied with their experience; 9 out of 10 customers who started Brave Search Ads campaigns in 2024 have continued to advertise in consecutive months.&nbsp;</p>

 What’s driving success at Brave 
<p>The two key forces behind our success in 2024 were the continued growth of the Brave browser (where in most regions Brave Search is the default), and the effectiveness of search engine advertising for all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>Brave browser and Brave Search are growing at a sustained pace each month. In January, the Brave browser counted 80 million active users worldwide, and 1.29 billion Brave Search queries. The latest numbers are <a href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1886617512353390979">shared regularly to the public by our CEO Brendan Eich</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search advertising is a well-established market where ads help users find products they show clear intent for with their search keywords. Advertisers on Brave Search are seeing available keyword volume passively increase each month, with conversion rates remaining steady at 100, 1,000 or 10,000 monthly clicks. Brave Search has achieved a predictable and gradually-growing stream of new Web traffic, and thus conversion volume for advertisers. For the first time since Bing, there’s an independent search engine with high-quality search results that convert customers as well as or better than Google Ads.</p>
<p>While the formula itself is simple—a growing search engine plus good ads equals more advertisers—Brave Search didn’t appear overnight. The project began nearly two decades ago <a>with Cliqz, which became Brave Search</a> with a 2021 acquisition, and that tremendous effort is now bearing fruit.

 通过迁移到Base,Horizen立即与高度活跃的DeFi和dApp生态系统连接,为$ZEN提供了更大的实用性和可访问性。    <p>该提案的目的是增强Horizen的Base设施,采用潜力和生态系统范围,同时保持其隐私和零知识（ZK）创新重点，迁移到Base的主要好处包括:</p>  <p>前所未有的可扩展性和低费用</p>  Base利用了Optimism的OP Stack,并计划将交易速度缩减到1秒以下的最终结果,而成本低于1美分—是ZK驱动的应用程序的理想选择，    <p>开发人员成长与CoinBase支持</p>  Base提供了蓬勃发展的开发人员社区,丰富的流动性和强大的营销支持,使Horizen具有竞争优势。    <p>机构级安全与信任</p>  作为Coinbase支持的网络,Base增强了ZEN的机构信誉,巩固了其在Grayscale和Coinbase生态系统中的地位,并保持了$ZEN持有人的合规优势。    <p>未来证明和更大的网络效应</p>  预计2025年将有100个+应用在Base上使用,Horizen可以早期采用,更深的流动性和更大的互操作性。    <p>在可扩展的生态系统中增强隐私</p>  Horizen将可扩展性与先进的隐私创新相结合,将保护隐私的技术带入了Superchain。    <p>优化的ZK集成</p>  Base灵活的模块化架构使Horizen可以利用现有的汇总Base架构,同时专注于ZK创新的开拓性。    <p>跨链互操作性</p>  Base强大的桥接功能可促进与其他L2和L1的互操作性,从而扩展了$ZEN的范围和可组合性。    <p>成本效率</p>  与维护独立的基于基板的链相比,Base已建立的Base架构降低了开发成本。      为什么要搬到Base-为什么现在呢？ <p>迁移到Base的建议不仅是技术上的转变,而且是使ZEN的采用,实用性和长期价值最大化的战略举措，</p><p>一年前,此举是不可能的-但今天,区块链景观发生了重大变化:</p>  <p>Base已发展成为一个繁荣的生态系统,超过了TVL和开发人员参与度的主要竞争对手，</p>  <p>第3层解决方案已成为改变游戏规则的缩放模型,可实现超低成本交易和更大的灵活性，</p>  <p>Horizen Labs在L2 / L3生态系统方面获得了第一手经验,有助于将Base确定为Horizen未来的最佳选择，</p>  <p>通过迁移到Base,Horizen可以与Coinbase支持的快速扩展的网络保持一致,同时保留其利用零知识证明实现可信赖的数字未来的愿景。</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  最终思想:视野的确定时刻 <p>此举的目的是巩固Horizen在隐私和可伸缩性方面的领导地位,确保我们保持竞争力,创新性并深入以太坊生态系统。</p><p>Horizen一直致力于为未来建设,这一过渡标志着朝着实现我们的使命迈出大胆而必要的一步。</p><p>保持联系并加入对话:</p>  <p><a

<p>We are pleased to announce that Taylor Hornby and Ted Hoffmann have joined the Zcash Foundation board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor and Ted’s considerable expertise, along with their perspective as community members will enhance the Foundation’s ability to better support and serve the Zcash community.</p>



<p><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/earthrise-for-the-zf-board/49274">Taylor Hornby</a> (earthrise on the Forum) brings extensive experience to the Zcash ecosystem, having worked at the Electric Coin Company (ECC) during Zcash’s pre-launch, later returning to ECC in 2018 as a security engineer, before leaving in 2022 and becoming the Zcash Ecosystem Security Lead through 2023. His stated focus is aligning engineering efforts with product improvements and adoption, fostering unity among community leaders through constructive dialogue, and promoting a culture of collaboration and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/boggerster-for-the-zf-board/49271">Ted Hoffmann</a> (boggerster on the Forum) is a European citizen fluent in French, German, and English, with nearly a decade of experience in cryptocurrency. He’s particularly passionate about Ethereum and Zcash, valuing open finance and permissionless financial privacy as essential safeguards against authoritarian financial controls. He believes Zcash’s privacy features are critical for fostering a democratic society. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Cosmos, Bitcoin, and Zcash, Ted advocates for a community-first approach to advancing Zcash, prioritizing effective communication, streamlined technology, robust onboarding, and a transition to proof-of-stake (PoS).</p>



<p>Taylor and Ted’s arrival coincides with the departure of Peter Van Valkenburgh and Amber Baldet from the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter has been a remarkable board member and visionary. Over the past eight years, his steadfast dedication has been instrumental in shaping the Foundation into what it is today. From boldly advocating for the Foundation’s unique charitable mission to ensuring that our new trademark policy supports greater decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, he has set a high standard for our mission of building financial privacy infrastructure for the public good. His commitment to privacy, decentralization, and open-source innovation has left an indelible mark on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As he settles into his new role as Executive Director at Coin Center, we thank him for many years of service and wish him continued success in defending the rights of developers and advancing privacy for all.</p>



<p>Amber’s involvement in Zcash dates back to her time at JP Morgan, where she was responsible for establishing a partnership with the Electric Coin Company that triggered a huge amount of interest in Zcash’s technology. She was one of the first ZF board members appointed based on the community’s feedback, and she has been steadfast in ensuring that the Foundation stays focused on its mission. Her experience in technology leadership roles, and as a startup co-founder and CEO, has been invaluable to the Board and to me personally, often bringing a much-needed dose of reality to our discussions. Her presence on the board will be sorely missed but she will continue to serve the Zcash community and mission as a founding member of the Financial Privacy Foundation’s board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the board, the Zcash Foundation team, and the entire Zcash community, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Peter and Amber for helping guide me through the past four years, and for their vision, dedication, and lasting impact on the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>— Jack Gavigan, Executive Director</p>

<p>Welcome to the Empeiria’s first development update of 2025! We're kicking off the year with our mainnet launch around the corner, technical updates and ecosystem advancements to set the stage for a transformative year for the Empeiria ecosystem!</p>Intelligent Digital Product&nbsp;Passport 1. iDPP: Intelligent Digital Product&nbsp;Passport <p>As featured by the World Economic Forum, Empeiria has been selected for the TradeTech Regulatory Sandbox. This initiative, launched by the World Economic Forum in partnership with the Ministry of Economy, UAE (MoE) and Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED), aims to drive regulatory innovation in cross-border digital&nbsp;trade.</p>  TradeTech Regulatory Sandbox: <a href="https://www.tradetechglobal.org/sandbox">https://www.tradetechglobal.org/sandbox</a>    WEF Linkedin Announcement: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum-trade_tradetech-global-tradetech-forum-activity-7288556517350363137-V2rd">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum-trade_tradetech-global-tradetech-forum-activity-7288556517350363137-V2rd</a>  <p>As part of a pilot for the World Economic Forum we’ve developed a new product based on Empeiria’s infrastructure — iDPP, a Verifiable Credential-based system for product authentication.</p> What is&nbsp;iDPP? <p>A next-gen product designed for a framework of trust to verify the authenticity, origin and compliance — without compromising privacy.</p><p>Key Features</p>  Decentralized &amp; Verifiable — Uses blockchain-backed credentials instead of self-reported data.  Cost-Efficient &amp; Scalable — Off-chain storage (IPFS) minimizes blockchain fees.  AI &amp; Blockchain Integration — Automates trust-based interactions, making verification seamless.  <p>Why does it&nbsp;Matter?</p><p>In an age of deepfakes, counterfeiting, and opaque supply chains, verifiable data is the missing trust layer. iDPP ensures manufacturers, regulators, and consumers can verify products instantly.</p> 2. Mainnet Launch&nbsp;Progress <p>Mainnet is in its final stage of development, with key optimizations ensuring security, performance, and scalability.</p> Key Technical Milestones <p>✅ 400% Efficiency Boost<br>The document update process is now faster and more scalable — A major DID module refactor improves storage compression &amp; processing speed.</p><p>✅ Expanded Simulation Testing<br>We’ve expanded our simulation tests to catch rare edge cases and unexpected interactions to catch edge cases before they happen, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p><p>✅ SoftNodes — A New Mechanism for Long-Term Participants<br>A feature designed for those who want to stake and validate over the long run. Users can easily manage staking, select validators, receive rewards, and monitor their node activities.</p><p>✅ Network &amp; Automation Preparations<br>We’re actively configuring servers and automation scripts for the mainnet launch to ensure network stability ahead of&nbsp;launch.</p><p>✅ Comprehensive Developer Docs<br>We’ve completed an extensive documentation set, covering standard blockchain interactions and our custom features. Developers and users can quickly understand the chain’s capabilities and operational guidelines</p> 3. Additional Development Updates  OneClick Deployment Portal <p>We continue to refine the OneClick Deployment Portal, which recently went live. Our focus is on optimizations and security reviews to ensure safer and more straightforward deployments across the ecosystem. Given our role as a trust layer, these audits help us maintain top-tier reliability standards.</p> AI Agent Integration &amp; Use&nbsp;Cases <p>We’re building tools where an AI agent interacts with users and leverages verifiable credentials. For example, an AI agent can conduct user assessments, issuing credential-based certifications for those who meet certain criteria — ideal for exams, training, or automated skills verification. Another application involves AI-based credential verification, where an AI system validates credentials such as employment records or certificates — useful in job interviews or background checks.</p> Telegram Game&nbsp;Updates <p>We continue expanding our Telegram-based game (gEMPE) with new missions, improved gameplay, and additional features. The goal is to keep the experience engaging and fresh for our community while rewarding users for participation.</p> Summary <p>Thank you for being part of our journey! 2025 has already seen a flurry of innovation: from the iDPP rollout to wrapping up preparations for our mainnet launch. We’re committed to delivering impactful solutions for decentralized data and digital identity.</p><p>We look forward to an exciting year of growth, collaboration, and pioneering new possibilities in verifiable data and blockchain technology!

He also explores why the internet’s original covenant—where content creators traded free access for search traffic—is breaking today, and how a better internet could introduce entirely new business models for creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, we have a choice to make: will the next era of the internet be shaped by a handful of centralized players, or transformed into an open ecosystem where power and control flow to creators across the globe?</p><p>Resources:</p><p>Watch the conversation here: <a href="https://youtu.be/gioxu1CVjhM">https://youtu.be/gioxu1CVjhM</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Read more, including the full transcript, here: <a href="https://cms.a16z.com/?p=374659&amp;preview=true">https://a16z.com/ai-crypto-internet-chris-dixon/</a></p><p>Chris’s recent article on blockchain innovation: <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/blockchain-ai-internet/">https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/blockchain-ai-internet/</a></p><p>Find Chris’s book, Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet:</p><p>Penguin Random House: <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/744504/read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/744504/read-write-own-by-chris-dixon/</a></p><p>Penguin UK: <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/459860/read-write-own-by-dixon-chris/9781804949245">https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/459860/read-write-own-by-dixon-chris/9781804949245</a></p><p>For more resources on AI &amp; crypto visit: <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/?tag=ai-crypto,web2-to-web3">https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/?tag=ai-crypto,web2-to-web3</a></p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

 ShadeX — Cosmos Encrypted Money&nbsp;Market <p>The Cosmos is going through ATOM realignment, the process of protocols prioritizing ATOM and its community as a critical asset to achieving collective success.</p><p>Shade as an encrypted DeFi suite, rapidly embraced ATOM alignment by accruing and liquidity-providing ATOM and stATOM on ShadeSwap. Shade currently holds ~16,000 ATOM in its treasury.</p><p>Beyond just accruing ATOM, Shade is launching ShadeX — the world’s first encrypted money market. Users are empowered to lend out their crypto assets, passively earning interest fees and yield from users who borrow their assets from a lending pool. The ShadeX money market maintains solvency via a system of liquidations of collateral from insolvent borrowers, returning the borrowed debt back to&nbsp;lenders.</p><p>ShadeX will feature ATOM and stATOM as both lendable and borrowable assets. Additionally, ATOM and stATOM will be usable as collateral on ShadeX to borrow other popular assets (i.e. BTC, ETH, USDC, SILK,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>Historically, money markets throughout crypto expose all lending and borrowing data. This means transparency for how much interest has been accrued to a user’s position, how much someone has borrowed, and even how close they are to liquidation! Can you imagine a world where you knew everyone’s credit ratings, mortgages, and student loan&nbsp;debt.</p><p>We believe ShadeX is a key trailblazing experiment for onboarding institutional and large liquidity into a data-secure lending and borrowing environment. The power of the CosmosSDK and CosmWasm have empowered protocols (such as Shade) to build compelling financial primitives for anyone in the world to&nbsp;access.</p><p><a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/blog/shadex-coming-soon">ShadeX - Redefining Crypto Lending/Borrowing via Encryption - Blog</a></p><p>If you are interested in bringing your ATOM to the world’s first achievement, we invite you to join us for the launch of ShadeX on March 5,&nbsp;2025.</p><p>All you need is some SCRT for gas and ATOM for lending/borrowing to begin experiencing the most data-secure DeFi in all of&nbsp;crypto.</p><blockquote>Bridge your ATOM today → <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></blockquote><p>X: <a href="https://x.com/Shade_Protocol">https://x.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.co/u3bysYisf1">https://t.co/u3bysYisf1</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/shadex-cosmos-encrypted-money-market-ff866e1d39c6">ShadeX — Cosmos Encrypted Money Market</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Ecosystem Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with OpenEvidence: A Life-Saving Healthcare Revolution  <p>This AI-powered search engine for doctors could be one of the most important companies of the next decade.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published February 19, 2025
  



OpenEvidence co-founder Daniel Nadler.



 
<p>Choosing the right medicine for a prostate cancer patient, based on the latest efficacy research. Accessing expert guidance in a rural area, where sub-specialists are scarce. Uncovering overlooked studies in a review of OCD treatments. Identifying the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism before it’s too late.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the millions of ways more than a quarter of U.S. doctors have used the specialized medical search engine <a href="https://www.openevidence.com/">OpenEvidence</a> in the roughly one year since it launched. Already, the scale of its impact is a prime example of AI as a force for good. But if co-founders Daniel Nadler and Zachary Ziegler and their team achieve what we believe they can, the lives they help save could soon be measured in the millions.</p>



<p>This transformative technology comes as the U.S. healthcare system reaches a breaking point. With just one million active physicians for a growing—and aging—population of 340 million, doctors are stretched thin. On top of clinical work, they spend countless hours sifting through journals, to ensure their life-and-death decisions are based on the latest research. But a new PubMed article is published every <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266638992400076X#:~:text=Over%201.5%20million%20scientific%20articles,the%20PubMed%20database%20every%20year.">three minutes</a>, and medical knowledge doubles every <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116346/#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20the,0.2%20years%E2%80%94just%2073%20days.">73 days</a>. It is impossible to keep up.</p>



<p>Like a ChatGPT for doctors, OpenEvidence automates this information hunt. The platform searches across 35 million peer-reviewed publications—and, thanks to a new content partnership, is trained on The New England Journal of Medicine. There are no hallucinations; if the literature is inconclusive, OpenEvidence simply doesn’t respond. And it communicates just like healthcare professionals do—conversationally, and complete with medical charts and graphs.</p>



<p>A second-time founder, Daniel was already well ahead of the AI curve when he launched the financial technology platform Kensho, which was acquired by S&amp;P in 2018 and is credited with the company’s AI evolution. When COVID-19 hit, he couldn’t stop thinking about applying what he’d learned to healthcare. So he founded OpenEvidence with a mission to organize the world’s medical knowledge—and help physicians quickly surface the latest and most effective treatments for their patients. Daniel has proven to be a magnet for talent, attracting top AI researchers to the OpenEvidence team—including Zachary, a brilliant computer scientist from Harvard—and assembling a world-class medical board to ensure the platform gives physicians exactly what they need.</p>



<p>The response has been remarkable: in less than a year, OpenEvidence became perhaps the fastest-growing healthcare business in history, with more than 35,000 verified doctors registering each month. Aside from the iPhone, we believe no technology has been adopted by doctors so quickly. Even more remarkable is that it all happened via word of mouth; the engine of OpenEvidence’s growth is trust. And because the app is free to every doctor in every U.S. care center, it’s assisting not just doctors in top hospitals, but also small, independent practices in hard-to-reach communities across the country.</p>



<p>Sequoia is proud to lead the Series A for OpenEvidence and partner as their first institutional investor, and we look forward to supporting them as they continue to grow. The work Daniel, Zachary and their team are doing has the potential to create one of the defining companies of the next decade—and to revolutionize medicine for doctors and their patients alike.</p>

DeepSeek’s rapid ascent has triggered global scrutiny, with lawmakers and regulators worldwide raising questions about its privacy policies, potential ties to Chinese censorship, and the implications for national security. While specific details of actions taken by other countries may not be publicly available due to ongoing investigations or diplomatic sensitivities, it is widely understood that several nations have expressed concerns and are monitoring the situation closely. These concerns often revolve around data collection practices, potential government access to user information, and the potential for misuse of AI technology.</p><p>Adding to the growing unease, cybersecurity firms have discovered significant vulnerabilities in DeepSeek’s large language models (LLMs). These LLMs are susceptible to “jailbreak” techniques, which allow users to bypass safety protocols and generate harmful&nbsp;content.</p><p>The discovery of these vulnerabilities in DeepSeek mirrors similar issues found in other AI platforms. OpenAI recently patched a flaw in its ChatGPT-4 model that allowed attackers to manipulate the chatbot’s responses. Similar vulnerabilities have been identified in Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5-VL model and GitHub’s Copilot, demonstrating a broader challenge in ensuring the safety and security of advanced AI&nbsp;systems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/italy-blocks-deepseek-ai-over-data-risks-e2c5f3654a34">Italy Blocks DeepSeek AI over Data Risks</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Tilman Tschoeke’s first day at RobCo was in the spring of 2022. The small-scale industrial robotics company was still tiny, with just 25 employees in their Munich office. It was a challenging time for European startups—the characteristic precarity of early-stage entrepreneurship was exacerbated by rising interest rates and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Companies were counting every euro carefully.</p>



<p>RobCo’s 28-year-old cofounder Roman Hölzl gave Tschoeke a laptop, informing his new head of finance that he’d have to bring his own charger. A few days into the job, Tschoeke was given access to the company’s bank account as he prepared to issue salary payments. At first glance, the numbers he saw there made no sense. He asked Hölzl if he could give him access to the second bank account, to which Hölzl replied, “Oh, there is no second account.” Tschoeke’s stomach sank. He could only choose to trust Hölzl’s seeming unflappability, which proved to be a sound judgement call when a well-timed payment from the company’s seed round arrived days later.</p>



<p>Tschoeke was beginning to appreciate that flirting with the boundaries of sensible and possible was just another weekday for Hölzl. It wouldn’t take long working with him before Tschoeke, like so many others who know the young CEO, came to understand that Hölzl views the world as a series of obstacles to surmount, odds to overcome and races to win. It’s a trait that has defined Hölzl’s triumphs. In the most immediate, physical sense, it has also led him to the edge of disaster.</p>



 



<p>Hölzl comes from a long line of competitive skiers. His paternal grandfather was a skier, having picked it up during an apprenticeship in post-World War II Switzerland. He eventually settled in Munich and ran a small butcher shop—exhausting manual labor that reliably put food on the table even during times of scarcity. Their three sons eventually took up teaching skiing to pay their way through school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When they weren’t skiing, both of Hölzl’s parents ran a small car dealership in Neuburg an der Donau, a calendar-pretty Bavarian town an hour north of Munich. In the winter, they would drive their sons, Roman and Florian, the three hours to the alps. By the time Roman was a teen, he was an instructor himself—a family vocation that Florian now sees as surprisingly apt preparation for his big brother’s work as a founder. It required keeping a cohort (of kids, usually) motivated to brave any sort of dreadful weather or scary terrain. Roman had to present himself as fearless to instill confidence in those who counted on him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hölzl brothers built their nerve by throwing themselves, often literally, into sports—tennis, swimming, trampolining, skateboarding, whatever. Roman was a stronger skier and more intense competitor than his younger brother, a trait Florian believes grew out of Roman’s obsession for optimizing his performance. Skiing, a sport where the smallest mistake can turn into a personal disaster, became Roman’s prime testing ground for visualizing a plan, experimenting at top speed, and applying learnings to future runs.</p>



<p>Most German school days ended at lunchtime. After school, when they lacked the hours necessary to drive to the slopes, they would scour the internet to find videos of new tricks, refine them on their trampoline, and then later experiment on the mountain. In the snowless summer they would lay down wooden pallets covered with fake grass near their home and lather soap on the pipe of a bicycle rack so they could slide on a rail.</p>



<p>By Roman’s mid-teens he was jumping, freestyling and competing constantly against the best skiers in Europe. “We did these 70-foot jumps—that’s double flips, three-and-a-half rotations, corkscrews,” he said. “Basically rotations out of your natural axes and back into it.” He was strong enough that he earned sponsorships from two French companies and was winning competitions with titles such as King of Shred. Well into secondary school, Germany’s education system still allowed him to manage his time as he saw fit. He would show up to class mainly just to take exams, while skiing close to a hundred days a year. His enviable LinkedIn summary of this professional period of his life reads, in part: “Backflips, deep snow, and great times!”</p>



<p>His grades were adequate but certainly not fantastic, and in the winter of 2012, his father challenged his then 18-year-old son to get better marks. If he could, they’d take a ski trip to Canada. Hölzl accepted and got the grades. The day before they were set to depart on their trip, they went skiing. That was when Hölzl took the worst fall of his life and suffered a compression fracture in two spots in his lower back.</p>



<p>He spent a night immobilized in the hospital in an awkward position that made his feet fall asleep. As he lay awake, he contemplated what his life would be if this was, in fact, paralysis. Years later, in hard moments with his startup, he would reflect on that long, numb night.</p>



<p>“If things go south at RobCo, I’m benchmarking against that,” Hölzl says, “which puts everything so much into perspective that company-building becomes a bit of a different beast. It will never be as bad as it was that night in March 2012.”</p>



<p>That next morning, imaging showed that his spinal nerves were fine; he would recover. His family moved his bed upstairs from the basement to the living room. There, as he convalesced, Hölzl had to remain still, really for the first time in his life. He had a lot of time to consider a future in which he might not ever be able to ski. “Having an injury where maybe there’s not going to be a next time,” his brother says, “it’s terrifying. But maybe for Roman, it was necessary to learn patience.”</p>
 



Hölzl on the slopes in Hochzillertal and Kitzbühel, Austria



 
<p>After his injury, Hölzl spent weeks wearing a stabilizing exoskeleton to hold his spine in place. He spent the next season easing back onto the slopes but was far from competing. So what did he do with the other 80-or-so days that he otherwise would’ve been skiing? “That’s when I first started pouring energy into uni,” Hölzl said.</p>



<p>Over the course of the next few semesters, he went from the bottom 25% of his class to the top 3%. School was the new arena where he sized up the competition and was determined to come out on top. “You want to have that same feeling,” he says, “even if it’s an engineering event.”</p>



<p>For as long as he could remember, Hölzl was fascinated by the way his skis, boots and bindings enabled him to do things like launch himself down a mountain at explosive speeds and jump vast distances. “What I always found the most interesting was the intersection of humans and technology,” Hölzl said. “In skiing I witnessed how great it can be if things work out well with you and your technology. But also if it doesn’t go well, with a big crash.” Keen to explore that intersection, Hölzl pursued human factors engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016 he enrolled at the Technical University of Munich, one of Europe’s best engineering universities. During those studies, he also completed a research fellowship at Harvard. His research tended to focus more on user experience—in robotics and autonomous driving—than on back-end engineering.</p>



<p>He met Constantin Dresel and Paul Maroldt when he began a Ph.D. program back at the Technical University of Munich in 2019. Together they ran a practical lab course in robotics and drilled into what they saw as the promise of modular robotics: developing industrial robots that were nimble, safe and able to be reconfigured quickly, thus opening a potentially huge market of smaller manufacturers that historically hadn’t been able to afford to automate manual tasks. The three men were able to plug into Munich’s hub of industry, taking advantage of weekly feedback from advisor companies and deploying prototypes, which gave them practical testing opportunities that validated their otherwise abstract mathematical work.</p>



<p>When the trio launched RobCo in 2020, it was a seamless move into commercializing the work they’d already been doing in the lab. From their time immersed with industry leaders, they understood that manufacturers were fretting over labor shortages that only promised to worsen in the coming years. RobCo aimed to create a robot capable of alleviating that labor shortage and drastically increasing productivity. Picture a programmable arm, perhaps about the size of a human arm or larger, that can do fine, complex manual tasks on repeat ad infinitum.</p>



<p>Two weeks after they claimed the name, they learned that the hit video game Fallout contains a multibillion-dollar robotics company called RobCo. Hölzl just thought it was short, easy and punchy. Now their YouTube videos are peppered with appreciative fan comments—“Ay when y’all releasing zeta invaders”—which gives the cofounders occasion to smile, to think how their startup is blurring the lines with science fiction.</p>
 







 
<p>The early-stage “kind of garage-style” company that Tilman Tschoeke took a chance on in 2022 was powered in large part by Hölzl’s sheer zeal. Hölzl’s fire impressed Tschoeke. “That’s clearly one of his key character traits—he’s very competitive, in a positive sense,” Tschoeke says.</p>



<p>Today, Hölzl’s typical pitch to potential clients begins, he says, with them pitching him. Companies want to know: Can you really do this? Can you install a robot that can laser-cut aluminum bicycle parts, for instance, or pack hearing aids and stack the boxes onto pallets? So RobCo’s opener is simple enough. You’re having trouble finding people. It’s only going to get worse. Let us automate some basic tasks for you. Hire our robots.</p>



<p>Roughly 70% of their customers had never used physical automation before. But all of a sudden the 150-year-old manufacturer de Crignis had RobCo arms molding sheet metal into cladding for machines, and Frank Präzisionsteile, a company that manufactures parts for aerospace and medical devices, had RobCo arms filling the overnight shifts no human workers wanted. And on and on.</p>



<p>RobCo’s modular arms are small enough that they don’t need to be bolted to factory floors. They can be up and running in a matter of a couple of days rather than weeks. “Many of those companies are really just lacking those people,” Hölzl said. “And we’ll see the labor time bomb basically ticking faster and faster in Germany between 2025 to 2028. That’s when the most people will go on pension ever in the history of the country.”</p>



<p>A RobCo robot costs a customer between 2,000 and 4,000 euros per month, or about a third of the cost of the two shift workers its labor can replicate. The size, speed and scale of their robots are what Hölzl calls, in a manner befitting a former elite athlete, “superhuman, but only a little bit.” The RobCo arms can move something that weighs 40 kilograms a few thousand times a day. Greater weights and distances require much more robust robots, the sort that larger factories have used for decades. RobCo has carved its niche in taking over discrete, standalone tasks that would usually require a human operator.</p>



<p>As for the humans building these machines, Hölzl and his cofounders have complementary strengths. In the early days, Dresel focused on the back-end software (the founders built their platform on C++, running on Linux). Maroldt was the hardware guy, the prototyper. Hölzl focused on user interfaces, designing them to be as seamless as possible.</p>



<p>“The best user interface is one that doesn’t exist, in a sense,” Hölzl said. “The key really is, which parts of the overall teaching of the user interface can you just abstract away?” For example: Their perception mechanism is so refined that a user can indicate to the robot a pickup point and a dropoff point for a part, and the robot can detect the rest—what the parts are, how to find and grab them, and how to place them where they need to go. Hölzl says that such a process would have previously required a programmer to feed the machine 50 separate instructions.</p>



<p>Sequoia came across RobCo in 2022 when a scout forwarded Luciana Lixandru the company’s deck. The premise was, essentially, “UiPath for the real world.” Lixandru, who had led the Series A for UiPath—a Romanian company that automates digital tasks, and which is now worth nearly $8 billion—latched onto the thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon meeting Hölzl, she knew he was a special founder: Hölzl’s switch from elite skiing to academic performance was unconventional but promising. “He’s honestly amazing,” she says. “He’s very articulate, very high IQ, very ambitious, very competitive. At Sequoia, all our partners are really competitive. You put him at that table and he still might be the most competitive person there.” Lixandru recalls putting Hölzl in touch with a colleague of hers, a fellow German, and the two eventually met up. The colleague later reported back that they’d taken a nice Sunday bike ride. “And then, when I talked to Roman,” Lixandru says, “he was like ‘We had a biking race.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hölzl was surprised when he first heard from Sequoia; he thought RobCo, as a robotics firm, wouldn’t appeal to venture capitalists who tend to back software companies. The great drawback of robotics is that unlike software, robots are made of stuff. “With software, you build one product and you sell it a million times,” Lixandru said. “Here you have to rebuild every single product that you build and then go deploy it. And you have to do this in a smooth, capital-efficient way.” Eventually the goal is to expand across the globe—the U.S. market remains the ultimate prize—but scaling robotics is an even greater feat than scaling software. Every unit has to be built, shipped, installed and monitored. Sequoia is betting that Germany, a hub of mid-sized engineering and manufacturing companies, is the right place to start scaling.</p>



<p>In one sense, RobCo keeps pushing so fast by doing the least. Rather than dabble in theoretical solutions, the company builds only the specific features its clients ask for and need. Tschoeke says that his CEO has the charisma to sell and to communicate a vision, as well as the technical background to resolve customers’ engineering concerns. “He’s very to the point,” Tschoeke says of Hölzl. “Whatever the question is, he has answers. And I think that’s his biggest strength.”</p>



<p>RobCo is now approaching 100 employees, supplying small- and mid-sized manufacturers in Germany with its robotic arms. The company is filling a market niche that Hölzl believes may include tens of thousands of companies. As RobCo reaches more customers, it’s also gathering data with a long-term aim of making robots that work even in unstructured use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In Germany we have a quote that means, basically, ‘Impossible is nothing,’” Tschoeke says. “From a technical perspective, when they say, ‘OK, no, we cannot do it in two quarters because typically it takes a year,’ we say, ‘OK, let’s do it in one quarter.’ And we’ve proved it many times. This comes strongly from Roman. He is always pushing that balance pretty strongly.”</p>



 



<p>Hölzl misses his skiing days. His life now is spent in the office six days a week obsessing over RobCo. Get him talking about skiing and you can hear the joy in his voice. From RobCo’s HQ in Munich, he’s a short drive from alpine skiing. But when he daydreams, it’s of western Canada or of Hokkaido. Japan, he says, has the greatest snow in the world.</p>



<p>He and Florian recently splurged on a first for them: skiing in the Caucasus Mountains. Florian traveled to Georgia from Germany; his brother arrived directly from a work trip abroad, feeling a little worse for wear amid all the travel. They headed to a tiny village where the next morning, a man wearing ski boots picked them up in a Ford Raptor pickup truck. He drove them to a clearing outside town where a helicopter flew them to 15,000 feet and they got a glimpse of Russia before they dropped into virgin mountainside powder.</p>



<p>Florian remembers it as a sublime day on the mountain. He also watched his brother closely. After a few runs, Hölzl was actually the one to beg off early. His schedule had caught up with him, and in a moment of uncharacteristic restraint, he decided not to push himself to the absolute brink.</p>



<p>They left the mountain with light still in the sky. After two days of rest—an eon for any founder to put everything on pause but an eternity for this one—he finally felt right. On the third day, Hölzl began to bang out emails and take calls. “He was hyped to work again,” Florian says, “because he had so many ideas.” Florian felt that he was witnessing an understanding dawn on his brother in real time: Not every race in Roman Hölzl’s life required a headlong sprint, it turns out. It took Hölzl a mere three decades on skis to learn that he, too, is only human—a realization that just might help sustain his human-augmenting robotics company for years to come.</p>

<p>Today, we have adopted a new trademark policy for the Zcash trademarks. You can read the full policy <a href="https://zfnd.org/trademark-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we highlight some of the important changes, and explain why we believe this new approach supports and enables greater decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



 Background 



<p>For the past five years, use of the Zcash trademarks was governed by an <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">agreement</a> between the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Following ECC’s decision to terminate that agreement, ZF became the sole steward of the trademarks. This provided an opportunity to review and update the trademark policy to reflect the growing decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>Our overarching objective in making these changes is to allow members of the Zcash community to use the trademarks as broadly and permissively as possible for purposes that are natural and well-intentioned in the context of a decentralized cryptocurrency, while still protecting the trademarks (and thus, Zcash’s name, brand and reputation) from misuse by those who seek to mislead, deceive or defraud.</p>



 Key Changes 



<p>At a high level, the changes introduced in this new trademark policy are aimed at making it:</p>



 
 Shorter and simpler: The most obvious change is that the new trademark policy is shorter and simpler. The old policy was adapted from the Model Trademark Guidelines, which are intended for open source software projects. By reviewing the policy from the perspective of Zcash as a cryptocurrency, we were able to make it shorter, simpler, and therefore easier to understand. 
 



<p></p>



 
 More permissive: The new policy is also more permissive. The old policy was drafted in a way that required that certain uses be explicitly licensed. While we sought to make it as simple as possible to license the trademark, it still required paperwork, which discouraged some people and teams.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 
 Minimized in scope: The new policy seeks to minimize the scope of uses that must be explicitly licensed. For example, the old policy permitted the use of the Zcash trademarks on promotional goods for free giveaways but not for sale. This meant that anyone who wanted to make and sell Zcash-branded merchandise was required to obtain a license from ZF. The new policy removes this restriction, meaning that anyone can now make and sell Zcash-branded merchandise, like stickers, t-shirts or mugs.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Eliminating the Trademark’s Role in Zcash Governance 



<p>The trademark agreement created a governance role for the trademarks by stipulating that network upgrades were subject to approval by both ECC and ZF. If either party objected to the activation of a network upgrade, the Zcash trademarks could no longer be applied to either fork of the blockchain.</p>



<p>The ZF Board believes that it is no longer appropriate to use the Zcash trademarks in this way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency, defined by a documented protocol, and implemented as open source software (most notably <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash?tab=readme-ov-file#the-zcashd-full-node">zcashd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/?tab=readme-ov-file#about">Zebra</a>). The nature of open source software means that anyone is free to copy and modify that software, including making modifications to the way the Zcash protocol is implemented. They may then invite others to run that software. If this were to occur without broad consensus support across the Zcash community and ecosystem, it could result in a contentious hard fork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the event of a persistent contentious hard fork, in order to prevent user confusion, the Zcash Foundation may use the Zcash trademarks to call for specific naming conventions at exchanges or other entities to clearly distinguish between the two tines of the fork. However, the Zcash Foundation will endeavor to not use the Zcash trademarks as a means of persuading the larger public that one tine of the fork or the other is the canonical and only legitimate version of Zcash.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>As Zcash and its ecosystem evolves and become more decentralized, the structures that have built up to support Zcash must also evolve. The Zcash Foundation is committed to ensuring that it adapts to better serve the Zcash mission and community. That commitment includes supporting ongoing decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, and this new trademark policy is an important step in that direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we are keen to hear the community’s feedback and suggestions (both of which helped inform our decision-making on this policy), so please engage on the Zcash Community forums.</p>

<p>Zcash Foundation has developed this <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zcash-Foundation_Participatory-Grant-Making-for-Decentralized-Cryptocurrency-Ecosystems.pdf">discussion draft</a> and an AI-generated <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zcash-Foundation_Participatory-Grantmaking-in-Decentralized-Cryptocurrency-Ecosystems.wav">audio companion</a> in order to empower our community as we collectively explore various future Participatory Grantmaking (PGM) models. Its purpose is to provide an overview of potential approaches without endorsing or advocating for any specific model. The inclusion of any particular funding model in this document should not be interpreted as an indication of support or preference by the Zcash Foundation.</p>



<p>Participatory Grantmaking (PGM) is a natural extension of Zcash’s commitment to decentralization and community governance. The exploration of PGM models for Zcash represents our collective commitment to transparent and inclusive decision-making. The PGM framework enables community members to actively participate in determining how resources are allocated, ensuring that funding decisions align with the collective vision of Zcash’s future.</p>



<p>By examining different models, we can work together to identify mechanisms that:</p>



 
 Preserve Zcash’s core principles of privacy and decentralization 



 Ensure equitable participation in funding decisions 



 Maintain transparency while protecting participant privacy and 



 Strengthen community engagement and ownership 
 



<p></p>



<p>We invite discussion on the Zcash community forum to facilitate <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/unlocking-the-future-of-zcash-through-participatory-grantmaking/50379">an open dialogue about potential PGM implementations</a>, knowing that the success of any chosen model will depend on active community participation and careful consideration about how it serves Zcash’s mission. The ultimate decisions rest with the Zcash community, determined through collaborative discourse and deliberation.</p>

<p>In January, PIVX Labs unveiled Chatstr, a new secure messaging app, and it immediately grabbed my attention. The app ties together the PIVX and Nostr communities. And although it is an independent project from some PIVXLabs devs, it cleverly uses your PIVX wallet as your identity — pretty slick,&nbsp;huh?</p><p>Just a quick note: they’ve since renamed it Vector, so that’s what we’ll be calling it from here on&nbsp;out.</p><p>I even had the chance to chat with JSKitty, one of the brains behind the whole thing, and you can find my interview with him <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/uncovering-chatstr-an-interview-with-jskitty-d4c84b7f5af8">here</a>. I tried out the secret messenger, and here’s what I&nbsp;think.</p> First Impressions <p>Vector’s interface is undeniably simple. The clean design makes it incredibly easy to navigate, even for those unfamiliar with secure messaging. The basic structure works, and it works&nbsp;well.</p><p>Real-time message delivery was smooth and reliable, and the inclusion of emojis, while basic, added a touch of personality to conversations. The core functionality — sending and receiving encrypted messages — is Vector’s strength.</p> The Security Question: Encryption and Seed&nbsp;Phrases <p>Vector’s primary selling point is its focus on security. While I am not familiar with all the backend stuff, the team claims that the app offers a “solid vault-like privacy, without sacrificing the common, fun, enjoyable experience of a well-featured app.”</p><p>In terms of login requirements, Nostr users can sign up with their nsec private key while PIVX users can use their 12-word seed phrase. Although Vector does not store seed phrases at all, I find it unsettling using it at the initial signup. Subsequent logins require a 5-digit decryption pin.</p> Current Functionality <p>While simplicity can be a pro, Vector currently lacks a handful of the features users may expect from modern messaging apps. There are no advanced features like disappearing messages, voice or video calls, or rich media sharing. This makes it feel somewhat basic compared to established players.</p><p>Another significant drawback is the user discovery system. You need the “npub” (of someone to chat with them. This means you can’t easily discover or connect with new users within the app. This severely limits the potential for community growth and makes it feel isolating.</p><p>In general, Vector has potential. The core functionality — secure, real-time messaging — is there. The simple interface is easy to use. However, the cumbersome user discovery system holds it back. The app is still a work in progress and it will be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>In <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company building immersion for Sequoia’s pre-seed and seed-stage founders, we focus on the path to product-market fit. Using the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-framework/">Arc PMF Framework</a>, we describe three distinct PMF archetypes, depending on how customers view the problem your product solves. This new companion framework is about application: Once you understand the three archetypes and your company’s place in the world, what steps can you actually take day-to-day to pursue PMF, and how do you know you’re on the right track?</p>



 Answer the Four Terrifying Questions 



<p>Achieving durable product-market fit requires tackling four terrifying questions that should keep you up at night as you build your business. Each terrifying question has positive indicators that mitigate your fear and indicate you’re headed in the right direction, and a resolution that confirms you’re ready to tackle the next terrifying question. As you build conviction in your answers to the terrifying questions, you get closer to PMF.</p>
 







 
 



 How to Answer Each Question&nbsp; 



<p>The more overlap between your company and the market opportunity, the closer you get to resolving the terrifying question.</p>
 


 
	 
					 
				The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework			 
				
	 

			 
			 
				Your unique advantage			 
			 
				What is my company’s right to exist?			 
			 
				The opportunity			 
		 
	 



 
<p>The first terrifying question to confront is: What is my company’s right to exist? Great companies are built on a founder’s authentic insight about a market opportunity. At this stage your work is to understand the category, the competition and your unique advantages as a founder. How clearly can you describe your founder-market fit? Pressure-test the originating belief behind your business. You want to understand if the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tam-sam-som">TAM</a> provides a big enough reward. As you refine your idea, there will be positive indicators that suggest you’re heading in the right direction.</p>



 
 You can articulate why it’s a compelling category and market, and why now is the moment to capture it 



 Your wedge or entry point into the market opportunity becomes clearer 



 You can articulate your unique advantage in seizing this specific opportunity—why you have founder-market fit 



 Ideation compounds as you hone your direction—information and conversations result in “productive pivots” that build sequentially; you feel progress, not just motion&nbsp; 
 



<p>Conviction in your originating belief should grow as you pressure-test your idea and see more positive indicators. You know that you’ve answered this question when you’re ready to marry the idea for the next decade-plus, and you’d recruit a best friend to work on it with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, when David Vélez was starting Nubank, he turned down an opportunity to join Sequoia as a partner in California. He had always wanted to start a company, and after finishing Stanford GSB he felt a pull back to Latin America. He then spent months pressure-testing his insight about the opportunity to disrupt Brazilian banking. The deeper he dug, the stronger his conviction in the idea became, and he identified his wedge: credit cards, which offered a lower regulatory barrier to entry. Once he was resolved and knew he was ready to commit, Nubank was born.</p>

				What you think matters			 
			 
				Do people care enough?			 
			 
				What customers think matters			 
		 
	 



 
<p>You have an insight into a market opportunity, but the terrifying question remains: Do people care enough about the problem you’re solving? If people don’t care enough, you won’t be able to build a meaningful business by addressing it. They need to care about the problem not only in the abstract, but they need to be willing to pay for the solution. Speaking with potential customers gives you this information. You need a critical mass of conversations to produce enough evidence: We’ve seen companies conduct 50+ conversations in a week. Positive indicators that the problem resonates with customers:</p>



 
 High hit rate on cold outreach (which is more likely to reflect truth vs. warm leads predisposed to “be nice”) 



 More people than you invited show up to calls and demos 



 Customers’ eyes light up at your pitch and they lean in; your idea represents an unlock for them: “I want this now!” 



 Customers express clear willingness to pay for the solution&nbsp; 



 Customer responses help you refine the idea and sharpen what a differentiated solution might look like<br> 
 



<p>It’s important to be objective about how customers externalize these positive indicators, and not let confirmation bias cloud your judgement. If only one in 10 customer conversations lean in, the problem may not matter as much as you thought—but what matters most is the depth of engagement. You’re looking for a set of customers who respond passionately and feel your pitch really speaks to them. Dig deeper into what they have in common and laser focus on this segment. It can be easy to talk yourself into believing that customers are more excited about your idea than they are. The conversations that resonate most strongly will help you define your ICP, how they see the problem and why it matters to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ultimate resolution you’re seeking through these conversations is a set of design partners—initial customers who are excited to co-create the solution with you. If you’re seeing rabid customer interest and you’ve secured design partners, then you’ve successfully validated the problem and answered this terrifying question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before launch, DoorDash’s founders <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-doordash/">spoke</a> with “three or four hundred” small businesses. While their initial idea was about last-mile delivery, they weren’t initially targeting restaurants, since they thought Grubhub and others had already solved this problem. However, they discovered through customer conversations that competitors only routed orders, and left restaurants to make their own deliveries. Local restaurants that couldn’t afford their own delivery staff were the most passionate merchants DoorDash interviewed, with a burning unmet demand. Their first onboarded customer was a macaroon store in Palo Alto that had been turning down dozens of orders per week because they couldn’t deliver them.</p>

				Your roadmap			 
			 
				Does my product actually change behavior?			 
			 
				Customers’ established behavior			 
		 
	 



 
<p>After you’ve validated the problem, there are still likely many different ways you could choose to build your product to solve it. At this stage, the terrifying question becomes: Does your product actually change behavior? It needs to not only work but to delight customers enough to transform their behavior. Your primary task at this stage is iterating on your product and evolving features to find positive indicators that users are consistently engaging with at least one feature. A product feature becoming “sticky” signals that it’s adding enough value to change users’ behavior, in addition to other positive indicators:</p>



 
 A clear “lightbulb” moment in your demo that makes your product click for people 



 Short activation period: users are able to on-ramp and get immediate value from the product, which you can measure as engagement 



 A specific feature in your product becomes durably sticky, even if it’s not the entire product surface 



 Customers make nuanced feature requests, point to a compelling feature set 



 Power user behavior emerges as an outlier pattern among a subset of customers&nbsp; 



 Evangelism and virality emerges—users start telling peers about a specific feature or capability 
 



<p>As you iterate on the product to move your metrics up, your North Star is engaged and retained users. A growing set of retained users, and a low churn rate, give you conviction that your product is indeed changing customers’ behavior. If your most engaged users match the ICP you identified earlier, it should strengthen your conviction in the problem. If not, this will help you refine your understanding of the problem and your ICP, and evolve your product to serve them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drew Houston of Dropbox <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-dropbox/">says</a> product virality is “an exponential game, but also a game of inches.” As Dropbox came out of beta and opened to general availability, the team obsessed over every surface of the onboarding flow and feature usage. They soon figured out that users who shared files with contacts got the most value from the product. As they optimized for file sharing—even advertising on Craigslist to get users in the office to test new designs—the product began to spread virally, with high activation and retention rates, and low churn.</p>

				Your sales playbook			 
			 
				Will customers pay enough to build a business?			 
			 
				Customer spend			 
		 
	 



 
<p>After finding product traction and building conviction in your solution, the next terrifying question to confront is: Will people pay enough for it to build a real business? Scaling a meaningful business requires an exchange of value: customers have to be happy to pay your asking price. Your initial beta customers likely won’t pay your ideal price point, and that’s OK—getting there is a process. As you seek to prove the hypothesis that your price target is realistic, you should iterate on your sales process just like you iterate on product features, testing how to demo, price, package, activate, onboard and support your customers. As you strengthen the value exchange with customers, you’ll see positive indicators:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Discovery process confirms your assumptions about budget availability&nbsp; 



 Customers don’t balk at your asking price or slow roll the deal 



 High ratio of engaged users upgrading from the free tier to the paid tier 



 Contract reviews happen quickly; you don’t get stuck in procurement purgatory 



 You don’t find yourself in a knife fight with competitors based on price 
 



<p>The ultimate answer to whether customers will pay enough to build a business is a list of paying customers who feel they get great value from your product at your asking price. But to achieve your ambition and build an important company, you need to grow. You should be able to chart a path to $500M in revenue based on your conviction in the problem, your assessment of the TAM and the strength of the value exchange.</p>



<p>When Block first introduced the Square mobile card reader, they intended to sell the hardware and software to merchants. The founders had answered the terrifying questions of whether people cared enough about the problem and whether their product changed behavior, but they were still iterating on the price point and how much people would pay. As Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-block/">explains</a>, at one point they realized the best value exchange would be to give the hardware and software away for free, and charge a percentage fee on each transaction. The company would get recurring revenue rather than a one-time sale, and their customers would get immediate value without any capital outlay—a win-win, which quickly brought them to PMF.</p>



 Revisiting the Terrifying Questions 



<p>While the terrifying questions build on one another, you shouldn’t think of answering them in a strictly linear way. Practice is always messier than theory, and it’s possible you’ll confront multiple questions at once, and move fluidly between them over time.</p>



<p>For example: In 2022 Robinhood, already a public company with over $1B in annual revenue, made a profound realization about their ICP: their core customer was not the first-time amateur getting started with investing, as they’d thought, but rather the “active trader” making many trades per week or day. In our Crucible Moments podcast, founder Vlad Tenev <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/robinhood-ft-vlad-tenev-reinventing-finance-for-a-new-generation/">describes</a> how discovering this caused the team to revisit who cared most about the problem they were solving, whether their product was optimized to deliver those users the most value, as well as the value exchange with those customers. Over two years, the company radically evolved its offerings based on these insights and iterated to strengthen their answer to each terrifying question. The result has been dramatically increasing revenue per user (and Robinhood’s share price along with it).</p>



<p>Every time you expand to a new customer or product line, you confront the same terrifying questions again. PMF is an ongoing pursuit, not a finite destination. But we believe that if you answer each terrifying question, the output is product-market fit.</p>

<p>As online content becomes predominantly AI-driven, intellectual property (IP) rights should not be neglected as (human) creators will heavily rely on them. While the main use cases for blockchains revolve around financial applications, one could argue that our everyday lives constantly intersect IPs in different forms. Although the legal framework is abundant, proper recording, monetization and disputes are often a burden for independent creators. Story Protocol aims to create a decentralised framework for IP management, tokenizing it both through NFTs and fungible tokens, allowing creators to register fully programmable IP, that is also recognized and enforced through the traditional judiciary system. Using smart contracts and programmable metadata, Story Protocol ensures proper monetization for creators whenever their IP is used.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jason’s background  Current IP pain points  Tokenizing IP  Story Protocol blockchain  Preventing IP infringement  Story Protocol validators  Interoperability  Onboarding traditional IP to Story Protocol  Story Protocol’s legal framework  Enforcing IP rights on Story Protocol  Hiding or demonetizing on-chain IP  Governance &amp; disputes  Roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/jasonjzhao">Jason Zhao on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/storyprotocol">Story Protocol on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.2.0">2.2.0</a>. In this release, we introduced an additional consensus check on the branch ID of NU6 transactions, along with some important refactors and other improvements.</p>



<p>In order to support the new node and wallet stack that will enable us to deprecate zcashd, this release includes the ability to lookup transaction ids by their transparent inputs and revealed nullifiers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This release also includes a number of updates and enhancements to our JSON RPCs such as an updated JSON RPC crate, accessor methods to <code>zebra-rpc</code> requests and responses to enable Zaino to construct and deconstruct these types. We have also included fixes and updates to some RPC methods to closely match zcashd behaviour. The <code>getblock</code> RPC method now returns transaction details at verbosity level 2, the getblockchaininfo method will return the genesis block when zebra has an empty state, and the <code>getrawtransaction</code> output and RPC errors in general are now as close to zcashd we are able to at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.2.0">v2.2.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,&nbsp;</p><p>January was a month of steady progress, marked by key technical advancements, advancing partnerships, and media coverage. With enhancements to the codebase, ongoing development of future versions, and continued media presence, Panther is gaining momentum and positioning itself as a leader in the privacy and compliance space for DeFi.</p><p>Here are the highlights from January.</p> Technical Progress 

<p></p><p></p>

<p>Panther Protocol’s development continues to move forward at a strong pace, with key enhancements made to the codebase based on <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/changelog/overview-1?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">external testing</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/security-audits?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">audits</a> from <a href="http://veridise.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Veridise</a>. These updates focus on improving performance, security, and scalability, ensuring a solid foundation for future releases.</p><p>Panther contributors remain focused on advancing the framework that supports <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Managers</a>, a critical component of Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/what-is-panther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">architecture</a> designed to <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/compliance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">enhance compliance</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">confidentiality</a>.</p><p>Additionally, preparations for the forthcoming Canary Network are well on track, with Panther Tech contributors focused on configuring and integrating <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">PureFi, an official Panther KYC/KYT partner</a> with <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/changelog/overview-1/stage-5?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">EtherSpot’s bundler service</a> on Polygon.&nbsp;</p><p>The controlled testing environment provided by the Canary Network will allow for real-world experimentation with new features, reinforcing Panther’s commitment to innovation and resilience. The Canary Network will be owned and operated by the forthcoming Swiss-based Panther Protocol Foundation (the Foundation), which is expected to form soon.</p><p>With work accelerating, important technical announcements will be coming from the Panther ecosystem in the days ahead. Stay tuned for what’s next.</p> Ecosystem Updates <p></p>

<p></p><p></p>

<p>In December, the Panther Protocol Foundation secured agreements with <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/09/2993959/0/en/Panther-Protocol-and-Eurobit-Partner-to-Pioneer-Compliant-and-Confidential-DeFi.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Eurobit</a> and <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/17/2998455/0/en/PureFi-and-Panther-Partner-to-Enable-Privacy-Enhanced-Compliant-On-Chain-Transactions.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a> to apply to become Zone Managers. In January, Panther’s ecosystem team actively worked with these partners to establish the necessary infrastructure to support their onboarding. At the same time, these partners worked to refine their own frameworks to effectively use Panther’s core privacy and compliance-enhancing features.&nbsp;</p><p>As these partnerships continue to progress, Panther ecosystem contributors are also focused on attracting additional financial service providers as part of an ongoing effort to expand&nbsp; Panther’s network of Zones.</p> Panther in the Media <p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Panther was recently featured on<a href="https://www.cnbcarabia.com/episode/13922?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> CNBC Arabia’s Crypto Weekly</a>, where co-founder Dr. Anish Mohammed acted as spokesperson, discussing key aspects of Panther’s mission. You can catch the interview at 14:50 in the episode. Panther was also quoted twice by <a href="http://cryptonews.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">CryptoNews</a>, highlighting the protocol’s growing recognition with news media. Later in January, Panther was featured on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC3McVc6CWU&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">CryptoCoinShow</a>, where Dr. Mohammed outlined Panther’s roadmap for 2025. Panther was also interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx-lILA9zVk&amp;list=PLHfKQ5FrydSB6UsJga1g3_msqqRXvVm76&amp;index=2&amp;t=2063s&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Kirill Ivanov</a>, which included a detailed explanation of Panther’s model and its potential impact on the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p> Conclusion <p>January was a key month for Panther Protocol, with significant technological advancements, new ecosystem developments, and growing media attention. January saw updates to the codebase, along with the progress on future iterations and the Canary Network. Meanwhile, partnerships with Eurobit and PureFi continue to shape Panther’s role as a leader in privacy-enabled compliance for DeFi. As Panther gains momentum, the project is closer than ever to realizing its vision of a confidential and compliant DeFi ecosystem.</p>

  Partnering with Avelios: Healthcare for the Modern Age  <p>Christian, Nicolas, Sebastian and their team are transforming hospital information systems—and improving the lives of doctors and patients alike.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/anas-biad/">Anas Biad</a>	 



Published February 6, 2025
  



Avelios co-founders Christian Albrecht, Nicolas Jakob and Dr. Sebastian Krammer.



 
<p>We’ve all been there. You book a medical appointment and fill out your forms online—but when you arrive, you’re handed a clipboard full of the same questions to answer all over again. And behind the scenes, doctors and staff are also spending valuable time copying and pasting, making their demanding jobs even harder.</p>



<p>It happens because the operating system most hospitals run on was developed in the ‘90s, if not earlier. Data is unstructured; interoperability is non-existent; UIs are anything but user-friendly. The consequences, in terms of both inefficiencies and patient outcomes, are severe. Yet despite decades of technological development, hospital information systems (“HIS”) remain undisrupted. Why? They are incredibly difficult to build.</p>



<p>The typical HIS is a complex and mission-critical web of modules, and the hospitals that run them are highly regulated and understandably risk-averse—which can make launching an HIS company just as grueling as launching the product itself. New companies in this space often revert to simple point solutions that try to integrate with a legacy HIS, instead of the ground-up overhaul healthcare clearly needs.</p>



<p>The team at Munich-based <a href="https://en.avelios.com/">Avelios</a> has seen the challenges up close. During the height of COVID, Dr. Sebastian Krammer spent valuable time counting patients by hand, then reported the results to authorities via fax. And when he and Nicolas Jakob, a software engineer and deep learning expert, tried to expand their promising research on classifying skin conditions with AI, they quickly discovered hospitals’ antiquated systems couldn’t provide the data they needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So they teamed up with Christian Albrecht, a McKinsey alum and previous co-founder with Nicolas, to solve the problem. And instead of “treating the symptoms” by building on top of outdated legacy software, they decided to take the hard path of “treating the cause” and tackle the problem at its core, by building a completely new HIS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last couple of years, Avelios built a full hospital information system, including documentation (e.g., EHR, medication, operating room management); administration (e.g., billing, staff, clinic management); patient portals; AI solutions, and more. They took a modular approach so they could land in hospitals with one offering before expanding to the full operating system. But then multiple sea changes in the market accelerated their plans:&nbsp;</p>



 
 One of the leading HIS providers announced they would sunset their product in 2027, creating an urgent need for more than 1,000 hospitals to replace their systems. 



 Regulators in Germany and elsewhere responded to problems revealed by COVID-19 with both fines for failing to digitize and funding for modernization. (Germany’s Hospital Future Act, for example, dedicates €4.3B to this.)&nbsp; 



 Demand for AI exploded, putting a spotlight on the difficulties of accessing data and integrating with legacy hospital systems—which are exactly the challenges that Avelios was designed to solve. 
 



<p>Avelios, in other words, is the right team, with the right product, at the right time. As a result, they have already won several of Germany’s largest public and private hospitals.</p>



<p>When we met the team, we were deeply impressed by their ambition, the depth and breadth of the product, the customers they’d won and their revenue growth—and more importantly, that they achieved all of this with just pre-seed funding (!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately for us, Christian, Nicolas, and Sebastian agreed to a partnership, and we are proud to lead this Series A round as they and their <a href="https://avelios-medical.jobs.personio.com/?language=de">fast-growing</a> team work toward their goal of revolutionizing healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an Avelios-powered future, doctors and staff will have the system of record and AI tools they need to make better, more informed decisions. They’ll be able to focus on the reason they got into medicine in the first place—helping people. And their patients will get not only a seamless experience but the best possible care.</p>

<p>This is the 32nd post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Pavel Beloborodov (Senior Software Engineer), and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (Lead for Privacy Engineering).</p>
<p>Starting with desktop version 1.75, advanced Brave users will be able to write and inject their own scriptlets into a page, allowing for better control over their browsing experience.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Customize a website’s appearance with custom scriptlets</p>
<p>Brave already offers the cleanest and safest out-of-the-box browsing experience of any Web browser. Users get best-in-class 3rd-party ad and tracker blocking, privacy protections, cookie notice blocking, and many other enhancements (read more on our <a>privacy updates</a> blog series). Most importantly, these features are enabled by default, so users get the best possible experience the moment they install Brave. There’s no need to manually install Web extensions (and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-removes-500-malicious-chrome-extensions-from-the-web-store/">take on the risk of malware</a>) or worry about <a>Google’s Manifest V3 changes</a>. With Brave, things just work.</p>
<p>However, some users want the freedom to customize how ads and trackers are blocked in their browser. In addition to offering the ability to write custom filters and <a>subscribe to community-maintained ones</a>, we now support custom scriptlets that enable advanced users to write JavaScript and inject it into any website.</p>

 With great power comes great responsibility 
<p>Adblockers like Brave Shields, <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Resources-Library">uBlock Origin</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/Scriptlets">Adguard</a> already use scriptlets internally for extended blocking capabilities. For instance, they can load a harmless version of a tracking script instead of the real one, maximizing privacy while minimizing breakage. Custom scriptlets bring this same power to Brave users. However, this power requires extreme caution. Only scripts that are confirmed safe should be injected, and for this reason the feature is “gated” behind a Developer mode flag in Shields &gt; Content filtering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Custom scriptlets are stored locally in your browser, and never leave the device.</p>

 How to use custom scriptlets 
 
 On desktop, open the Settings menu. 
 Navigate to the Shields section, then to Content filtering. (Or you can go directly to brave://settings/shields/filters.) 
 Scroll down and enable Developer mode. 
 



    


    



      
      
    
 
 Under Custom scriptlets, click Add new scriptlet and write your JavaScript. Give it a name (note that the custom scriptlet always gets saved with a user- prefix). Then click Save.&nbsp; 
 



    


    



      
      
    
 
 Finally, insert the rule by adding a custom rule for the website you want to modify, and press Save changes. Note that you must use filter rule syntax, which looks something like “example.com##+js(name-of-your-scriptlet.js)”. For more information, <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#scriptlet-injection">see the custom scriptlet technical documentation</a>. 
 



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Once the scriptlet is done, you can visit the website you just modified to see the difference:</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Before: stackoverflow.com without the custom scriptlet</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>After: cleaned up stackoverflow.com with the custom scriptlet which removed the sidebars</p>

 Editing or deleting a custom scriptlet 
<p>You can easily edit or delete your custom scriptlet using the buttons on the right.</p>



    


    



      
      
    

 Another way Brave makes the Web user-first 
<p>By default, Brave prevents fingerprinting while ensuring functionality on websites by <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protections">randomizing the output</a> of many Web APIs. But with custom scriptlets, you could completely disable a Web API on a website you don’t trust. You could also inject a scriptlet to prevent websites from disabling right-click. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Brave prioritizes the user first, in line with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">W3C’s priority of constituencies</a>. Our bet on best-in-class 3rd-party ad and tracker blocking reflects this user-first approach. We initially built custom scriptlets to help us with our own adblock-related debugging, but decided to release it as a feature because it proved so useful. Please give it a try, and tell us what you think on <a href="https://community.brave.com">community.brave.com</a>, <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://x.com/brave">social media</a>.</p>

<p>Cloud computing hasn’t seen a fundamental upgrade since Amazon launched EC2 in 2006. Software development is fundamentally changing in the wake of breakthrough LLMs and generative AI. As software development is democratized, deployment and management must follow. We’re excited to be backing (together with <a href="https://www.usv.com/">USV</a>) veteran open source infrastructure developer <a href="https://evanphx.dev/">Evan Phoenix</a> on his journey to change this with&nbsp;<a href="http://miren.dev">Miren</a>.</p><p>Miren is building a modern cloud operating system, purpose-built for this new environment. Miren’s software will allow for hybrid deployments across home/office computers, data centers and existing clouds, creating an integrated, modular ecosystem which gives customers flexibility and reduces lock-in to vendors. This not only increases flexibility and reduces cost but gives customers the ability to easily integrate compute over private &amp; sensitive data without compromising ease of management.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>AI changes deployment needs from two directions: 1) to train/fine-tune models, companies need to run compute workloads on sensitive private local data and 2) with generative AI, development is democratized but deployment is not. Miren meets both these needs with a flexible system that is both designed for scale and is opinionated enough to provide extremely simple deployment &amp; management of code. With genAI apps and individual developers as an initial GTM, Miren can gain adoption from the bottom up and work its way into startups and then large enterprises with promise of easy compliance, lower costs, and maximum flexibility.</p><p>—</p><p>Disclaimer: The information contained in this article has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any entity managed by BlueYard Capital (“BlueYard”).

<p>This week, a16z cofounder Ben Horowitz had a rare and invaluable conversation with Dr. Clarence B. Jones, a pivotal figure in American history.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Jones, who served as speechwriter, attorney, and advisor to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., shared his personal insights on race, inclusion, and the lasting legacy of the civil rights movement in 2025.</p><p>In their wide-ranging discussion, Dr. Jones reflected on the timeless wisdom of Dr. King, quoting one of the most enduring lines from the "I Have a Dream" speech: “I want my four children to be judged by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.”</p><p>“That, to me, is still, that’s the template,” Dr. Jones said. “That still remains a template.”</p><p>Their conversation covered critical themes in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, delving into the history of the movement, the lessons from "Letter from Birmingham Jail," and the profound impact Dr. King’s work continues to have today.</p><p>It was a rare opportunity to hear directly from someone who not only witnessed history but played a key role in shaping it, and we hope you enjoy it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>About Dr. Clarence B. Jones:</p><p>Dr. Clarence B. Jones served as legal counsel, strategic advisor, and draft speechwriter to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. from 1960 until Dr. King’s assassination in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. During that time, Dr. King depended on Dr. Jones for legal and strategic counsel and assistance in drafting landmark speeches and public testimony. He is credited with writing the first seven paragraphs of the iconic I Have A Dream speech.&nbsp;</p><p>Across the decades following Dr. King’s assassination in 1968, Clarence B. Jones worked to carry on Dr. King’s legacy, to continue the nonviolent struggle for social justice, voting rights, and democratic inclusion. He is the founder of the Dr. Clarence B. Jones Institute for Social Advocacy, and also serves as the Founding Director Emeritus of the Institute for Nonviolence and Social Justice at the University of San Francisco. Dr. Jones is also the author of three acclaimed books "What Would Martin Say?", "Behind the Dream: The Making of the Speech that Transformed a Nation" and "Last of the Lions".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Ben on X:&nbsp; <a href="http://twitter.com/bhorowitz">http://twitter.com/bhorowitz</a></p><p>Find a16z on X: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

<p>While AMMs (automated market makers) represent a DeFi innovation in themselves, research and experimentation have pushed the possibilities well beyond the limitations of the classic x*y=k constant product formula originally used by LPs. One of the main innovators in this field remains Balancer - from multi-token pools with different weights replicating TradFi indices, to dynamic ratios that can be changed under certain conditions preventing further imbalances, Balancer set in place user protection measures. With the recent release of Balancer V3, developers get more freedom to experiment with AMMs, introducing features such as hooks that enable limitless pool customisation, boosted pools that combine LP fees with yield farming from money markets, and many more.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Balancer’s inception  The evolution of AMMs  Balancer vs. other AMM competitors  Fungible vs. non-fungible liquidity  Balancer v3  Boosted liquidity pools  DevEx and hooks in Balancer v3  Preventing stablecoin depegs  MEV mitigation &amp; CoW AMM  Scaling to L2s  Gyroscope &amp; QuantAMM  Balancer’s B2C &amp; B2B solutions  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/fcmartinelli">Fernando Martinelli on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/Balancer">Balancer on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.
