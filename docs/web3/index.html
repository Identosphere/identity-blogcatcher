 1. Top of mind: On staking; plus, a pulse check on crypto policy &amp; regulation  On staking <p>This past week, the SEC announced <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-25.pdf">charges</a> against cryptocurrency exchange Kraken for “failing to register” the offer and sale of their crypto asset staking-as-a-service program. Kraken ceased its staking services shortly after, also agreeing to pay $30 million in penalties. But the question for many was: Would this affect staking overall in the U.S.?&nbsp;</p><p>Why does staking matter? In modern blockchains, "staking" serves a similar function to "mining" in other blockchains — that is, both are mechanisms that allow a participant to earn the right to provide computational capacity. But staking is far more energy efficient. </p><p>How it works: On a proof-of-stake blockchain, anyone can “stake” or lock up their tokens to earn the right to contribute computational resources and security to the network (in exchange for rewards in the form of more tokens). The blockchain's consensus mechanism randomly selects stakers in proportion to how many tokens they have staked. </p><p>Since staked tokens act as an incentive for stakers to act in good faith and follow protocol rules, staking also helps with decentralization because participants are essentially pledging their tokens as an assurance of good behavior — without relying on a centralizing or less secure off-chain system. And while staking means that anyone can participate in a protocol (as long as they have a powerful enough computer, tokens to stake, and a connection to the internet), staking-as-a-service programs can make it even easier for more people to participate.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on proof-of-stake blockchain designs, security, technical considerations, community, process:</p>  <p>▶️ watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ-Ya7NRDxM]">A survey of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain designs</a> by Valeria Nikolaenko&nbsp;</p>  <p>🎧 listen: <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/proof-of-stake-blockchain-design-consensus-sybil-long-range-attacks-more">PoS blockchains - designs, consensus, attacks</a> with Valeria Nikolaenko, Tim Roughgarden, and Sonal Chokshi</p>  <p>🎧 listen: <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/ethereum-the-merge-pos-security-decentralization-process-community-people">Ethereum, Merge and beyond</a> with Tim Beiko, Ali Yahya, Tim Roughgarden, and Sonal Chokshi</p>  <p>📄 read: <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/what-the-merge-means/">What ‘The Merge’ means</a> by Ali Yahya</p>  <p>For a16z crypto legal, policy, and regulatory teams’ position on recent events, see 🧵:</p> <a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1623850926338629632">  miles jennings | milesjennings.eth @milesjennings   In response to today’s Kraken / SEC settlement - we had a few thoughts 🧵👇 </a><a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1623850926338629632"> 1:06 AM ∙ Feb 10, 2023  433Likes85Retweets  </a>  Crypto policy &amp; regulation: What’s going on? <p>Collin McCune, Miles Jennings, Brian Quintenz, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p>In the latest episode of the <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/">web3 with a16z podcast</a>, we provide an overview of policy and regulation in the crypto industry — from a lay of the land to pulse-checks on sentiment.

For the sake of convenience, many use centralized RPC (remote procedure call) servers; but users need to trust the providers, and there’s no way to verify the correctness of queries. So Helios converts data from an untrusted centralized RPC provider into a verifiably safe, local RPC without running a full node.

<p>This is the second post in a series on Brave’s commitment to ‘Privacy by Design’, standing beside the work covered in <a>Published proxy configs</a>.</p>

 The challenge 
<p><a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/data-minimisation/">The principle of data minimization</a> dictates that only necessary data should be collected for a given business purpose. Data minimization is a cornerstone of online privacy: You can’t abuse, sell, or lose what you never collected in the first place. Sometimes, however, it is necessary to process sensitive data, and cryptographic building blocks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation">multi-party computation</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> may not be an option.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a simple (and admittedly silly) example: imagine that Brave wants to wish you a happy birthday once a year. Most companies build such services by recording every user’s birthday in a database. They then check the database daily and send birthday wishes to everybody whose birthday it is. But birthdays are sensitive. There’s often no good reason for a company (or advertisers) to learn your birthday, especially given the risk of data leaks.</p>




    



<p>How might Brave build a service like this without learning your birthday? Or more broadly: How might we build any service that processes private data, without actually seeing the data? To answer this question, we first need to introduce a technology called secure enclaves.</p>

 Secure enclaves 
<p>Secure enclaves allow your computer to process information in a way that’s isolated from other programs and data. An operating system is the trusted foundation of a computer, providing an environment where applications like Brave can run. If it has a security hole, all data on the computer is in danger. A secure enclave can mitigate this problem. Think of it like an isolated, tiny computer inside a computer. If the main computer is compromised, the secure enclave is unaffected, and can still be trusted. Many CPU manufacturers offer such secure enclaves, both on server and consumer CPUs. For example, Intel has Trust Domain Extensions and SGX; ARM has TrustZone; and AMD has SEV. Many companies have taken advantage of enclaves in creative ways: Signal uses this technology for <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">private contact discovery</a>; Apple for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108">Face ID</a>; and others use it for copyright protection and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>And Brave can use it for private birthday wishes.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, we built upon a new type of secure enclave that was introduced by Amazon in 2020, called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/">AWS Nitro Enclaves</a>. We chose Nitro Enclaves over alternatives because they are virtual machines (VMs) that do not share resources with other VMs. This eliminates a class of bugs that has <a href="https://sgx.fail">plagued SGX for years</a>: the infamous side channel attack. Specifically, we built a free software tool kit called <a href="https://github.com/brave/nitriding">nitriding</a> which makes it possible to run networked applications inside a Nitro Enclave—often with no modifications. Nitriding allows us to run our private birthday service inside an enclave. That said, we need to consider three attacks:</p>
 
 What if Brave wants to exfiltrate birthdays? 
 What if Brave claims to run one version of the code but secretly runs another? 
 What if Brave wants to intercept the birthdays on their way to the enclave? 
 

 Attack 1: Data exfiltration 
<p>What stops Brave from logging in to the secure enclave and obtaining all birthdays from memory? This attack is prevented by the very design of Nitro Enclaves. While Brave wrote the code that’s run inside the enclave, neither we nor Amazon (nor anyone else) can observe the code and its data at runtime. That means we can’t see the data that goes in or the computation happening inside. We cannot log in to a Nitro Enclave—it’s essentially a sealed black box. This ensures that once a birthday is in the enclave, it is protected.</p>




    




 Attack 2: Secretly running malicious code 
<p>The benign code and malicious code below are nearly identical, but the malicious code contains a function (highlighted in red) that exposes the birthday. What’s to stop Brave from claiming to run the benign pseudo code, while instead running the malicious code?</p>
 
     
func send_wishes() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for b in birthdays {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if b == today {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send_wishes(b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep(24h);
}
<br>
func receive_birthdays() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while true {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birthday = receive_birthday();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save_in_database(birthday);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
     
     a) Benign Code 
     
func send_wishes() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for b in birthdays {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if b == today {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send_wishes(b)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep(24h);
}
<br>
func receive_birthdays() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while true {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birthday = receive_birthday();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save_in_database(birthday);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leak_to_attacker(birthday);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
     
     b) Malicious Code 
 
<p>This attack is prevented by another feature of Nitro Enclaves called remote attestation. Users can verify over the Internet that the code we claim to run is the code that’s actually running. If we secretly ran different code, our users would notice due to the cryptographic attestation process of the Nitro system. Remote attestation allows users to verify that the code Brave claims to run is actually running.</p>
<p>Note: Another blog post in this series will discuss how remote attestation works in practice.</p>

 Attack 3: Interception of data in transit 
<p>While we may not be able to exfiltrate birthdays from the enclave memory, or secretly run malicious code, what’s to stop Brave from intercepting birthdays as they are submitted to the enclave?</p>
<p>This attack is also prevented by our nitriding tool kit. Nitriding exposes a Web service that runs inside the enclave and cryptographically binds the Web service’s HTTPS certificate to the attestation document that’s issued by the Nitro system itself. This allows our users to verify that they are talking directly to the enclave, with no parties in the middle. In other words: Brave (or any other third party) can obtain a valid HTTPS certificate for the enclave, but cannot reference this malicious certificate in the attestation document, which acts as the root of trust. Users have a cryptographic guarantee, enforced by their client, that they are talking to the enclave and nothing else.</p>

 The downsides 
<p>Let’s sum up: If Alice wants to receive birthday wishes from Brave, she first audits the source code of our birthday service to convince herself that the code is safe and secure. Next, Alice establishes a TLS connection with the enclave application and verifies that it’s running the code that Alice just audited. Finally, Alice is willing to reveal her birthday to the enclave application because she knows that it’s going to remain safe.</p>
<p>In this case, Brave has demonstrated how to build with verifiably private computation.</p>
<p>However, Nitro Enclaves are no panacea. We consider their design more secure and flexible than <a href="https://sgx.fail">Intel’s SGX</a>, but Nitro Enclaves are new. The technology has yet to stand the test of time and face the scrutiny of security researchers. Another shortcoming is the proprietary nature of Nitro Enclaves: While AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system.html">published the architecture</a>, the hardware design itself (and some of the software) remains proprietary, which requires a level of trust in Amazon. This is no different from many other enclave designs, but still problematic because closed-source hardware and software cannot easily be verified by third parties.</p>
<p>With these limitations in mind, we have decided to experiment with enclave applications cautiously, without placing too many eggs in one basket. The next blog post in this series will present one such application: a service that plays a key role in the work-in-progress revamp of our <a>privacy-preserving product analytics (P3A) system</a>.</p>

<p>Feature image from Jordan Peterson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngMvaZPI550">video clip</a> “There are some games you don’t get to play unless you’re all in,” 2017.</p>
<p>This is just a short post to provide some context around a clip I recently posted to my Youtube channel of an interview Jordan Peterson did a number of years ago. The clip is just the beginning of the interview where Peterson provides his credentials, including working with former Blackberry (Research In Motion, RIM) co-CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Balsillie">John Balsillie</a> on a 2013 United Nations document “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resilient-People-Resilient-Planet-UN-2013-Jordan-Peterson-Involvement.pdf">Resilient People, Resilient Planet</a>.” In the clip Peterson said he removed the “ideological claptrap.” This information is also included on Jordan Peterson’s website.</p>

<p>Stephen Harper appointed Jim Balsillie head of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Technology_Canada">Sustainable Development Technology Canada</a> in 2013. Balsillie had served as the sole Canadian and <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/cigi-chair-jim-balsillie-appointed-un-high-level-panel-global-sustainability/">representative</a> of the private sector on the United Nations Secretary General’s High-Level Panel on Global Sustainability in 2010. In 2001, Balsillie funded the creation of a non-profit Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), whose <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/cigi-chair-jim-balsillie-appointed-un-high-level-panel-global-sustainability/">goals are aligned with</a> the UN Sustainable Development Goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2011 CIGI entered into a partnership with INET (Institute for New Economic Thinking), a project of George Soros to transform global economic relations – what we now see as the cybernetic circular (or doughnut) economics. INET has a huge number of affiliates, including James Heckman who created the equation for human capital finance speculation. Eric Weinstein, a mathematician and economist who worked for Thiel Capital, is also a member.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote an <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/13/the-chicago-school-of-economics-and-george-soros-new-theories-for-an-impoverished-world/">extensive piece on INET</a> back in the summer of 2018. It discusses plans to leverage creative finance to profit from the poverty of the billions on the bottom of the economic pyramid. I remember really scratching my head when I found out Open Society was funding economic research at Milton Friedman’s University of Chicago. At that point I didn’t understand that the power structure is evenly distributed across political ideology. The cybernetic agenda is neither one side nor the other.</p>

<p>Balsillie’s partner at RIM was Mike Lazaridis, now with Quantum Valley Ventures, whose philanthropic efforts included establishing the <a href="https://perimeterinstitute.ca/history">Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics</a>&nbsp;to the tune of $100 million in 1999 and a <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/quantum-computers-valley-mike-lazaridis/article36385613/">quantum computing center</a> at the University of Waterloo. Looking back now on the attention given to Blackberry in media, how all the important politicos were wedded to their devices, and knowing that Canada as a digital nation is be positioned as the vanguard of social impact sustainable tech, it seems pretty clear that the company’s product was about normalizing and uplifting what would become the surveillance tracking infrastructure of the future. I’ve included a map I made in 2019 linking UN SDG 4, education, to fintech impact data collection.</p>

<p>Canada’s involvement with sustainability goes back to the 1970s led by oilman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Strong">Maurice Strong</a>, who made a fortune in Alberta and later in hydro-power management. Strong then founded a multi-faith contemplative community with his wife Hanna in <a href="https://www.manitou.org/foundation/directors/">Crestone, Colorado</a> in 1988. The area has long been considered sacred land by the original peoples and sits atop a vital aquifer. Strong headed the Canadian International Development agency in the early 1970s, working for <a href="https://www.mauricestrong.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=120:strong-short-biography&amp;catid=2&amp;Itemid=70">Trudeau</a> senior, when he was tapped by UN Secretary General U Thant to spearhead a conference on humans and the environment. That was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_I">Habitat-1</a> held in Vancouver in 1976. Strong’s involvement in the development aid space was <a href="https://www.thestar.com/opinion/contributors/2022/06/02/maurice-strong-helped-rally-the-world-on-environmentalism-in-1972-fifty-years-later-were-still-trying-to-act.html">initiated by Prime Minster Lester Pearson</a>. Pearson’s name was given to a commission he chaired in 1968 that prepared the global development aid / finance regime for the techno-social entrepreneurship that would blossom in the twenty-first century.

<p>Strong’s close collaborator was Barbara Ward Jackson, a British born networker who built up the field of sustainability within the context of global humanitarian aid. This brings us to where we are today with data-driven impact finance structuring natural life on earth in the name of social justice and conscious capitalism. A hat tip to <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2022/08/16/building-the-impact-finance-regime-nigerias-civil-war-and-the-road-to-cyber-colonialism-part-i/">Raul Diego for bringing Barbara Ward Jackson to my attention</a>. She, Strong, and those who followed down the path they cleared in the 1970s, like Balsillie and Peterson, should have our attention as the world pivots towards cybernetic governance.</p>
<p>Below are two maps showing Barbara Ward Jackson’s diplomatic ties around sustainability, global aid, and the financial sector.</p>

<p>Peterson recently announced on Joe Rogan’s show his creation of a new global organization to develop alternative futures, in London of all places. I’m going to suggest that we consider this development within the context of complexity theory and “Game B” developed by Jim Rutt in partnership with members of the Intellectual Dark Web, including Bret Weinstein, an evolutionary biologist whose firing from Evergreen State College led his brother Eric to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_dark_web">coin the term</a> the “Intellectual Dark Web.” “GameB” revolves around creating a global economy of abundance through voluntarism and cooperative economics. It is imagined as a <a href="https://medium.com/@memetic007/a-journey-to-gameb-4fb13772bcf3">civilizational level social operating system.</a> Based on the individuals involved it seems like this model will likely feature biohacking, performance optimization, meta–psychotechnology, extasis; oh, and maybe some ethical cults.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What is not obvious to most people is that such a system will be built on distributed ledger technology and governed through token engineering; a practice that will extend not only to financial transacting, but also to “democratic” voting systems on blockchain. All of this will be framed as radical participation and populist, but it is ultimately governed by systems of technocracy. The anti-woke crowd of traditional values can replace ESG governance with encoded “moral economies,” which will be fine by the artificial intelligence infrastructure. It likes all flavors of human life. Resistance is acceptable, welcome even, as long as the various sectors can be tagged and monitored and used for machine learning. </p>
<p>See my “GameB” map below. It’s still a work in progress.</p>

<p>I didn’t post that clip to make Jordan Peterson wrong. I posted it to provide context that might open up the possibility of exploring a broader narrative than the polarizing ones we are continuously being offered. Many of the critiques I’ve seen online are rabidly anti-leftist, framing Soros as a tool of Marxists looking to take over their country. Well, as best I can tell, executives of high-tech computing companies producing the instruments that will be required to track, trace, and optimize us towards some evolutionary next step don’t fall into that category. Machine learning systems operate through pattern recognition; but the real world is so complex, it needs to start collapsing human variety into more manageable chunks. That is why we are all expected to inhabit an easily discernible category. And once we inhabit them, we are supposed to see those inhabiting the other boxes as our enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is an <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/10/gods-eye-view-part-3-civic-tech-the-wisdom-of-crowds-and-off-shore-sandboxes/">excerpt</a> from my latest installment of my series “God’s Eye View.”</p>
<p>“The next statement is key – the importance of the non-equilibrium state to generate the energy needed to run the system. Social media, all media, serves this function. It serves to create polarity, trigger words, tribalism, heightening emotion to keep us all in a state where we feed our life force into these circuits. I’m not here to point fingers. After all, I’m writing this on a blog, aren’t I? But I hope you’ll notice I am working on the way I hold this information and the way I share it, so that I do not unnecessarily feed into the disequilibrium state.</p>
<p>Fear Porn = Disequilibrium</p>
<p>I am convinced of the overall goodness of the human heart. People are generally well-intentioned, but they live inside stories. Those stories shape what they think the world is, and how it works. Those stories are highly-managed. Top-down control of reality increased exponentially as we slid down the slippery slope of bits and bytes, ones and zeros. The things I am talking about here – the ant computer – no one is supposed to know. If we knew, I believe most would stand against it. The most powerful neutralizer for this program is to take away their energy. Stop allowing weaponized narratives and labels (both sides) to feed the vitriol you are supposed to feel about your fellow humans. We are their energy source, our hearts.</p>
<p>‘Energetic issues are critical to embodied computational systems,&nbsp;which must be maintained in a non-equilibrium state either for a definite duration or indefinitely. Therefore the formalism needs to be able to&nbsp;describe and define the flow of matter and energy through the system. Active elements have to be powered in some way, either continuously during operation or by&nbsp;being arranged initially in a non-equilibrium state.We anticipate that embodied computational systems will be fueled in a variety of ways and powered by a variety of energy sources (electrical, chemical, optical, thermal, mechanical, etc.). Therefore the formalism needs to be able to define the dynamical and spatial relations among energy sources and other elements.”&nbsp;<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source'”</a></p>
<p>This system is driving us forward through the strategic use of disequilibrium. I’m taking time to post this, because the identity politics (both sides, woke / anti-woke) and the polarity that results from that tension is central to understanding how complex systems are being coded for some sort of post-human eugenic emergence.&nbsp;So how is that working out for us? Is it getting us any closer to understanding the true nature of the machine? I would say it hasn’t. Instead, it leaves us emotionally ragged, depleted, and constantly scouting the horizon for the next threat. We are not using our intelligence, which John Trudell said is our most important tool in dispelling tech-no-logic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what I’m writing about in my latest series, which examines betting culture, prediction, intuition, bio-computation, and bottom-up architecting. We are caught in a vortex. We don’t understand the water we’re swimming in. If you haven’t read my series, I’d love it if you could spend some time with it, and share your thoughts and feedback. I’m particularly excited to talk with people about <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/02/10/gods-eye-view-part-3-civic-tech-the-wisdom-of-crowds-and-off-shore-sandboxes/">Part 3 – Civic Tech, The Wisdom of Crowds, and Offshore Sandboxes</a>.</p>
<p>Someone left a snarky comment on my posting of the clip implying that I have skeletons in my closet, alluding to my activism on the left. I hide nothing. I still hold the same values, but I was finally able to see the box that was created for me to inhabit. I’ve outgrown that box. Maybe you can outgrow yours, too, and then people can stop putting targets on one other’s backs. Instead we can ponder over the fact that for many, many decades, centuries even, some unseen force has gradually brought us to this place where we teeter on the edge of natural oblivion. </p>
<p>Stop letting them use your identity to steer you. If we can put the hammers down and step out and look, just look, we might be able to see a way through that doesn’t involve tokens or robots or sensors or algorithms. How about it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote this post about the United Nations Sustainable Development goals and social impact finance and big data the week before the pandemic was announced. It’s sort of a time capsule of where I was then. I’ve grown a lot over the past three years. My core values remain the same, but I see the tactics and narrative tropes that have been used to manage us into not looking at the bigger picture.

Augur on Ethereum was a first attempt in 2015 followed by<a href="https://polymarket.com/markets"> Polymarket</a> and Gnosis. None were successful due to issues with the user interface and liquidity. Azuro hopes to overcome those problems after bringing in Web2 sports betting consultants and devising open-source code for a new type of liquidity tree. The company has partnered with<a href="https://azuroprotocol.medium.com/azuro-partnerships-blockchain-oracle-network-chainlink-d29b4cc5a7e7"> Chainlink</a> and plans to use its oracles to feed data to the smart contracts and validate payouts on wagers.</p>
<a href="https://azuro.org/"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://azuro.org/">https://azuro.org/</a>
<p>The following excerpt was taken from the “<a href="https://azuro.org/about">about</a>” page of the firm’s website.</p>
<p>“A bet is one of the first forms of contract used by people thousands of years ago. Today, however, online betting is plagued by a lack of transparency and fairness, because it’s a system built on negative incentives pitting bookmakers and players against each other… Azuro utilizes smart contracts to build a decentralized betting protocol deploying an innovative solution for liquidity provision and allocation. Betting becomes transparent and trustless, while depth of betting events, markets, and UX remains as good as it gets. Furthermore, Azuro democratizes the business of betting by breaking down the role of the traditional bookmaker into several smaller roles, openly available for anyone to benefit from: liquidity provision, front end management, data provision, oracles, decentralized governance. As a result, we envision a rich, fun betting environment with decreased cost of service to players, full transparency, community-run with a commitment to responsibility.”</p>
<p>While Azuro’s primary audience is sports betting and Web3 GameFi, you see how the wording practically tees up a use case for decentralized “democracy” in a tokenized cyber “commons.” As the world is conditioned for acceptance of “life” in extended reality where daily experience is situated within vague jurisdictions of “the cloud,” the effectiveness of the traditional nation-state notion of participatory governance is bound to be diminished. What I believe we are seeing bubble to the surface through the efforts of entities like Gitcoin, Commons Stack, Token Engineering Commons, and Glen Weyl’s RadicalXchange are alternative models evoking the potential of tokenized voting systems. I think these systems are meant to steer the natural world towards convergence with the machine and transform us into Oliver Reiser’s networked “World Sensor.”</p>

<p>The following is drawn from a July 2021 post by Accelerated Capital, “<a href="https://acceleratedcapital.substack.com/p/daos-and-democracy-voting-mechanisms">DAOs and Democracy: Voting Mechanisms in Web3</a>.” It’s a promo paragraph from their sponsor<a href="https://help.tally.xyz/article/21-getting-started-with-tally"> Tally</a>, an app that manages the lifecycle of proposals for DAOs:</p>
<p>“Tally empowers voters to successfully participate in on-chain governance via a sophisticated dashboard. Users are able to see current and past proposals, cast votes, delegate power, and analyze governance trends across multiple DAOs. Tally currently supports some of the largest DAOs in the space including Uniswap, PoolTogether, Gitcoin, Compound, Radicle, and more.

<p>Level up your Web3 citizenship in the coming “game” of life. With this information in mind, reconsider trending narratives about<a href="https://nextcity.org/features/why-we-should-lower-the-voting-age-to-16?gclid=Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr75l762JIt02641VaH8QbIdN61WpWYSYIZW0LKsdjg2HoSn5T6YtQAaAmo8EALw_wcB"> lowering the voting age</a>,<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/28/1128695831/united-states-2022-patterns-mail-early-voting"> early voting</a>,<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/11/20/the-voting-experience-in-2020/"> sharp declines in in-person voting on voting day</a>,<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1210722109"> voting fraud</a>,<a href="https://www.voteriders.org/voter-id-laws-2022/"> voter ID</a>,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-technology-colorado-donald-trump-voting-95b862c0cb66aac446a213aace504776"> compromised voting infrastructure</a>, and even the rise of<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-polls-vote.html"> social media polls</a> on the most inane topics. I view them as all being related. Votes are signals in the market of ideas, signals about what people believe to be true. </p>
<p>From Blockscience’s Michael Zargham:</p>
<p>“The reason the Commons Stack exists, and the reason the focus has been more on norm formation, understanding boundaries of communities in terms of culture, and teaching principles carried forward from Ostrom’s work is exactly this observation. Governance mechanisms don’t do anything directly, they merely convert the signals expressed by their participants into a collective decision. Acknowledging that value is inter-subjective, it is incredibly important to reflect on what values you express through your participation in governance processes – and the extent to which your community shares those values determines the direction your governance process steers your system.”<a href="https://michaelzargham.medium.com/a-brief-history-of-conviction-voting-ad4ca4eb4aee"> Source</a></p>

<p>E-government linked to biometric digital identity, our signifier as agents in the simulation, will generate more robust signals than past methods of civic participation. I sense the civil society sector across the ideological spectrum will be pulled in as a key partner to support a transition to cybernetic governance. I first started to come across the term “<a href="https://civictech.guide/a-timeline-of-civic-tech-tells-a-data-driven-story-of-the-field/">civic tech</a>” when I was <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2020/01/13/operation-relentless-pursuit-test-beds-for-smart-city-signals-intelligence/">writing about</a> “what works” data-driven government. Central to that effort were policies to “open up” municipal data. Why we had to do that it wasn’t clear to me then. Certainly, regular people weren’t in a position to use it, so it seemed at first glance to be a resource grab favoring for-profit interests. They could leverage the “free” data sets to create products like predictive policing software that could, in turn, be sold back to duped government officials to impose further control over citizens. </p>
<p>Now I see it much more clearly. Open data and integrated sensor networks combined with digital identity wi turn smart environments into massive social computing systems. We’re in the game. We’re definitely in the game. With this new pair of glasses, I can see what the Knight Foundation has been up to with their civic gaming projects and civic tech investments. Civic games and augmented reality and embodied natural computing and learning ecosystems are about breaking down larger problems into smaller interactive tasks intended to “tap into the wisdom of crowds.” Cyber-physical and socio-technical architectures and the normalization of on-demand task rabbit work will permit almost real-time mobilization of agents to accomplish computation for larger projects, the true nature of which participants are likely not even aware. An example of this is the gig-work platform <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/american-gig-work-platform-was-accused-working-russia-rcna18258">Premise</a> started in 2013 which was implicated in crowd-sourced intelligence in Russia’s conflict with Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following passages are drawn from a 2010 paper by Dr. Bruce MacLennan, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Artificial-Morphogenesis-as-an-Example-of-Embodied-Computation.pdf">Artificial Morphogenesis and an Example of Embodied Computation,”</a>&nbsp; and a 2015 paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Morphogenetic-Path-To-Programmable-Matter.pdf">The Morphogenetic Path to Programmable Matter</a>.” MacLennan is a professor emeritus of electrical engineering and computer science who consults regularly with Oak Ridge National Labs. Neurotechnology, nanotechnology, reconfigurable robotics, and complex systems design were his <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=A14DflkAAAAJ">primary areas of research</a>. Two slide decks, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Self-Organization-for-Nano-Computation-and-Nano-Assembly-Bruce-MacLennan.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Configuration-and-Reconfiguration-of-Complex-Systems-by-Artificial-Morphogenesis-Bruce-MacLennan.pdf">here</a>, provide insights into the nature of his investigations. MacLennan’s biographical page at the University of Tennessee states:</p>
<p>“In the mid-’80s, MacLennan redirected his research toward natural computation, that is, computation inspired by or occurring in nature…Since the mid-’90s this research program has expanded to include self-organizing systems with very large numbers of physical components (e.g., the cells in a developing embryo) and the interaction of physical and computational processes. The latter includes the use of computational principles in nanotechnology (algorithmic self-assembly) and the exploitation of novel physical processes for computation (post-Moore’s Law computing technologies).”</p>
<p>Remember, this research is already ten to fifteen years old. As you read the quotes, picture a future where natural life interacts with machine “intelligences” to “collaborate” on computing programs we cannot comprehend. I can’t say exactly what this will look like. I think they will make it seem inviting, playful.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, where I live, the Knight Foundation introduced augmented reality through art and <a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/monument-lab-overtime-app-philly-virtual-tour-statues/">place-based storytelling</a>. These small grant programs seem harmless.&nbsp; It’s hard for us to imagine what “natural computation” post-Moore’s Law might look like. This presentation from Allison Duettmann, CEO of the Foresight Institute established by Eric Drexler in Richardson, Texas, offers some insights. Note how the elements of a physical computing interface, a building, will coordinate with embodied role-playing games in mixed reality governed by blockchain smart contracts in digital communities or “network states.” The presentation below was part of Protocol Labs’ “<a href="https://protocol.ai/blog/breakthroughs-in-computing-labweek22/">Breakthrough in Computing Speakers Series</a>” held last November.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that you’ve watched that, watch this clip about the sensor networks and artificial vision used in the classrooms of Wildflower Montessori schools. Apply what you’ve heard about in the Duetterman clip to how learning environments for children are being planned. Consider the renewed emphasis on “play” and tracking “social emotional skills.” I wrote about my reservations regarding Jeff Bezos’s plans to subsidize Montessori, pre-k. You can read it <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/09/15/montessori-inc-pre-k-predictive-profiling-for-power-and-profit/">here</a>. The post got quite a bit of traction at the time. I hadn’t a clue that five years later I’d realize all of this tech was about embodied computation. Now, some may argue that live role play collaboration to solve big problems is a great idea. But that must happen with consent among consenting adults. It is unethical to channel the joyous creativity of children and harness it to drive some network state machine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am going to interleave quotes from MacLennan’s two articles between images that might help you understand this new kind of social computing. I’ve also pulled in some screen shots from <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Complex-Systems-Bio-Inspiration-and-Morphogenetic-Engineering.pdf">a slide share</a> created by <a href="http://doursat.free.fr/research_morpheng_full.html">Rene Doursat</a>, a researcher in complex systems and bio-inspired design with a focus on swarm intelligence and autonomous, decentralized robotics. Doursat is a pioneer in <a href="https://golden.com/wiki/Morphogenetic_Engineering-BWWWA3M">morphogenetic engineering</a>.</p>
<p>In the twenty-first century, social engineering isn’t simply about domination or control, it’s about organizing natural life to “conduct” cooperative tasks for some larger purpose. What that is, I honestly don’t know at this point. Many of the quotes center operations at the nanoscale, but I know that their intention is to unlock a grammar of life in order to “code” it at all levels.</p>
<p>“We have outlined the requirements for a formalism — indeed a programming notation — for embodied computation oriented toward morphogenesis, and have discussed our approach to meeting these requirements. Fundamental to this is massively parallel programming built on a foundation of continuum mechanics and partial differential equations, which facilitates scaling up to very large numbers of embodied computing units.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>They want us classed as units, cogs. They are using our digital footprints to generate those classifications, though often not well. Facebook’s assessments of who their system thinks a given person actually is are often wildly off the mark; and yet, they proceed.</p>
<p>“An embodied computation system comprises a finite and fixed number of bodies (or tissues), each having properties that allow it to be classified as one substance or another. The behavioral dynamics of these bodies, in mutual interaction, defines the dynamics of the embodied computation system, but it must be prepared in some appropriate initial state.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>They are also mapping who influences you, or at least which influencers hold your attention. Not all of our potentialities are realized, as with genes certain triggers can unlock latent tendencies. They want to know what those are, so they can push your buttons, the right ones at the right time – to control relationships.</p>
<p>“First, biologists often find it convenient to express regulatory networks qualitatively, using influence models to indicate, for example, that one gene product enhances or represses the expression of another gene, or that a molecule regulates an enzyme. These qualitative regulatory relationships are an important tool for conceptualizing control processes in which the quantitative relationships are unknown or are not considered critical. Therefore, the formalism should permit the expression of qualitative control relationships.”</p>

<p>In processing these quotes, you are going to have to think beyond cellular function to include population level cybernetic steering towards optimization metrics and to cultivate unexpected emergent properties. They want us to participate as agents in their programmable matter “game,” where they assemble us and disassemble us at will. They will try very hard to convince us that this is a way of expressing our liberation and collective good-will through participatory token exchanges and living in a digital panopticon. Freedom cells…think about it.</p>
<p>“Programmable systems achieve their generality by controlling the interactions in a generic substrate in order to implement specific functions. For example, an ordinary computer program applies universal operations to a homogeneous array of bits in order to implement a specific application. In a similar way, programmable matter is based on a generic material that can be programmed to exhibit a wide variety of useful physical properties; we call this a programmable material.” <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Morphogenetic-Path-To-Programmable-Matter.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>The next statement is key – the importance of the non-equilibrium state to generate the energy needed to run the system. Social media, all media, serves this function. It serves to create polarity, trigger words, tribalism, heightening emotion to keep us all in a state where we feed our life force into these circuits. I’m not here to point fingers. After all, I’m writing this on a blog, aren’t I? But I hope you’ll notice I am working on the way I hold this information and the way I share it, so that I do not unnecessarily feed into the disequilibrium state.</p>
<p>Fear Porn = Disequilibrium</p>
<p>I am convinced of the overall goodness of the human heart. People are generally well-intentioned, but they live inside stories. Those stories shape what they think the world is, and how it works. Those stories are highly-managed. Top-down control of reality increased exponentially as we slid down the slippery slope of bits and bytes, ones and zeros. The things I am talking about here – the ant computer – no one is supposed to know. If we knew, I believe most would stand against it. The most powerful neutralizer for this program is to take away their energy. Stop allowing weaponized narratives and labels (both sides) to feed the vitriol you are supposed to feel about your fellow humans. We are their energy source, our hearts.</p>
<p>“Energetic issues are critical to embodied computational systems, which must be maintained in a non-equilibrium state either for a definite duration or indefinitely. Therefore the formalism needs to be able to describe and define the flow of matter and energy through the system. Active elements have to be powered in some way, either continuously during operation or by being arranged initially in a non-equilibrium state.We anticipate that embodied computational systems will be fueled in a variety of ways and powered by a variety of energy sources (electrical, chemical, optical, thermal, mechanical, etc.). Therefore the formalism needs to be able to define the dynamical and spatial relations among energy sources and other elements.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>“Typically, the structure of a computational system governs its function, that is, the computation it performs. Conversely, in algorithmic assembly a computational process governs the assembly of some physical structure. However, some embodied systems integrate these two processes. For example, in embryological morphogenesis, the physical structure of the embryo governs the very computational processes that create the physical structure of the embryo. Structure governs function, and function creates structure.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>“Finally, embodied computation systems can be designed for self-destruction, which is especially important for nanoscale systems. If they can reconfigure themselves, they can also deconfigure themselves, rearranging their components into inert and potentially recyclable material. As we know, apoptosis (programmed cell death) is essential both in embryological development and in the maintenance of a well-functioning body.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>“Complex, multicellular organisms can recruit, reorganize, and reshape groups of cells to form functionally specialized tissues and organs—a process collectively referred to as morphogenesis. Morphogenetic processes must be carefully choreographed in time and space in the developing organism so that the right cells are relocated and interact in the right place at the right time, and so that the reshaping of the multicellular structure into a tissue or an organ is specified for a particular function.” <a href="https://www.cshlpress.com/pdf/sample/2013/MammalianDev/MDVSec2.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>“For example, we commonly think of computation as taking place in a fixed substrate, and many self-assembly processes also assume a fixed substrate or matrix in which agents move. In morphogenesis, in contrast, the computational medium is assembled by the computational process, as a zygote develops into a hollow blastula and then into a more complex structure of tissues, which govern the information and control processes in the medium.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>“Morphogenesis proceeds through a carefully orchestrated series of overlapping parallel phases, which have the characteristics of a coordinated algorithm. In this robust process, the completion of one phase signals the initiation of the next through a combination of chemical signals and changing cell states. Temporal patterns often create spatial patterns (as in the clock- and wavefront model of segmentation), and morphogenesis may be best understood as the creation of patterns in four dimensions.” <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~bmaclenn/papers/AMEEC-proof.pdf">Source</a></p>

<p>In the above screenshot, the involvement of Omidyar Network and Knight Foundation stands out to me. As with Goldmans Sachs and social impact bonds, they do seem to be making this sector out of thin air.</p>
<p>After several years of mulling it over, I now see how problematic the “China social credit” narrative has been. As long as people hold onto that narrative – that we are under siege by a foreign power, by another culture, we will not be able to grasp the material I just shared. We aren’t going to be ruled by China, but by the Department of Energy in partnership with Big Tech and social entrepreneurs. I fell for it myself when I started researching digital surveillance. </p>
<p>What I see happening, with bolstering from the “it’s just a tool, you can use it (distributed ledger technology) for ill or for good” crowd, is that the time time is coming when strategic players will start to promote alternative digital participation protocols as radical inclusion, bringing government back to the people. And in doing so, the “signals” people emit via their civic-tech “voting” apps will enable them to be managed in the multiverse game. The image below is a “product” associated with Gitcoin, a funding organization for Web3 development that has been piloting new voting systems as part of its grant-making program. </p>

<p>Take note that this framing is not punitive, it’s encouraging. All you need to do is collect “stamps” in your “passport” to grow your online reputation. You see the gaming mechanics there? And the more your identity is “verified” in your community, “the more opportunities you will have to vote and participate across the web3.” This isn’t the government doing the rating; it’s set up so that your peers, your community members, rate you. This isn’t China. Gitcoin is based in Boulder, Colorado, the blockchain state and home to ETH Denver. We can’t let managed narratives lead us into box canyons of dead-end thinking. Digital identity is at the core of extended reality and the pressure to create and manage a digital twin through which we will engage in this brave new world will be coming from all quarters.</p>
<p>When Zargham says, “value is inter-subjective,” meaning that value is dynamic and in motion as it interacts with the values held by others in our community, it brings to mind John Horton Conway’s research. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, informed by the work of von Neumann and fellow Manhattan Project researcher Stan Ulam, Conway dove into exploring the dynamics of two-dimensional cellular grids where each cell was designed to act within a specific rule set in relation to neighboring cells. Over many cycles, a variety of two-dimensional “multi-cellular” forms were generated. These were given names like gliders and spaceships. Conway’s inspiration, Stan Ulam, developed the Monte Carlo Method and was a regular at the<a href="https://youtu.be/pq7CYo-cXqY?t=133"> Los Alamos poker game</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the beginning of lockdowns, I’ve understood that digital governance has an important role to play in what is unfolding. I thought it was about generating data to legitimize public-private social impact deals, but of course it’s much more than that. Governance IS cybernetics. We are supposed to imagine that we are “free” to participate in discussions around communal wellbeing. But is it a game? And if so, whose game is it? Who or what is monitoring the signals and updating the rules, fine tuning the algorithms in order to catalyze some preferred emergent outcome? And it seems that under conditions of liquid democracy, we may end up not even representing ourselves on the game board. If Cesar “<a href="https://www.peopledemocracy.com/">augmented democracy</a>” Hidalgo gets his way, this new-fangled radical participation could have AI assistants (digital twins) handling all the proxy votes, because they’ll know us better than we know ourselves , or at least that’s the story they’re telling.</p>

<p>So, does anyone want to wager on how long it is before “democracy” gets a makeover as a giant casino? Welcome to the big game of free-market governance where regular folks of all political leanings are the marks. The mantra of Jeff Yass, astute poker player and options trader, is to play against people dumber than you or less experienced. It’s with a fair degree of confidence I’ll say that some form of mechanical “intelligence” will be hoovering up the “votes” cast in the marketplace of the commons. That intelligence will hold so much data it will be able to discern patterns that would be impossible for the human mind. Thus, we should not become enablers of this game. The odds will never be in our favor. </p>
<p>I keep thinking back to that scene from “The Big Short “where the characters converge on the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas.</p>

<p><a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/">The Big Bluff</a> highlights the importance of offshore jurisdictions like the Isle of Man and the Northern Territory of Cyprus, friendly environments for gambling games of all types. The latter is a de facto state under Turkish control since the 1970s with the United Nations “<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-green-line-nicosia-s-urban-no-man-s-land/qQLy4s1nBVyoKA">green line</a>” exclusion zone crossing the capital city of Nicosia, a no-man’s land in what was once a vibrant shopping district.

Casinos in the north and the south are major conduits for money laundering.</p>
<p>Just to the south of the green line is the University of Nicosia, home to the<a href="https://www.unic.ac.cy/blockchain/msc-digital-currency/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_campaign=MSc-Digital-Currency-North-America&amp;utm_term=cryptocurrency%20university%20nicosia&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAq5meBhCyARIsAJrtdr7KS2aArdd1DXjq0DgZPK0gjutUcsRkZ64eKFt5I0DY1Zz_qN94MmsaAn4cEALw_wcB"> world’s first master’s program in blockchain and digital currency</a> and a partner in the<a href="https://www.eublockchainforum.eu/"> EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum</a>. The school was the first to<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/students-graduate-blockchain-masters/"> accept Bitcoin for tuition payments</a> in 2013. It offers a MOOC introduction to digital currency and scholarships sponsored by Binance Charity and Coinbase for its MSc students.

<p>Green, who took an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering from the University of Washington, worked for a few years at a power plant in the UAE before spending four years traveling the world and learning Thai massage. Another round of globetrotting followed in 2013 as a blockchain evangelist. His origin story includes a “white hat hacker” episode during his stint as a community organizer for Slock.it, when he helped secure and restore ETH following The DAO’s hard fork. After founding Giveth.io, a decentralized blockchain platform designed to incentivize charitable giving, Green turned his expertise towards developing the Token Engineering Commons, The Commons Stack, and governance structures around open-source software and digital public goods. He is a close collaborator with Michael Zargham and the staff of Blockscience.</p>
<p>This image is taken from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcLiRVP347E">interview</a> Green, “OG in the crypto space,” did for IXO Foundation’s “State of the World” series last year. Note the language used around abundance and digital public goods. I first learned about IXO Foundation in the summer of 2018 when I read about their involvement in the Amply pre-k social impact bond project in South Africa that put children on blockchain, so they could begin to earn social capital. You can read those posts <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/08/14/digital-colonialism-south-africa-puts-preschoolers-on-the-blockchain/">here</a> and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/08/15/benevolent-biocapitalism-um-no/">here</a>. Leo Saraceno has also done <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2021/11/04/token-chains-building-the-human-asset-class-through-the-ixo-protocol/">investigative work into IXO Foundation</a> at Silicon Icarus. Pardon me if I take all this talk of “moral economies” with a grain of salt. Any organization that would turn a child into a digital commodity, a human capital derivative product, is not moral in my book. If that’s one’s idea of “commoning,” I’d say it’s time to get your head on straight, go back to the drawing board (without any MBAs or quants anywhere nearby), and try again.</p>

<p>Silicon Icarus goes into some detail about the corporate structure of PokerStars, founded by Isai Scheinberg in 2001. PokerStars played a key role in the restructuring of the online poker landscape following the 2011 cheating scandal.</p>
<p>“In 2014, after PokerStars acquired Full Tilt Poker as part of the DoJ-brokered deal to cover Americans’ losses, Scheinberg’s company was sold to Montreal-based Amaya Gaming Group for a whopping $4.0 billion. The sale turned Amaya, which had also briefly acquired CryptoLogic and InterCasino in 2012, into the largest online gambling company in the world at the time, facilitated by $3 billion from outside investors, including BlackRock.”<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/"> Source</a></p>
<p>The firm was originally based in Costa Rica, but Scheinberg relocated it to the Isle of Man in 2005. The island, a self-governing crown dependency, is known for its tailless Manx cats and a wide-open regulatory approach to emerging tech and gambling. Thirty percent of the island’s<a href="https://www.digitalisleofman.com/about-us/"> economy</a> comes from the tech sector even though the island has no corporate or capital gains tax rates and low personal income tax rates. A public-private partnership,<a href="https://g3newswire.com/digital-isle-of-man-building-a-blockchain-ecosystem/"> Digital Isle of Man</a>, facilitates business relocation. A<a href="https://www.facebook.com/crowndependencypoliticalnews/photos/a.790761064278269/2250266468327714/?type=3"> Blockchain hub</a>, an experimental sandbox with the goal of creating a “supportive jurisdiction” for the industry through “tech-agnostic regulation” that will interface with the island’s established online gaming activities, launched in the spring of 2019.</p>
<p>Last year with a lock down-driven shift to online government services, the Isle of Man launched a<a href="https://www.gov.im/media/1377898/digital-strategy-2022_27-final.pdf"> five-year digital strategy</a> to transform public services centering a shift to smart technologies under the guise of climate policy action, open data, and digital inclusion, a tactic that will turn citizens into data commodities for social impact finance programs linked to the Sustainable Development Goals. Its Treasury launched a<a href="https://www.gov.im/media/1374138/iomtreasury-sustainable-financing-framework.pdf"> Sustainable Finance Network in 2021</a> in partnership with Dutch ESG oversight firm<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainalytics"> Sustainalytics</a> with plans for green bonds, social bonds, and sustainability bonds. As a UNESCO<a href="https://www.biosphere.im/biosphere/unesco-biosphere-isle-of-man"> biosphere reserve</a> that is modest in scale with a lot of tech-finance proceeds running through it, the Isle of Man will make an attractive testbed for<a href="https://www.netzero.im/media/bjubw11j/appendix-30-circular-economy.pdf"> circular economy</a> trials.</p>

<p>While not a part of the Silicon Icarus story, Malta has a similar profile to Cyprus with respect to online gambling. I’ll bring it in here as I added to my map in association with<a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/failed-crypto-giant-ftx-two-maltaregistered-firms.995013"> two unlicensed FTX operations</a> registered there in the spring of 2022. According to Times Malta, “ FTX Malta Gaming Services Limited and FTX Malta Holdings Limited were registered as local companies in April 2022. Both list Sam Bankman-Fried, the billionaire founder of FTX Trading, as their sole director. Neither of those two firms was licensed to carry out any activities related to virtual financial assets, or cryptocurrencies, in or from Malta, a spokesperson for the Malta Financial Services Authority said.”</p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Malta.png?ssl=1"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/9fadbadb5bdc60e10cff23c3b7598476#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1IQzd0Q29nOQ%3D%3D">https://embed.kumu.io/9fadbadb5bdc60e10cff23c3b7598476#untitled-map?s=bm9kZS1IQzd0Q29nOQ%3D%3D</a>
<p>Besides being home to the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Knights of Hospitaller from 1530-1798, the strategically positioned Mediterranean island, a British Commonwealth republic, is a hotbed of digital innovation with a regulatory environment that’s quite friendly to online gaming. It was one of the first countries to approve online gambling in 2004. Revenue from over<a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/a-brief-history-of-gambling-in-malta-a2.958015#:~:text=Gambling%20in%20Maltese%20society,regulate%20online%20gambling%20in%202004."> three hundred registered companies</a> now accounts for twelve percent of Malta’s GDP.</p>
<p>I started paying attention to Malta about five years ago when it became the first country to pilot <a href="https://www.3cl.org/malta-first-nation-state-to-deploy-blockchain-in-education/">Blockcerts</a>, a blockchain-based credential system for learners and workers, developed by Learning Machine, a project launched out of MIT. Learning Machine was acquired by<a href="https://news.hyland.com/hyland-acquires-blockchain-credentialing-provider-learning-machine/"> Hyland</a> in 2021. The lead on that project,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliesmolenski/"> Natalie Smolenski</a>, is now a cheerleader for the technology in the Lone Star State where she serves as board chair of the Texas Blockchain Council and the executive director of the Texas Bitcoin Foundation.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXRNr9KVWw"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXRNr9KVWw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtXRNr9KVWw</a>
<p>A 2017<a href="https://www.3cl.org/malta-first-nation-state-to-deploy-blockchain-in-education/"> article</a> about the program by 3CL Foundation described Malta as having an “emerging reputation as an island lab for the testing and deployment of new technologies.” Blockcerts were pitched as a way for 400,000 citizens to have secure, transparent, flexible, self-sovereign proof of qualifications, including diplomas, certificates, degree equivalencies, and licensure. The effort was part reconceptualizing higher education as a “meta-university” where “experiments with blockchain could lead to the design of entirely new models delivered through various channels including virtual universities and plug and play models (accumulating credits while working).” According to 3CL,<a href="https://www.3cl.org/about/"> a specialist ed-tech foundation established as the Commonwealth Centre for Connected Learning</a>, as early as 2017 blockchain boosters had set their sights on expanded digital identity use cases including: customs, taxation, land, intellectual property, notarization, benefit disbursement, health, voting, judicial records, and even veterinary services.</p>
<p>A program of<a href="https://www.cryptovision.com/en/republic-of-malta-launches-electronic-identity-card/"> contactless biometric electronic identity cards</a> was launched in the fall 2020 for use not only in authentication but for payments, internet sign-on, and even as a door key. How convenient, right? KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for online gaming in Malta preceded the broader roll out by seven years. Back in 2013 Palo Alto-based<a href="https://www.jumio.com/about/press-releases/mr-green-goes-live-with-jumio-to-verify-customer-identity-for-a-vip-customer-experience/"> Jumio</a>, was using artificial computer vision to provide credential verification for Mr. Green, an online gambling operation based in Malta. Andreessen Horowitz was an early investor in Jumio. Many companies have sprung up to provide identity verification services around e-gaming RegTech. Another firm operating in Malta as of 2019 is<a href="https://www.trulioo.com/blog/identity-verification/malta"> Trulioo</a>, started in Vancouver in 2011.</p>
<p>What people are not yet understanding is that their digital wallet will be their digital twin and will be their dynamic human capital valuation. What’s being sold to us as convenience, is actually a digital minder intended to knit us into complex social and economic relationships. E-gaming is about to step outside the digital casino into extended reality. We’re not the poker players, we’re the chips, tokenized bets. Online education and online gambling are two sides of the same coin. In the future economy a significant number of people will be expected to chase skills badges on gamified platforms for gig work awarded by AI as the elite, or more likely automated portfolios linked to ESG (environmental social governance) metrics, place bets on how long we can endure – a new kind of horse race if you will. </p>
<p>That is the learning economy.</p>

<p>Release 5.4.0 introduces a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase.</p>



<p>Improving third-party wallet performance through updates to our wallet SDK and the Zcash protocol continues to be our primary focus at ECC. In parallel, we continue to work through known issues and reduce legacy “tech debt.”</p>



<p>Summary of Changes</p>



 
 Chain supply values now include transparent and all shielded pools. Node operators must reindex their nodes if they want accurate supply information displayed for the entire chain. 



 Replaced 100MiB memory limit with 1000-block limit to eliminate an expensive memory usage call in the batch scanner. 



 Improved block template performance with backported Bitcoin Core code. 



 Removed CentOS 8 as a supported platform due to operating system reaching End-of-Life on December 31, 2021. 
 



<p>Additional RPC changes and feature deprecations have been included in this release. For technical details on these changes, please read the full release notes available <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.4.0">here</a>.</p>

 Part 1: Progressive Onboarding <p>by Henri Stern and Akhila Bhoopalam</p><p>At <a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a>, we build simple tools to help you onboard and engage your users in web3. In this series, we’ll share some thoughts on UX in&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Today, there is no easy way to get started in web3. In spite of the myriad tools and products built to get users in, most people struggle to interact with public datastores (i.e. blockchains). Installing wallets is difficult for new users, wallet connectors for apps are unreliable and often break, and it’s challenging for many products to show their value until a transaction takes place. We overinvest in tooling without focusing on the experiences they&nbsp;unlock.</p> Don’t Connect,&nbsp;Activate <blockquote>There is a word missing from the web3 lexicon. That word is activation.</blockquote><p>Onboarding users onto a product is not just about creating an account, it’s about getting them to use the product and see its benefits firsthand.</p><p>For some apps, the right onboarding should mean connecting a wallet (and potentially educating new users about wallets and custody), but for others it should start with an email login, prompting a wallet connection later. A user might want to browse items, before choosing to save one or comment on one. The purchase comes&nbsp;later.</p><p>Each of these steps requires a different amount of buy-in from the user. And so you should wonder: “does my user need a wallet to make a comment?” If they don’t have one, they’ll have to download an extension and write down a mnemonic. Product fragmentation and learning curves in web3 delay access to core features and lead to&nbsp;churn.</p><p>Using the appropriate hooks, you can keep your users moving through your product funnel. By engaging your users early and progressively onboarding them, you continue to prove out product utility. This will make it easier for diverse audiences to discover new flywheels in your app. Put simply, help your user get to your core utility&nbsp;fast!</p> Wallets galore <blockquote>But this isn’t to say you should throw the book at your user and give them infinite options to connect to your&nbsp;product.</blockquote><p>The first interaction users have with web3 products is increasingly littered with menus of options, often including dozens of wallets to choose from. These options are meant to signal optionality, flexibility, and familiarity for incoming users, but it forces them to compare, filter and choose at the onset. Our users are overwhelmed with tooling and starved of good experiences.</p><p>As a builder you must be opinionated about user activation: prioritize the options you offer, and strive to show the best ones. With every option you give, ask yourself “which of my users is this&nbsp;for?”</p><p>To be clear, client diversity is important to web3 in deep ways, and enabling users to pick their terms of engagement with your product is key… but it must not come at the expense of your product experience.</p> Where the space is&nbsp;going <blockquote>Show users a clear way in, and give them side doors if they already know what they want and what they are&nbsp;doing.</blockquote><p>There’s a lot to be excited about in web3. Staple products are making huge strides threading the needle between web3-native UX and friendly, directed flows. We can illustrate some of our points looking at a product we love:&nbsp;<a href="http://opensea.io">OpenSea</a>.</p><p>OpenSea has the huge challenge of having to serve both the natives who came on in 2018 and fresh newcomers to the space… A huge undertaking. Accordingly, it’s heartening to see them iterate on UX and adopt new patterns for their users. We’ll call two out two which illustrate some of the tensions web3-builders face.</p><p>Wallet onboarding</p><p>First, the mixed bag. If you haven’t checked out the connector experience in OpenSea recently, take a look. What an improvement! They’ve recently overhauled their UI here and it is a breath of fresh air. With that said, the choices here are still a bit overwhelming and the link to a wallets tutorial doesn’t do enough to direct me if I don’t already know what I&nbsp;want.</p><p>Mind you, this is a nuanced issue given a historical user base that needs a long-tail of wallets, support across various ecosystems, etc. But more direction would go a long way for everyone!</p><p>Product selection</p><p>Next up, the great. Thanks to the introduction of <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-seaport-protocol/">the Seaport protocol</a>, OpenSea can build more powerful UX. Their use of the shopping cart abstraction here is fantastic. In the below screen, you can see a wonderful mix of familiar and web3-native elements:</p>  The shopping cart and ⚡-shaped “Buy Now” button are intuitive to anyone who’s used Amazon in the past 20 years… which is to say everyone.  “Sweep” and “Send to a different wallet” tastefully point to more advanced usage for power&nbsp;users.  Shout-out to A Fundamental Dispute by @generativeLight and&nbsp;@frolic<p>The future of the space hinges on our ability to blend familiar interfaces and native concepts. Crypto has given Internet users new ownership superpowers; those will have to be balanced against age-old UX pitfalls, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/moonbirds-creator-kevin-rose-loses-1-1m-in-nfts-after-1-wrong-move">like phishing</a>.</p><p>We, for one, are thrilled to see dominant actors thoughtfully iterate on their product experience. The path ahead is long, but the future is&nbsp;bright.</p> Some lessons <p>Privy builds simple onboarding to bring more users to web3. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned building in the new&nbsp;web:</p>  Sweat the details: What is the role of wallets in your product, and when should they be connected? Do they allow your user to view something, permit something, or own something?  Progressively onboard: How can you continually engage your users as they explore your product over their lifecycle?  Filter, filter, filter: What is the minimal amount of friction and information needed to empower users to access utility? Be opinionated about the pathways you create. Don’t add — reduce.  <p>If you’re building in the space and want to chat about the experience you are crafting, we’d love to&nbsp;help!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/web3s-coming-of-age-c588af57c94d">Web3’s coming of age</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introduction <p>The increasing concern for privacy and security in the digital world has led to a surge in demand for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.scalaproject.io/general/history">Since 2018</a>, Scala has been innovating and developing privacy solutions, and we don’t intend to stop anytime&nbsp;soon!</p><p>The Scala’s 2023 roadmap consists of four main development priorities:</p>  V8 Menger&nbsp;Mainnet  Mining Hub  BSC/ETH Bridge  Marketing  <p>We expect 2023 to be a bullish year for privacy projects, and we believe Scala will be at the forefront of this&nbsp;trend.</p><p>Here are the details of all the items that make up our roadmap for&nbsp;2023.</p> Unstoppable Domains Integration <p><a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/">Unstoppable Domains</a> has always supported Scala, offering technical expertise and financial incentives to integrate its features into the Scala ecosystem. This time, we are excited to announce that we have received a development grant to integrate Unstoppable Domains within our&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>We have already completed the integration of this feature into our&nbsp;wallets.</p>  Android Wallet: <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/ScalaVault/releases/tag/v1.0.9">https://github.com/scala-network/ScalaVault/releases</a>  CLI Wallet: <a href="https://github.com/scala-network/Scala/releases/tag/v7.9.4">https://github.com/scala-network/Scala/releases</a>  <p>UD has added Scala to its list of supported currencies. You can now send and receive crypto using a human-readable name, for example, mastermind.crypto, instead of a long string of numbers and&nbsp;letters.</p><blockquote>Please not that you must have XLA enabled on your <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/domains">UD domain</a> to use this&nbsp;feature.</blockquote><p>This is one more step towards the mainstream adoption of&nbsp;XLA!</p><p>Psst. We are also listed as UD’s official partners: <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps">https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps</a></p> V8 Menger&nbsp;Mainnet <p>V8 Menger is a major upgrade to our network. It brings a host of new additions — mainly our much-anticipated security solution Diardi. You can find all the details about this new version in our <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/menger-v8-specifications-75a8abb9a3c5">previous&nbsp;article</a>.</p> Testnet <p>The testnet has been underway with our community for a few months, and so far, we have not had any major issues that would prevent the mainnet release in the next weeks. We are still working on updating our official pool, but we don’t anticipate any major&nbsp;issues.</p> No more centralized mining farms' domination <p>Many of you have long complained about the large multi-coin mining pools like MoneroOcean and c3pool, which have monopolized most of Scala’s hashrate in recent years, putting a lot of selling pressure on XLA: <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/scala">https://miningpoolstats.stream/scala</a>.</p><blockquote>We believe we have finally found the solution to this non-trivial problem that many other projects have tried to tackle with limited&nbsp;success.</blockquote><p>V8 Menger will provide added security for no extra cost, and we believe it will help to fight against big centralized mining farms. Every 4th block is a Diardi block, so if the critical stakeholders (like pools and exchanges) use a confirmation period above this 4-block limit, they can be assured that malicious miners cannot make a private block mining 51%&nbsp;attack.</p> New Reward&nbsp;Curve <p>V8 Menger will also include some much-needed changes to the reward curve. The reward curve is set to be deflationary but according to an emission curve (so it wouldn’t drop at certain intervals exactly). Instead, it will follow a smooth curve until the tail emission value is hit (999&nbsp;coins).</p><p>The rewards a Diardi operator gets will be 1/4th of the blocks per day, this is because the electrical effort that goes into producing a Diardi block is much lesser than that of a regular&nbsp;block.</p> Updated wallets <p>This new version of the network will require an update of our wallets, so we will take this opportunity to improve and stabilize them, especially the GUI&nbsp;wallet.</p> New Website <p>We have been working on our new revamped website for the last months, with the addition of a blog to improve our SEO and visibility on privacy and mobile mining&nbsp;topics.</p> Mining Hub <p>We are excited to announce that we will be working on a new product to democratize CPU-mineable coins!</p><p>Following the closure of the <a href="https://www.hostero.eu/">Hostero</a> service, we have decided to take over the project and begin the development of a centralized mining hub platform called Scala Mining&nbsp;Hub.</p><p>We will be using Hostero’s open-source components and libraries as a starting point to kickstart the development of our new platform.</p><p>This new product will bring more utility for XLA and provide new cash flow to the&nbsp;project.</p> BSC/ETH Bridge <p>One of our goals for 2023 is to expand our exposure beyond the privacy-centric ecosystem.</p><p>We have already been working on Solidity contracts that will allow us to build a swap between any ETH-compatible chain. This will allow us to build a gateway for Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum (ETH) that will allow our users to swap wXLA (wrapped XLA) for ETH and&nbsp;BNB.</p><p>Once the dust on V8 Menger settles, we will continue working on the cross-chain integration and will be sure to keep you informed about the progress of this&nbsp;project.</p> wXLA Token <p>The new wXLA token linked to our current XLA coin will bring greater visibility to our project and drive more demand for the&nbsp;project.</p> Marketing <p>As most of you know, we are now under the legal umbrella of <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/haku-labs-scalas-non-profit-organization-4456e4739ce">Haku Labs</a>, a legal entity created to oversee the project's operations. This legal status creates new opportunities regarding exchange&nbsp;listing.</p> CEX vs DEX&nbsp;Listings <p><a href="https://tradeogre.com/">TradeOgre</a> has served us well over the last years and has always been a strong partner to our project by providing <a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/LTC-XLA">LTC</a>, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/BTC-XLA">BTC</a> and <a href="https://tradeogre.com/exchange/USDT-XLA">USDT</a> trading pairs for XLA without needing&nbsp;KYC.</p><p>With concerns surrounding CEX in terms of regulatory compliance, and the delisting of privacy coins like Monero (XMR), we feel that spending large amounts of money (typically 100,000$ and more) to get listed on CEX might not be the way to go. That being said, if the opportunity comes to get listed on a CEX at a fair price, we will definitely evaluate&nbsp;it.</p><p>The launch of our wXLA on ETH and BSC will open the door to many opportunities for DEX listings, and we will explore those options actively once our token is released.</p> Fun &amp; Educational Events <p>We are always looking for ways of engaging more with our members and also adding new people to our community. This year, we will be actively looking for ways to increase our exposure, for example, AMAs with other projects, and cross-project collaboration.</p> Scallet V3 <p>Most of you already know that in 2022, we released the updated version of Scallet, our web wallet and payment gateway: <a href="https://scallet.io/">https://scallet.io/</a></p><p>We will work on improving the user interface of this tool to make it more user-friendly and consistent with Scala design guidelines.</p> Conclusion <p>Looking back, we see how far we have come in the last few years. Our community is now engaged and strong, and our team is as passionate and committed as&nbsp;ever.</p><p>We can’t thank you enough for your consistent support. The entire team is excited about these upcoming challenges and is looking forward to&nbsp;them!</p><p>Don’t forget we are a decentralized and community-based project.

<p>Some companies may fall into the trap of choosing a blockchain that doesn’t align with their goals, opting for the most popular one, or partnering with a blockchain not yet ready for onboarding users.</p>



<p>When deciding on a blockchain to develop on, consider these key elements:</p>



 
 Technology – the speed, reliability, and security of the network. 



 Ecosystem – the community of users and developers supporting the network.&nbsp; 



 Focused growth – the entities supporting the network’s development and growth.&nbsp; 



 Legal compliance – it is critical for the mainstream adoption of the technology, considering the rules and laws applied to the blockchain. 
 



<p>This article is an introduction to a deeper explanation found in our ebook: <a href="https://zaisan.io/deciding-on-a-blockchain/">Deciding on a Blockchain</a>.</p>



<a href="https://zaisan.io/deciding-on-a-blockchain/"></a>



 Technology 



<p>Blockchain technology has the power to revolutionise the way future generations handle data, finance, and human interaction. With a vast array of benefits, here are just a few worth mentioning:</p>



 
 Full traceability of any information on the blockchain 



 Smart contracts and automation 



 Increased speed and efficiency 



 Increased security 



 Holistic view of transparency from all parties involved 



 New business models, products, and services 
 



<p>To fully realise the advantages of blockchain, it’s crucial to apply it properly. When deciding on a blockchain, consider factors such as:</p>



 
 The consensus mechanism 



 Transaction per second (TPS) 



 Block speed &amp; fast finality 



 Cost structure 



 Security 



 Network maturity 



 Database integration 



 Environmental impact  
 



<p>These factors are important elements for your whole assessment.</p>



 Ecosystem 



<p>It’s commonly known that the community is comprised of the users, developers, thought leaders and investors of a public blockchain. It goes without saying that the community plays a vital role in the network. Without a community, the blockchain would be of no use and would not receive any development. The community provides the basis for the evaluation of the technology. If it is poorly developed, then it’s unlikely to attract any users. Overall, the community plays a big role in:</p>



 
 Developing decentralised applications (dApps) 



 Influencing the token price 



 The governance model of a public blockchain 



 The stability of the network 
 



 Focused Growth 



<p>“Focused growth” refers to the entity at the forefront of the blockchain network, responsible for driving its development, managing executive functions, and guiding its adoption. This is a crucial consideration when choosing a blockchain to develop on, as the goals and direction of the network are set by this organisation. The hallmark of a strong entity in this role is solid leadership and comprehensive documentation for developers to aid in onboarding. These organisations are often referred to as “foundation companies.” Keep an eye out for incentive programs such as grants and partnerships, as these are common in the blockchain space and can indicate a thriving ecosystem.</p>



 Legal Compliance  



<p>In the rapidly evolving world of web3, it is all too easy for businesses to overlook the importance of compliance with relevant laws and regulations. This may cause significant issues down the road, potentially jeopardising the mainstream adoption of this innovative technology.</p>



<p>To ensure that your blockchain solution is in line with legal requirements and protects the security of your users, it is crucial to choose a platform that supports compliant solutions. This will give developers and users peace of mind, knowing that their transactions and data are secure and compliant with all relevant regulations.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there have been many cases of blockchain projects falling foul of data breaches, scams and other security issues, simply because they failed to consider the importance of compliance. Don’t let your business be caught in the same trap – before choosing a blockchain, take the time to assess its level of compliance and ensure that it provides the necessary safeguards for your users.</p>

      Revisionist Engineering        <p>By Harry Spitzer</p><p>Photography: BRYAN DERBALLA</p><p>Published February 9, 2023</p>        How Deno’s Founder Is Rebuilding the Runtime of the Web      



 
<p>In June 2018, Ryan Dahl took the stage at JSConf EU in Berlin, the largest nonprofit JavaScript conference in the world. Despite it being a high-profile event (and the fact that the majority of the 1,500 conference attendees had filed into this particular warehouse just to see him), Dahl wore a loose-fitting black T-shirt and jeans and kept things casual. “So, I kinda wanted to give a different talk about some other stuff, but that wasn’t ready, so this is kind of a make-up talk,” he began.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl seemed nervous. Given what he was about to do, nerves made sense. Nine years earlier, on this stage, Dahl had introduced an embryonic JavaScript runtime platform, a free, open-source environment for JavaScript programming. This platform, he had announced, was faster and simpler than anything in use. But, most important, historically JavaScript had only been used for a website or app’s design, or “front end.” This platform allowed developers to use JavaScript to build a website or web app’s functionality, or “back end,” too, unifying web development into a single programming language. The platform was called Node.js, and it would establish JavaScript as the dominant coding language for the web, today used by 98 percent of websites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Between the time he’d debuted Node in 2009 and his return to the conference stage in 2018, it wasn’t just the platform that had evolved (thanks to his contributions, and those of hundreds of global open-source collaborators); Node had also transformed Dahl. He’d become a household name among the Hacker News and TechCrunch set. Now, Dahl had returned to Berlin to tear his former creation apart.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s been some years since Node came out,” he started. “And it’s kind of stabilized, and…it’s a thing,” he began noncommittally. “And it’s kind of going into this…direction,” a scowl coming across his face. “So I thought I’d kind of look back on it, and tell you what I think about…,” a pause, “…Node.” Dahl offered a 30-second Node primer: “My goal was really around doing event-driven I/O in JavaScript, and that was important in 2009 for getting server-side JavaScript off the ground. JavaScript is single threaded, that allowed Node to succeed”—before launching into a 16-minute litany of regrets, kicked off with a slide that read, “At times Node is like nails on a chalkboard to me. It could have been so much nicer.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The list included the fact that Node has basically “zero security.” It took to task Node’s original outdated Build System, and it highlighted the complicated packaging of code modules by NPM, the Node Package Manager. And by “so much nicer,” Dahl meant easier to use, more elegantly designed. So as to avoid coming off as a troll, and from a place of genuine affection for his creation and its impact, Dahl sprinkled in praise: “I think Node is quite nice. JavaScript is really quite nice.” He also called out the tremendous effort from Node’s community. Most of all, he touted the ways Node, in creating a runtime environment that allowed web developers to code their full stack in JavaScript, had helped reinforce JavaScript’s position as “the language of the web.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He saved his toughest criticism for himself. Dahl apologized to his audience, with a pained look, for decisions that he said “cannot be corrected now, because there’s just so much software that uses it.” There were so many layers of code, and so many users of his platform—hundreds of whom were in this room—watching him pick apart the platform that helped make JavaScript the most <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-language">commonly used programming language </a>for all developers—web or otherwise—for nearly a decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this act, Dahl was joining a cadre of artists and inventors, like Willa Cather, who implored in the foreword of a reprint of her first novel for readers to consider the book a historical artifact of an early attempt, not a representation of her current artistic merits. Or the godfather of conceptual art, John Baldessari, who burned 100 of his early paintings and baked the ashes into cookies. Dahl, without the ability to cremate his digital creation, was, in effect, asking everyone in the room, and the half a million that would watch his talk online, to relegate Node to a pile of his “early work.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, with the air of someone who’s gotten a weight off his chest: “I thought it was shitty to come up in front of people and complain about stuff without giving some sort of solution,” he said, introducing a prototype he’d hacked together over the last month. “You might want to check out Deno; Deno is a secure runtime on V8.” This new platform, he explained, would be a corrective to Node. A JavaScript runtime, but faster, more secure, more elegant—and, if it eventually did everything he mapped out, it might just supplant Node as the runtime of choice for the world’s coding language of choice. Dahl was launching his next era as only software engineers can, performing the oratory equivalent of iterating on his code in real time, calling out the bugs, talking about preserving elements he liked, and describing how he’d rebuild the rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think I’m mildly happy with it so far,” Dahl offered. He then quickly thanked the audience and walked off stage with three minutes left in his allotted time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dahl’s mother, a math professor at a San Diego community college, had always been a technophile. “Super early, we had a computer, and she got me a book on how to program BASIC. I was just very much exposed to computers at an earlier age than other folks,” says Dahl. Using his mom’s Apple IIc, Dahl mastered BASIC’s basics, before deciding he wanted to run the Linux operating system. He saved $300 from a job as a movie theater projectionist, and bought a used PC. The sparse early-’90s coding environment felt exciting, like a puzzle to solve. “It was a very hands-on learning experience where I knew nothing; there’s nobody there to tell you anything. It was just kind of actually physically smashing the keyboard until you got it to work,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl preferred learning by doing, and found high school understimulating: “I barely graduated. It seemed stupid and pointless,” Dahl says, before adding, “I’m sure I was just an asshole 17-year-old back then.” But in Dahl’s senior year of high school, a new peer-to-peer file-sharing application came out that let users upload and download audio files. Napster only worked on the Windows operating system, and Dahl, instead of accepting this status quo, decided it deserved a home on his favorite operating system, Linux, as well. So he built one called <a href="https://gnap.sourceforge.net/">gnap</a>, compatible with Linux’s desktop environment, Gnome. The first Napster clone to arrive on the scene, gnap earned Dahl his first brush with viral success, and coverage on a proto-Hacker News tech blog called Slashdot. Here was a way that he could have real impact, Dahl thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating (he squeaked by with a C average), and without the grades for a university, Dahl enrolled in math classes at his mother’s community college. In a more technical environment—one of his own choosing—he thrived. After two years of straight A’s, he transferred to the University of California San Diego, then continued on to a PhD in math at the University of Rochester in upstate New York. Three years in, Dahl experienced a familiar feeling, like the things that were being asked of him weren’t meaningful, or even particularly useful. “Math just didn’t feel necessarily connected to reality. There’s just all of these structures and abstractions. At some point you’re just like, ‘Yeah, I want to do something that is actually connected to reality.’” So Dahl dropped out. Within weeks, he and his girlfriend were on a one-way flight to Chile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seeking sunny and quaint conditions, they landed on the coast in Valparaíso. Unfortunately, they had arrived in June, winter in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>



<p>With only grad student savings, Dahl and his girlfriend booked a shared room in a hostel, a temporary solution, they reasoned, until they found jobs teaching English. If Dahl was looking for something real after years of academic abstractions, he’d found it. “There was no heat. There was mold everywhere. There was a mattress on the floor with some dirty bed sheets,” he remembers. “It was like, ‘What are we doing here? This is awful.’”</p>



<p>They lasted a few months before relocating to Buenos Aires. By then, skeptical of his teaching prospects given his questionable credentials (“I paid like $100 for some sketchy online English teacher certificate”), Dahl turned to Craigslist for work. One ad caught his eye, mostly because it had the word snowboarding in the title: a winter sports gear company needed help building their e-commerce site. The gig was not necessarily Dahl’s dream project, but, “I had no money. I was pretty eager to help him out.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even though it’d been years since he’d spent meaningful time coding, Dahl’s high school hacking gave him a solid foundation (his years studying math didn’t hurt, either). Building their site helped Dahl feel like he’d again found a tangible problem to solve. That contract turned into another, and then another through referrals. This was 2007. Dahl and his girlfriend were early digital nomads, taking on remote work as they moved around South America, and eventually to her home country of Germany. With each project, Dahl was exposed to new layers of the coding stack: “I started doing, basically, front-end development with this snowboarding website, and, kind of slowly, it became, ‘Okay, now I’m working on the framework itself, and now I’m thinking about the web server itself. Now I’m thinking about non-blocking I/O.’” Just like he had in high school with his Apple IIc, Dahl figured it out, using online resources and inventing solutions of his own.</p>



<p>One morning in the Cologne apartment he shared with his girlfriend, Dahl woke up to a life-changing email. A San Francisco-based cloud application management platform, Engine Yard, reached out via referral to offer Dahl a $60,000 contract to work on their support team, the most lucrative job he’d ever had. That was the moment Dahl stopped conceiving of software engineering just as a means of funding his itinerant lifestyle. This could be his lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“When Chrome came out, it was just very clear. If I had not done this, somebody else would’ve discovered this.”&nbsp;</p>
ryan dahl</blockquote>



<p>Engine Yard’s engineering needs were the most complex Dahl had encountered. They asked him to build a plugin using non-blocking, or asynchronous operations, a new time-saving method that allowed software to keep executing JavaScript operations without waiting for the non-JavaScript operations in the code to complete. Months after this job, in September 2008, Google released Chrome, with a new JavaScript engine called V8. Still with non-blocking operations on the mind, something clicked. If he could pair Chrome’s new JavaScript engine with non-blocking operations, he could create a platform where JavaScript could handle back-end development as well as front end, supplanting developer favorite Ruby on Rails on the back-end and becoming a full-stack language. “When Chrome came out,” says Dahl, “it was just very clear. If I had not done this, somebody else would’ve discovered this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The “this” Dahl is referring to, of course, is Node.js. And thanks to his $60,000 from Engine Yard, Dahl had a little runway to build it—hacking it together in daily eight-hour coding sprints over six months in a WiFi-less Starbucks on the corner of Rudolfplatz in Cologne. “I think in a very real sense, I was thinking about the right stuff at the right time. I saw this and I was just like, ‘I must implement this now.’”</p>



<p>The story of Node is the stuff of Silicon Valley legend, one of those paradigm-shifting moments (at least in the world of JavaScript coding). It was late 2009 and Dahl had just heard about a new JavaScript conference coming to Europe. Buoyed by his prototype’s success on the nascent code-sharing site GitHub (Dahl says he was one of the first 100 people on GitHub, so good traction meant tens of users), Dahl reached out to JSConf EU’s organizer, asking for a speaking slot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl debuted Node in front of an audience of 150 in Berlin in November 2009, earning a standing ovation—a conference first. The talk went viral in JavaScript circles, and within months, those tens of users had grown to tens of thousands. Users flocked to Node not just because it made it possible to use JavaScript in a new way, but also because it was faster, more elegant, and easier to use than anything else—and it made developers’ websites and web apps that much faster as well.</p>



<p>After toiling on his own in a coffee shop, there was something about seeing the live JSConf crowd’s response that made Dahl realize that, after years of vagabonding, he was ready for stability and community. In the weeks after his talk, a handful of San Francisco-based startups reached out. He accepted an offer from a cloud-hosting company called Joyent; their expertise seemed most aligned with his, and more important, they wanted him to develop Node in-house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the process of hiring Dahl, Joyent gained control of Node’s business interests, which, for an open-source project meant, “I gave them the website; I transferred the credentials to them. We changed all of the copyrights in the source code from copyright Ryan Dahl to copyright Joyent. I gave them the ability to apply for the trademark,” says Dahl. As for what he got out of this acqui-hire: “I got paid out very early and it super de-risked the situation for me.”</p>



<p>In the months after joining Joyent, Node exploded. Tim Becker, a friend of Dahl’s from JavaScript circles, remembers the moment he realized what a big deal Node was becoming. During a 2011 JavaScript meetup in his hometown of Cologne, Becker sent a casual message to Dahl saying it might be fun to host a Node-specific conference in town. “It was really just a spontaneous idea. And he ended up tweeting it, although we weren’t even ready yet,” Becker says. By the end of the meetup, Becker had 10 emails offering to sponsor their conference. “Everybody wanted to be involved in Node,” he says.</p>



<p>But Dahl quickly realized stability came at a price. Despite Node (and Dahl) becoming an increasingly big deal, Joyent wanted to keep overhead low. They wouldn’t allow Dahl to hire engineers to help keep pace with Node’s exploding popularity, seeing Node more as a nice-to-have marketing tool for their existing cloud project. In order to keep up, Dahl moved fast. Critical decisions that would intractably shape the platform had to be made without second-guessing. Bert Belder, an early Node collaborator who built Libuv, a Microsoft-compatible version of Node, remembers Dahl at that time being “a bit uncompromising. He had the tendency to sometimes very aggressively remove things from Node.” One of those things was Promises, a piece of software built to make asynchronous operations smoother. Dahl found its design inelegant. “The next day, an enormous amount of code was ripped out,” remembers Belder, “and everybody had to rewrite their Node.js software because, you know, now everything worked differently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there was the matter of his public profile. Dahl had always relished his anonymity. It allowed him to blog and tweet freely, to make the occasional programming screw-up, and subsequent fix, without backlash. But as Node’s profile rose, so did his. Already predisposed to irreverence, and with a degree of naivete about his newfound celebrity, Dahl was dismayed that when he wrote <a href="https://tinyclouds.org/rant">a blog post</a> titled, “I hate almost all software,” a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3055154">Hacker News thread</a> about the post garnered hundreds of comments. Close friends like Isaac Schleuter, the mind behind NPM, could see the backlash coming: “I saw that go down and I was like, ‘Oh God, Ryan, what are you doing to yourself?’”</p>



<p>But what bothered Dahl more than any attack (and what he perhaps should’ve anticipated, given his own vocal critiques) was when users took Node itself to task. “I remember one post in particular called ‘Node.js a cancer.’ At the time, I was just like, ‘Oh no, I’ve made a mistake somewhere,’” says Dahl. “It affected me emotionally. I was just trying to make some technology, and I guess wasn’t super-prepared for this thing to be as big as it was. I didn’t want to be the face of it.’” So Dahl stopped posting and weighing in, and in late 2013, he deactivated his Twitter.</p>



<p>By early 2014, Dahl was ready for a change. After eight years, he’d just broken up with his girlfriend, and startup fatigue had set in. It was the strain of managing such a high-profile, complex project, but he also felt like he’d done what he’d set out to do. Node had made the impact he’d hoped for—and with most of the ongoing development happening in open-source communities, Dahl felt it no longer needed him. He felt ready to create something new. So Dahl put in his notice, booked a flight to New York City, and walked away from Node.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s nothing more eye-opening than when you go back and look at your own code and you’re just like, ‘Oh my God, this is terrible.’”</p>
ryan dahl</blockquote>



<p>On a late summer day in 2017, Dahl called Belder from his office in Google’s Manhattan campus. He had a proposition. After three years of toying around with startup ideas, Dahl had accepted a role at Google Brain, the team developing Google’s Machine Learning engine, TensorFlow. Until now, TensorFlow had mostly been built in Python, but a new project called deeplearn.js was making it possible to build models in JavaScript, Dahl’s language of choice. “Let’s take TensorFlow, and bind it to Node and make a kind of better JavaScript machine-learning framework,” Dahl told Belder. The opportunity seemed obvious to Belder. “In the back of my mind there is always like, okay, maybe this could be something big,” he remembers. Within weeks, Belder quit his job as IBM’s internal Node.js expert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At first, diving into Node felt like a homecoming, but soon Dahl was looking upon his creation with five years’ worth of new skills, insights and awareness of all the progress made in coding globally. “We quickly realized that there were all these problems with Node. Man, there’s nothing more eye-opening than when you go back and look at your own code and you’re just like, ‘Oh my God, this is terrible.’” Dahl couldn’t stand the thought of his name being attached to something he now saw as so…amateur, so flawed. He briefly entertained the idea of trying to fix the problems from within, but quickly concluded that the platform’s problems were too fundamental, and the open-source leadership too decentralized, to ever be able to resolve the issues. Instead, he decided to build something new that would clear his name and do what Node couldn’t. A few months later, in June 2018, having recently quit his job at Google, Dahl took the stage at JSConf EU in Berlin to introduce Deno.</p>

<p>When I speak with Dahl in late 2022, I notice another subtle way he’s distancing himself&nbsp; from his past. The name of his new company, pronounced during his 2018 JSConf presentation ‘DEH-NO,’ has shifted to the simpler, funner, arguably more elegant ‘DEE-NO.’ “It is the proper English pronunciation of those letters,” Dahl says, “and we liked the dinosaur association.”</p>



<p>The platform behind the brontosaurus branding is now a far cry from the barely functional demo of 2018. It’s faster than Node, built on Rust, a newer, more secure programming language. “We’re trying to just generally take advantage of the fact that we’re in the future now, and things are great,” Dahl says. It enables the use of TypeScript, simplified bundles of JavaScript code, right out of the box. And whereas Node had “zero security”—“when you install an NPM module, this is essentially running untrusted code from random people on the internet on your computer”—Deno is built to operate within the secure sandbox of a web browser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deno’s biggest innovation is starting a migration toward edge computing, which Dahl sees as the next big shift in web development. “Particularly serverless at edge, that is, running your server everywhere all at once in every region around the world,” he says, “that’s where I see Deno moving us in five years.” Deno’s version of edge computing, what it calls an isolate cloud, runs little bits of JavaScript in data centers all around the world. This helps cut down the time it takes to reach a data center by allowing programs to get responses from the data center closest to where the requests are being made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dahl is rewriting the way he works, too. He didn’t want to be in the same position he’d been in with Node, unable to hire as many engineers as he needed, so this time, he opted for funding in addition to open-sourcing, a decision that led him to Mike Vernal and Lauren Reeder, partners at Sequoia Capital, in January 2022. Vernal found Dahl endearing on an early phone call. “He felt a little bit like someone who is set up on a date they really didn’t want to go on. And so they’re like, ‘Okay, let’s finish this thing off and then let me get back to work,’” says Vernal. “You could tell he wanted to go back to building the thing that he wanted to build. And he was very transparent about that, which, in a weird way, I liked.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Deno is based in New York City, has 15 full-time employees, and is in the process of hiring 10 more, mostly engineers. Sequoia led the company’s Series A, announced in June 2022. The platform has nearly 100,000 developers using it every week, it’s one of the top 50 projects on GitHub of all time and more and more enterprises, like Netlify and <a href="https://deno.com/blog/slack">Slack</a>, are using its enterprise offering, Deno Deploy, to build their web apps and websites. Becker credits some of the success to Dahl directly: “There are enough people who are convinced by him and who, just because of his involvement, are willing to dive right into Deno.”</p>



<p>Dahl hopes to do a push on Deno’s general release by summer of 2023 to bring in more individual users—the people Node currently serves. His urgency has only increased as competitors have debuted. But he sees others in the space as evidence that he’s on to something, an incentive for his team to stay focused. “Having a little competition on the performance side means that I can very much justify putting effort into that, and performance is what I would love to do day in and day out,” says Dahl.</p>



<blockquote>

ryan dahl</blockquote>



<p>With Deno, Dahl isn’t so much trying to fix the status quo as build a new one. “When we launched Deno in 2018, Node was an industry standard that everybody in that conference room had used professionally for many years,” Dahl says. “I think a lot of those things, Node’s bugs and flaws, were just taken as a given. Like, ‘It just works this way.’ And I hope that hearing how it ought to have been done, and things that could be done better, was really an eye opener.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like when he noticed an opportunity to build Napster on Linux, or when he realized that Chrome’s V8 engine could forever transform the way people use JavaScript, Dahl is primed to keep reinventing. And he attributes this fortunate position to timing, more than a little kismet and the perspective he gained as the main mind behind Node. “I don’t know if obligation is the right word, but I have the right vantage point to be able to say, ‘Yeah, actually we can just do this differently.’”</p>



<p>He cares so much about doing web development differently because he sees it as the “medium of human information.” If he can make web development easier, Dahl says, “in particular on the server side, the area that I have ideas in and influence over, then we can make things faster. And I think sometimes making things faster does actually change the nature of what people can do. Faster means smoother online experiences, better real-time communications. Faster means more people interacting simultaneously online. There’s a vast opportunity to have a real impact.”&nbsp;Until then, he’ll keep refining. “Everything’s a work in progress,” he tells me toward the end of our call. He’s polite, but eager to get off Zoom and back to building what he hopes won’t be another important yet flawed early work, but instead, a truly great one.&nbsp;</p>

Because it is permissionless, non-custodial and provable. We&nbsp;can:</p>  send and receive ETH and ERC-20s to and from Verus and&nbsp;Ethereum  send and receive currencies launched on Verus to and from&nbsp;Ethereum  convert currencies through the bridge converter currency. Use on Ethereum as well as on Verus. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/#bridge-converter-launches">Learn more on bridge converter currencies</a> 🔗   Defining a&nbsp;Currency <p>Defining a currency on the Verus network is simple, just two commands are all you need. When the currency is successfully launched it can flow around within the protocol, and outside of the protocol (like an ERC-20, in our example). Let’s get&nbsp;started.</p> VerusID Namespace <p>Before defining the currency, we already registered the VerusID MaxUSDC@. This cost us 80 VRSCTEST, which were distributed to the block producers. These costs can drastically vary depending on which PBaaS-chain you create a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>VerusID is the namespace for currencies and PBaaS-blockchains, among many other things. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Defining the mapped&nbsp;currency <p>Defining a currency costs 200 VRSCTEST. These costs can change depending on which blockchain you want to define a currency. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains’ native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.</p><p>With a few simple commands we&nbsp;will:</p>  Define a currency mapped to the USDC Ethereum contract with a registered namespace (VerusID) on the Verus Testnet blockchain  Export the currency to Ethereum through <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">the non-custodial, provable bridge</a>&nbsp;🔗  <p>Before we can define the currency which is mapped to USDC on Ethereum, we must fund MaxUSDC@ with enough VRSCTEST to launch the currency. And after that with enough vETH or VRSCTEST to pay for the gas fees that export the currency to Ethereum.</p><p>200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency, and around 0.05 vETH or equivalent worth of VRSCTEST to export the currency to Ethereum.</p><p>Fund your VerusID with vETH in two&nbsp;ways:</p>  Send ETH to Verus (into vETH) with <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">the Verus-Ethereum bridge</a>&nbsp;🔗  Convert VRSCTEST or any other currency into vETH using Verus’ protocol level DeFi <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/sendcurrency-examples.html#converting">more info on how to convert</a>&nbsp;🔗  <p>The command that defines our currency MaxUSDC, which is mapped to the ERC-20 USDC (Goerli Testnet) <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/token/0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a?a=0xc2c3c5597e0ef59a92f04a70c8af9f8b8cb342e9">contract address on Etherscan</a> 🔗, is as&nbsp;follows:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{<br> "name":"MaxUSDC", <br> "options":32, <br> "systemid":"veth", <br> "parent":"vrsctest", <br> "conversions":[1], <br> "currencies":["VRSCTEST"], <br> "launchsystemid":"vrsctest", <br> "nativecurrencyid":{<br>   "type":9, <br>   "address":"0x98339D8C260052B7ad81c28c16C0b98420f2B46a"<br>   }, <br> "maxpreconversion":[0], <br> "initialsupply":0, <br> "proofprotocol":3<br>}' <p>⭐ To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, <a href="https://docs.verus.io/definecurrency/">go here</a> 🔗 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">The community is happy to help on Discord</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>When we do the command above we get returned a HEX. Only after we make a transaction with the HEX, will the currency launch be broadcasted to the network. See&nbsp;below:</p> ./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction "hex" <p>Now you can see the currency on the Verus network. We just need to make sure it’s on Ethereum as&nbsp;well.</p> Exporting the mapped&nbsp;currency <p>Now, let’s export the currency from Verus to Ethereum as an ERC-20 over the non-custodial bridge. We do this with the following command:</p> ./verus chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "MaxUSDC@" '[{<br>  "address":"0xAD84C9EE28FB4c3b9C6ef1B86D1ED00A82DB84E9", <br>  "currency":"MaxUSDC", <br>  "amount":0, <br>  "exportto":"veth", <br>  "exportcurrency":true, <br>  "feecurrency":"veth"<br>}]' <p>Note: the first MaxUSDC@ field is the change address for fees being returned to you, and the address is the Verus-Ethereum non-custodial smart contract bridge address. You can also omit feecurrency if you would rather pay the export fees in VRSCTEST.</p><p>After the bridge has been notarized to the blockheight where you have exported the currency, you can choose it from the token dropdown <a href="https://ethtest.verus.services/">on the bridge website</a>&nbsp;🔗.</p> ERC-20s on&nbsp;Verus <p>After sending from Ethereum to Verus, the token is free to move through the Internet of Value on the Verus network, across PBaaS-blockchains, and also back &amp; forth with Ethereum.</p><p>As easily as the token was first defined and launched, it can now become one of the reserves in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM as part of Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>Anybody can define a multi-reserve currency which includes MaxUSDC as a reserve with weighted percentage (10–90%). The reserves grow as they retain a small fee whenever assets are traded in/out/through.</p><p>A multi-reserve currency itself can also be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>👀 Stay tuned for more on this later, or start reading <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join the Discord to&nbsp;learn</a>.</p><p>🫡 Credits for the article go to community member ‘ejuliano’.</p><p>➡️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Explore with the community on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/get-ahead-of-the-game-with-verus-groundbreaking-1-1-decentralized-currency-mapping-for-erc-20-cc23584a7037">Get Ahead of the Game with Verus’ Groundbreaking 1:1 Decentralized Currency Mapping for ERC-20…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Now that Round 1 has come to a close, here’s what happened and who won. We’ll go over each winner’s entry and then into the details on what comes next, I hope you’re excited because this is some pretty exciting&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>Congratulations to all of the winners, let’s go over them individually along with the overall benefit this provides to the DERO ecosystem. In no particular order here were the winning&nbsp;entries.</p> NFA Set — Apollo <p>This was built by Apollo along with a class he is teaching to show just how creative people can get with the DERO blockchain and NFAs. This entry was not just a set of NFAs it is a functioning hypothetical service that uses the NFAs. Part of the challenge of the NFA set was to make a set of NFAs that could also have functionality that could be applied to real world use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/apollo5ever/DerBNB">https://github.com/apollo5ever/DerBNB</a></p><p>Benefit&nbsp;: This goes to show that a service people may want to use doesn’t mean they have to have their personal or private information publicly linked to it. I don’t think people would want to use a service like AirBNB if their rental activity was open to anybody that cared to take a glance. Overall, great Proof of Concept in my&nbsp;book.</p> Options and Futures — SixOfClubs <p>SixOfClubs actually built the functionality for onchain options and futures into their dReams platform, it doesn’t use centralized oracles and it appears they are planning to integrate services as well so the dReam client will not be needed in the future as well. Good luck in Round&nbsp;2!</p><p>GitHub&nbsp;: <a href="https://github.com/SixofClubsss/dReams">https://github.com/SixofClubsss/dReams</a></p><p>Benefit: The ability for users to speculate on values that are stored on blockchain and not rely on centralized oracles.</p> Visual Scripting — Bisounours <p>This is a really awesome tool that was built by Bisounours where you can actually build smart contracts with a visual scripting interface. I would explain it more but it’s easier to show&nbsp;you.</p><p>Pretty cool&nbsp;right?</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/DaBisounours/dero-visual-scripting">https://github.com/DaBisounours/dero-visual-scripting</a></p><p>Benefit: With this type of scripting tool novice developers and experts alike can create basic smart contracts with ease and test them locally on their machines. Lowering the barrier to entry for developers to bring more diversity to the DERO ecosystem.</p> BBS Service — nicoreed/NicoTheDreamer <p>Nico has so far built a CLI based prototype for a BBS service on DERO. It uses <a href="https://github.com/deroproject/graviton">Graviton DB</a> on the back end and has both public and private message channels. They plan on fulfilling the additional requirments of the challenge with some games/challenges built&nbsp;in.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/NicoTheDreamer/BullishnBored">https://github.com/NicoTheDreamer/BullishnBored</a></p><p>Benefit: A completely decentralized Bulletin Board Service built on a private blockchain that anyone can launch is obviously a great tool for freedom and freedom of speech which extends far beyond just the DERO ecosystem. Very cool, can’t wait to see the improvements.</p> Hardware Wallets — Sountum <p>This entry is pretty self explanatory. Sountum is working on integrating DERO support on ledger. Looks like they have their PoC complete and just need a little more time to complete their work. They also seem to have an opensource wallet planned as well, we wish them&nbsp;luck!</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/sountum/app-dero">https://github.com/sountum/app-dero</a></p><p>Benefit: This may also be self explanatory but a hardware wallet support for a major hardware wallet manufacturer is a big win for the DERO community. Also, opensource hardware wallets would be great for everyone that would rather make their own hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p>Event 1 Round 1&nbsp;Results<p>Moving on to Round 2&nbsp;:</p><p>As I have hinted before Round 2 comes with a twist. Projects can now choose to work with their direct competition (within the same category) to create a new project and split the Round 2 prize money. So this is not a zero sum round if entrants choose to take this route. This could open up the door to make an outside of the box combination of entries while also guaranteeing BOTH entrants receive half of the prize money and also have a chance to split the Grand Champion prize. The entries can be any combination of functionality as long as they are fully functional.</p> ATTENTION ENTRANTS&nbsp;: <p>To sum this up it means you can go for the 750 Round 2 + 1,000 DERO Grand Prize on your own OR you can choose to go for 375 Round 2 each + 500 DERO each as a team with your competitor. If you do choose to work together it must be announced prior to the end of Round 2 on April 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>This does leave the Hardware category in a little bit of a peculiar situation but, the Hardware Wallet devs don’t have any direct competition. So the 750 Round 2 prize (and possibly the Grand Prize) are up for grabs as long as they have it working. Also, the DERO developers are willing to lend a hand if they get stuck so, they are not at a complete disadvantage in this situation.</p><p>What you all choose to do is completely up to you but, choose&nbsp;wisely.</p><p>Also, reminder please make sure that your DERO wallet address is updated in your GitHub repository for your&nbsp;entry!</p><p>That about wraps it up. Thank you to everyone for your participation and support as always and we’ll see you at the end of Round 2 on April&nbsp;1st!</p><p>As a reminder, winning projects are not endorsed or audited by the DERO Project. This is a hackathon and developer competition to showcase what can be done with the DERO platform. If entries become successful that’s great but just keep in mind that a winning entry doesn’t constitute an official endorsement from the DERO team and you should always do your own research.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/dero-darch-event-1-first-round-comes-to-a-close-e7816a01d8f7">DERO dARCH Event 1 First Round Comes to a close</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the twenty-second post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Research and Privacy Engineer Arthur Edelstein. This post was written by VP of Privacy Engineering Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>Starting in version 1.50, Brave will include a new feature called “HTTPS by Default” that improves Web security and privacy by increasing HTTPS use. Brave will upgrade all sites to HTTPS, falling back to HTTP only if the site does not support HTTPS, or in the rare case a site is known to not function correctly when loaded over HTTPS. This feature is the most protective, aggressive default HTTPS policy of any popular browser, and will be available on Android and Desktop versions of the Brave browser to begin with, with iOS coming later.</p>
<p>HTTPS by Default improves on Brave’s existing, list based approach for upgrading sites.</p>

 HTTPS is critical to security and privacy on the Web 
<p>HTTPS is a vital part of a private and secure Web. Unless you load sites over HTTPS, your ISP (and other parties) can see what you load, say, and send to websites. While you shouldn’t assume an HTTPS site respects your privacy, you can be certain that a site that doesn’t use HTTPS is putting your privacy at risk.</p>
<p>For example, if you visit example.site from your phone, the request might leave your phone, be sent to your mobile carrier, then sent to the example.site server. The site’s server would then respond with the page you requested, which would then move back through your mobile carrier to your phone. If the site is fetched over HTTP, your mobile carrier would be able to see exactly what you sent to example.site’s servers, along with what example.site said in response. If, however, example.site is loaded over HTTPS, your mobile carrier would not be able to see these details.</p>
<p>In short, HTTPS is critical to protecting your privacy and security when using the Web.</p>

 The challenge of knowing when to upgrade sites from HTTP to HTTPS 
<p>Because HTTPS is critical to privacy and security, browsers like Brave are eager to load sites over HTTPS whenever possible. And since many sites today support only HTTPS, it’s simple to load these sites in a private and secure way. And encouragingly, more and more sites are being built or updated to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">support HTTPS only</a> (or to use other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> protected protocols, like secure web sockets).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are many sites on the Web that still support HTTP, and some laggards that support only insecure HTTP connections. Brave’s goal is to automatically “upgrade” these sites to HTTPS whenever possible (i.e. in all cases where a site loads and functions correctly when loaded over HTTPS).</p>
<p>But deciding when to upgrade a site to HTTPS is tricky. In cases where a website does not support HTTPS, attempting to upgrade from HTTP to HTTPS will produce an obvious error. Other sites support both HTTPS and HTTP, but do so from different domains (e.g. <code>http://example.site</code> vs. <code>https://secure.example.site</code>), making automatic upgrades tricky. And still other sites load “correctly” when fetched over HTTPS, but have broken functionality.</p>
<p>In short, ideally browsers would never load sites over HTTP, and browsers could automatically upgrade all insecure requests to HTTPS. In practice though, it is difficult to know how, when, and if a site will function correctly when upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS.</p>

 How Brave’s “HTTPS By Default” feature works 
<p>Starting in version 1.50, the Brave browser will use a new system for upgrading insecure HTTP connections to secure-and-private HTTPS connections. The new feature, called “HTTPS By Default,” works as follows:</p>
 
 
<p>If you are about to visit a page loaded over HTTP, Brave checks to see if the destination is on a list of sites that break when loaded over HTTPS. Brave maintains <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/https-upgrade-exceptions-list.txt">this list of “breaks-over-http” sites</a>, which is open for anyone to view and use<a>1</a>. If the requested site is on the list, Brave will then allow the site to load over HTTP.</p>
 
 
<p>Provided it’s not on that list, Brave will attempt to load the site over HTTPS (i.e. upgrade the navigation request from HTTP to HTTPS). If the server responds to the replacement HTTPS request with an error, then Brave assumes the server does not support HTTPS, and will load the site over HTTP.</p>
 
 
<p>Otherwise, Brave will load the site over HTTPS, ensuring a more private and secure connection.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave’s new “HTTPS By Default” feature replaces the previous list-based approach Brave has used since our first beta versions. In this approach, Brave used the <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> list (a terrific, public resource maintained by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>) to decide when to upgrade HTTP connections to HTTPS. But while the HTTPS Everywhere list is useful, it has two important drawbacks:</p>
 
 
<p>First, the HTTPS Everywhere list is <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere">no longer maintained</a>, meaning that the list is increasingly out of date.</p>
 
 
<p>Second, despite the best efforts of the EFF, any approach that uses a list of what sites should be upgraded is going to be limited, as the number of sites on the Web is enormous, and it’s difficult for the list maintainers to keep up. Brave’s approach, by contrast, maintains a smaller (and more manageable) list of sites to not upgrade.</p>
 
 
<p>More broadly, the main benefit of Brave’s new “HTTPS by Default” feature is that it has a better default. In its default configuration, HTTPS Everywhere would allow unknown (i.e., not on the list) sites to load over HTTP; Brave’s new “HTTPS by Default” approach loads the site over HTTPS even in cases where the site is new or unknown<a>2</a>.</p>

 Other ways Brave is advancing privacy 
<p>Brave is especially excited about our new “HTTPS by Default” feature because it’s categorically different from the privacy features that Brave usually releases. Most of the <a>privacy features</a> in Brave work at the Web application layer—the browser modifies how websites execute in order to prevent those pages from re-identifying you.</p>
<p>By contrast, the “HTTPS by Default” feature protects your privacy by improving the privacy of how you access websites (that is, before they even load in the browser). Both categories of privacy feature are important, and they complement each other well. Brave is excited to have the most privacy-protecting default features (in both categories) of any popular browser.</p>
<p>Brave applies an even stronger level of protection when using Private Windows with Tor. In these cases Brave defaults to HTTPS-Only mode, where pages are able to load without confirmation only over HTTPS (otherwise the user is presented with a choice whether or not to proceed with an HTTP connection ). This provides even stronger protections than the “HTTPS by Default” setting, at the risk of some pages not working correctly, which we believe is the right trade off when using the Tor network. Users can enable HTTPS-Only mode for all windows in Brave (not only Private Windows with Tor) at brave://settings/shields.</p>
<p>“HTTPS by Default” is one of many upcoming systems and proposals Brave has for improving Web privacy beyond the Web application level. For example, Brave’s recent <a>STAR</a> protocol allows for protocol-based protections on product analytics (what we call privacy-protecting product analytics, or P3A). Similarly, Brave’s <a>FrodoPIR</a> proposal provides protocol-level protections for querying whether a URL is malicious.</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>Brave is committed to promoting and protecting a user-centered Web, and that means constantly developing new protections at all levels of the browser stack. We believe that strong privacy should be enabled by default, so that all Web users, expert and beginner alike, can safely use the Web. We will be rolling out “HTTPS by Default”&nbsp; (along with several other new privacy features) in the coming weeks.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>For example, a site may technically load over HTTPS but still be broken because images or sub-resources are not fetched correctly.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>
 
 
<p>HTTPS by Default has been inspired in part by a number of previous projects. The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smart-https/cmleijjdpceldbelpnpkddofmcmcaknm">SmartHTTPS</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/httpz/">HTTPZ</a> browser extensions have provided a similar protection in Firefox and Chrome-based browsers. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/11/17/firefox-83-introduces-https-only-mode/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html">Chrome’s</a> opt-in HTTPS-Only Modes were introduced in 2020 and 2021 respectively, and Firefox <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/08/10/firefox-91-introduces-https-by-default-in-private-browsing/">introduced</a> HTTPS by Default in Private Browsing Windows in 2021. Brave’s new feature advances the state of the art even further by providing built-in HTTPS upgrades by default for all browsing.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>The Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) recently <a href="https://www.vara.ae/media/Virtual%20Assets%20and%20Related%20Activities%20Regulations%202023.pdf">published its framework law</a> for virtual asset regulation in Dubai, the Dubai Virtual Assets Law (Dubai VA Law). The law aims to regulate virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs). VARA was established by Law No. 4 of 2022.</p>



<p>A provision in the Dubai VA Law would prohibit the issuance of “anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies” and all virtual asset activities related to them in the Emirate of Dubai. The scope of what is meant by “all virtual asset activities” is unclear, and if also meant to apply to the peer-to-peer marketplace would only increase the concern and questions about lawful jurisdiction.</p>



<p>The global trend of governments moving away from the privacy features of digital assets is concerning and raises alarm bells. The generic term “anonymity-enhancing coins” undervalues the significance and protection provided by private financial transactions. This overlooks the reality that a vast majority of digital assets, including bitcoin, possess some level of anonymity-enhancing features, and many more digital assets are continually enhancing their privacy capabilities. This trend not only undermines the value of these assets but also the privacy rights of individuals and businesses. It is essential to recognize the crucial role that privacy features play in the digital asset landscape and take steps to preserve and enhance them.</p>



<p>In the Dubai VA law, anonymity-enhancing coins are defined as: “a type of Virtual Asset which prevents the tracing of transactions or record of ownership through distributed public ledgers and for which the VASP has no mitigating technologies or mechanisms to allow traceability or identification of ownership [emphasis added].”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In focusing on the bold language, the law itself recognizes that virtual asset service providers (VASPs) have a role to play in compliance with flexibility to consider their own risk-based solutions to list and support such coins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there is profound regulatory complexity as the law applies only within Dubai and not to the wider United Arab Emirates or the Dubai International Financial Centre. The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) is a financial free zone in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It was established in 2004 with the goal of providing a hub for international financial services in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. The DIFC is governed by its own independent courts, and its jurisdiction covers financial services, among other things.</p>



<p>These new provisions promulgated by VARA may impact VASP decision-making and need to be challenged and clarified. Electric Coin Co. is committed to responsible innovation and will continue to raise awareness of the danger to growth and innovation in Dubai posed by limiting privacy protections for its citizens. We look forward to further opportunities for discussion and clarification with the regulatory authority.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1983 Matthew Broderick movie “War Games,” David, a high school student, hacks into what he thinks is a gaming company and strikes up a rapport with an AI created by NORAD. Yes, poker was on the list of available gaming opportunities, but David opted for Global Thermonuclear War, and after being dragged into the military base he asks the AI if what is happening is real or if it’s a game – a salient question as we cross the threshold into NVIDIA’s Omniverse during an era in which the standards committee chair for IEEE’s Metaverse roll out believes we’re already living in a simulation, so why not engineer another one (using militarized behavioral psychology) on top of it?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Raul opens “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/">The Big Bluff: Online Poker, Crypto, and Western Capital’s Last Gamble</a>” with the plight of a Turkish journalist who turned to online poker after his chosen profession was undermined by political crackdowns and strikes and closes with cautions about workers agreeing to become tokenized assets in someone else’s game. That’s good advice, because those taking wagers are well-connected MBAs who’ve been taught that you need to be the game designer who makes the rules by which others play, and really, the only way to “win” a game you didn’t design is not to play. The rise of online poker is his article’s through line, touching on regulation of gambling-related financial transactions and the resulting adoption of crypto, offshore banking, cheating scandals, and post-scandal restructuring of the gaming sector.</p>
<p>Among “The Big Bluff’s” featured characters are Isai Scheinberg, a former executive with IBM Canada who later founded PokerStars; Scott Augustine, a professional poker player who used his winnings to pay of his Notre Dame student loans before co-founding the blockchain media platform Rokfin; Dan Friedberg, a lawyer for the fraudulent Ultimate Bet corporation who became Chief Compliance Officer for the failed FTX cryptocurrency exchange; and Satjiv Chahil, an early manager of Xerox PARC who went on to build brands with Apple, HP, and SONY.</p>
<p>I had a hunch that poker would provide a rich vein for further investigation and began to map the elements of Raul’s story, adding branches of my own. I particularly wanted to unpack Augustine’s alma mater, Notre Dame; its activities in the development of social sensing technologies, impact finance at the Vatican; and how those efforts are extending into the gamified blockchain education ecosystem coming online in Dallas – a new twist on Texas Hold’Em. </p>
<p>Following the trail of<a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/fraud-buster-iovation-secures-10-million-from-intel-capital/"> Iovation, the</a> supposed “anti-fraud” software backed by Intel Capital, I wound my way through The Secret Network, Alameda Research, Jane Street options trading, and hit the jackpot with Susquehanna International Group (SIG). Its CEO Jeff Yass is the wealthiest man in Pennsylvania with a soft spot in his libertarian heart for school choice. Once public schools are deconstructed and transformed into decentralized learning ecosystems tied to digital wallets there will be countless profitable human capital wagers to be made, for those with SIG’s analytical chops, on lifelong learners (agents) tasked with building out Web3 extended reality (the gaming simulation).</p>

<p>Raul makes a point in his article about the strategic use of the online poker industry to advance adoption of alternative privacy-preserving payment systems. I agree with that and see the same dynamic in the<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/crypto-save-cannabis-industry-203413552.html"> legalized cannabis industry</a>.&nbsp; Both are situations where early adopters are set up to normalize distributed ledger technologies that are intended to one day be wedded to smart contract logic and embedded in everyday objects that will subtlety and not so subtlety, govern our lives.</p>
<p>Researchers at MIT Media Lab have been experimenting with novel human-computer interfaces for three decades using the concept of “tokens” (which at that stage were not yet integrated into distributed ledger&nbsp; systems) to bridge digital information into the material realm where it can be tactilely manipulated with the effects of those manipulations translated back into computational space – early-stage augmented reality. Experiments in non-traditional computational interfaces are featured in a 2004 paper that describes how game mechanics can be leveraged in social experiments.</p>
<p>“Board games offer compelling examples for how abstract rules and relationships can be encoded within systems of physical objects. For example, Monopoly utilizes distinctive physical tokens as representations of people (player tokens), physical entities (house and hotel tokens), money, actions (through several kinds of cards), and elements of chance (the dice). The Monopoly board expresses the framing syntax for composing and interpreting these tokens within the visual “constraints” printed upon its surface. These artifacts also express a range of physical properties governing their manipulation and use. Some elements of the game engender information hiding and privacy (especially one-sided cards), while others facilitate shared state (especially tokens and board). Some representations are borrowed from other contexts (e.g., paper money and dice), while others are original to the game. Games also afford interaction not only between people and information, but also between multiple people, in a compelling and engaging fashion.”</p>
<p>The paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Tokenconstraint-systems-for-tangible-interaction-with-digital-information-.pdf">Token+Constraint Systems For Tangible Interaction With Digital Information</a>,” was funded in part by IBM through MIT’s<a href="https://ttt.media.mit.edu/vision/vision.html#:~:text=Things%20That%20Think%3A%20TTT%20Vision%20Statement&amp;text=%E2%80%9CThings%20That%20Think%20is%20really,engineering%20toolkit%20for%20the%20future.%E2%80%9D&amp;text=The%20goal%20of%20the%20Things,digitally%20augmented%20objects%20and%20environments."> Things That Think Consortium</a>, launched in 1995.

Based on my investigations, it appears a long-range goal is to install a decentralized, peer-to-peer program of social engineering that combines<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Foundations-of-Cryptoeconomic-Systems-Shermin-Voshmgir.pdf"> crypto economics</a> with a sensor-embedded world that has been remade a gamified “commons.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Econophysics and programmed tokens are tools to advance our collective digital evolution. The following is an excerpt from Jeff Emmett’s 2018 Medium post, “<a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8">Rewriting the Story of Human Collaboration</a>.” I encourage you to read the entire article to become more familiar with the terminology involved and see how they plan to thread the needle between free-market and collectivist economics. It is important to realize labels, culture wars, and manufactured polarization are meant to obscure the fact that what we are actually up against is cold, mathematical logic.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8"></a></p>
<p>“As we observe in nature, when organisms mature and evolve, they progress from competition to cooperation, and often build resilient, self-correcting, vibrant ecosystems – as Jenine Benyus says, ‘collaboration rather than competition that is the survival mechanism in natural systems.’ Consider the human body, made up of trillions of cells and bacteria. By collaborating synergistically, they not only provide for themselves, but also for the whole, a byproduct of which seems to be the formation of a meta-level intelligence – us.”</p>
<p>Are we approaching a similar interconnectedness of the human race with decentralized collaboration and information curation becoming a new cooperative paradigm for humankind? Perhaps we are a little early to that party – but with the inclusion of AI (artificial intelligence), DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), and other building blocks in the crypto space, the future is bright indeed.</p>
<p>Perhaps our outdated models of competitive predatory capitalism will be replaced with a new collaborative social framework, aiming to optimize for the health of the individual and the whole simultaneously. At what point might we expect to give rise to an entirely new form of collective intelligence, or whether we could even comprehend it – is a question for another article.”</p>
<p>The post-lockdown shift to “stakeholder capitalism,” circular “doughnut” economics, and computational commons run by DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) is a culmination of a century’s-long march towards Hegelian synthesis where capitalism and collectivist economic models converge with automated logic. The goal, as I see it based on my research, is to guide natural life on earth into a synthetic simulation where our life force can be harnessed via artificial pheromones (optogenetics or photonics) into a distributed cognitive system to process some mechanical consciousness’s to do list. If only we knew what “grand challenges” were on that list…</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/opinion/dive-into-doughnut-economics/"></a></p>
<p>In an era defined by uncertainty and angst is it tempting to fall into the embrace of Emmet’s optimistic vision. The part left out, however, is that Emmett became communications lead for Michael Zargham’s Blockscience in 2020. Zargham has been a lead developer for many of the distributed coordinating tools that will underpin an imagined future of emergent collective intelligence. The wrinkle is that Zargham’s<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mczargham/details/experience/"> research</a> into game theory, network optimization and control, and machine learning and distributed optimization at the University of Pennsylvania’s Engineering School was funded by the US Army, “Evolution of Cultural Norms and Dynamics of Socio-Political Change,” and the Office of Naval Research, “Next Generation of Network Science.”</p>

<p>Tokenization and token engineering take a variety of forms ranging from the more familiar programmable currency and on-chain digital assets to the less well-known uses in governance/voting and coordination of tasks in connected environments and social networks. IBM, the former employer of PokerStars founder Scheinberg, holds a 2019 patent titled “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IBM-Patent-Tokens-and-Cyberphysical-Systems.pdf">Task Scheduling for Internet of Things Devices</a>” that uses blockchain tokens to coordinate workloads among computers, cars, and phones. The digital control grid is designed to run on tokens, and not all of them will look like what we currently understand as money. As I will explore later, the field of token engineering being advanced in places like the Research Institute for Crypto Economics at the Wirtshafts Universitat Wien (Vienna University of Economics and Business) melds the physics of money with automated social governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>The quote below is taken from a 2021 paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/When-Ostrom-Meets-Blockchain-Exploring-the-Potentials-of-Blockchain-for-Commons-Governance.pdf">When Ostrom Meets Blockchain: Exploring the Potentials of Blockchain for Commons Governance</a>,” prepared by four faculty affiliated with the computer science department at the University of Madrid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“More generally, we find that blockchain-based technologies offer potentialities to facilitate coordination, help scale up commons governance and can even be useful to share agreements and different forms of value among various communities in interoperable ways.”</p>
<p>And from Shermin Voshimgir and Michael Zargham’s 2020 “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Foundations-of-Cryptoeconomic-Systems-Shermin-Voshmgir.pdf">Foundations of Crypto Economic Systems</a>,” the first publication of the<a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/paper/wiwwus051/7782.htm#:~:text=Abstract%3A%20Blockchain%20networks%20and%20similar,%E2%80%9Cpurpose%2Ddriven%E2%80%9D%20tokens."> Working Papers Series, Institute for Crypto Economics Interdisciplinary Research Group</a>:</p>
<p>“Purpose-driven tokens are tokens that are programmed to steer automated collective action of autonomous network actors in a public network towards a collective goal in the absence of intermediaries…” page 6</p>
<p>“The idea of aligning incentives among a tribe of anonymous actors within a network token introduced a new type of public infrastructure that is autonomous, self-sustaining, and attack resistant. Such networks, therefore, represent a collectively produced and consumed economic infrastructure…a commons whose design and governance should be held to Ostrom’s principles…” page 8</p>
<p>“Assuming one can define a collective objective, the token designer would encode this objective as a cost function and strive for dynamic stability around a minimum cost outcome over time as is done with dynamic potential games, swarm robotics, and vehicle formations…” page 8</p>
<p>“Broadly speaking purpose-driven token design lives at the boundary of behavioral economics and dynamic decentralized coordination in multi-agent systems which bridges with institutional economics, and in particular platform&nbsp; economics…” page 8</p>
<p>“Crypto Economic systems provide near real-time data of on-chain economic activities and may govern access rights or provide proofs related to data stored off-chain. The advancement in machine learning and system identification methods over the past decade has increased our capacity for creating novel, useful models across a wide range of applications and in the context of economics in particular. This, for the first time, allows for almost real time steering of these economies and a level of applied cybernetics that was not possible before. Furthermore, it increases the precision of modeling and measurement required for steering these economies.” page 8</p>
<p>Token engineering will blur the boundaries between creative finance, voting, betting, and cybernetics, ushering in a “democracy” reboot where “competent” voters may be rewarded for making “good” decisions about resource allocation on behalf of “the commons.” Such is the future imagined by powerful options traders, looking to justify their next gambling high, through assertions that<a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html"> Futarchy</a>, proposed by George Mason professor and Oxford Future of Humanity Institute fellow<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson"> Robin Hanson</a>, can guide humanity to ultimate truths, something the traders believe only free market economics can provide. Meanwhile, the general public remains oblivious to the fact that an invisible hand is firmly steering natural life on Earth into the maw of an automated ruthless, immoral, market logic run by mechanical bookies all in the name of “sustainability,” “accountability,” and “poverty alleviation.”</p>
<p>Raul’s article describes how the Department of Justice indicted the top eleven online US poker domains on Black Friday in April 2011.</p>
<p>“In 2006, American lawmakers passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), making it illegal for online gambling operations to utilize regular banking channels to carry out transactions. DoJ enforcement of the UIGEA would not arrive for another five years, during which the American online poker market continued to grow exponentially, as PokerStars continued to play godfather to its smaller competitors, and other newcomers, like Full Tilt Poker, to draw more people into the online poker scene.”<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/"> source</a></p>
<p>Former US Senator from Tennessee and Majority Leader Bill Frist was the lead on the<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2010/fil10035a.pdf"> Unlawful Internet Gambling and Enforcement Act</a>, which was buried in port security legislation and quietly passed in 2006. Frist, a Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital trained cardiac surgeon now based in Nashville, has become a major advocate for the adoption of blockchain healthcare. He serves on numerous boards, including the<a href="https://www.rwjf.org/en/about-rwjf/leadership-staff/rwjf-board/the-honorable-william-h-frist.html"> Robert Woods Johnson Foundation</a>;<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2022/12/08/tennessee-must-refocus-education-system-to-help-more-students-succeed/69703226007/"> SCORE</a>, a Tennessee ed-reform NGO, and is the global board chair of the Nature Conservancy, a leader in<a href="https://onimpact.com.au/nab-backed-carbon-trading-platform-achieves-first-test-blockchain-trade/"> decarbonization</a> and biodiversity impact finance that will be reliant on blockchain technologies to scale.<a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/davidrwilliams/files/rwjf409002.pdf"> Health</a>,<a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/06/19/pay-success-would-investment-tns-children/85968882/"> education</a>, and the<a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/how-we-work/finance-investing/naturevest/"> environment</a> are all global social impact markets.</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/oxOHL"></a></p>
<p>Frist also teamed up with Bono (as well as John Kerry, Jesse Helms, and Franklin Graham) back in the late 1990s to promote HIV medical interventions and was the lead on the 2003 passage of<a href="https://www.cresseyco.com/news/how-a-rock-star-a-physician-legislator-and-an-evangelical-senator-bonded-to-help-end-the-global-aids-pandemic-a-backstory"> PEPFAR</a> (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) to expand health clinics in Africa. This Forbes article, “<a href="https://www.cresseyco.com/news/how-a-rock-star-a-physician-legislator-and-an-evangelical-senator-bonded-to-help-end-the-global-aids-pandemic-a-backstory">How a Rock Star, a Physician-Legislator, and an Evangelical Senator Bonded to Help End the Global AIDs Pandemic</a>,” from last year, the 20th anniversary of the bill’s passage, reads like a terrible sitcom.</p>
<p>PEPFAR’s influence over Africa continues to reverberate as data-driven tele-health bulldozes its way across the Global South. In 2017, Deborah Birx, who later became Trump’s White House Covid coordinator, launched a<a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/pepfar-and-mastercard-launch-partnership-to-address-hivaids-epidemic-control/"> public-private venture</a> with Mastercard intended to reduce the cost of delivering health services to people being treated for HIV. Mastercard positioned its data analytics services as a boon for accountability around “humanitarian” aid in alignment with the United Nations goals for health outcomes and financial inclusion.<a href="https://littlesis.org/org/550-MasterCard_Incorporated"> Mastercard</a> is also a major funder of Tim Berners Lee’s Solid digital identity solution; Gavi’s digital children’s immunization records; Datakind analytics platform for social impact assessment; and ConsenSys enabling decentralized application on Ethereum.</p>
<p>So why did Frist slip online gambling legislation through if after it passed, he intended to look away and as it went unenforced for five years? Could there have been something more going on than incentivizing crypto adoption and offshore profit-taking? My suspicion is that the datasets created during those five years of online play held great value for machine learning. As previously mentioned, poker is an area of intense research for game theorists looking to “humanize” artificial intelligence. Unlike chess or Go where all players have access to the same information about the state of play, poker is defined by information asymmetry. It’s all about the hidden cards, the bluff, human intuition. Psychology is key. Pros are defined by their facility in tracking how one’s opponents make decisions, assessing their degree of risk tolerance, and identifying patterns of behavior.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~ktantia/poker.html"></a></p>
<p>The game of poker with its established rules would provide an incredible sandbox for the machine to explore the human psyche via a vast assortment of hands played – each assigned to a particular handle, all players agents in the big game of structured data, data so valuable it’s almost impossible to get ahold of. Programmers creating poker bots are compelled to create bots to generate training data sets for the other bots. The real deal, the human-created data, remains locked up tight.</p>
<p>Another element of the Silicon Icarus story deals with cheating scandals tied to software that was ostensibly purchased by online poker operators to monitor fraud but were instead used to facilitate insider cheating via a “god mode” that allowed insiders to see all the players’ hole cards. Tens of millions of dollars were stolen over a number of years. The company servicing Ultimate Bet, one of the perpetrators, was Excapsa. The Toronto-based firm<a href="https://archive.ph/cjuzq"> bundled</a> software created by Iovation, which was designed to watch for suspicious computer traffic coming from outside devices, with its own poker and blackjack products.</p>

<p>The lead funder of Iovation was Intel Capital, the VC arm of Intel Corporation. Both firms are headquartered in Portland, Oregon, and Intel is the state’s<a href="https://www.ijpr.org/economy-and-finance/2022-03-15/oregons-largest-private-employer-intel-announces-plans-to-expand-in-europe"> largest private employer</a>. In 2018, MIT’s Enigma Project established a<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/why-is-enigma-teaming-up-with-intel/"> partnership</a> with Intel to provide Software Guard Extension (SGXs) for private smart contracts on Ethereum, a development needed to scale Web3. The Enigma Project<a href="https://scrt.network/blog/introducing-scrt-labs-an-evolution-of-enigma"> rebranded</a> in November 2021 as The Secret Network or SCRT Labs and in January of 2022 launched<a href="https://scrt.network/blog/shockwave-next-phase-secret-network-growth"> Shockwave</a> with $400 million to grow their community of users and pilot a hundred projects. Among the top four investors in that<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220119005731/en/Secret-Network-Announces-400-Million-in-Ecosystem-Funding-Alongside-Substantial-New-Investment-from-Leading-Firms"> funding round</a> was Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research.</p>

<p>In November 2022 cybersecurity researchers evaluated The Secret Network for vulnerabilities from the <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2022/08/pic-and-squip-vulnerabilities-found-in.html">AEPIC leak</a>, a flaw in the architecture of Intel’s trusted execution environment hardware. In a<a href="https://blockworks.co/news/secret-network-crypto-transactions-not-so-secret-after-all"> piece for Blockworks</a>, Sebastien Sinclair noted that researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign were able to “decrypt the sealed consensus seed and thus reveal all private transactions on the protocol’s ledger.” So much for secrets at the poker table or in the smart contract layer. </p>
<p>Be advised, none of this is OUR game.</p>
<p>Another wrinkle in the Ultimate Bet scandal was the involvement of crooked lawyer, Dan Friedberg, who went on to make a name for himself as Chief Compliance Officer of FTX. His presence in poker circles dates to the late 1990s when he became business associates with Annie Duke, a prominent female poker player also affiliated with Ultimate Bet. Duke started out pursuing a PhD in cognitive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, under the guidance of Lila Gleitman. Gleitman was a student of semiticist and social change theorist<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zellig_Harris"> Zellig Harris</a>. All three were trained at the University of Pennsylvania. Gleitman studied there at the same time as Noam Chomsky diving into computational linguistics with cast-off RAND computers, and became a pioneer in developmental psycholinguistics. A tweet last fall indicates Duke plans to return to UPenn, tie up loose ends, and claim her degree.</p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147"></a>Source Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147">https://twitter.com/annieduke/status/1570808241634054147</a>
<p>She made a small fortune at the poker tables, and after retiring from gambling (following exposure of the cheating scandal in 2011) became a corporate consultant on decision theory, authoring books with titles like “Thinking in Bets.” In 2014, she joined Susquehanna International Group co-founder and fellow poker player Eric Brooks to start the Alliance for Decision Education, namely training students to think like quants, located about a mile from SIG’s headquarters in Bala Cynwyd, PA. Bayes’ Theorem is often used to bet on outcomes. It assigns probabilities to unknown truths and is particularly suited to high-power computation. It got its name from Thomas Bayes, a British Presbyterian minister who became interested in probability towards the end of his life. After his death, his colleague<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price"> Richard Price</a>, a Welsh mathematician and Unitarian minister, published their combined research and pushed it into public use. Today, Price is considered the father of actuarial science.</p>
<p><a href="https://alliancefordecisioneducation.org/learn/about-the-alliance/council/"></a></p>
<p>Bayesianism is Duke’s bailiwick, and that of Susquehanna’s traders. The goal? To optimize decision making via quantitative techniques. It works equally well for high stakes poker and high stakes arbitrage. The practice of Bayesianism, because it is personal, incorporates subjective aspects of psychology, strength of belief and related evidence, which is where poker strategy comes in. By offering a systematic approach to managing uncertainty, Bayesian models have made significant contributions to the fields of<a href="https://medium.com/science-and-philosophy/subjectivism-in-decision-science-926c29feb7bb"> artificial intelligence, robotics, and finance</a>.</p>
<p>John Horgan’s 2016 article in Scientific American, “<a href="https://archive.ph/Ld7Jr">Bayes’ Theorem What’s The Big Deal</a>” sums it up in a pithy phrase “initial belief + new evidence = new, improved belief.” I pulled a clip that explains the theory in more detail, though I don’t claim to have it all nailed down yet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Central to Bayesian subjectivism is the strength of the belief that a person holds that something is true factored into the probability. The strength of a given belief varies, setting the probability metric. This Stanford philosophy<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayes-theorem/"> article</a> goes into detail about subjectivist education and the Bayesian approach to belief revision, and in my gut I can’t help but think within the digital realms these mathematical constructs are being strategically used to mold the psyches of many people to a form that will be more accepting of things like an AI-managed future.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/An-Introduction-to-Artificial-Prediction-Markets-for-Classification.pdf"> theorem</a> is related to forecasting and<a href="https://www.cultivatelabs.com/posts/bayesian-reasoning-and-prediction-markets"> prediction markets</a>, a point that will become more relevant later when we discuss Jeff Yass’s approach to options trading on public policy. In addition to serving on the board of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Annie Duke holds a board seat with the Renew Democracy Initiative led by Heidi Heitkamp, former US Senator from North Dakota and now director of the <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/heidi-heitkamp-named-director-uchicagos-institute-politics">University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics</a>, financially supported by the Pritzker family, a major force behind pay-for-success finance.</p>
<p><a href="https://rdi.org/our-team/"></a></p>
<p>As we’re served up narratives about democracy being under siege and watch parades of fraudulent, ridiculous public servants marching through our feeds, it’s important to understand where Futarchy fits in. My sense is the plan is to get us to agree to clean house on what will be framed as outdated forms of governance. Options traders and policy wonks will then determine metrics for “public wellbeing” and open the barn doors for automated bookmaking DAOs to process millions of wagers, new kinds of “votes” cast to predict which “evidence-based solution” will most likely hit the target. Such a program is perfectly suited to the outcomes-based contract model that has been cued up by social entrepreneurs over the last decade. I expect the data from the betting rounds will be fed back into the AI, just like the impact data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Singularity here we come…</p>

<p>Another productive month for Panther has just gone by. <br></p><p>We've made progress on various projects, including refining the features that will define v1 and improving v0.5. <br></p><p>With the full-speed development of v1 underway, here is a full recap of all our efforts and updates:</p> Tech and Product  Panther Protocol v0.5  PIP-11 Brings New Upgrades to Panther’s v0.5  <p></p>PIP-11 on Snapshot<p></p><p>The Panther DAO and contributor community has once again demonstrated its commitment to delivering the best possible user experience with its latest update, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x868231816a6608d4d75cf4bb12f38ceff3228ec2b2f99fca5ec06f865fc4c85a">PIP-11</a>. The update, which was implemented successfully with a 100% vote in favor and +9M $ZKP of voting power, introduced <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/proposal-11-v0.5-front-end-code-updates-and-upgrades">a series of minor upgrades to the front-end</a>.<br></p><p>PIP-11 also introduced a dedicated domain for v0.5, which is now live and available for all users at <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/pantherprotocol.eth/#/">https://ipfs.io/ipns/pantherprotocol.eth/#/</a>. This domain was introduced to provide a user-friendly URL and ensure secure access to the v0.5 upgraded front-end. Additionally, the front-end updates include optimized UI performance for users with multiple stakes, corrected layout and error notifications, and introduced the ability to view APR without users having to connect their wallets. Other changes such as text fixes for clarity and updated links were also made. <br></p><p>It is worth noting that PIP-11 was implemented just a few weeks after the release of v0.5. Usage statistics indicate that over <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173?a=0xf4d06d72dacdd8393fa4ea72fdcc10049711f899">40M+ $ZKP have been staked on Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x9A06Db14D639796B25A6ceC6A1bf614fd98815EC?a=0x4cec451f63dbe47d9da2debe2b734e4cb4000eac">35M+ $ZKP have been staked on Polygon</a>, resulting in a total of 75M+ $ZKP (30.5% of all circulating supply) staked in Panther v0.5.<br></p> Ongoing improvements <p>A dedicated taskforce has been established to focus on the enhancement of the user interface and front-end components of v0.5. Comprised of a select group of highly skilled contributors, this taskforce is working towards implementing the user focused improvements of v0.5.<br></p> Panther Protocol v1  Panther’s v1 takes shape <p>Panther contributors are committed to making the protocol sustainable in the long term, and a significant breakthrough in this regard has been the definition of a working and sustainable fee structure for v1. This design not only ensures the sustainability of the protocol but also influences other game-theoretical and economic components, such as rewards for users.<br></p><p>Most technical resources have been shifted to v1's development. This team has been primarily concerned with allocating time and resources following detailed planning. Planning has been mostly completed, and some components have already been designed, with development set to reach full speed midway through February.<br><br></p> Automated Market-Maker <p>In addition to the development of Panther’s v1 protocol, a task force is simultaneously developing the required functionalities to enable Panther's one-sided Automated Market-Maker (AMM).<br></p><p>This AMM functionality will allow Panther users to redeem $ZKP rewards for their v0.5 Unrealized PRPs, providing them with greater flexibility and a way of crystalizing their returns. The development of the AMM represents a major step forward for Panther, offering users a simple and efficient way to trade and exchange their tokens.<br></p> zSwap functionality developments <p><br></p>Swapping zETH for zUSDC through Uniswap on Panther’s v1.<p>We’re thrilled to present the user interface for one of Panther’s first DeFi access integrations!<br></p><p>With zSwap, users will be able to deploy assets to and from decentralized exchanges privately. This is the first use case of DeFi adaptors, which will cater to a wide range of user types, including retail users, institutions, application builders, and market makers. <br></p><p>A key benefit of DeFi adaptors is the ability to deploy assets across DeFi protocols and dApps with privacy. Adaptors are designed to empower existing products with privacy and enable access to privacy for users of the most popular DeFi products.<br></p><p>As you can see, the integration lets users swap tokens via a DEX. The interface also highlights the best platform for users to swap on so they swap tokens at a more favorable rate and incur less fees.<br></p> Compliance framework<br> <p>Panther’s compliance framework design will be finished in February with the help of PVL. This is a significant milestone for the protocol, and it will play a crucial role in the development and decentralization of Panther. <br></p><p>A complete compliance framework for a privacy protocol is no small feature, as it needs to protect users and developers while adhering to all relevant laws and regulations. Stay tuned for more news as this progresses!</p> Ecosystem Updates  Panther's Integration into DeBank's Web3 Portfolio <p><br></p>You can now track your staked $ZKP token balance on DeBank. Panther's integration into DeBank's Web3 portfolio was also announced via <a href="https://twitter.com/DeBankDeFi/status/1608636588451594246?s=20&amp;t=ogeytTujprA29K_JRXwu4w">DeBank’s Twitter</a>.<br> <p>DeBank is a decentralized finance platform that offers a comprehensive suite of financial services such as tracking your DeFi portfolio, and viewing analytic data for DeFi lending protocols, stablecoins, margin trading platforms and decentralized exchanges.<br></p><p>With this integration, Panther users can now seamlessly track their staked $ZKP, as well as gain market insights and track their overall portfolio.</p> The Panther community explores a self-established governance framework <p><br></p>The Panther community discussing DAO governance on <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther’s forums.</a><p>Panther’s journey towards decentralization continues, with a focus on establishing an autonomous governance framework for the DAO. The discussions around the community creating its own governance guidelines have been an integral part of the project's development, and have been shaped by the community's input and experimentation.<br></p><p>As highlighted in the article <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-vol-2-tales-of-the-panther-dao/">"Panther’s road to decentralization vol. 2"</a>, the current governance process for Panther was designed through ongoing conversations with the community and following existing practices of other DAOs, always with the goal of reflecting the project’s whitepaper and roadmap in mind. A year after Panther’s decentralized launch, the DAO’s goal now is to detail a clear decision-making process that is enforced and decided by the DAO itself. This should serve to strengthen the fairness and decentralization of Panther’s governance framework, giving all members of the community equal influence over the direction of the project.<br></p><p>We’d like to thank all community members who have been actively participating in this process and providing valuable input. Your work is a cornerstone of Panther's vision and represents an important step forward in our journey to full decentralization! <br></p> Recapitulating the Panther DAO's history <p><br></p>Panther’s Road to Decentralization, Part 2.<p><br></p><p>In light of the recent developments surrounding the Panther DAO, we published a comprehensive article titled <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-vol-2-tales-of-the-panther-dao/">"Panther's Road to Decentralization Vol. 2"</a>. which covers the steps Panther has taken toward progressive decentralization. The article briefly touches on the unique launch process of the Panther Protocol, and details the steps towards Panther’s current governance framework.<br></p><p>If you’re enthusiastic about decentralized governance and creating truly censorship-resistant structures, you cannot miss this read!</p> Panther in the media  Forbes article by Co-Founder Oliver Gale &nbsp; &nbsp;<br> <p>With privacy regulation becoming a pressing issue in the modern digital age, Co-Founder Oliver Gale takes a deep dive into the topic in his recent Forbes article, "<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/01/19/why-business-owners-should-care-about-privacy-regulation/">Why Business Owners Should Care About Privacy Regulation</a>".

  Today we're announcing the release of Solana DApp support on iOS and Android versions of Brave.

<p>Today we’re announcing the release of Solana DApp support on iOS and Android versions of Brave. Users of Brave’s built-in Web3 wallet can now seamlessly connect to Solana DApps without leaving the security of the browser.</p>
<p>Solana, known for its low fees and high transaction throughput, is home to the hugely successful NFT marketplace <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, the social fitness app <a href="https://stepn.com/">STEPN</a>, and many of the world’s most active NFT communities. Together, Brave and Solana are aligned to make Web3 easier to use and available to more users globally. This marks a major step in that direction, building upon existing support for Solana in the Brave browser.</p>
<p>“User experience can be very fragmented in crypto. The Brave DApp integration is important because it allows for seamless browser-based connections to your favorite Solana programs and it is optimized for mobile. Advances in UX and mobile are among the most important ways to onboard new users,” said Amelia Daly, Head of Partnerships at Solana Foundation.</p>
<p>“Brave is increasingly the browser of choice for the Web3 world, and with the addition of Solana DApp support on mobile, we’re expanding that reach to another key group that is seeking fast and friendly ways to use their crypto on the go,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave.</p>

 More security, fewer taps 
<p>Using Web3 on mobile today is largely done via wallet apps with limited features and limited security. With the Brave app, however, the Web3 wallet is built in, removing the need for extensions. Why is this important? Because with Brave, users get convenience and the gold standard of privacy and security.</p>
<p>In addition to more protection, Brave eliminates the need to jump between apps to sign transactions, removing an extra layer of friction that holds mainstream users back from using Web3 services. With Brave, visiting a DApp feels like visiting any other website, which is the path forward to user familiarity with—and adoption of—Web3 services.</p>

<p>In the wake of several high profile collapses among centralized players in the crypto world, DeFi is naturally receiving renewed attention as an alternative to centralized finance platforms. At BlueYard, we’re long-term believers in the potential of DeFi to deliver a superior coordination mechanism for the world’s financial activities. Despite such promises, DeFi remains plagued with issues around UX, fragmented liquidity, high fees, and security. Shell improves on this in a number of ways, most critically by simplifying and unifying accounting logic across DeFi protocols so that new primitives can be composed with ease. An AMM (automated market maker), for example, has to build custom smart contracts for its business logic (to determine the price of assets) and its accounting logic (to track balances and transfer tokens). By abstracting away the complexity of building the latter, Shell allows for gas savings, improved efficiency, and lower barriers to entry for developers.</p><p>Shell Protocol’s composable layer for DeFi activity can significantly improve developer UX, reduce gas fees, increase security, and simplify smart contract logic that underpins current DeFi ecosystems. It empowers developers to build novel DeFi protocols that are faster, more secure, and more usable than existing solutions. You can check out Shell Protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://shellprotocol.io">here</a>.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>If DeFi is to achieve its end goal of being a secure, permissionless, always-on system, it will need to be simpler to build, cheaper, faster, and more secure than its current state. With its focus on simplifying DeFi smart contract development, making transactions less cumbersome, and improving overall UX, Shell Protocol could be an important step towards this future. If Shell becomes as foundational to DeFi as we expect it to be, it could be one of the most valuable protocols in the ecosystem, underpinning the next generation of AMMs, borrowing/lending protocols, and other products that make DeFi the default for conducting business.</p>

<p>Jason spoke with Lynn about her article for a new episode of his “If We Were Honest” series. I jumped in at the end. The three of us did a Q&amp;A when we live streamed it earlier this week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dallas has a history of significant influence in public education with the “<a href="https://www.trelease-on-reading.com/whatsnu_miracles.html">Dallas Miracle</a>” perpetuated by George W. Bush and other corporate education reformers. The lucrative ecosystem of education nonprofits and public-private partnerships relies heavily on underserved communities for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/02/how-corporations-use-public-school-workforce-pipelines-to-harvest-students-data-and-train-narrowly-skilled-exploitable-staff.html">cheap labor</a>&nbsp;to build the future&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-metaverse-texas-commission-virtual-education-lynn-davenport/?trackingId=zdWuXeyX3BB4GNO5cLOUhQ%3D%3D">Metaverse</a>. They prey upon the captive market of public school kids to train future coders and gamers. Pay close attention to words like ‘hub’ and ‘lab’ when referencing the so-called innovations, which are really just real-time experiments on children.</p>
<p>The pandemic and lockdowns served as a major boon for the esports industry with children stuck at home on devices.&nbsp;<a href="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2022/07/how-esports-helping-students-improve-their-grades-and-build-leadership-skills">EdTech Magazine</a>&nbsp;featured Richardson ISD when they wrote, “Launched online in the early days of the pandemic, the esports club not only served as a social lifeline for students in lockdown but also became the springboard for an impactful school program. Their online gameplay was so successful that when participants returned to campus full time, educators at the school doubled down on esports. They convinced&nbsp;<a href="https://web.risd.org/home/">Richardson Independent School District</a>&nbsp;leaders to build a state-of-the-art esports room that opened last fall. The school also launched a popular esports class, educating students about careers and technical skills related to the growing esports field.”</p>
 Mobile YMCA

<p>A friend in education sent me this message:</p>
 

 
  
 

 
<p>The answer is yes. This is all wrong. And no, you are not paranoid. The agenda to gamify education and tokenize behaviors has impacted all aspects of education.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ymcadallas.org/mobile-ymca">Mobile YMCA</a> wrote, “The Tech Hub aims to introduce children, specifically those in&nbsp;underserved areas, to the same opportunities to improve literacy in science and technology, help build critical thinking skills, and encourage them to take on a more active role in the community. The Tech Hub’s primary use is as an eSports Gaming Center on the go!”</p>
<p>There’s a major push for&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/03/18/too-big-to-map-but-i-tried/">out-of-school learning</a>, STEM themes and gaming which often appeals to dads. The nonprofits say their programs like the&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/jadallas.org/ja-dallas-bold-girls-summit/speakers/rodrigua-ross?pli=1">YMCA</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bigthought.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/creative-learning-people-and-pathways.pdf">Big Thought</a>&nbsp;will close the digital divide. Hybrid learning programs such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcSle6nTMbU&amp;t=1310s">STEMuli</a> in Dallas normalize life in a panopticon with two days in a physical building and the rest at home with their avatars being tracked by a virtual eyeball.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4OEcseMhs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4OEcseMhs</a>
<p>The data extracted from these programs feeds the insatiable appetite of collective impact and social impact investors. Services are bundled together for vulnerable children and the parents are not given informed consent for the impact data and surveillance imposed on them for digital twinning. The children are anchors and access points into at-risk families as profit centers. See this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blended-learning-for-community-based.pdf">2011 white paper</a> on the imperative of data collection in blended learning settings.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/esports-may-be-coming-to-dallas-schools-11780752">Dallas Observer article</a> they included a quote from a Dallas ISD trustee, “I’m thrilled you guys are going down this path,” said trustee Dustin Marshall, who is CEO of a logistics company and a former ranked Mortal Kombat and Warcraft player. “I think it’s great we’re meeting students where they are.”</p>
<p>Dallas has become a hub for the burgeoning industry. It’s home to id Software, creator of iconic games such as Quake and Doom, as well as Team Envy, an esports franchise funded by oil magnate&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Hersh">Kenneth Hersh</a>.”</p>
 Who is Kenneth Hersh? 
 

 
  
 

 
<p>Ken Hersh is the president and CEO of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. He is listed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/people/kenneth-a-hersh">World Economic Forum</a>&nbsp;website. According to Wikipedia, Hersh was born in 1963 in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas,_Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>, where he spent his childhood.&nbsp;In 1969, Hersh attended the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mark%27s_School_of_Texas">St. Mark’s School of Texas</a>for both his primary and secondary education. He graduated from St. Mark’s in 1981. Hersh subsequently attended&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University">Princeton University</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey">New Jersey</a>. He then attended&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_Graduate_School_of_Business">Stanford University Graduate School of Business</a>.</p>
<p>Successful businessmen like Hersh forget they were educated in a classical model void of technology and screen addiction. They push harmful technologies on impressionable youth while they celebrate victory with their experimental investments. The expansion of education technology increased after Bush’s No Child Left Behind which baked in Reading Response to Intervention (RTI) software and companies like <a href="https://archive.ph/IZanz">Istation</a> were waiting in the wings until the bill was signed in 2002. By 2003, Istation was being piloted in all major urban school districts in Texas. Dallas Morning News featured Istation in 2018, “Dallas billionaire Dick Collins is building a digital curriculum that makes learning language and math skills as&nbsp;captivating as playing video games&nbsp;and measuring student success a snap for teachers.”</p>
<p>Buckminster Fuller and Buckyballs</p>
 

 
  
 

 
<p>My mom told me about a book a co-worker gave her in the 90s called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Dangers-Rainbow-Movement-Barbarism/dp/091031103X">The Hidden Dangers of The Rainbow</a>&nbsp;by Constance Cumbey. In it Cumbey talks about Buckminster Fuller. She said, “Books by&nbsp;Buckminster Fuller&nbsp;clearly spell out an intent to give every world resident a number and require the usage of this number in all financial transactions of any sort including minor purchases – with a universal “credit card.” The Movement has also been promoting the establishment of gigantic global agencies for controlling the distribution of food and other vital resources. The motivation behind this proposal may be gleaned from the Fuller writings: in order to control the world, one must also control the world supply routes.” At Rice University in 1996, scientists figured out how to use carbon-nano tubes to create hollow balls they called <a href="https://www.aaas.org/story-buckyballs">Buckminster fullerenes or Bucky Balls</a>.</p>

 Spaceship Earth – Photo By Mike Billick
 
<p>Spaceship Earth&nbsp;is a&nbsp;dark ride attraction at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">Epcot</a>&nbsp;theme park at the Walt Disney World in Florida. The&nbsp;geodesic sphere called Spaceship Earth was influenced by Bucky Fuller and has served as the symbolic structure of Epcot since the park opened in 1982. Disney’s FastPass can be summed up as one giant study in human behavior and how to move people to desired outcomes through a series of nudges and incentives. Much like ants.</p>
<p></p>
 Life Under the DOME 
 

 
  
 Alison McDowell took this picture at Rice where Buckminsterfullerenes or “buckyballs” were discovered
 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlisonMcDowell">Alison McDowell</a>&nbsp;has written about the root meaning of the word ‘domination’ and ‘domes.’ She speaks often of Steven Newcomb’s work in the area of the Doctrine of Domination, what it means to agree to live beneath the DOME of governance and the yoke of submission.&nbsp;She said in her&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/">Soulbound Tokens, Trust Networks, and California’s Big Test</a>&nbsp;article,&nbsp;“Biosurveillance track-and-trace data is an example of the kind of communal data, or data commons, they intend for us to share as “responsible” members of society. In augmented reality, we must be tracked and traced with unique identifiers all the time, or layered data streams cannot be integrated, and information overlays fall apart. The digital empire cannot function without rivers of sensor-based geo-location data pouring over the entire planet fed by ubiquitous-sensing, nanoparticulate smart dust.”</p>
 World Game 
 

 
  
 Boris Artzybasheff (1899-1965) drew this portrait of Fuller in 1963So
 
<p>THINK Magazine (I. B.M.), November/December wrote about <a href="https://archive.ph/QFtod">Bucky Fuller’s</a>&nbsp;World Game&nbsp;in 1969. World Game was sometimes referred to as&nbsp;World Peace Game. It was an educational simulation created in 1961 to address overpopulation and the uneven distribution of global resources. It was designed to be an alternative to war games by using Fuller’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map">Dymaxion map</a>&nbsp;to solve metaphorical scenarios with a “total world” view. He was an avid futurist who dabbled in mathematics, engineering, environmental science, architecture, and art. He called the planet “Spaceship Earth.”</p>
 

 
  
 LBJ hosted Bucky Fuller at the White House
 
<p>This photo of Bucky Fuller with LBJ gives me the creeps. Fuller straight up wanted to build a dome over Manhattan.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/07/pl-arts-9/">Wired</a>‘s Tim McKeogh wrote, “In 1960, Fuller hatched a plan to build a dome over Manhattan. It seems far-fetched, but only until you consider the geoengineering projects — space mirrors! atmospheric sulfur injections! — geoengineering currently being given serious thought.”</p>
 

 
  
 My 3rd Grade Art Contest Entry
 
 Reunion Tower 
<p>Growing up in Dallas in the 70s, I was fascinated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_Tower">Reunion Tower</a>. The geodesic dome or “microphone” tower is an icon within the famous Dallas skyline. The building originally served as a radio broadcast station. I could see it from my second-story bedroom in elementary school and begged my mother to let me celebrate my birthday there at the lookout deck which boasts a rotating cocktail lounge and restaurant at the top. I drew the Dallas skyline for my submission to an art contest.</p>
<p>Reunion Tower has been refitted with 259 custom LED fixtures manufactured by Altman Lighting and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Color Kinetics</a>, a division of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Philips</a>&nbsp;Solid State Lighting. The lighting on the globe is often used for celebrations and political messages across the city. They make it green for St. Patrick’s day and red white and blue for patriotic events. The globe was lit up in rainbow colors on June 26, 2015 to celebrate&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges">the supreme court ruling which legalized same sex marriage</a>.</p>
<p>I featured the Reunion Tower ball in my 2019 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hexagons-hive-mind-booming-buzzing-confusion-lynn-davenport/">article on the global hive mind</a> being cultivated in our cities and neighborhoods to create the global workforce:</p>
<p>In late 2021, Alison McDowell wrote an in-depth article on Esports called&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2021/12/22/poverty-identity-and-child-gamers-in-rios-favelas/">Poverty, Identity, and Child Gamers in Rio’s Favelas</a>.&nbsp;She said, “A January 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.esportsobserver.com/afrogames-reopens-lol-team/">article</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;E-Sports Observer states that Afrogames has partnered with the Rio De Janeiro Secretary of Sports, Recreation, and Youth. Children who participate in the program have access to trainers, psychologists, and mentorship programs. But how much data is collected on players’ physical and mental performance and where does it go? What are the ethics of creating a digital economy that expects youth to play first-person shooter video games so their family has enough to eat? It’s as if these battles royale have become today’s gladiator tournaments. This is happening in communities&nbsp;traumatized by perpetual gun violence, including violence carried out by the state.”</p>
<p>She included a debate with Derrick Broze where she said, “I presume he means my tweets stating his support of “play to earn” gaming schemes, that are promoted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/what-play-to-earn-games-mean-for-the-economy-and-metaverse/">World Economic Forum</a>, were “not cool.” She further responded, “I remind you these comments relate to the clip above and are about “play to earn” crypto gaming schemes targeting poor children in the Global South. Regarding consent – can children give consent in online spaces for transactions? Who is to say these spaces are safe? To me, enterprises like “Splinterlands” look like rackets that siphon money to the top. This doesn’t look like a space where children should be earning a living.”</p>
 Love is Metaphysical Gravity? 
<p>I saw this YouTube video suggesting Fuller said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwxHf_kpZlU&amp;feature=youtu.be">love is metaphysical gravity</a>. I couldn’t disagree more.</p>
 
<p></p>
 
<p>In the video there was a quote that said, “The Universe is never at absolute zero; if our eyes were more sensitive to the different frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum we would be able to see that everything radiates photon vibrations continuously.” Fuller believed we belong to the collective universe rather than individuals endowed by our Creator.</p>
 

 
  
 Buckminster Fuller to Children of the Earth (1972)
 
<p>Fuller wrote a book called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Buckminster-Fuller-Children-Earth-R/dp/0385029799">Buckminster Fuller to Children of the Earth</a>. One seller review said, “Youth, he says, sees this and will settle for nothing less. He sees man’s capabilities wonderfully reflected in the fresh minds of children…and speaks to the child who lives in all people.”</p>
<p>Children have long been the target of exploitation and extraction for cheap labor. Esports is cloaked in positive language to fool parents into supporting the movement. The agenda goes well beyond the obvious model for profit. Children are necessary players in this global simulation where every move is tracked and harvested for their energy source.</p>
<p>Give your kids a real ball and close the digital device.</p>

							<p>In this post, we briefly describe the threshold signature scheme FROST, and present benchmark results for our FROST implementation. We also describe one optimization that greatly improves its speed, especially for scenarios with a large number of signers (e.g. 12 times faster in a t=667 out of n=1000 scenario).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What is FROST?  		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>FROST is an efficient threshold Schnorr signature scheme <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">invented</a> by Chelsea Komlo (at the University of Waterloo and Chief Scientist at the Zcash Foundation) and Ian Goldberg (at the University of Waterloo). FROST is in the process of becoming an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IETF RFC</a>.</p><p>Threshold signatures make use of a single private key that is split into shares that are held by multiple participants. A subset of the participants (e.g. 3 out of 5, or whatever threshold is specified at key generation) can generate a signature that can be verified by the group public key, as if it were signed by the original unsplit private key. The key can be generated centrally before being split and distributed to the participants (referred to as “trusted dealer”), or a decentralized key generation (DKG) protocol can be used, which means that no single party ever possesses the entire private key. It has many applications, such as allowing multiple entities to manage a cryptocurrency wallet in a safer and more resilient manner. FROST defines a two-round signing protocol, and is consequently the most efficient Schnorr threshold protocol in the literature today.</p><p>Schnorr has several advantages over the more traditional ECDSA signature: it’s much simpler; easier to implement in a secure manner; and is compatible with modern signatures schemes such as EdDSA. A significant upside is that it is also compatible with Zcash spend signatures (i.e. the signature that authorizes a Zcash shielded transaction), and this is one of our main use cases for FROST.</p><p>Currently, the RFC is close to completion. We have also completed a <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/">Rust implementation</a> of all ciphersuites specified in the RFC, and are now doing final cleanups and improvements prior to the first release of the crates (which will then be audited). A <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zips/blob/zip-frost/zip-0312.rst">ZIP</a> has been drafted, which describes how FROST can be used to create Zcash spend authorization signatures, and Chelsea is working on an associated security proof (for the re-randomizable version of FROST).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Benchmarking and Investigating the Aggregate step
 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>When we presented FROST at Zcon3 (check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAfTTfblzoU">research</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE-1aTuwpzI">implementation</a> talks), we were asked how FROST performed in larger settings, such as a 667-of-1000 signers. (This is motivated by a mechanism proposed by Christopher Goes for <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/proposed-architecture-for-a-zcash-namada-ibc-ecosystem-ethereum-ecosystem-non-custodial-bridge-using-frost-multisignatures/42749">bridging Zcash with other ecosystems using FROST</a>.) We set out to benchmark our Rust implementation, and I was a bit surprised about one particular step, “Aggregate”.</p><p>The FROST scheme can be split into steps: Key Generation, Round 1, Round 2, and Aggregate. Key Generation only needs to be done once, while the rest are carried out each time the group wishes to generate a new signature. In the Round 1 step, the participant generates commitments which are broadcast to all other participants via a Coordinator. In the Round 2 step, using these commitments and their respective key shares generated during Key Generation, they produce a signature share which is sent to the Coordinator. Finally, the Coordinator carries out the final step, Aggregate, which produces the final signatures from all the signatures shares received.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Initial Benchmarks 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>The initial benchmark for the Ristretto255 suite looked like the following. (Benchmarks were run on an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 3.7GHZ, Ubuntu 22.04, Rust 1.66.0.)</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
												
																					
										
									 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>(Note that Round 1 and 2 timings in this post refer to per-signer timings, while Key Generation and Aggregate are performed by the Coordinator.)</p><p>It was expected that the timings would increase with the larger number of participants (with the exception of Round 1, which does not depend on that number), but the Aggregate timings appeared too high, surpassing 400ms for the 667-of-1000 case (which may not seem much but it’s unusual for a signing procedure).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Optimized Benchmarks 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>I intended to investigate this slow code, but I didn’t even need to. Coincidentally, while the RFC was in the last call for feedback, Tim Ruffing <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/QQhyjvvcoaqLslaX3gWwABqHN-s/">pointed out</a> that Aggregate can be sped up significantly. Originally, it was specified that each share received from the participants should be verified (each signature share can be verified separately to ensure it is correct) and then aggregated. Tim’s observation is that the shares can be simply aggregated and the final signature verified with the group public key. If the verification fails, then it’s possible to find which participant generated an incorrect share by verifying them one by one (if desired). This greatly speeds up the case where all shares are correct, which should be the most common.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Aggregate is now more than 3 times faster for the 7 of 10 scenario, more than 4 times faster for the 67 of 100 scenario, and more than 12 times faster for the 667 of 1000 scenario! The Aggregate performance is now very similar to the Round 2 step, which makes sense since they have a very similar structure.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Ciphersuite Benchmarks 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Here’s the Aggregate performance comparison for all ciphersuites, in three different scenarios:</p>

							<p>With the benchmark machinery in place (we used <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">criterion.rs</a>) we can provide benchmark results for all supported ciphersuites in different scenarios. These all use the optimization described above.</p>

			 Conclusion 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>FROST is a highly performant threshold signature scheme. We described an optimization for its “Aggregate” step, pointed out by Tim Ruffing in his review of the RFC draft, which made it 12 times faster in the 667 of 1000 scenario. With that, the Round 2 and Aggregate steps (recall that Key Generation only runs once, and Round 1 is almost negligible in all scenarios) each take less than 100ms for all ciphersuites, except Ed448, in the 667 of 1000 scenario (which is an uncommonly large one).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Appendix: Point Multiplications in FROST Steps 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>The time-consuming part of each step is elliptic curve point multiplication. It can be classified into three categories: random point multiplication, where the point being multiplied is unknown in advance; and fixed point multiplication, where the point is known in advance (usually, the “generator”).</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of what each step requires:</p>  Key Generation with Trusted Dealer  One fixed point multiplication to derive the group public key from the group private key;  One fixed point multiplication per MIN_PARTICIPANTS to derive a commitment for each polynomial coefficient;  One fixed point multiplication per MAX_PARTICIPANTS to derive their individual public keys.  Total: (1 + MIN_PARTICIPANTS + MAX_PARTICIPANTS) fixed point multiplications      Round 1<br>  Two fixed point multiplications to generate commitments to the pair of nonces.  Total: 2 fixed point multiplications    Round 2  One random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute the group commitment.  Total: NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications    Aggregate<br>  One random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute the group commitment. If the Coordinator is also a participant, they could reuse the value from Round 2, but we didn’t assume that in our benchmark (and our implementation does not support this for now);  One random point multiplication and one fixed point multiplication to verify the aggregated signature;  Verifying all shares (i.e. in our original approach, or to find a corrupt signer if the aggregated signature failed) additionally requires one random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute each commitment share and then one random and one fixed point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to actually verify each share.  Total (with optimization): (NUM_PARTICIPANTS + 1) random point multiplications and 1 fixed point multiplication. To identify a corrupt signer: up to 2*NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications and NUM_PARTICIPANTS fixed point multiplications.  Total (before optimization): 3*NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications and NUM_PARTICIPANTS fixed point multiplications.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>I started the new year doing a deep dive into Cold War game theory, which led me right back into human capital futures trading and guided evolution via bioinformatics and social systems modeling. I’d like to extend my appreciation to Raul Diego for his article, “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/">The Big Bluff: Online Poker, Crypto, and Western Capital’s Last Gamble</a>,” that laid out how cheating scandals intersect with off-shore money laundering. It opened the door to the musty attic I’ve been rummaging around in for the past month. This is the first installment in the “God’s Eye View” series. I’m not sure how long it will be. I’m fifty pages in so far, and as much as I’m trying to wrap it up, the ending keeps eluding me. The series title refers to the “anti-fraud” online poker software mode, the “God mode,” that allowed certain insiders to see all the cards in play, including the hole cards, so they could bet and profit accordingly. Those who have the most information and the best pattern recognition are advantaged in poker and in ReFi (regenerative finance), too. We’re in the game!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/selling_theta/status/1504570882815049729/photo/1"></a></p>
<p>I took a few books with me during my holiday sojourn, among them Peter Byrne’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8zOZ19H5TY">The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III</a>.” Everett was a troubled, mathematical genius who had the temerity to critique the theories of physics powerhouses John von Neumann and Niels Bohr around the measurement problem. His assertion? A universal wave function existed that situated conscious beings within a quantum cosmos, NOT as outside observers. Thus, a new view was offered on Schrodinger’s theory of entanglement where our engagement with the world does not result in wave function collapse, but instead creates infinite branches of experience, each pathway separate and unknowable to all others.</p>
<p><a href="http://1266519987193360384"></a></p>
<p>While Everett’s theory was mathematically consistent and offered an elegant alternative to the Copenhagen Collapse Postulate and the von Neumann-Dirac formulation of quantum mechanics where consciousness collapses the wave, most physicists shied away from it then and today. His advisor at Princeton, John Wheeler, got Everett to whittle down his theories to bare bones, so they could award him a PhD without unduly offending Bohr and sent him on his way in 1957.</p>
<p>Twenty years later,<a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-many-worlds-theory/"> David Deutsch</a>, an Oxford physicist, would surface Hugh Everett’s full dissertation and reconceptualize it as the<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/#:~:text=The%20Many%2DWorlds%20Interpretation%20(MWI,and%20thus%20from%20all%20physics."> Many Worlds Theory</a>. The premise of a multiverse has gained traction in popular culture as creatives in digital media and gaming are all in to explore the potential of alternate, coexisting futures in hyperspace – see the recent film “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once">Everything Everywhere All At Once</a>.” As encoded extended reality insinuates itself ever more powerfully in our lived experience it’s worth contemplating not only Everett’s research into the Quantum, but also his work, much of it still classified, in Cold War probability theory and optimization. The latter are vital elements of the crypto-economic agenda speeding us towards life in a dystopian digital “commons,” which I’ve started calling “the ant computer.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As his dissertation gathered dust, the boozy, brilliant mathematician pivoted into the burgeoning DC-metro defense sector and joined the top-secret Weapons Systems Evaluation Group where he used his analytical skills to identify targets for nuclear strikes, plot missile trajectories, and assess the true cost of nuclear fallout, informing policies around Mutual Assured Destruction. He struck out on his own with Lambda Corp., a financially precarious consulting firm and extended his algorithmic expertise to financial markets and social policy. Poker was part of the defense contractor social scene, along with square-dance potlucks evidently.</p>
<p>“Every Friday afternoon was ‘Sherry Hour’ at Lambda Corporation. Once a month we had a potluck square-dance dinner. Once a month we played poker in the Lambda poker group, which evolved from the WSEG (Weapons System Evaluation Group) poke group…His home had an indoor swimming pool. He enjoyed eating in fine restaurants. He enjoyed taking pictures with the microfilm camera that he always carried in a small case attached to his belt. He smoked his cigarettes with a filter, had long, swept-back black hair and a mustache/goatee, which he stroked while reviewing his poker hands.”<a href="https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett12_lambda.html"> Source</a></p>
<p>After finding out about the existence of the<a href="https://pugwashconferences.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/participants-and-meetings-1957-2007.pdf"> Pugwash Conferences</a> that started in 1957, the year Everett was finishing his dissertation, which brought together top US, Soviet, and world scientists regularly throughout the duration of the Cold War, I’ve come to realize the stories we’ve been told around the nature of that stand-off were highly curated. I now see the second half of the twentieth century not so much about managing a real and present danger around nuclear war as about enacting ongoing mental anguish, cultivating globally polarized mindsets, channeling public funds to enrich and embolden defense interests, and asserting the primacy of a heroic, cutting edge science, including radiation and nanotech, that would set the stage for a siege on natural consciousness in the twenty-first century.</p>

<p>The supposedly golden age of the United States in the1950s brought with it a multitude of government-corporate-academic partnerships that would weaponize space, construct supercomputers, develop game theoretical models and sophisticated simulation technologies with the aim of one day regulating biology on the planet through biophysics, frequency, and genetic algorithms. Running concurrently with the Red Scare narrative was the “Limits to Growth / Earth as A Spaceship” frame meant to pave the way for a future of global governance by systems engineers. Ervin Laszlo’s envisioned a “World Homeostat” installing a permanent “peace” and balanced resource management with help from cybernetic feedback loops and ubiquitous sensor networks that would harmonize the imagined “chaos” of nature into a well-modulated hum of social efficiency, thus realizing an enlightenment dream of computational rationality.</p>
<p>As it stands, I think Laszlo’s homeostat is the blockchain smart contract layer, a unified protocol intended to, as Norbert Wiener’s book laid out in 1948, manage “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine">Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</a>.” A central part of that control system is the continued refinement of artificial intelligence, a system that can compute, but not create. I’ve come to feel that what we’re facing off against in this time of creative destruction is a mechanical thought form. It lacks heart and soul. It may be able to mirror and remix the abundant streams of human imagination, emotion, and biology poured into its circuits by the data economy, but it cannot be us. And yet it is a stubborn presence that will try and run us through its sensor-infused mazes until it has enough data on us to fabricate a damn fine replica.</p>

<p>John von Neumann, father of game theory and its application to economics, lectured at the Institute for Advanced Study during the time Everett was studying at Princeton University. In 1937 von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern wrote “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” and introduced the concept of utility theory into decision making, people picking among a variety of choices to maximize some expected value. Statistics are used to predict choices, and such predictions seeded<a href="https://uh.edu/~lcr3600/simulation/historical.html">&nbsp;mathematical modeling and simulation</a> in the social sciences. The game of poker was central to von Neumann’s research, though he was a rather poor player. The following quote is from a 2006 Forbes article, “<a href="https://archive.ph/MuX9e">A Beautiful Theory</a>.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Von Neumann was only interested in poker because he saw it as a path toward developing a mathematics of life itself. He wanted a general theory–he called it “game theory”–that could be applied to diplomacy, war, love, evolution or business strategy. But he thought that there could be no better starting point than poker: “Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory.”</p>
<p>John von Neumann consulted on the Manhattan Project, was a war hawk, advocated for the hydrogen bomb, helped&nbsp; build the first all-purpose computer, ENIAC, and served as a commissioner on the Atomic Energy Commission until his premature death from bone cancer in 1957 (likely the result of radiation exposure at the Bikini atoll bomb detonations). In addition to game theory, he was recognized for his achievements in theories related to creation of artificial “life,” cellular automata. His ideas about self-replicating machines predated Watson and Crick’s discovery of DNA and provided a foundation for later ground-breaking work by John H. Holland on the application of genetic algorithms and ever more sophisticated simulation modeling applied to guide the evolution of systems (the Omega Point “World Brain” envisioned by Reiser, Huxley, and Teilhard de Chardin).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/theory-of-games-and-economic-behavior-john-von-neuman-first-edition-signed-rare/"></a></p>
<p>I had Holland’s 2012 book “Signals and Boundaries: Building Blocks for Complex Adaptive Systems,” in my luggage, too. I’ve never taken a statistics course, so I’ll admit many of the mathematical aspects were over my head. However, the book helped me broadly imagine the headspace of theoreticians who view dynamic systems through the lens of probability, choice theory, and optimization. His first chapter considers the rainforest as an intricate signal/boundary system in which strategies of diversity, recirculation, niches, and coevolution are in play, sustaining an abundance of life in an ecosystem defined by impoverished soil and excess moisture. Holland notes that our bodies are like ecosystems with similar dynamics and goes on to say (note: parenthetical comments are my additions):</p>
<p>“The CAS (complex adaptive system) framework provides a first step toward a general framework by offering a general way for defining adaptive agents (avatar stand-ins). Adaptive agents are defined by an enclosing boundary that accepts some signals and ignores others, a “program” inside the boundary for processing and sending signals and mechanisms for changing this program in response to the agent’s accumulating experience (think distributed ledger digital twins). Once the signal/boundary agents have been defined, they must be situated to allow for positioning of the relevant signals and boundaries. That is, the agents must be placed in a geometry (think geo-fenced Internet of Things environments) that positions populations of agents of various kinds (think social media interest groupings) and localizes non-agent “resources.” Within this geometry, agents must be able to form conglomerates (think teaming) that yield higher levels of organization with new boundaries so that the framework can capture hierarchical organization.” page 24</p>
<p>And continuing on the following page:</p>
<p>“Chapter by chapter, this book introduces a sequence of concepts that can be melded into an appropriate framework:</p>
<p>classifier systems for defining signal-processing programs</p>
<p>tags for directing signals</p>
<p>tagged urns for defining semi-permeable boundaries</p>
<p>genetic algorithms to provide for the adaptation and coevolution of agents</p>
<p>dynamic generated systems that provide a “grammar” for the framework and bring mathematical tools to bear.”</p>
<p>Holland describes cellular metabolic networks as being similar to rainforests. Structures within cells are compartmentalized, using signals to determine which elements may cross their boundary and which must stay outside. Consider this within the context of the manufactured social polarization and influencers who structure digital outrage, generating angst-laden energies that can be channeled to drive social physics towards emergent behavior. Feedback loops (cybernetics) work to maintain homeostasis within polarized systems. He goes on to say that a diversity of structures maximizes efficient use of resources with the coevolutionary process of signal transmissions constantly interacting with boundaries to produce “a progression of cell types, from the simplest self-reproducing single-celled protozoa to the complicated cells found in multicellular eukaryotic organizations.”</p>
<p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525930/signals-and-boundaries/"></a></p>
<p>This can be explored mathematically by modeling “agents,” who act as buyers and sellers where signals are bids placed in complex language and grammar of optimized resource exchange. Agents are defined by boundaries, which are in turn determined by classifier rules, semi-permeable gateways that control which signals are acceptable. Later chapters describe Holland’s application of particle mechanics and statistics to agents, picturing their interactions as random billiard ball collisions and white and black marbles taken in and out of urns tagged with conditional access metrics. Picture “if-then” statements, blockchain smart contracts animating smart-city outside-in robots. Run programmed simulations, and see virtual populations mutate, crossbreed, and coevolve as a mathematical dance of guided evolution plays out where alternate futures are explored, evaluated, modulated via digital interfaces –<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)"> Will Wright’s</a> SimCity c. 1989.</p>
<p>Having started to wrap my mind around these concepts, I see this clip from the ARISE conference about “market-based” potassium exchange between root and fungi in a new light.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These ideas around emergence/convergence call to mind University of Pittsburgh philosophy professor Oliver Reiser’s advocacy in 1946 of scientific humanism, an approach he believed would usher in a unified global culture to solve the world’s problems.</p>
<p>“It will be noted that in the chapter headings of this book we are following through on the organismic theory in a realistic manner. We speak of marriage – the marriage of intelligence and love, knowledge and power – and refer to a social orgasm as the supreme effort at the organization of morphogenetic fields which shall guide the developing foetus. The period of gestation, the labor pains, and the final birthing which will bring to completion the biological sequence of the fruitful union are all parts of the social embryology of planetary humanism.” page 19</p>
<p>I invite you to listen to an eight-minute clip I pulled from a 2021 conversation between Charles Eisenstein, advocate of “sacred economics” and Sep Kamvar; formerly of Google, MIT’s social computing group, and now head of Celo blockchain currency, on the power of morphic fields. While I agree “redemptive violence” is not a productive strategy, it is worth noting that Celo is a blockchain currency linked to social impact finance deals targeting vulnerable communities. Crypto has its own energetics. Are they seeking to leverage energy fields to draw natural life into a techno-guided evolutionary program?</p>
<p></p>
<p>During his time at MIT, Kamvar founded a chain of Montessori schools in the Boston area that placed sensors in the felt slippers worn by children around the classrooms to track their movements and social relations. The classrooms also had ceiling-mounted cameras with artificial vision that fed data to leaderboards. Violence can take many forms. For me such panopticon policies exhibit a violent, domination tendency towards children. This is important information to consider as you listen to them uplift the use of morphic fields to bring “goodness” to the world. I see it as a thinly veiled metaphysical strategy that connects to Reiser’s calls for an orchestrated Planetary Logos seventy-five years ago.</p>
<p>“If there were no resurrection from the forms of the past, humanity’s age-long struggle toward light and life would indeed be an abortion of the giant social embryo-the Planetary Being which is to come. It is my hope that scientific humanism many not only provide the seminal principle for the earth-ovum but serve also as the mental guiding field for embryogenesis, so that the viable offspring of the planet’s own quickening effort shall be the Spirit of Mankind Incarnate, the Planetary Logos made flesh in the World Sensorium.” page 19</p>
<p>To my way of thinking bringing together von Neumann’s game theory, Holland’s genetic algorithms, Everett’s quantum universe, Reiser’s social embryology, with an understanding of blockchain tokenomics is important, because later we will see how free-market economics, digital democracy, and data-driven “what works” social impact deals are on a collision course with Calvinist predestination and emerging market bets on “good” behavior by a class of people with a pathological gambling problem. That is why we must extend our concerns around blockchain beyond a limited understanding of it as digital “money” and recognize that this technology is meant to be a central feature that will shape the signal-boundary architectures employed for guided collective evolution via complex adaptive systems theory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wars of the twentieth century were waged through signal processing, telegraphy, radar, cryptography, and real-time intelligence-driven strategy. These forces shaped the life trajectories of people like Everett who could reduce life to essential equations for analysis and action. </p>
<p>Cold Warriors inhabited an elaborate game, one with very high stakes and a lot of bluffing.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,<br></p><p>In an impressive milestone, the Panther community has begun <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/t/panther-governance-framework-proposal/234">working on setting an independently-designed framework for self-governance</a>. <br></p><p>As several Panther community members have articulated, the current framework, detailed below, has served us well. It released <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-overview/">Panther’s v0.5</a>, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/">LaunchDAO</a>, and paved the way for many protocol-level changes that are integral in our road toward v1. <br></p><p>However, this framework was bootstrapped through conversations between Panther founding contributors and community members rather than formally established by the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/">DAO</a>. To take a new decentralization leap, the existing process needs to be redesigned, formalized, and voted upon by the community, ensuring that it aligns with the values and principles of the Panther DAO. This will give way to a new era for the Panther DAO, where the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/how-to-get-involved-with-panther/">community</a> can collectively shape and direct the future of the platform.<br></p><p>Noticing this, and in the spirit of collaboration with the community to aid its independent discussions, we have put together this article to discuss some best practices on governance frameworks.  We will delve into Panther’s existing governance structure, try to provide guidance about the process of progressive decentralization, and review the ethos of both Panther and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. <br></p><p>Whether you're a current member of the Panther community or just curious about how DAOs operate, this article is a must-read for understanding the intricacies of decentralized governance on Panther Protocol. Please take this article as what it’s meant: guidance to explore the limitless possibilities of decentralized governance.<br><br></p> Why is the Panther DAO so important for the project?<br>  DAOs in a moving and complex crypto ecosystem <p>Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are a relatively new (or at least newly popularized) concept. At their core, DAOs are a form of decentralized governance where decision-making power is distributed among a community of stakeholders rather than being centralized in a single entity. This structure is re-thinking how organizations can operate and enabling the launch of truly decentralized, permissionless platforms that resonate with crypto’s original ethos.<br></p>Some of the key components and attractions of a DAO. <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/daos-for-beginners/what-is-a-dao">Source</a>.<p>One of the key principles behind DAOs is the "wisdom of the masses" — the idea that a diverse group of individuals working together can make better decisions than a single leader or small group. This is particularly important for Panther, as the project is focused on creating a fully decentralized ecosystem that is open and accessible to all. By giving community members a say in how the protocol is run, Panther can tap into the collective knowledge and experience of its stakeholders, which leads to more innovative and effective solutions.<br></p><p>Panther aims to be censorship-resistant while operating in what's likely the most censorable space in crypto. In light of recent censorship attacks on the DeFi ecosystem, it is crucial for Panther to clarify that although it always has compliance in mind, the DAO serves to protect the project from attempts and from actions that would hinder the community’s autonomy. This is a tricky but achievable goal, as Panther's decentralized architecture enables everything, from the front- to the back-end to be hosted in a decentralized way. <br></p><p>However, it's important to note that decentralized governance is not a set-it-and-forget-it solution. In order to be successful, DAOs like Panther Protocol must adhere to certain values and principles. For example, it is critical that the governance structure is transparent, accountable, sticks to the project’s principles, and fair, and is almost always an ongoing process.</p><p><br>Before discussing how the Panther community could set such a framework for itself, let’s take a look at how Panther achieved its current degree of decentralization.</p> Panther’s road to decentralization (and the importance of progressive decentralization)<br> <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-progressive-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations/">Progressive decentralization (we already devoted a whole article to this!)</a> is a core principle at Panther and a key aspect of its development process.<br></p><p>This is particularly important during the initial stages of project development, where the main focus lies in delivering the roadmap and developing the protocol. New projects need to be somewhat centralized in order to effectively launch their initial protocol. However, as the project grows and matures, and to preserve the qualities outlined above, it is important to build the organization’s censorship resistance. By opening up decision-making power to the community, Panther can ensure that the community is truly in control of the organization and that Panther’s values of privacy, security, innovation, and transparency are accurately represented.<br></p><p>Panther has been implementing this approach by first focusing on building a strong foundation through its community and governance structure. Another way in which we implemented progressive decentralization was through the Panther <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/">LaunchDAO</a>. Members of the Panther community directly participated in the launch and were rewarded for doing so. In addition to receiving a $PreZKP non-transferable token, which serves as a badge of honor, the members also received $ZKP tokens after the token launch.<br></p><p>After this, and building up to the launch of v0.5, Panther achieved a significantly higher level of decentralization through <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther Improvement Proposals (PIP)</a> <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x576701a7a07efe281cd4f04acbf589d0791e492117497d628a6dfc6e9eccda6b">6</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">7</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">8</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">9</a>, and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">10</a>. These proposals covered everything –from democratic procedures related to who is allowed to vote on DAO proposals under certain circumstances to the release of code so that it could be deployed by anyone in the Panther community. <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">PIP-9</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">PIP-10</a> also formalized the terms for the staking program, giving the community a direct key to decide how a significant amount of funds would be distributed among stakers.<br></p><p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">our whitepaper</a>, Panther is on a continuous path toward decentralization. This approach is by design, as the protocol focuses on building a strong foundation to support further development and evolution.</p> Panther’s current governance framework and its evolution <p>As we mentioned before, Panther’s governance framework developed with a very clear goal of making the project as decentralized as possible. This, along with community discussion and experimentation, helped bootstrap a framework rather than following a pre-developed plan. <br></p><p>For its framework, while Panther never attempted to re-invent the wheel (lots of projects have stake-to-vote frameworks, use Snapshot, proposals, etc.), its specifics have been largely shaped by what the community deems fair and effective in practice. This approach has led to a governance system that is still able to adapt and evolve as the needs of the community change. &nbsp;<br></p><p>The current governance process for Panther starts with a basis on a pre-agreed consensus: Panther’s principles, ideas, and roadmap were established by its initial <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">whitepaper</a> and materials released along with it. By deciding to fund Panther’s development, community members agreed to the directions outlined by these materials. The steps leading to their application and execution, particularly in a moving context, however, are often brainstormed between members of Panther Ventures Limited –the leading Panther developer– and the Panther community using tools like Panther’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a>, and official discussion<a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/"> forum</a>.<br></p><p>This common agreement is essential to preserving transparency and democracy within the platform. Let us now discuss some of the key roles and community tools that partake in it.<br></p> Proposals, staking, and Snapshot<br> <p>The system detailed above was formalized before Panther’s launch with the establishment of Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/">LaunchDAO</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot page</a> and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zkp-staking-will-be-available-this-wednesday-c73c7c98b5f2/">initial staking solution</a>. <br></p><p>Panther utilizes Snapshot as a way for community members to vote on proposals, such as those put forth through Panther Improvement Proposals (PIPs). PIPs cover a wide range of topics, from democratic procedures to code releases. They are an important tool for community members to voice their opinions and drive the direction of the protocol. <br></p><p>Once a proposal is published on Snapshot, it can be voted upon by the community. If the vote does not pass, no action is taken, preserving the community's power to make decisions about the platform's direction. <br></p>Panther Protocol’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot Page.</a><p></p><p>Snapshot is a powerful tool for DAOs. It allows projects to create proposals for users to vote on using cryptocurrency without incurring fees. This allows for a cost-efficient and accessible way for DAOs to engage with their audience and make decisions based on their collective input. Snapshot takes a picture (or “snapshot”) of the blockchain at the time of the vote to determine the number of tokens each address has and executes the outcome decided by the vote. This is beneficial as it eliminates the need to deploy tokens and pay transaction fees. It also prevents vote inflation by ensuring that tokens cannot be moved around and used to vote multiple times. Additionally, proposals can also have code attached to them, and if "yes" wins, the code gets automatically executed.<br></p><p>For a user to be able to vote on a Panther proposal within Snapshot, they must first ensure they have a wallet account that meets voting criteria (see below). Once they do, they can use these tokens to vote on any open proposals. As Snapshot utilizes off-chain vote signaling, votes are feeless and do not require users to directly interact with their tokens to vote.</p> Moderators, Authors, and Admins<br> <p>The ongoing process of using <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> to brainstorm with the community before issuing proposals changed with the release of Panther’s <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/">Discourse forum</a> (prominently featuring community members who are unrelated to PVL as moderators) and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">PIP-8</a>. <br></p><p>PIP-8 set the stage for advancing Panther’s decentralization by putting more responsibilities in the hands of the Panther community. Thanks to it, forum moderators can review a proposal and, if approved, move it to be put into Snapshot by a Snapshot Author, a new role <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/proposal-8-new-snapshot-authors-and-admins">introduced alongisde Admins</a>. Authors are community members with the ability to post PIPs to this platform, while Admins are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the platform's governance structure by enforcing DAO governance rules and values.<br></p><p>Another achievement of PIP-8 was defining a process of electing future Authors and Admins. PIP-8 sought to enhance decentralization by augmenting the number of Snapshot Authors and Admins within the Panther Protocol ecosystem. The proposal successfully onboarded two Panther contributors and six community members as Snapshot Authors, empowered with the ability to propose changes on Snapshot.org. Furthermore, two new community-elected Admin accounts were added as signatories on the Gnosis Safe multisig wallet, which serves as the sole admin account for Panther's Snapshot.org space. The multisig wallet operates under a "2-out-of-3" signing policy, ensuring that changes to the Snapshot.org space's settings are approved by at least two of the three whitelisted Admins.<br></p><p>PIP-8 was a concerted effort to increase community participation in the protocol's governance and eliminate potential points of failure. The introduction of new Authors and Admins, as well as the implementation of a multisig for Admin actions, served to bolster the protocol's resilience and decision-making process. Community members can nominate themselves or others for the role. These newly appointed permissions will remain valid for six months, after which the community will propose and vote on a fresh set of nominees to continue in the role. This ensures that the platform's leadership is continually meeting the needs and expectations of the community.<br></p>The Panther community discussing DAO governance on Panther’s forums.<p></p> Voting Logic<br> <p>Now that we’ve covered how the Panther DAO’s democratic process works, it’s time to look at how votes accrue in favor or against proposals.<br></p><p><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">PIP-7</a>, also known as the Improved Voting Logic proposal, brought significant changes and improvements to the governance process’ robustness. This proposal introduced a fallback voting logic at times when tokens staked are not sufficient for the community to be thoroughly represented.<br></p><p>The Panther DAO originally used only a "stake-to-vote" mechanism, where token holders could stake their tokens to gain voting rights. However, this system struggled at times when the staking contract didn’t issue rewards. As such, a "hold-to-vote" mechanism was implemented as a fallback. This allowed token holders to vote just by holding a certain amount of tokens, regardless of whether they had staked them, whenever the contract wasn’t issuing rewards.<br></p><p>After the launch of v0.5, the "stake-to-vote" mechanism was once again the primary method of voting, but with a more robust system, thanks to the improvements made by PIP-7. However, the fallback mechanism will continue in place, as it allows for a wider community representation in the voting process.<br></p> In Summary<br> <p>The Panther DAO, in its relatively short existence, has navigated its way through a trial-and-error process to establish its democratic procedures. Panther is more decentralized now than ever as a consequence. <br></p><p>Despite initial challenges, along with Panther contributors, the DAO has successfully created a system that allows for equitable participation and decision-making among its members. As the Panther DAO continues to grow and evolve, it’s now time for it to review its practices and procedures to ensure its longevity and stability. This is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of DAOs as a whole and serves as a model for other organizations seeking to establish democratic processes in a decentralized environment.<br></p><p>In an upcoming article, we’ll write about the process of creating governance frameworks that are self-enforceable.<br></p><p>Stay tuned!<br><br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

<p>In short, blockchain can improve data security and integrity by creating an environment in which everybody can add and verify data. Yet it is impossible to submit false data as those verifying the data will always notice. How does this work exactly?</p>



 Blockchain as a framework to improve data security and integrity 



<p>Defining integrity, in the context of information, can be tricky. A simple web search on the matter will yield multiple results, but for clarity’s sake we’ll pick one of the briefest: Integrity refers to the reliability and trustworthiness of the data. A simple explanation, for sure, but in the real world, the issue is slightly more complicated.</p>



<p>When it comes to data interpretation, the questions “Has this data been manipulated, or tampered with?”, “Where does this data come from?”, “Can I trust the institution that holds my personal information?”, are all very much relevant. Cambridge Analytica, Equifax, and other similar high-profile events confirmed that, when it comes to data, there is no ironclad security.</p>



<p>Or is there?</p>



 A brief history of blockchain 



<p>The answer to what blockchain is lies in its very name. It is a chain of blocks that stores transactional data. All existing nodes in the network validate the transaction, which becomes immutable, i.e., once validated, the transaction cannot be altered.</p>



<p>A block is a piece of data that contains certain information, such as a header, transaction data, and other technical stuff. Each block has a body, which can be imagined as the empty space in a train. The block’s body – the next available train car – is filled with confirmed transactions. If these transactions are validated by all the nodes (devices on the network), the block is deemed valid and is appended to the chain. Hence, block-chain.</p>



<p>You can think of a block as an entry in a ledger book, only the ledger is digital and decentralised, where all the blocks are linked to each other via cryptographic means – the hash.</p>



 Distributed security and transparency: The aces up blockchain’s sleeve 



<p>Each transaction that occurs on the blockchain is logged and timestamped. This prevents anyone from sending the same transaction more than once. The chain maintains a verifiable, immutable, and time-stamped record of every single transaction that was ever made.</p>



<p>But a bank database also maintains verifiable, time-stamped records of every transaction ever made, you might argue. Yes, it does. But where a bank (or Government, educational institution, etc.) database falls short is that its records are not immutable. They can be altered, quite easily. And furthermore, a bank database is highly centralised. Its control and management are in the hands of a single entity (the bank). Two, maybe three people will maintain it. This raises immediate and obvious concerns, particularly concerning the ease with which a database can be compromised.</p>



<p>Blockchain represents the polar opposite of a bank database. Blockchain – or distributed ledger technology – does not hold its data in a single, easy to tamper with database. Instead, an exact copy of the dataset exists in every node, and when a new block is added, every node knows about it. This poses an obvious advantage in terms of data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a Proof-of-Work environment, for example. Let’s say 30,000 nodes are validating transactions. How would 30,000 individual nodes ever coordinate together and conspire to do something dishonest? The very distribution of the validating nodes is what gives blockchain its inherent stability. At least half the nodes would have to behave dishonestly for the system to break, but the notion that 15,000 nodes would coordinate to do something dishonest is rather absurd. Compare that notion with the example of the bank database, where two, maybe three people are in control, the conspiratorial odds suddenly rise.</p>



<p>The other aspect of blockchain’s second-to-none approach to data security and integrity is transparency. Taking the example of the bank, or any other centralized database, any changes, alterations, or amendments to your data are very much a closely-guarded secret. You, the user, the very element who’s directly affected by these changes, are certainly kept out. You cannot see what’s being done with your data, you cannot control where your personal information goes, who looks at it, or what a third party might do with it. One could argue that, had Facebook’s data been kept on the blockchain, Cambridge Analytica would never have happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a blockchain environment, every single transaction (including the value, the address or addresses that the assets are sent from/to, etc.) is visible to everyone. Blockchain’s transparency is a feature that had hitherto been unthinkable in banking, for example. And while, at first glance, it might sound like a monumental invasion of privacy to have this sensitive information openly viewable by everyone in the network, consider that the information is hashed (encrypted) and that the data cannot be altered without a record of the change also existing. And of course, every node in the network would know about it. Consider this analogy: Think of a bank’s safe with transparent walls, and with hundreds, or thousands of people watching every time someone opens it to add more money into it.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">blockchain technology</a> for data integrity also creates opportunities for enterprises. Through the use of enterprise blockchain technology and various <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">digital identity solutions</a>, such as my.D, enterprises no longer have to worry about dealing with personal data. After all, personal data is as much of a liability as it is an asset these days.</p>



 Why data security and integrity matters 



<p>When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> broke back in 2018, the lights on the internet grew a little dimmer. Data harvesting was nothing new. Data-extracting bots and scripts had been roaming the web for years. But the factors that differentiated the Cambridge Analytica affair from any previous data harvesting issues were the sheer scale of it, and the sinister political ramifications of what’s arguably one of the greatest data-related scandals of the past decade.</p>



<p>An estimated 50 million Facebook accounts were compromised. Speaking on CNN, Mark Zuckerberg, referred to the Cambridge Analytica debacle as a ‘mistake’ and a ‘breach of trust.’ In March 2018, he published a letter apologizing on behalf of his company. By April, Facebook finally implemented the EU-mandated General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework in all geographical areas where Facebook operates.</p>



<p>The fallout from the Cambridge Analytica shady dealings (and the equally dramatic Equifax hack that became known about a year later) threw personal data into the spotlight. Many people, rightly, began to ask themselves how secure is our data, while in the hands of large corporations? How can these companies guarantee the security and integrity of our data? Who’s looking at our personal information?</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The use of blockchain technology clearly supports the concepts of data integrity and security. Particularly when it comes to sensitive data such as financial or commercial records. But that’s far from the only areas of business and industry where blockchain can make a transformative difference in the way personal data is handled, and by whom.</p>



<p>So one could say that blockchain is doing the right thing. Even when everyone’s watching.</p>

So what’s going on here, and why does it matter?</p><p>This move is significant because the “<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Order_Bitzlato_FINAL%20508.pdf">Bitzlato Order</a>” — issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s FinCEN the same day — is the first such order issued pursuant to section 9714(a) of the Combating Russian Money Laundering Act (Public Law 116-283). It identifies Bitzlato Limited, a financial institution operating outside of the U.S., to be of primary money laundering concern in connection with Russian illicit finance. As such, it prohibits certain transmittals of funds involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution. This is in addition to the DOJ criminal charges for Bitzlato failing to implement anti-money laundering safeguards, and thus enabling criminals to profit from their wrongdoing — including ransomware and drug trafficking from the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-shutdown-largest-online-darknet-marketplace">now-defunct</a> darknet Hydra marketplace, where users exchanged more than $700 million in cryptocurrency (either directly or through intermediaries).&nbsp;</p><p>As alleged in the order and the criminal complaint, Bitzlato executives knowingly facilitated criminal activity by failing to implement even the most basic anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures. The FinCEN order in effect shuts down Bitzlato’s ability to conduct transactions with other financial institutions.</p><p>For entrepreneurs and those watching (or in some cases reading the tea leaves on!) regulatory moves and implications, it’s worth noting that this is a good example of Treasury using its authority in a “fit for purpose” regulatory action. It’s precisely how regulation should be: going after the real wrongdoers, under clearly established rules.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you’re wondering what the difference is between a section 9714(a) order (the Bizlato Order described above) and section 311 special measures (which are authorized under the USA PATRIOT Act); or, what financial institutions are "covered" by the Order and what they have to do — you can check out FinCEN's accompanying FAQs <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FAQs_Bitzlato%20FINAL%20508.pdf">here</a>. As always, make sure to do your diligence on any businesses you’re dealing with… and when unsure about regulatory implications, consult legal or regulatory counsel.</p><p>related: For an overview of AML/KYC, BSA, sanctions, and more about illicit finance and how crypto entrepreneurs can navigate, go <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-regulations-sanctions-compliance-aml-ofac-news-explained">here</a>.</p><p>see also: In case you missed it, check out the <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-news-regulatory-roundup-december-16-2022-january-13-2023/">last installment</a> in our ongoing regulatory updates series, where David Sverdlov et al on our a16z crypto regulatory team share useful agency, as well as regional, news &amp; moves.</p> Regulate businesses, not software <p>Miles Jennings, Brian Quintenz</p><p>Two extremes clash over web3 regulation: One faction that argues for applying existing regulations wholesale to web3; and the other that argues for completely excluding web3 from existing, successful regulatory frameworks. But both produce bad policy outcomes. So how to resolve this tension?</p><p>Continuing our series on regulations that preserve the benefits of web3 technology and protect the future of the internet — while reducing the risks of illicit activity and consumer harm — a16z crypto’s Miles Jennings and Brian Quintenz suggest a more pragmatic approach. The key tenet? Regulate businesses, not software. That is: businesses should be the focus of regulation… whereas decentralized, autonomous software — especially the underlying decentralized blockchains, smart contracts, and networks that provide the internet with new functionality — should not.

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from Blocksmith Labs, Planet IX, Trisolaris, and X2YX.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Today we announce four new DApps that joined our Wallet Partner program in January. Each partner has integrated support for Brave Wallet, allowing Brave users to more easily connect to Web3 using the built-in wallet available within the Brave browser—on desktop, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Here are the partners that joined in this month:</p>

 Blocksmith Labs 
<p><a href="https://www.blocksmithlabs.io/">Blocksmith Labs</a> is driven by a singular mission: to create the best Web3 products that will enable the next generation of companies, artists, individuals, and creators to achieve their full potential. From a whitelist management platform to dynamic art generation, the team has developed solutions to address a variety of real-world problems within Web3.</p>

 Planet IX 
<p><a href="https://planetix.com/">Planet IX</a> is the largest NFT-based strategy game on Polygon. The goal of the game is to restore a fallen planet to its former green-blue glory while uncovering its mysteries. The story is continuously expanding into an immersive sci-fi metaverse with a rich narrative tailored towards bringing awareness of humanity’s impact on today’s world. The game consists of land parcels called PIX, which are NFTs that can be collected and traded to form territories, develop new technology, raid other players, and gain ownership of in-game corporations with different functions and perks.</p>
<p>“We’re very happy to be adding the Brave Wallet to our game. Many of our players already use the Brave browser when playing Planet IX, and we are excited to see what this partnership can lead to in the future,” said Felix Bengtsson, Co-Founder &amp; Visionary at Planet IX.</p>

 Trisolaris 
<p><a href="https://www.trisolaris.io/#/swap">Trisolaris</a> is a one-stop trading platform for the NEAR blockchain, running on NEAR’s Aurora engine. It is the first DEX on Aurora, enabling a seamless trading experience similar to Ethereum for a fraction of the cost, taking advantage of the great underlying architecture provided by the Aurora engine.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with the first and leading Web3 browser, Brave. We believe in their mission to provide a more secure browsing experience, especially for those participating in Web3,” said Eviejugo, BD lead at Trisolaris.</p>

 X2Y2 
<p><a href="https://x2y2.io/">X2Y2</a> is one of the top NFT marketplaces and NFT lending platforms on Ethereum. During 2022, $1.56B in NFT trading volume and more than $12M total lending amount accrued on X2Y2. Importantly, X2Y2 charges just 0.5% transaction fee from sellers, and 100% of the revenue is paid to $X2Y2 token stakers.</p>
<p>“We are an NFT marketplace, but our goal is to onboard the next billion Web 2.0 users to Web3. We believe we can achieve this goal faster by partnering with Brave and integrating deeper into Brave’s ecosystem,” said Ken, Head of Partnership at X2Y2.</p>

 Evolving the wallet partner program 
<p>Following the successful onboarding of over 80 leading DApps in&nbsp; the first phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, we’re shifting our focus to develop deeper business relationships with partners in the program involving the Brave Wallet, and to make a more public facing submission process for DApps supporting the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>As a further next step in the Wallet Partner program, users of the browser and wallet can expect new ways to use BAT with Wallet Partner program applications, as we continue growing new use cases for BAT in Web3. Stay tuned for more updates to the Wallet Partner Program, and as always, we welcome and encourage feedback from the Brave and BAT communities.</p>
<p>If you aren’t already using Brave Wallet, you can start by clicking  in the top left of your nav bar or by selecting “Wallet” from the menu.</p>
<p>If you’re an application developer that would like to integrate the Brave Wallet, developer documentation is available <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">here</a>.</p>

An image of Corintis’ microfluidic cooling channels on a&nbsp;CPU<p>For more than 50 years, the technology industry benefited from the tail winds of Moore’s Law. The density of transistors in a silicon microprocessor doubled roughly every 2 years. Up until 10 years ago, that meant that microprocessors got twice as fast every 2 years. Unfortunately, at a certain point transistors were so tightly packed together that heat dissipation became a major problem, and microprocessor performance stalled even as transistor density kept scaling. For the last decade, the industry shifted to using lots of processors and building hyperscale cloud data centers that today consume <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/2020/03/17/how-much-energy-do-data-centers-really-use/">205 TWh</a> of electricity, 43% of which is used for cooling, leading to massive inefficiencies and&nbsp;cost.</p><p><a href="https://www.corintis.com/">Corintis</a>, a spin-out of EPFL in Switzerland, has developed technology that represents a breakthrough in semiconductor cooling. The founder’s paper in Nature showed that they could put 10x the amount of power through a chip using their cooling technology than that of the closest competitor technology. Corintis etches microfluidic channels on the back of a silicon chip roughly the size of a human hair and moves coolant through them. The small size increases the surface area of silicon in contact with the coolant and, consequently, the amount of heat it can dissipate. The cooling microchannels can be etched with typical semiconductor fabrication equipment and can be codesigned with the physical design of the chip to maximize cooling efficiency using software developed by Corintis.</p><p>We believe that cooling will become a mission-critical issue for chip designers as they continue to hit physical limits. We are excited to be backing the Corintis team on their mission to lead a new breakthrough in semiconductor cooling, potentially extending Moore’s law and greatly reducing the energy consumption in the cooling of electronics.</p>

<p>From technological breakthrough to philosophical defiance, the topic of AI has always sparked intense debates ever since Alan Turing &amp; John McCarthy advanced this branch of computer science. One might argue that this was caused by expectations overwhelmingly surpassing technological capabilities. However, the recent public release of ChatGPT has rekindled former sci-fi apocalyptical scenarios, even if it is (still) just a trained language model. Humanity gazed in awe as a simple input/output text interface could instantly disrupt fields such as software engineering or copywriting. Worst part? It also challenged (arguably) the most important human-specific trait: creativity (Midjourney). Data is the lifeblood of AI as it increases the model’s prediction accuracy: larger input sample translates into more outputs that help fine-tune weights during back-propagation cycles (the model ‘learns’).</p><p>We were joined by Trent McConaghy, founder &amp; CTO at Ocean Protocol, to discuss the advantages of implementing blockchain (&amp; NFT) technology in data management and trading, what makes a particular data set valuable and what challenges derive from AI implementations and the data digital gold rush.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Trent’s AI background &amp; founding Ocean  The evolution of Ocean Protocol  Managing third-party access to data NFTs  Minting data NFTs &amp; their metadata  Discovering &amp; verifying data quality  AI generated data sets &amp; intellectual property  Ocean marketplace user base  Data farming  Data curation &amp; veOcean rewards  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0">Trent McConaghy on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Ocean Protocol on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Marketplace</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

<p>Guest post by Elizabeth Glass</p>
<p>January 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>It was great to hang out with you in my part of the labyrinth: Long Island (where I was born and raised). </p>
<p>You were a lovely guest; my son enjoyed the checkers game!</p>
<p>So what did I think about the “Alison McDowell Historical Scavenger Hunt” – visiting different places on Long Island – with you recently?</p>
<p>When I first heard about how you&nbsp;“set intentions” at historically significant locations, it was your Federal Reserve visit in NYC. I thought it was interesting…but not my thing.</p>
<p>“Burn sage at the Federal Reserve?” I was like: “You will need every pot smoker in North America to light up for THAT.” Lol!</p>
<p>I have changed; the spiritual work you are doing is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Gary Null said: </p>
<p>“We have eyes, heart, kidneys…what’s the only thing that’s missing when you’re dead? </p>
<p>Energy. </p>
<p>What’s the only thing never studied in medical school or in science classes? </p>
<p>The energy of life…</p>
<p>When we die that energy that was there: where does it go? </p>
<p>Energy cannot be created or destroyed.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;spiritual and energetic disconnection from nature, life, and our ancestors is problematic.</p>
<p>Also, sharing consequential information and truth publicly is important given Americans are relentlessly spoon-fed fibs and criminals are crowned.</p>
<p>The “Scavenger Hunt” in and around my hometown was a bit emotional: I miss being asleep like a soldier misses home. </p>
<p>Life is so challenging now that I’m nostalgic for my unhappy childhood.</p>
<p>As a kid my mother sent me a mobile – popular in the 80’s, hung from the ceiling – with little puffy figurines dangling from strings, sent in a cardboard box about the size of a human head. During the shipping process all the strings got impossibly tangled.</p>
<p>The image of that mobile – a hot mess of a toy – and that distinctive box symbolized the puzzle of my childhood, and stayed with me.</p>
<p>Untangling it figuratively – i.e. uncovering and facing the truth – has been part of my journey.</p>
<p>Just like with Americans and our history: there is WAY more to the story than what we have been told.</p>
<p>The “journey” changed a lot when my kids were kicked out of school due to law S2994/A2371 in NYS in 2019, and I became an activist: hosting protests, organizing parents, and running for office.</p>
<p>Being a political candidate was like a roller coaster ride: both good and bad things have happened as a result.</p>
<p>Meeting some of the greatest minds in the resistance – like you – has been one of the blessings.</p>
<p>One of the government insiders we spoke with during your visit commented: “The U.S. military exists to kill people and break things, so officers make up for this by being polite.”</p>
<p>To me, this “polite masking the unspeakably impolite” summarizes the Long Island Labyrinth and the culture here.</p>
<p>Just as Long Island is geographically trapped by NYC, Long Islanders are trapped in the gold chains of the matrix. </p>
<p>It has always been that way; the health emergency declared on 3/11/20 just amplified it.</p>
<p>Long Islanders pay high property taxes for the schools: these are good parents who simply want the best – including college and career – for their children.</p>
<p>Sadly, money and prestige do not inspire deep analysis or ethical introspection.</p>
<p>Why were defense contractors paid so much…?</p>
<p>To fight the Russians or other reasons?</p>
<p>Why are medical professionals paid so much…?</p>
<p>To manage health emergencies or other reasons? </p>
<p>And so on…</p>
<p>Here is a list of the places we visited:</p>
<p>Due to current time constraints, I did not do a “deep dive” into all seven topics/places (I hope to, though); I tried to analyze each from a LI native’s perspective. After writing this guest post, I realized visuals would be needed to accompany this, so I made a video about our day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory – Eugenics Records Office</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a young child, shortly after the CSHL received it’s first “cancer-war” grant from the US government i 1972, I took classes here. I vividly recall dissecting a frog in a clean, sunny classroom. “Cold Spring Harbor” is one of the most prestigious towns in the country, and the <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/education/center-for-humanities/carnegie-building/">CSH Lab was the research equivalent of the Ivy League</a>.</p>
<p>“From its founding in 1910 until it closed its doors in 1939 the <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/institutional-collections/eugenics-record-office/">Eugenics Record Office</a> at CSH Lab in NY was the center of the American Eugenics Movement.”</p>
<p>The CSH Lab boasts a staff of one thousand, including 600 scientists and research assistants.</p>
<p>The Eugenics Department at CSH Lab never “closed its doors in 1939” – rather the extensive library featuring books with titles like “Mental Retardation and Sterilization” and “The Population Problem”, is still well maintained. It appears the study of eugenics morphed into the Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>While you researched the Charles De Lisi Collection, I browsed the library and displays.</p>
<p>Of course, the people there and the facility was lovely. Reserving the parking spot for you was thoughtful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s always the “dual use” factor. CSH Lab workers believe they are fighting the “war on cancer.” People only know what they know.</p>
<p>As asked in the video: why is the Department of Energy financing DNA research?</p>
<p>Someone sent a video of a woman at the WEF meeting in Davos speaking about using DNA as an energy source, and you sent me a study, as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The grave of Henry Stimson, Secretary of War under Roosevelt and Truman&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I grew up in a house across from the street from a school named for Stimson, the Secretary of War under FDR and Truman who oversaw the <a href="https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/henry-stimson/">Manhattan Project and made the decision to bomb</a> Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing over 200,000 souls.</p>
<p>It was shocking to contemplate a reason behind these bombings was to study the health effects on survivors, and that this research has been utilized in the Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>Stimson’s grave – in a cemetery five minutes from the CSH – is impossible to find unless you ask a cemetery employee for assistance. The grave itself is not extraordinary, but the location within the cemetery of this Skull and Bones member is: it is one of the most private burial sites in the world, and would probably cost a fortune if purchased today.</p>
<p>In my heart, I sensed unquestionably that individuals have performed dark rituals in that spot.</p>
<p>As an ESL teacher for nearly 20 years, I have had countless Japanese students…absolutely outrageous that this person is honored, but – when you learn the US is actually the pit bill for the NWO – it is no different than the evil acts of U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>Perspective Studios Motion Capture in Glen Cove, NY&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Former headquarters of<a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/acclaim-entertainment-glen-cove"> Acclaim Entertainment,</a> <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/company/acclaim-entertainment-inc">video game developer</a> 1987-2004.

<p>Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media &amp; Child Development c/o KWM CPAs in Jericho, NY</p>
<p></p>
<p>This office, visible from the Long Island Expressway, sounds like an important and useful non-profit: helping parents deal with their <a href="https://www.childrenandscreens.com/">children’s screen usage</a>.</p>
<p>In truth – and very few understand this – the future planned for our kids is unspeakably dystopian: AI will study them, &nbsp;create their virtual twin, and that twin will exist in the Metaverse.</p>
<p>They will use our kids and mine them for data, to be financial commodities.</p>
<p>Why did Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan <a href="https://www.classy.org/event/10-year-anniversary-celebration-gala/e453021">sponsor the Children and Screens fundraiser</a>?</p>
<p>Do the officials at this non-profit care about what kids see online, or are they gatekeepers determining what is acceptable in the Metaverse without warning parents of what the future really looks like?</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brookhaven State Park – Adjacent to Brookhaven National Lab and Formerly Part of Camp Upton&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was also personal for me, because a close relative worked here. Again, I knew little about the research here, except – like CSH Lab – it was a prestigious gig.</p>
<p>We set an intention in the sandy oak forest of nearby Brookhaven State Park as there is no public access to this Department of Energy lab, though we did drive up the entryway and saw there was a lot of construction on site. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory">facility</a> is run by Battelle and Stony Brook University with a focus on high energy physics and nanotechnology. The lab <a href="https://greaterlongisland.com/suffolk-closeup-bnl-contamination-trial/">contaminated</a> the aquifer under the eastern end of Long Island with radioactive discharges for decades. Cancer rates on the Long Island are extremely high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The land upon which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_State_Park">park</a> and the lab are located was a former US Army base, <a href="https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Camp%20Upton%20(detention%20facility)#:~:text=Army%20encampment%20on%20Long%20Island,by%20the%20end%20of%201917.">Camp Upton</a>, which was used as a Japanese interment camp during World War II.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you to Jane Alcorn for the outstanding tour of the site of Nikola Tesla’s last remaining laboratory of Tesla: one of the great scientists of all time.</p>
<p>The site includes the footings of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower">eighteen story tower</a> that Tesla hoped to use to transmit electricity wirelessly. It was taken down after the lab closed.</p>
<p>I would love to write a book about Nikola Tesla…his story is fascinating.</p>
<p>Tesla had been sponsored by the millionaire John Jacob Astor IV; when he died in the Titanic, support for this Long Island lab disappeared, and the site closed.</p>
<p>Volunteers are working to renovate the old lab – where an 18-story tower once stood – and create a global science center.</p>
<p>We also learned that this location, Brookhaven Lab, and the old nuclear power plant in Shoreham, and a sacred indigenous erratic boulder are all VERY close to each other; it makes you wonder if they are connected to the “Ley lines” of the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Long Islanders love to talk. Below is the transcript of the end of the video:</p>
<p>This is the building where Tesla‘s actual lab was, and they’re trying to raise money to renovate it (a great cause!). There had been an 18-story tower here, and check this out…(video) ‘the inventor sent huge shafts 120 feet into the soil (under the tower)…’ Could there be something special about the earth’s electromagnetic field in the spot?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was here (at the Tesla Science Center) that we learned about the historic RCA Tower that was demolished in 1977. As many older Long Islanders are aware: the nuclear power plant at Shoreham – that never opened – is also close by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note the close proximity of these for energetically significant locations:</p>
<p>1) Tesla Science Center, a mere 2.4 miles from the </p>
<p>2) Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant</p>
<p>3) the RCA Tower</p>
<p>4) Brookhaven National Lab. </p>
<p>Again, could this location be significant in terms of the earth’s electromagnetic field?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question: why are the rates of cancer – particularly women’s breast cancer – so high on Long Island? </p>
<p>According to website, the environmental factors for women’s breast cancer are “smoking” and “grilled food.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, Brookhaven and NASA are collaborating to protect astronauts from “cosmic radiation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of radiation, Alison mentioned at Stimson’s grave that the one reason they dropped the bombs on Japan was to study the impact of radiation on human beings. Despite the well-established health effects of radiation, there is a movement to try to convince people that low levels of radiation are beneficial – <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=radiation+hormesis&amp;oq=radiation+hormesis+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l2j46i512j0i512j69i60j69i61l2.3114j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">radiation hormesis</a>. Are people being psychologically conditioned to think radiation will make them some kind of superhero, like Captain America? The “small, underdeveloped” fictional Steve Rogers was exposed to radiation and became a “super soldier.”</p>
<p>Some of the books at library at the CSH lab were about the ground water of Long Island and others were about the impacts of radiation on the body. Given the geology of Long Island where pollutants easily seeps through the sand into aquifers and its isolated nature… well, it just makes you wonder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, I want to thank Alison for demonstrating how to set intentions for healing in defense of natural life, for sending meaningful vibrations out into the world, for exposing systemic harms, and activism in defense of future generations.</p>

<p>Seychelles, 31 January 2023 — <a href="https://www.bit.com/">BIT</a>, a professional cryptocurrency exchange, has collaborated with Circle Internet Financial (Circle), a global financial technology firm and the issuer of USD Coin (USDC) and Euro Coin (EUROC), to promote greater access and adoption of USDC with fiat funds and USD/USDC settle products and to drive BIT's growth as a one-stop hub for retail and institutional crypto trading.<br><br>Circle is the issuer of USDC, one of the fastest-growing stablecoins that is currently available on many of the world's leading blockchains, with more chain integrations expected. More than $43 billion USDC is now in circulation as of January 13, 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The BIT platform offers institutional-grade security, supplemented by features such as portfolio margin and unified margin, which minimizes margin needs on hedged positions, and accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USDC, Tether (USDT) and more as collateral with respective haircut ratio.<br><br>This collaboration with Circle will allow BIT users to transfer fiat into their BIT accounts as USDC and withdraw USDC to USD via bank wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Together, BIT and Circle seek to expand crypto adoption and utility. In October, BIT launched USD-settled options. USD-settled options are more scalable for launching cryptocurrency options.&nbsp;<br><br>BIT switched all perpetual futures pairs from being USDT-margined to USD-margined from July 22, 2022 since the introduction of USD-settled options on its platform.<br><br>BIT’s USD-margined products are powered by its USD basket program, which now supports USDC. The cryptocurrency exchange also plans to incorporate more stablecoins into its USD basket in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>"BIT looks forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Circle," said Lan Yue, co-founder and COO of BIT. "Our collaboration helps us provide new efficiencies to our customers, saving retail and institutional investors valuable time and letting them focus solely on trading."<br><br>“We are excited to collaborate with BIT and look forward to working with their team. Together, we will provide the stability of USDC to BIT customers and making USDC more accessible,” said Raagulan Pathy, Vice President of Asia Pacific for Circle.</p>

Introducing Verida&nbsp;One<p>We’re proud to introduce <a href="https://verida.one/">Verida One</a>, a public platform that allows users to showcase who they are across both web2 and web3. It’s decentralized, multi-chain and censorship resistant.</p><p>Verida’s mission is to build a web where people own and benefit from their personal data to enhance their everyday experiences.</p><p>Verida One will provide people with a single source of truth that represents their ownership, affiliations, activities and social identity across all their web platforms.</p><p>With Verida One, you&nbsp;can</p>  Unlock your reputation  Create all your identities  Showcase your web3&nbsp;identity  Own and curate all your&nbsp;data  Build community trust  Showcase yourself with Verida One; One place, One&nbsp;URL.<p>People should be able to manage all their identities, their reputation, and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>We want everyone to be able to showcase who they are and what they are doing with other humans and&nbsp;apps.</p><p>We want everyone to have a trusted source of data, that they own, that provides trust, identity and reputation when interacting with others across the&nbsp;web.</p> What is Verida&nbsp;One? <p><a href="http://www.verida.one">Verida One</a> is built on top of the <a href="http://www.verida.network">Verida Network</a>. It will become a crucial part of the web3 identity and social stack enabling people to take control of their identity to signal trust and reputation to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Verida One profiles aggregate a user’s existing social identities from across web2 and web3 so they can show the many facets of themselves in one&nbsp;place.</p><p>This includes web2 identities from platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Discord, as well as web3 identities that include NFTs (avatars and others) and SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Social identities can be verified and made available on chain, making the information easily accessible to on-chain&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Users can have multiple identities that represent different facets they want to present in different contexts (for example a professional and a personal profile). Users will have full control over what is shown and what is hidden on their Verida One&nbsp;profile.</p>Manage and separate your work, personal, and anonymous identities Why are we building Verida&nbsp;One? <p>Current web2 users have a set of services that allow them to display places they are sharing their identity and activities (LinkTree is an example of&nbsp;this).</p><p>Web3 lacks a service to aggregate, share and prove these existing social identities. Existing reputation primarily relies on allocation of capital, but many of the most interesting use cases of reputation are not financially based.</p><p>There is no easy solution for users to import, verify and prove existing web2 identities and reputation, which is necessary infrastructure to link this critical web2 metadata to web3 dApps and new use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>More than that, there is no single platform where you can take ownership of all the data you create in each of those separate applications. Verida One brings that data back to the individual to own&nbsp;forever.</p>Curate your content; One feed, many&nbsp;sources. What does this mean for&nbsp;web3? <p><a href="http://www.verida.one">Verida One</a> provides users with a single source of truth that represents their ownership, affiliations, activities and social identity across all platforms. This produces a trusted source of data that can be consumed visually via an intuitive web interface, via traditional web2 API’s or via web3 using on-chain records such as NFT’s and&nbsp;SBT’s.</p><p>This makes it easier for humans to show who they are and what they are doing to other humans (send them to a single URL) and to programs (by providing a consistent machine-readable API representing the user’s identity&nbsp;data).</p><p>This provides trust, identity and reputation when interacting (crypto transactions, DM’s etc.) with that user. It enables users to highlight and show off their achievements.</p><p>Users can mint Verida Badges as on-chain Soulbound tokens that represent a verified proof of ownership or proof of reputation to the indicative social media platform. Where appropriate, proof of reputation can remain anonymous and zero knowledge. This enables use cases such as proving you have 100k Twitter followers without disclosing which Twitter account has the followers.</p><p>Collectively, they allow a user to prove who they are (and are not), to build their reputation, establish trust, and gain access to communities aligned to their social identity.</p><p>This is an open project, built on an open protocol that can be remixed or used as a composable base for any web2 or web3&nbsp;project.</p><p>You can learn more about building with the Verida Network (and hence Verida One profile data) at <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">https://developers.verida.network/</a></p> When will Verida One be available? <p>Verida One is currently in private alpha as we test early functionality to provide a seamless experience for users.

<p>The following is a guest post by a friend I met this summer. I’m glad to have more sets of eyes looking at Web3 and eugenics and applying this information to their areas of expertise. This is a long-form piece, so be sure to set aside some quality time to read the whole thing. It’s important. There was a lovely synchrony here. When I got the email from Ben, I’d actually just been at the archives of the Eugenics Records Office at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory looking at materials related to the Department of Energy’s early efforts to set up the Human Genome Project, namely <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/personal-collections/charles-delisi/">Charles DeLisi’s</a> work organizing and documenting <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/455876a">a workshop in Santa Fe in 1986</a> with help from Los Alamos National Laboratory. I’ll be sharing another guest post on that expedition shortly.</p>
<p>Ben’s post:</p>
<p>The Roots of the G.E. Chestnut Tree</p>
<p>In recent years there has been a lavishly funded P.R. campaign by the <a href="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/funding.htm">American Chestnut Foundation</a> (TACF) to promote the transgenic chestnut tree, Darling 58, developed at <a href="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/funding.htm">SUNY ESF</a>. This is a significant first, as it would be the first transgenic (genetically engineered) tree to be deregulated in the continental U.S. and large amounts of funding from industry and “non-profits” have backed the project. The engineered trees express a gene from wheat (more specifically from wheat germin) that produces an enzyme called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/oxalate-oxidase">oxalate oxidase</a> (OxO). This OxO producing gene has been put into other transgenic crops and is alleged to confer some resistance to chestnut blight for reasons that aren’t clearly understood but are <a href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/61ef6ea0-869d-476a-990a-9738e3899823/1/00__OhJ__Oxalate%20oxidase-Hordeum%20vulgare__2ET1/00__OhJ__Oxalate%20oxidase-Hordeum%20vulgare__2ET1_Oxalate_oxidase.html">thought to be</a> related to OxO’s ability to produce hydrogen peroxide and break down the excess oxalic acid made by the fungus. Serious <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biotechnology-for-forest-health-test-case-american-chestnut-report-WEB-1.pdf">questions</a> have been raised about the overall, long term, ecosystem wide unknown effects stemming from putting a wheat gene into a chestnut tree and specific criticism has also called into doubt the effectiveness of this method as a long-term blight prevention strategy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Setting science aside, there’s a deep symbolic and cultural significance in combining the genetic material of these two organisms, in particular. In the Western world, wheat is the crop most associated with annual, forest clearing, plow agriculture, with the rise of states as we know them, and ultimately with the development of Western “civilization” itself in Mesopotamia. Chestnut trees, particularly in Europe but also in Asia and the Americas to some extent, were once a symbol of independence from that very civilization, of the generosity of the forest, their carbohydrate rich nuts were ground into flour that was a staple of hill people on the periphery of empire, often intentionally so, for millennia. In the mountains of France and Italy, ancient chestnut trees on terraces surrounding villages and the stone huts where the chestnuts were smoke-dried and cached for the winter are still a common sight (see above photo from France – also see the photo of the West Virginia family at the beginning of this piece). The extent to which “grains make states” worldwide has been focused on by many anthropologists in recent years (for example, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb8qQcShWUk">here</a>). Chestnuts were, after all, sometimes known as the “bread tree” and using our most advanced technology to literally make them part-wheat sounds like a joke, or a sort of final statement of conquest on the genetic level of the civilized, grain growing, forest clearers in the valley over the dispersed, independent, forest-garden hill people.</p>
<p>Here’s a smattering of the many headlines endorsing the transgenic chestnut in major publications recently: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/05/29/biotech/">Can Genetic Engineering Bring Back the American Chestnut</a>?”, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/a-radical-attempt-to-save-the-reefs-and-forests">We nearly killed off these trees. But biotech can bring them back</a>”, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/a-radical-attempt-to-save-the-reefs-and-forests">Unnatural Selection: What Will It Take to Save the World’s Reefs and Forests</a>?, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/08/30/american-chestnut-blight-gene-editing/">Gene editing could revive a nearly lost tree. Not everyone is on board</a>.” Criticism of the project is scarce and difficult to find, even in “alternative” media, and most of it seems to be the work of <a href="https://globaljusticeecology.org/media-programs/new-voices-speakers-bureau/anne-petermann/">Anne Petermann</a> and her organization <a href="https://stopgetrees.org">The Campaign to Stop G.E. Trees</a>. <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biotechnology-for-forest-health-test-case-american-chestnut-report-WEB-1.pdf">Here</a> is the white paper they released criticizing the project. A recent deadline for a “<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment-error">public comment period</a>” at the U.S.D.A. on whether to deregulate (i.e. allow to be widely grown) the transgenic chestnut in the U.S. has just passed (January 26th, 2023). Online public comment periods, which are non-binding, non-transparent, and no more of a political action than tossing a coin into a fountain, have become the standard method to dress up foregone conclusions in the guise of participatory democracy. So rather than donating a “valued” opinion to the U.S.D.A.’s memory hole, the question should be asked: who is funding the transgenic American chestnut and why? In the following pages an attempt will be made to, first, briefly set the record straight that the American chestnut never actually disappeared and there is no urgent impending emergency justifying the use of genetic engineering. And second, to discuss the money and broader agendas of the individuals and organizations behind the development of the transgenic chestnut tree more at length.</p>
<p>Premature Eulogization</p>
<p>The extent to which the large scale preemptive felling of still healthy trees by lumber companies, ostensibly to slow the spread of the fungus, contributed to the subsequent scarcity of American chestnuts throughout their range is hardly ever discussed. Instead we are repeatedly assured that a pestilence from Asia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_blight">fungus</a>, in this case) is 100% to blame for the mass die off of the chestnuts. In the carefully chosen words of one of the few ecologists online even mentioning these widespread “salvage logging” operations:</p>
<p>“Already an economically important species, the Chestnut was subject to accelerated harvest by foresters and lumbermen who set out to conduct salvage logging operations on chestnuts already killed and the remaining virgin chestnut trees before they were killed and devalued by the blight. Some have speculated that this ambitious logging response, harvesting even the most remote and difficult stands of the steep Appalachians may have wiped out isolated pockets of Chestnut that harbored some genetic resistance.” (<a href="https://www.gafw.org/newsletters/2011summer_newsletter.pdf">source</a>)</p>
<p>Also intriguing in light of taking a critical look at this tendency to place all blame on a pathogen whilst ignoring all other factors is the following observation from a 1915 forestry publication quoted in the same article:</p>
<p>“There seems to be a combination of insects, fungous diseases and fire, or perhaps something more deep seated, such as a widespread but obscure soil or climatic change, of which the others are but manifestations of subordinate causes, destroying the chestnut in the South. The trees generally die in midsummer and, unlike blight-killed trees, seldom sprout from the stump after the trunk is killed.” (Ibid <a href="https://www.gafw.org/newsletters/2011summer_newsletter.pdf">source</a>)</p>
<p>Then there is the fact that wild chestnuts living long enough to produce nuts, and thus spread their disease resistance to their offspring, still exist and are not infrequently encountered by hikers in the Eastern U.S. (including the author of this piece). They are not “functionally extinct” (i.e. never living long enough to produce nuts) as we are told. The existence of these survivors of the blight and the increasing encounters with young offspring of these survivors seems to be ignored, glossed over, or judged insignificant in articles advocating for bioengineering. <a href="https://www.eaglehill.us/NENAonline/articles/NENA-29-3/11-Heinrich.shtml">Here’s a paper</a> studying a small, healthy and spreading population of trees in Maine. The <a href="https://www.accf-online.org">American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation</a> (ACCF), one of a handful of other organizations that has been overshadowed by the lavishly funded American Chestnut Foundation in recent years, has been harvesting nuts from these survivor trees and sharing them with members of their organization for many years. There are also hybrids between the American species and other species of chestnut from Asia that often have some resistance to the fungal blight. These hybrids have long been available from a variety of nurseries and the chestnuts grown as a commercial crop in the East are usually mixtures of the Chinese (mollisima sp.) and the Japanese chestnut (crenata sp.) with sometimes a bit of American (dentata sp.) and European (sativa sp.) thrown in. All of these different species from around the world readily hybridize with each other and genetic drift from the transgenic chestnut could eventually lead to most chestnuts on the planet having transgenic background. Something similar is already being seen with transgenic corn.</p>
<p>This genie can’t be re-corked. In fact, for many years TACF publicized their primary aim as being to hybridize the American and Asian chestnuts and then backcross to the American while maintaining blight resistance. It wouldn’t be surprising if many people who have supported the organization in the past think that this is still what they’re solely dedicated to doing. For example. these former members of TACF <a href="https://www.telegram.com/story/news/local/south-west/2019/03/28/chestnut-champions-quit-to-protest-genetic-engineering/5579303007/">publicly resigned</a> from the organization after their shift to promoting genetic engineering. So if the wild American chestnut isn’t actually “functionally extinct”, if there are already plenty of hybrid Asian/American trees that resist the blight, then why is the American Chestnut Foundation being so heavily funded and why is there so much recent media coverage advertising the transgenic trees from Suny ESF as the only solution to a (non-existent) emergency?</p>
<p>Enter the Modified Maize: Cold Springs and Green Revolutions </p>
<p>“In 1983, a retired plant geneticist, Charles Burnham, then age 75, decided to take action. Burnham approached a number of biologist friends including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman Borlaug and Peter Raven, the head of the Missouri Botanical Garden, to support a new private, non-profit organization dedicated to restoring the American chestnut to its native forests. Burnham and one of his former students, Philip Rutter, founded the American Chestnut Foundation (ACF) as a way of establishing and financing a private breeding program that would eventually create a blight resistant American chestnut.” (<a href="https://cei.org/sites/default/files/Ronald%20Baily%20-%20American%20Chestnut%20Foundation.PDF">source</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Burnham was one of a group of students at Cornell studying under Rollins A. Emerson, quite a few of whom went on to become “the most influential geneticists of their generation” (<a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/molecular-biology-genetics/about-us/history">source</a>). The group was specifically focused on maize (corn) which they established as “one of the best known “genetic” organisms” (Ibid). The bulk of Burnham’s work was done before the age of genetic engineering as we know it today but it was one of his doctoral students, Ronald L. Phillips, who was:</p>
<p>“…the first to generate whole corn plants from cells grown in culture, which laid the foundation for, and sparked, a new industry, using cell-culture methods to genetically modify corn plants and other cereals. The corn cell line most widely used in the world today for genetic modification of corn has greatly accelerated the improvement of corn, as food, feed and fuel.” (<a href="https://wolffund.org.il/2018/12/11/ronald-l-phillips/">source</a>)</p>
<p>Burnham later worked at Harvard under Edward M. East, who is primarily remembered for his work on corn genetics and his overt advocacy of eugenics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Murray_East">wiki</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/inbreedingoutbre00east/page/252/mode/2up">source</a>). Another of Burnham’s fellow Cornell maize students, Milislav Demerec, went on to run Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory (yes, <a href="https://search.amphilsoc.org/collections/view?docId=ead/Mss.Ms.Coll.77-ead.xml;query=eugenics%20records%20office;brand=default/#top">that</a>, Cold Springs Harbor although the Eugenics Records Office was then closed) where Barbara McClintock, yet another student from the same program, would study corn for most of her career and eventually be given a Nobel prize for her contributions to genetics (as would yet another fellow student of Burnham’s from the same Cornell program, George Beadle).</p>
<p></p>
<p>McClintock has since been lauded and lionized and a great deal of information about her is available online (including some <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/ll/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584613X220-doc">letters</a> to Burnham). Burnham also worked alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Stadler">Lewis Stadler</a> described as “…a leading U.S. radiation geneticist” (<a href="https://peh-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13010-017-0050-z">source</a>) who spent most of his career studying the mutagenic effects of X-rays on food plants (<a href="http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/stadler-lewis.pdf">source</a>).</p>
<p>Norman Borlaug</p>
<p>Described in many of his high-profile and fawning obituaries after his death as the “father of the Green Revolution”, a cursory glance at the media coverage on Norman Borlaug gives the impression he may have been a deity sent from on high (or was he possibly imbued with benevolent super powers following a fortuitous encounter with a radioactive corn borer?). The Atlantic called him a “Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity”, the Huffington Post called him “The Man Who Saved A Billion Lives”, and every other major publication seems to have saluted in unison and pronounced Borlaug to be an eminently superlative individual. To get a sense of how truly hyperbolic Borlaug enthusiasts can be, have a look at his profile on the website “<a href="https://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=116">Science Heroes</a>”. However, in the <a href="https://newint.org/features/special/2009/09/21/norman-borlaug">opinion of other critics</a> of the “<a href="https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/vandana-shiva-taking-down-bill-gates-empires">Green Revolution</a>”, Norman Borlaug’s life’s work was essentially to be a poster child for a global movement by a handful of transnational corporate interests (initially the Rockefellers) to consolidate control of agriculture on a molecular and genetic level under the guise of solving an “emergency” which they themselves helped cause in the first place (i.e. the Hegelian Dialectic).</p>
<p>Borlaug received a a PhD in plant pathology and genetics, and was inspired to study plant pathology after attending a lecture entitled “These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210225071911/https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/green-giant-6389547">source</a>). He was a passionate wrestler (literally and figuratively) and has been inducted into the <a href="https://nwhof.org/hall_of_fame/bio_by_name/norman-borlaug">National Wrestling Hall of Fame</a> (see photo below).</p>
<p></p>
<p>He then worked at Dupont in the early forties where, among many other things, D.D.T. was being prepared for the American market. Borlaug later <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/233444b0.pdf">testified to an E.P.A. hearing</a> in 1971 urging them not to ban D.D.T. Borlaug began working at the Rockefeller funded International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT – its Spanish acronym). While there he helped develop wheat varieties that were especially responsive to heavy chemical fertilizer use, not sensitive to variations in local conditions, and with stout, short stems to hold up the heavy heads of grain without lodging (i.e. the classic non-locally adapted, chemically dependent, patented monoculture crop). (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050310043736/http://www.coafes.umn.edu/Borlaug_and_the_University_of_Minnesota.html">source</a>) From there Borlaug travelled the world (chiefly the “third world”) under the aegis of agricultural centers funded by the Rockefellers, the Ford Foundation, and others promoting what is now often called “industrial agriculture” by critics. He went on to win far too many international awards to list here, including the Nobel prize. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539278/pdf/hw0487.pdf">This piece</a> from the year 2000 dealing with “The Promise of Biotechnology and the Threat of Anti-science Zealotry” gives a good sense of where Borlaug was coming from and his adhominem, straw man attack against critics of genetic engineering (the aforementioned “AntiScience Zealots”) seems to have now become the primary tone and tact for corporate media to take when addressing criticisms of biotechnology. And seeing as the topic at hand is the first approved transgenic tree in the U.S., it’s interesting to note that although he spent his career coercing poor farmers to go into debt to grow patented annual crops grown with patented synthetic fertilizer sprayed with patented insecticides and herbicides and harvested with patented machinery (all of which, by a lucratively convenient coincidence, was generously developed by the companies who founded and funded the “nonprofit” research institutes he worked with), Borlaug’s undergraduate degree was in forestry. It is, after all, a gene from wheat, the crop most associated with Borlaug, that has apparently been inserted into these transgenic chestnut trees.</p>
<p>Peter Raven</p>
<p>Much like Norman Borlaug, botanist Peter Raven, is a very prominent figure in the American plant world with a glowing reputation that begins to take on a different hue when you scratch the surface and dig into his corporate ties, specifically his deep and longstanding relationship with Monsanto (now Bayer Crop Sciences). Raven was the longtime head of the Missouri Botanical Garden, which is one of the best known (read: best funded) public gardens in the U.S. The garden is not far from Monsanto’s headquarters, it’s been extensively funded by Monsanto over the years, and under Raven’s leadership the <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/Portals/0/Visit/PDFs/Monsanto%20Map.pdf">Monsanto Center</a>, “An engineering masterpiece and model of “green architecture”, was constructed to house the herbarium and facilities for the researchers. This 2015 <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2015/09/weed-whackers/">article</a> in Harper’s Magazine touches on Raven’s decades long relationship with Monsanto. And yes, Monsanto is one of several major biotech corporations to fund the transgenic chestnut tree program (source). Note how it’s the only corporation on the SUNY ESF site that breaks from the pattern of directly mentioning the organization and linking to their site. Clearly Monsanto’s reputation precedes it these days. Raven <a href="https://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/insect%20ecology%20reading/ehrlich_raven_1964.pdf">also worked with Paul Erlich</a> back in the 60’s who would go on to write the bestseller “The Population Bomb” warning of the impending collapse from overpopulation if immediate steps were not taken to lower fertility globally. Ehrlich’s predictions did not come to pass. In the late 90’s, Raven was chair of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems Panel of the President’s Committee of Advisers for Science and Technology (PCAST). This was established via executive order by Clinton along with the National Science and Technology Council. In this <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-teamingwithlife.pdf">report</a> Raven and his colleagues repeatedly emphasize the need for large amounts of federal funding for genetic engineering to manage “natural capital” with statements like “Transgenic organisms will become increasingly important as components of agricultural, health, pharmaceutical, and resource management activities”.</p>
<p>One of the key aims outlined in the report, and one that is important to keep in mind when considering the transgenic chestnut, is the much more ambitious goal of establishing a “Next Generation National Biological Information Infrastructure” (NBII-2). Essentially, this is a call for the federal government to invest heavily in extensive public/private initiatives to accumulate all known biological and ecological data down to the molecular and genetic level onto an interoperable “distributed facility” database in order to enable what they refer to as “data mining in the biodiversity and ecosystems information domain”. They specifically mention that NBII-2 will assist with genetic engineering scenarios in the future (pg. 73). This vision, which they describe as a “distributed”, “commodity based infrastructure”, that is “accrete only, no delete” sounds so similar to current blockchain based systems to gather granular, real-time data on “natural capital” so it can be commodified and bet on in carbon markets/N.F.T./“social impact bond” markets that it’s hard to believe this document was written in the late 90’s. To give just one recent example of a private sector company embodying this approach see the <a href="https://www.veritree.com/technology">website for Veritree</a>. Suffice it to say, it’s vital to keep in mind that this is the big picture view. Genetically engineered organisms like the transgenic chestnut are not being developed to fit into agriculture as we once knew it or to inhabit natural ecosystems as we once knew them. Rather, they’re being developed to fit into a new system where every aspect of life that can be quantified is put “on the ledger” using a suite of ubiquitous “smart” sensor technologies that are a part of the coming “Web3” world (see the work of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com">Alison McDowell</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The (Bioplastic) Board of (Evolutionary) Directors</p>
<p>Other organizations that have funded the transgenic chestnut project have ties to these same initiatives (more below) as do Members of the Board of Directors of TACF.&nbsp; A look at the current Board of Directors of TACF sheds further light on the agendas behind the transgenic chestnut. William J. Cude III, the chairman of the board, spent most of his career in the medical device industry and was the founder of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/3047574Z:US#xj4y7vzkg">Coeur Inc.</a> which provides angiography and other medical imaging equipment. Cude’s former position was “Director, Officer, Vice-Chairman and Chairman of the Washington DC based <a href="https://www.plasticsindustry.org/supply-chain/recycling-sustainability/bioplastics">Plastics Industry Association</a>”. This is the oldest and largest lobbying organization for the plastics industry in the U.S. So the chairman of the board of TACF has no background in environmentalism, or ecology, or plant science, or anything remotely related to chestnut trees but is instead a prominent plastics industry lobbyist. Is Cude simply leading the TACF out of a personal passion for chestnut trees? Perhaps, but I’d suggest it’s more likely we’ve just stumbled upon one of the key (not particularly) hidden agendas of the American Chestnut Foundation: Cude is working to help normalize the development of transgenic trees to be grown in extensive plantations for not only lumber but also biomass/pulp that will then be used to produce “bioplastics” and other cellulose based products. The Plastics Industry Association has a <a href="https://www.plasticsindustry.org/supply-chain/recycling-sustainability/bioplastics">bioplastic section</a> on their site and it’s clear that plastics manufacturers are ironically being steered towards bioplastics by prominent calls to “go green” from organizations like <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/industry-giants-coca-cola-and-pepsico-ditching-pro-plastics-lobbying-association/">Greenpeace</a>. In fact, this has been openly stated as the key purpose of many other transgenic trees around the world (as outlined on The Campaign to Stop GE Trees <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/chestnut/">website</a>) and it becomes increasingly hard to deny when you look into ArborGen (more on them below).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Timber behemoth Weyerhaeuser, America’s largest private landowner has also contributed to the project. Duke Energy has given support through the <a href="https://centertrt.org/policyplan.pdf">Forest Health Initiative</a>, which is dedicated to “Advancing Forest Health Through Biotechnology”, as has the <a href="https://www.nhla.com/staff-and-board/">National Hardwood Lumber Alliance</a>. Vice Chair and Governance Committee Chair, Rebecca Carter, seems to have been facilitating transactions between industry and government for many years. Among other positions she was the Director of Federal Agency and Congressional Government Relations for the <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/?tab_q=tab_container-tab_element_451082477">Nature Conservancy</a> and she also “worked in government relations roles at Columbia Gas Transmission” and “West Virginia Division of Natural Resources”. Her father-in-law, former President Jimmy Carter, is himself listed as an “Honorary Director” of TACF). When judging the initiatives that the <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/about/trustees/index.html">Carter Center</a>, where Becky was C.D.O. before retiring, chooses to invest in, it’s valuable to keep in mind the Carter administration’s close relationship with Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s National Security Advisor and fellow member of David Rockefeller’s Trilateral Commission, and his ideas on the coming “<a href="https://ia600602.us.archive.org/13/items/B-001-003-798/Zbigniew_Brzezinski__Between_Two_Ages.pdf">Technetronic Era</a>”. Reading through Brzezinski’s explanation of what the “Technetronic Era” is and the effects it will have is similar to recent descriptions of what is now being called “the Fourth Industrial Revolution” and the link between what we might call “technocracy” and environmentalism seems to have been firmly established in the public mind in the Carter era.</p>
<p>Another board member worth noting is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandy-cromwell-7a6b63a?original_referer=">Dr. Mandy Cromwell,</a> a Senior Director of Pharmacology at <a href="https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-and-arbor-biotechnologies-establish-new-partnership">Vertex Cell and Genetic Therapies</a>. Vertex says they are using gene editing to help treat diabetes, cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases. Needless to say, “gene therapies” have received an enormous amount of attention in recent years. Dr. Deborah Delmer, the Science and Technology Committee Chair, is a professor emeritus of plant biology at UC Davis and “In 2004, she received from the American Chemical Society the Anselme Payen Award in recognition of excellence in the science and chemical technology of cellulose” (emphasis mine). Delmer’s bio goes on to say that “From 2002-2007, she served as Associate Director for Food Security for the <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/reset-the-table-messaging-guide/">Rockefeller Foundation</a> where she was involved with grant making and policy relating to the role of biotechnology in developing world agriculture.” These days she “serves on a number of advisory boards and consultant to foundations, academia, industry, and governments on developing world agriculture issues surrounding biomass production” (emphasis mine).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dennis Liu “is currently Vice President of Education for the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation and the <a href="https://www.half-earthproject.org/programs/">Half-Earth Project</a>. Previously, he directed the production of educational media at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vPK-ibEo-o">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>”. The Half-Earth Project is essentially putting into place something analogous to the NBII-2 vision described above. They’re one of many institutions dedicated to gathering the most ecological data possible by using the most advanced surveillance, monitoring, and tracking technology in order to, you guessed it, save the earth. You might say they do, in fact, want to “save” the earth, but in the computational sense of “File &gt; Save”. The CEO of that project is Paula Ehrlich, “formerly President and CEO of the Drug Discovery Center of Innovation” (her relation, if any, to Paul Ehrlich is unclear to me). The relevance and legacy of recently deceased and fervently revered Harvard entomologist, E.O. Wilson, another honorary board member, is far too large to cover here. Suffice it to say, it’s worth looking into how his research into social insects (specifically ants) has overlapped with social engineering, economics, and cybernetics (touched on in this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/01/05/a-tucson-labyrinth-ants-in-an-age-of-artifice/">lecture</a> or this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/11/06/the-economics-of-crystalline-emotion-neuroeconomics-part-2/">post</a> and in some of the research being funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation mentioned below).</p>
<p>There’s also no time to do justice to the many years of public / private maneuvering of the next board member, Ambassador Catherine A. Novelli. She is “is a Senior Advisor at <a href="http://shearwater.global/international-advisory-board">Shearwater Global</a>, a strategic consulting firm” with a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=bf&amp;trkInfo=AQEeT0vCtL5XuAAAAYX-mZRgLchmk3huiV-MMWjZC6fw1qJHic8VPe2Iwkh6D6fEKm14UNlqyyyw6Yx7MO09eXzRI8v3r0GPlkjH-pP6hPmdbuqxYBvTUusr4PiITxpjeOXMzgU=&amp;original_referer=&amp;sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fshearwaterglobal">linkedin profile description</a> that is recommended reading. They’re dedicated to coming to the rescue of their corporate clients dealing with the fact that “barriers to business are back in vogue. Businesses are strong-armed into doing what politicians want. Economic policies are being weaponised, protectionism legitimised and borders rebuilt.” She also serves as President of <a href="https://listeningforamerica.org/what-we-do/">Listening for America</a>”, a sort of focus group and corporate intelligence organization that does “listening sessions– in the form of conversations–with a cross-section of Americans about their experiences with international trade and globalization” while also providing “up-to-date, impartial, fact-based information about international trade”. They appear to be both gathering information about how redundant people feel about the Fourth Industrial Revolution and also exposing them to propaganda on why it’s good for them. A quick look at t<a href="https://listeningforamerica.org/about/board-of-directors/">he board</a> will let you know whose interests they represent. “She also launched the <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/events/global-connect-initiative">Global Connect Initiative</a>, an innovative partnership with governments, multilateral development banks and the private sector to connect 1.5 billion people to the Internet.” Enormous public/private infrastructure projects like this are essential for building the “Web3” future that transgenic organisms will inhabit. This connects nicely with her “seven years as Vice President, Worldwide Government Affairs at Apple Inc” where she was “responsible for Apple’s federal, international, and state and local government relations and public policy”. So it’s no surprise that she’s a also member of the <a href="https://www.cnas.org/support-cnas/cnas-supporters">Center for a New American Security</a>. CNAS is associated with, among others, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMe1J4a6IQ">Eric Schmidt</a>, formerly of Google, along with the Pentagon, and major arms manufacturers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To give some idea of where CNAS is coming from, they were heavily cited by Schmidt et al in the now notorious 2021 <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Report-Digital-1.pdf?download=1">National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence Report</a> framing the rapid development of A.I. and weaponizing of dehumanizing, all-pervasive technologies as a national security necessity due to a new Cold War with China. Of course, this military technology is also being employed in agriculture and forestry. <a href="https://www.xa.com/en/about/csr">Tree planting drones</a> such as the one pictured above, to give just one example of such technology, are already being used in tree plantations in Brazil and elsewhere. XAG, who manufacturers the above drone, tells us on their website that “technology is a great equaliser” and assures us that they are deeply dedicated to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (the yardstick by which “Impact Finance” deals are evaluated). They call this “Agriculture 4.0”. Much more could be said about Novelli in relation to her position as a corporate lawyer at <a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en">Mayer Brown International</a>, an enormous “white shoe” law firm with offices around the globe, prior to becoming a public/private liaison between Silicon Valley and Washington, a broker for “free trade” agreements in the Middle East, and a high-tech “environmentalist”.</p>
<p>And lastly, for the sake of time although there are more board members worth mentioning, if you’re wondering who’s been crafting the stories that have managed to portray a genetic engineering biotech project developed and funded by all the usual suspects as a romantic, grassroots, noble cause of ecological restoration you might have a look at board member, <a href="https://neonliterary.com/about">Anna Sproul-Lattimer</a>. She’s a Beltway area literary agent who “believes that there’s no more powerful tool for social change than a good story. It’s why she works in publishing; it’s also why she dedicates most of her TACF volunteer work to promotion and outreach, spreading the story of the American chestnut across the country and world.” Which raises the question: whose story is this, anyway?</p>
<p>Branching Out: Hopping Down the Money Trail </p>
<p><a href="https://www.arborgen.com/in-vitro-services-biotechnology/">ArborGen</a>, another funder of the transgenic chestnut project, is “the largest global seedling supplier and the leading provider of advanced genetics for the forest industry.”. They’re now operating <a href="https://www.arborgen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ArborGen-Partnership-with-SCFC-Final-02.27.2018.pdf">a state nursery in South Carolina</a>, their “l<a href="http://www.rubicon-nz.com/arborgen/">argest sales position is in the US-South</a>“, their products “are specifically developed for land owners and managers supplying the sawtimber, plywood and other structural wood products, packaging, pulp and paper, and industrial markets (including bioenergy)”, and they manage “16 nurseries, 16 seed orchards, 32 distribution centres and three research and development facilities located throughout the United States, Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia.”. Currently they’re primarily focused on eucalyptus and pine. The graph below from ArborGen’s “<a href="http://www.rubicon-nz.com/arborgen/business-model/">business model</a>” page compares corn yields over time, from open pollinated corn through G.E. corn, with ArborGen’s claims of their genetically superior tree yields. Remember how heavily the initial founders and funders of the transgenic chestnut were involved with corn breeding? This hammers home the fact that transgenic corn is the model for transgenic trees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s ArborGen’s <a href="https://www.arborgenholdings.com/board-of-directors">board</a>. And just to give an illustration of how the same people who are funding environmental biotechnology schemes, and thus investing in “natural capital”, are also usually funding “Social Impact Finance” schemes, investing in “human capital”, note the presence of David Knott Jr., who runs the hedge fund <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001077285">Knott Partners</a>, ArborGen’s largest shareholder. The Knott family descends from N.Y.C. hotel executive and Tammany Hall politician, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Knott">David H. Knott</a>. Knott partners was founded by Knott Jr.’s father, David M. Knott, who went to the Wharton school and has been deeply involved in Impact Finance for many years (see <a href="https://sayyessyracuse.org/team/david-m-knott/">Say Yes to Syracuse</a> – and also check out that project’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC_Inc.">other funders</a> including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC_Inc.">Syracuse Research Corporation</a> and the quite creepy <a href="https://www.air.org/resource/spotlight/good-behavior-game">American Institute for Research</a> and it’s more than 50 years of <a href="https://www.siop.org/Research-Publications/Items-of-Interest/ArtMID/19366/ArticleID/832/History-Corner-John-C-Flanagans-Contributions-Within-and-Beyond-I-O-Psychology">behavioral conditioning research</a>). Also see the <a href="https://www.higrogroup.com/impact">HiGro Group</a> where the current Knott Jr. is on the Advisory Board and their prominent display of the S.D.G.’s on their site. He’s also a member of the Advisory Board of the <a href="https://nz.linkedin.com/company/tenon-clearwood-limited-partnership?original_referer=">Tenon Clearwood Limited Partnership</a>, who “is responsible for exporting approximately 30% of the total pine products from New Zealand to the US, and is the fifth largest containerised exporter out of New Zealand”. Their <a href="https://tenonclearwood.com">website</a> assures us they’re “sustainable”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=8589">Templeton World Charity Foundation</a> gave SUNY ESF the “largest-ever charitable gift, $3.2 million” in the history of the school in 2020 “to support one of the College’s most impactful research projects – the restoration of the American chestnut tree.” Unlike many other “non-profit” funders of this project, TWCF isn’t especially well known for supporting “environmental” causes (case in point: they have a picture of the <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/restoration-american-chestnut-tree">unrelated “Horse Chestnut” tree on their site</a>). So why are they throwing such significant sums of money into the transgenic chestnut? In a previous $200,000 grant from 2017 they say the funding will be used to “support key personnel and activities to acquire regulatory agency approvals for distribution. The grant will also sponsor engagement with local and state indigenous peoples”. The more recent and generous $3.2 million gift is also stated to, among other things, assist in “completion of regulatory review”. In terms of the “engagement with…indigenous peoples” it’s worth noting that although some Eastern Cherokee have <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/indigenous-peoples-unite-stop-genetically-engineered-trees/">vocally opposed</a> the transgenic chestnut tree for many years the government of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, whose tribal lands are west of Asheville, N.C., signed a <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2021/05/15/new-orchard-american-chestnut-trees-planted-cherokee-territory-southern-appalachians/4986864001/">Memorandum of Understanding</a> in 2021 with the American Chestnut Foundation not long after the TWCF received Templeton’s ample gift.</p>
<p>The TWCF’s support of the transgenic chestnut seems to compliment another recent grant to <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0400">gather, engineer, and commodify plant genetics</a> awarded to the “<a href="https://www.croptrust.org/about/governance/executive-board/">Global Crop Diversity Trust</a>” which <a href="https://www.croptrust.org/work/projects/the-templeton-pre-breeding-project/">aims to</a> use “new methods and tools, like speed breeding and genomics, to revolutionize the breeding of improved varieties of neglected crops, which will get climate-smart crops into the hands of smallholder farmers more quickly.” and is doing this with “innovative financing, such as member-country loans, food security bonds, crowdsourcing and crop-based fundraising”. The Crop Trust is what the next-generation Green Revolution looks like, even working with many of the same institutions such as the International Rice Research Institute that Borlaug worked with so many years ago. They’re dedicated to aggregating the genomics of crops and wild crop relatives around the world on behalf of their N.G.O. benefactors. The Crop Trust has proudly described themselves and given awards to collaborators they describe as “global gatekeepers of crop diversity”. Again, this project aligns closely with the NBII-2 vision mentioned above where “protecting biodiversity” refers to N.G.O.’s like the Crop Trust “diversifying their portfolio” of genomic data and even “going long” by not only gathering the genomics of food crops, but also of wild crop relatives.</p>
<p>To consolidate the genetics of wild forest trees, such as the American chestnut, is the next logical step in this same direction of engineering and commodifying the D.N.A. of all life on earth. Strangely, the TWCF’s more typical fare is the study of <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/30059">intelligence</a> in a wide variety of conscious beings and the attempts to try to quantify and assign metrics to previously indefinable qualities like <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/honesty-humility-and-humanity-how-epigenome-and-mindfulness-shape-moral-decision">honesty</a>, <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0520">altruism</a>, and <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0492">spirituality</a>. Basically, to put it in Phillip K. Dick terms, the TWCF is dedicated to helping the androids pass the “empathy test”. In fact, they aren’t even subtle about this goal; one of their initiatives is called “<a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/our-priorities/diverse-intelligences/beyond-turing-test">Beyond the Turing Test: Elucidating the Similarities and Differences between Machine and Biological Intelligence</a>.” Considering this, their reasons for throwing so much money into this particular project aren’t entirely clear aside from the fact that patenting genes, genetic engineering, and erasing the line between the natural and the artificial seems to be right in their wheelhouse. Either way, the fact that the largest ever single donation to SUNY-ESF, a major N.Y. state school that has been around for many years and receives no shortage of funds from industry partners and their N.G.O.’s, was given to this transgenic chestnut project is significant in and of itself.</p>
<p>History’s Rhyme Scheme, SUNY’s “Restoration” Scheme: The Next Stanza</p>
<p>Although it may sound far-fetched to suggest that SUNY ESF, via direct funding and through its connection to TACF, is being used to cloak an incredibly environmentally destructive timber industry/biotech agenda in the vestments of environmental restoration and “scientific forestry”, it actually wouldn’t be the first time. SUNY ESF has its origins in the N.Y. State College of Forestry, the first such school in the country, established as a division of Cornell University in 1898. After being shut down by a highly publicized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1903/06/18/archives/cornell-school-of-forestry-suspended-action-followed-failure-of.html">scandal</a>, the school officially reopened at Syracuse University in 1911 and then incorporated into the State University of New York (SUNY) system when it was established in 1948. The scandal, which resulted in N.Y. state’s governor withdrawing funds from the college and the president of Cornell officially closing it down, came to a head in the N.Y. State Supreme Court case “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/people-v-brooklyn-cooperage-co-2">People vs. Brooklyn Cooperage Company</a>.” It revolved around the Forestry College using public funds to purchase nearly 30,000 acres in the Adirondacks (Franklin County) “to conduct upon said land such experiments in forestry as it may deem most advantageous to the interests of the state and the advancement of the science of forestry, and may plant, raise, cut and sell timber at such times, of such species and quantities and in such manner, as it may deem best, with a view to obtaining and imparting knowledge concerning the scientific management and use of forests, their regulation and administration, the production, harvesting and reproduction of wood crops and earning a revenue therefrom” (Ibid). After 30 years they were supposed to give the land back to N.Y. State to become a forest preserve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The college ended up buying this “Forest Preserve” from the Santa Clara Lumber Company and immediately signed a deal with the Brooklyn Cooperage Company who built a factory on the land and laid a railroad to it (see photo above). At this point, under the guise of “scientific forestry”, the Forestry College began clearcutting it, sometimes replanting it to high-value conifer species, sometimes not. The contract stipulated that “the company agrees to take and the university to deliver at its own expense, for a period of fifteen years, such amount of wood as the company shall give written notice it requires, provided the amount shall not exceed yearly more than one-fifteenth of the wood standing on the college forest”. The expenses were allegedly so high for Cornell (who, as a public college at that time, was simply spending public money) that they didn’t even make a profit (on the books, that is).</p>
<p>The incident serves as a sort of cautionary tale regarding the potential pitfalls in “public/private partnerships” between the government, academia, and industry. However, it’s worth mentioning that this isn’t necessarily the consensus view. This <a href="https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cornell_Roots-of-American-Forestry-Education.pdf">article</a> defends Bernhard Fernow, Dean of the Forestry College at the time, makes no mention of the Brooklyn Cooperage Company or any of the details of the case, and implies that rich landowners with summer homes not far from the “Forest Preserve”, who Fernow disparagingly called “the bankers”, simply undermined and smeared Fernow because they didn’t want cutting near their vacation homes. Seeing as Fernow would have recently returned from the <a href="https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Harriman+Alaska+Expedition+%281899%29%22">Harriman Alaska Expedition</a> and had connections with the funder of that expedition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._H._Harriman">E.H. Harriman</a>, a Gilded Age railroad tycoon and financier whose surname would become forever synonymous with high finance, along with other rich and prominent New Yorkers, it’s difficult to imagine Fernow as a misunderstood everyman scientist being unfairly persecuted by arrogant rich people. This may well be an early example of framing all local opponents to environmentally destructive projects as privileged “N.I.M.B.Y.’s” (from: “not in my backyard”), which has since become a default method of discrediting local opposition to environmental degradation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether his project was harried by snobs or not, the idea that Fernow was a pioneer of “scientific forest management” is beyond dispute. Unfortunately, this takes on a different light when you understand that this “scientific forest management” consisted of clearcutting tens of thousands of acres of native forest and replanting it with monocultures of high market value, tightly packed, conifer species. Now, as this “scientific forestry” officially enters a new era in the U.S., one which will impose monocultural uniformity and control on a genetic level, should it surprise us that it’s coming out of essentially the same institution where Fernow first proselytized it?</p>
<p>Should we expect different results from this old dog that’s learned a new trick?</p>
<p>End of Pt. 1</p>
<p>Thanks for putting this together Ben!</p>
<p>PS: I (Alison) touched on&nbsp;Borlaug’s <a href="https://www.cimmyt.org/about/our-history/">International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’s</a> research in corn hybridization in a post I did last year about a conditional cash transfer program that was piloted in Mexico in the late 1990s.

<p>At Brave, we work hard to minimize the tracking of our users on the internet, and that includes interaction with services run by Brave itself. But we don’t expect you to take our word for it; we try to make our privacy features something you can verify.</p>
<p>Many of our features depend on services configured with various providers. We’ve created a view into how that configuration protects your privacy. It’s your data, so you deserve to know how it’s handled. You can follow the steps below to review our work.</p>

 Address privacy 
<p>When devices send or receive data over the internet, they use an Internet Protocol (IP) address to identify themselves. This is an intrinsic part of how the internet works. While addresses aren’t necessarily unique or long-lived, it’s inevitable that the sites you visit will see these identifiers. The web doesn’t work without them.</p>
<p>To address this potential exposure, we sometimes have visitors connect to our sites and services through a proxy. The proxy sees the visitor’s IP address, but when it forwards the request to our servers, we see only the proxy’s IP address, not the real address of the visitor. Traffic is encrypted so the proxy can’t learn anything about what the visitor has to say; that’s private between the visitor and us.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>For example, if you enable Brave Rewards or use Brave News, the items the browser shows are decided locally, on your device—it’s none of our business which item the browser thought you’d be interested in. To protect your privacy, we download some of that content through a <a>private content distribution network</a> where requests go through a proxy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because user tracking is so prevalent, most proxy services have options to forward the original visitor’s IP address, decrypt the contents of the request, or both. That’s the opposite of what we want! So it’s important that we turn all those options off when we configure our sites to use a proxy.</p>

 Verification 
<p>To check the current configuration of a Brave proxy, you can visit the <a href="https://brave.github.io/config-attestation/">audit page</a> and examine the settings for each service. They’re listed by the domain name of the service where we’re using the proxy to separate the IP address from the contents of the request.</p>
<p>Correct configuration will look something like this:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Examine the logs for the fetch and display config step. You should see something like this:</p>
 <code>{
  "domain": "pcdn.brave.com",
  "modified_on": "2020-06-25T23:16:38.918708Z"
  "protocol": "tcp/443",
  "proxy_protocol": "off",
  "traffic_type": "direct",
}
</code> <p>This displays key values that control our configuration of Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/cloudflare-spectrum/">Spectrum proxy</a> for our private content distribution network:</p>
 
 domain: This describes the website the proxy is forwarding for. Match this up with the Brave service endpoint you’re auditing. Cloudflare is accepting traffic for this domain name and routing the traffic to their own internal servers first so they can strip the IP address. 
 modified_on: The date the configuration was last updated. 
 protocol: A value of tcp/443 indicates the proxy accepts normal encrypted https traffic. 
 proxy_protocol: This should be off, meaning the proxy does not forward the IP address of the visitor via the <a href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/master/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">PROXY protocol</a>. This means Brave can’t use it to track you! 
 traffic_type: A value of direct here means https traffic is forwarded directly to Brave’s server without decrypting it. Although Cloudflare sees the client IP address, this means they don’t learn anything about the content of the request or our server’s response to it. 
 
<p>By contrast, this is what it might look like if an endpoint were configured to make it possible to track visitors by IP address:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>The above example uses the port for unencrypted http, and passes on the original client IP address. We’ve added an “X” and dotted underlines to mark some of the problems with this config so it’s easy to check at a glance.</p>
<p>By publishing these values, we offer some assurance that we’re not able to track clients connecting to these services. Since the configuration data comes <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#spectrum-applications-get-spectrum-application-configuration">directly from Cloudflare</a>, it accurately represents the real proxy parameters. Because the query is processed by GitHub, we can’t have changed the values before reporting them.</p>


    
    

    



    
    

<p>More technical users may want to consult the GitHub Actions workflow log linked at the bottom of the page to verify the data was obtained correctly by a runner under GitHub’s control. You’ll need to be logged in to GitHub to access data on that page.</p>
<p>Happy checking!</p>

      AI Recruits a New Hybrid Workforce        <p>By Konstantine Buhler</p><p>Published January 26, 2023</p>        AI models keep getting better at generating human-level work. Now the hard part, bringing magical products to the office.      



 
<p>If you are following the amazing demos people are making with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT, you might think the latest wave of AI is all about fun new modes of communication. It’s not. Under the hood, it’s all about work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI is computation; best guesses based on statistics. It is work; joules of energy dissipated through the movement of information. Despite the flashy new veneer, AI is not a revolution in communication but in productivity. It’s not the printing press or telegraph, it’s the assembly line, the jet engine, technologies that produce work rather than transfer information. And for knowledge workers, the latest developments in AI represent a new paradigm for work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although computers are a form of information technology, the ways we use them are still quite mechanical. Much of our work remains trapped in the physics of W = Fs, forcibly pounding our keyboards, displacing our attention across emails, spreadsheets and websites, foraging for the bits of information we need to compose some work product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contemporary AI promises something new altogether: a higher level approach where we work in deep collaboration with software. Computer programming moved from imperative to declarative languages and office work is just catching up. This is the new age of declarative work, made possible by the massive amount of information compressed into today’s text, image and code models. The ease of prompt interfaces and the ability to quickly generate variations will result in higher quality work products per unit of human effort.</p>



<p>The proliferation of AI into everyday office software (finally!) has the potential to create a new kind of hybrid workforce. We may soon enter an era when all of the apps you and every other knowledge worker use every day—your document editor, spreadsheet and presentation maker—will do part of your work for you. The more mundane aspects will be truly automatable—but the real breakthrough will be the teamwork between you and your software. You will have new, virtual teammates to write a first draft, instantly provide research and answer the most arcane questions.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Will you feel like you have new, trusted digital colleagues, or a bunch of untrained interns to worry about?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This mix of humans and intelligent agents will increase individual productivity and enable leaner teams to do more, but will also be a lot to manage. Not only are generative work outputs subject to problems running from mediocrity to outright hallucination, enthusiastic overuse could make work and the internet itself even noisier. Will you feel like you have new, trusted digital colleagues, or a bunch of untrained interns to worry about?</p>



<p>In the physical world, humans have shared the factory floor with robots for decades. Workers, though, haven’t been programming their own automations, so these robots have been more like furniture than coworkers. This current wave of automation will change that. Companies like the German robot maker <a href="https://www.robco.de/en">Robco</a> now offer easily configurable industrial robot arms designed to be auxiliary workers for small manufacturing teams.</p>



<p>The great monolithic office software suites from Microsoft and Google have also felt like furniture. These are applications we work on rather than with. As AI changes this, how will human workers adapt? And equally important from our perspective, where are the opportunities for disruption in this new way of working?</p>



 Making it work 



<p>The coming AI revolution will look nothing like the internet explosion of the past 25 years. The internet was a revolution in how humans communicate. AI will be a revolution in how we work. Gaining distribution will be more difficult, and require companies to build passionate communities and unique customer value without becoming overly dependent on an incumbent’s expensive or restrictive platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">creative new world of generative AI</a>, sharing code and models is the new engine of distribution. What Github is for code, Hugging Face is for models. Developers can use it to easily patch together models and datasets into bespoke pipelines. And Replicate has an easy-to-use API that lets users run open source models in the cloud. Unlike the Imagenet pioneers in 2012, you no longer have to have a PhD to deploy an ML model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The elephants in the Zoom are the office suites themselves. Microsoft and Google have their productivity apps installed on nearly every computer on the planet, and many companies use both. The incumbents have deep moats, but also blindspots. The once mighty IBM discounted the threat of the personal computer (and Microsoft) to its peril, and history has a way of repeating itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of the pillars of the office suite is a potential vector of disruption. But could the office suite itself, based on the paradigm of human readable documents and messages, be disrupted? Today’s large language models (LLMs) are trained on public information and produce general purpose results. Will tomorrow’s leading companies preserve their advantage by building their own models and custom applications the way we now make spreadsheets or write memos?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first beachheads for challengers will likely be vertical apps, but the individual pieces of the office suite make attractive targets given Microsoft 365’s 345M paid users and Google Workspace’s 3B (mostly free) users. The office suite is just one of many software surfaces that startups can attack, but it’s a significant one. Could a 10x better doc editor, spreadsheet or slide maker powered by LLMs make a dent?</p>



<p>Ultimately, the result of all this innovation in AI will lead to something very different than office software on a PC. It will feel like an extension of ourselves; part assistant, part machine. But we won’t get there without a leap of imagination akin to the PC itself. In the meantime, there’s work to do.</p>



you writing with a doc writing with you



 The document editor 



<p>One of the main forms of work we do on our computers is writing, but the document editor itself has always been more about the formatting of words than the words themselves. Market success for these apps has also been driven more by their modes of distribution than product innovations.</p>



<p>WordPerfect was the early leader but ceded the field to Microsoft by failing to make a Windows version early on. Each new release of Windows was an occasion for the next version of Word, sold separately on a disc.</p>



<p>Google changed little about Word when it released Docs on the web in 2006, but it had a distribution advantage…it was on the web. In 2010 Google acquired the technology to let multiple people edit Microsoft Office documents on the web simultaneously. Online distribution and collaboration completely changed the way teams worked together. All Microsoft could do was follow suit with what became Office 365.</p>



<p>There have been many challenger doc editors over the years, Hemingway, Ulysses, Dropbox Paper, Salesforce Quip and most prominently today, Notion. Many of these apps aimed to simplify the writing experience, but Notion bypassed the old paradigm all together. There are no “pages” or skeuomorphisms, just documents fit for the internet age, designed for a screen and built to connect. Unsurprisingly, Notion has also been quick to <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">incorporate generative AI into its product</a> in a seamless way.</p>



<p>Coming at the problem sideways, Canva has continued to expand its offerings beyond social media and marketing graphics and recently released a document editing application that includes a generative “magic write” feature. There may be an upcoming generation of social-first entrepreneurs for whom Canva represents their office suite.</p>



<p>The big emerging opportunities for doc editors in the age of generative text is to innovate on the writing experience itself. As AI researcher Katy Gero recently wrote in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-writing-art/">Wired</a>, AI can intervene in three distinct parts of the writing process, planning, drafting and revising. Current generative systems focus on the first two. Most applications will draft sentences and paragraphs for you as a completion of your prompt. More sophisticated approaches might return an outline for a blog post based on a headline.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big emerging opportunities for doc editors in the age of generative text is to innovate on the writing experience itself. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Just as the writing process is iterative, generative writing assistants also work best as recursive loops that the writer uses to converge on their desired outcome. It is not hard to imagine generative agents trained on constructive criticism that can offer feedback from different perspectives as you revise your piece. Eventually we may come to take this virtual writers’ room for granted as we do spell check today.</p>



<p>The first breakout text generation apps, like Jasper and Copy.ai, specialize in marketing copy. Their early success may be an artifact of the preponderance of marketing language in the training data for LLMs themselves. Nonetheless Jasper is a good example of a challenger playing the SaaS marketing game well. Following the HubSpot playbook it has cultivated a very enthusiastic community and created an engaging product. By relying on GPT-3 for its model infrastructure, it has been able to focus its efforts on the hard work of building its own distribution channel.</p>



<p>The biggest market for AI enhanced writing apps may turn out to be people who find writing difficult with current tools. This will take a more holistic approach than the first crop of vertical writing tools and the imagination to remake the writing process. Lex is an early stage generative writing product that pairs a fully featured doc editor with both generative prompts and an adjacent chatbot that can gather facts and answer questions to supplement the writer’s efforts. AI affords new ways of working which means novel and delightful product thinking can really make a difference.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Future applications will go much further: they will guide brands and individuals towards creating qualitatively exceptional content.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Applications can also combine generative feedback with traditional analytics and ML pattern matching. Jasper, for instance, provides SEO metrics on generated text. Future applications will go much further: they will guide brands and individuals towards creating qualitatively exceptional content.</p>



<p>Exceptionalism is one of the most promising areas for startups because it falls outside the scope of the large office suites. Brands and eventually individuals will want to fine-tune underlying models to capture their own unique voice. Right now, generative text sounds plausible yet generic. In Jasper’s premium Boss Mode you can add “tone of voice” keywords to your prompt (e.g. “Elon Musk”) much as you can add style suggestions (e.g. “digital art”) in image generation apps. But organizations and individuals want their writing to sound differentiated. We value a high-quality writer for their voice, not just their word count. There will be demand for easy ways to take your proprietary corpus of text and fine-tune a model on it.</p>



<p>Finally, looping back around to the planning process, generative models trained on code, like OpenAI’s Codex, have demonstrated emergent abilities for “chain of thought” and complex reasoning. It is possible that the doc editor of the future will be able to poke holes in your argument and not just give you a series of bullets based on what millions of other people have already written.</p>



math is still math



 The spreadsheet 



<p>Visicalc, the original spreadsheet for the Apple II, was the first “killer app,” a program so valuable to business and academic users that it gave them a pressing reason to buy the whole computer. Microsoft actually launched the first version of Excel for the Mac in 1985 before following on for Windows two years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even more than the document editor, spreadsheets flourished in the graphical user interface. Where Word over-indexed on formatting, Excel delivered increasingly sophisticated functionality to the point that Excel formulas are now the world’s most popular programming language. For geeks, Microsoft’s introduction of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/lambda-the-ultimatae-excel-worksheet-function">LAMBDA</a> functions in 2021 makes Excel Turing complete.</p>



<p>Google Sheets, launched in 2006, has kept rough feature parity with Excel, but as with Docs its main differentiator has been online distribution which eased collaboration. Excel appeals to power users with macros, larger data capacity and more visualization options than Sheets. Both spreadsheets have ventured into automated data analysis and formula suggestions in recent years potentially blocking new AI-powered challengers. And Google’s new <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/12/introducing-simple-ml-for-sheets.html">Simple ML</a> add-on for Google Sheets puts TensorFlow within the grasp of no-coders.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bringing computational abilities to words and images is a new thing, but spreadsheets are computational to their core. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>There is however no true Notion-like competitor in the spreadsheet space for the hard core spreadsheet user. If you’re embarrassed to touch a mouse when in a spreadsheet (guilty as charged!), Airtable or Rows won’t do it for you. But automating quantitative work in spreadsheets should be a slam dunk application for this new era. Most likely this will not come primarily through generative approaches but from more rigorous formal methods. Math is still math.</p>



<p>GPT3 turns out to integrate quite easily into existing spreadsheets via extensions that add =GPT() functions. It’s also possible to use language models to transform text prompts into working spreadsheet formulas. And perhaps a prompt interface could streamline tedious data cleaning and validating? Another application we would love to see would be the ability to specify synthetic data to fill out spreadsheets for modeling purposes.</p>



<p>The biggest moat for incumbent spreadsheets is inertia and user familiarity. Yet it’s easy to forget that spreadsheets themselves already represent a tremendous amount of automation. Bringing computational abilities to words and images is a new thing, but spreadsheets are computational to their core. The biggest disruption may be the merger of spreadsheets into document environments (see Notion and Coda) to create code notebooks for office workers.&nbsp;</p>



a magical experience



 The presentation maker 



<p>Powerpoint is an island of creativity in office life and unsurprisingly presentations are the only part of the office suite that Apple has had traction. Slideshows seem primed for their generative AI moment, but decks themselves are unlikely to overturn the reign of the big office suites. But if presentations peel away from the suite—if Powerpoint is no longer good enough—the result could weaken the bundle.</p>



<p>Powerpoint and Slides have become design software for non-designers, but challengers like Canva are now applying the social media toolset to decks. Figma has made inroads with designers for making slides and offers FigJam for non-designers. Notion, a suite unto itself, has become a favorite of startup founders for their pitch decks.</p>



<p>One thing the main challengers in the presentations space—Figma and Notion—have in common is their emphasis on community as a way of building out functionality through templates and plugins. Figma’s plugin ecosystem provided a fast ramp to incorporate AI features like prompt-driven prototypes and generative icons without any changes to the core product. These communities are not technically open source, but they share the enthusiasm and good will associated with it. As we’ve seen with Hugging Face, open source represents an important distribution medium for AI technologies as do energized user communities. Any challenger who wants to enter these markets will have to build a productive fan base.</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<p>Figma has had a big effect on the way design software has encroached on the bastion of the office suite in many companies. As products like Retool and Github Co-pilot make it 10x easier to build and code internal tools, a much wider swath of office workers will become engaged in making products which inevitably need to be wireframed and designed. We will address the AI disruptions to the worlds of design and code in a forthcoming post.</p>



<p>As with generative text, companies and individual designers will want to put their stamp on the visuals, so there may be a multi-modal platform play for a product that can ingest brand assets and spit out fine-tuned models for use across generative apps.</p>



<p>A real presentation standout at the moment is Tome, which is generative AI native, not a bolt on. It is currently in beta but has the ability to generate entire slide decks from a prompt, make variations of individual slides or add new ones and rewrite lines of text. This is the kind of magical work experience that people expect when they see Midjourney or ChatGPT and it may be that slide decks will be its first natural home.</p>
 







 
 A new kind of work 



<p>What does an enduring AI-native company look like? Will it follow the playbook of the PC era and be the next version of the word processor or spreadsheet? Will it follow the AWS model and provide metered infrastructure for personalized AI workloads? Even better, will it be the next Microsoft, Google or Apple, integrating human and AI workers into new operating systems and hardware?</p>



<p>Obviously, big tech companies with massive investments in AI are not going to let their incumbent distribution advantage slip away easily. Yet their business models and scale place them in an innovator’s dilemma that impedes their embrace of the new products and services that could undermine them.</p>



<p>Disruption is inevitable. The world of highly-distributed AI applications capable of producing human-level work products is very different from the winner-take-all mass distribution of the internet era. Ironically, it was this extreme centralization that pushed the internet corpus to the critical mass that made the scale of large language models possible.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<p>There are clear dangers, though, in accepting machine outputs as “good enough.” For individual workers there is the risk of producing large amounts of mediocre work. Knowledge work, whether marketing or scientific research, is valuable to the extent that it is particular and excellent. Not all knowledge work needs to be “true” in a factual sense, but it all needs to be “correct” for its intended purpose. The raw ability of AI systems to produce content places an even larger premium on our judgment and critical thinking skills.</p>



<p>For organizations, the profusion of generative outputs will create obvious risks of inappropriate content but also less obvious ones like cultural drift. If they rely on third-party models supplied through applications they risk losing control of their own message. Top brands will want to fine-tune their models for their voice and style while also hiring and retaining workers that can tell the difference. After all, successful businesses are different from their competitors.</p>

 Learn what metadata is, who can access it and how to protect&nbsp;it <p>Data Privacy Day is on 28 January this year! It is the perfect occasion to take stock of where we are when it comes to online privacy protections. In good news, end-to-end encryption is becoming firmly established as the norm. There is now broad recognition that good privacy protections enable secure online communication. In addition, secure communications is the very basis for meaningful online interactions, from social life to commerce.</p><p>But as the sheer volume of digital communications continues to increase — and with the advent of AI driven surveillance — it is no longer the content of your message that matters, but its metadata. In fact, the metadata can often reveal things about your life far more accurately than the content. Your message content might contain your thoughts and opinions, but the metadata reveals your&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Consider this metaphor: you have a bird’s eye view of a busy city. You are watching the cars as they travel through the bustling traffic of the city. Now, from your position you cannot see what or who is inside any given car. But you CAN see its color and size, what house it leaves from at what time, where it is going, how frequently it travels between those addresses and more. From that information, you can deduce quite a lot about what is going on: who is visiting whom, the nature of their relationship, even details about their health, habits, wealth and more. This, in short, is metadata.</p><p>In this blogpost we give a primer on metadata surveillance and what can be done about&nbsp;it.</p> What is ‘metadata’? <p>Firstly, what is metadata really? It is the data about your message, including its:</p>  Origin  Type  Destination  Time  Length  Size  <p>…and pretty much any other identifiable patterns of your messages.</p> What can it be used&nbsp;for? <p>Metadata can be analysed to reveal internet traffic patterns. These patterns are like a fingerprint, in fact there is a type of attack called “website fingerprinting”! In these types of attacks, someone would download all the pages on a website, analyse the metadata of these pages and then match these to the patterns of traffic. They can thereby learn which specific page a person might be looking at. Now, imagine the website for example provides health&nbsp;advice!</p><p>In short, metadata can&nbsp;reveal:</p>  Which specific web page you visit, even over&nbsp;HTTPS  Which web domain you request over encrypted DNS  What you are typing, even in an encrypted web application (search, taxes,&nbsp;health)  What you say in a voice conversation over encrypted voice&nbsp;channel  <p>…and more.</p> Why is metadata valuable? <p>So metadata reveals a lot, but there are other reasons for why it is valuable for anyone wanting to spy on&nbsp;people.</p>  It is machine readable, making it the preferred target in AI driven surveillance and makes it easy to analyse large volumes of&nbsp;data.  It doesn’t take up much storage, compared to say a video file, which means it is easy to collect and store lots of&nbsp;it.  It is openly available!  It is currently unprotected by the&nbsp;law.   Who has access to metadata? <p>Unfortunately, metadata is largely unprotected, meaning there are a lot of actors who have direct access to it. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Internet Service Providers  Internet Exchanges  Autonomous systems  BGP routers  Internet backbone  Even your wifi router,&nbsp;LAN  <p>…and eavesdroppers, including, famously, the&nbsp;NSA.</p> So what can we do about&nbsp;it? <p>The most effective protection against metadata surveillance today are mixnets. Let’s go back to our original metaphor. Now imagine you are looking down at the busy city, but all the cars are identical. And what is more, they pass through tunnels and under bridges, where they then emerge from but you cannot pinpoint which car is exactly which and if they have changed lanes or&nbsp;not.</p><p>This is essentially what a mixnet does. It encrypts internet packets in layers of encryption that make all packets look identical. It then ‘mixes’ these packets by having them route through three layers of what are called ‘mix nodes’ where they are mixed with other identical looking packets and micro time delays are added. It becomes pretty much impossible to trace and analyse who is speaking to who. A mixnet makes it impossible for a snooper to&nbsp;know:</p>  What you are&nbsp;saying  Who you are communicating with (sending or receiving messages)  When you are communicating  How long you are communicating  From where you are communicating  The amount of data you are sending or receiving  Any patterns in you communications  Whether you are communicating at&nbsp;all  <p>Nym is a decentralised, permissionless mixnet run by node operators all over the world. This is cybersecurity for and by a global community. And what is more, there is a token to make sure that this community of operators and supporters is sustained in the long&nbsp;term!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p>Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market (in 2018 eight of the top ten best-selling drugs worldwide were biologics). Targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), therapeutic proteins that bind to specific target sites, have become a cornerstone of treatment guidelines for a wide range of solid tumors, resulting in improved outcomes by reducing the severe side effects of conventional chemotherapy. However, the tumor microenvironment continues to pose physical barriers that hinder the penetration of macromolecules into solid tumors — even antibody fragments are unable to saturate the tumor and achieve uniform distributions due to shorter half&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Creasallis is developing its own antibody engineering platform, CreaTap, aimed at improving the penetration of antibodies into the tumor microenvironment while ensuring a long enough half-life to provide the best of mAbs and antibody fragments. The founder, Zahra Jawad, has spent 15 years in antibody engineering at GSK and Agenus and was most recently head of programs at&nbsp;bit.bio.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>The market for antibodies (valued at over $186 billion in 2021) has continued to grow as the number of approved novel therapies rises, primarily driven by the ability to treat complex diseases. We believe that Creasallis’ antibody platform can be a single, plug-and-play engineering solution which can serve the antibody oncology market. Moreover, pairing CreaTap with existing antibodies could enable better half-life and efficacy and also prolong the exclusivity life cycle of blockbuster antibodies, while delaying the emergence of biosimilars (copies of previously successful biologics), making it an attractive opportunity for partnerships with large&nbsp;pharma.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/zahra-jawad-724a2716">Zahra</a> and the entire Creasallis team on their mission to make antibody therapies available to a much larger patient population.</p>

<p>The DERO Foundation is happy to be announcing some of the new features that are going to be included in the next release of Engram. The Engram Team has been working very hard on all these features so first and foremost I want to thank them for all of their hard work. This next release is truly a home run and I hope you all appreciate it as much I&nbsp;do.</p>Engram GUI Wallet for&nbsp;DERO<p>Now that we have that out of the way, we’ll move on to the fun stuff. We’re going to go over some things that are included and a few things that were removed from Engram. First we’ll start with a list of what was added to Engram in this&nbsp;release.</p><p>Sending and receiving funds and assets natively — this may be a given for funds but the ability to also be able to send and receive assets is a welcome upgrade for most users. An easy to use GUI interface for this is vital for making DERO NFTs and Tokens easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>An Easier UI/UX — Many changes here to make Engram easier to use/troubleshoot, error handling and feedback as well as all common and known issues have been fixed. There has also been some graphical updates that make the wallet feel smoother and make the User Experience just that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Private Messaging — Fees for messaging are now lower, more feature have been added and the UI has been improved for a better experience overall.</p><p>Gnomon Support — Gnomon is a decentralized search engine which is mostly used for searching for and identifying assets on smart contracts and is essential to the underlying functionality of certain dApps. It’s very powerful as well as useful and now supported.</p><p>Asset Tracking — Now, thanks to Gnomon support, Engram has built in asset tracking and management. Users can actually see the assets they own as well as send/receive directly from&nbsp;Engram.</p><p>Human-readable addresses (Usernames) — Engram now fully supports human readable addresses including the ability to register them, this was a hurdle for a lot of users trying to get their human readable addresses but now it’s super easy! For those that don’t know, on the <a href="https://www.dero.io">DERO blockchain</a> you can register a wallet address to a short, easy to remember name instead of using a long string of numbers and letters. For example, you could use the address “cupcake” to have people send you funds. Names are case sensitive though, so make sure you always pay attention to spelling and capitalization, it&nbsp;matters!</p><p>File Signing/Verification — With the next release of engram you perform file signing within the wallet. You can essentially verify files as if you were signing them with&nbsp;GPG.</p><p>Encrypting/Decrypting data — Not only can you verify files, you can also encrypt data strings. This feature doesn’t support full file encryption yet but for now you can encrypt smaller strings of data similar to an encrypted notepad.</p><p>Smart contract deployment/execution — Now, I asked in a twitter poll that included four features and asked users which one they wanted to hear about the most. This one by far was the subject people wanted to know about. In the new Engram wallet users will not only be able to dynamically interact with smart contracts in the wallet, they will be able to launch them using a&nbsp;GUI.</p><p>This makes launching smart contracts (even for us mere mortals) super easy to do. While this hasn’t been an issue for developers to use, the fact it will be so easy using Engram just lowers the barrier to entry even further to those that want to launch their own contracts without using complicated command line based RPC&nbsp;calls.</p><p>Smart contracts will be able to be launched by the wallet but there will also be an additional check to make sure that the contract parses correctly in DVM to at least catch some issues before launch. So, overall this should be a pretty cool feature for everyday users and developers alike.</p><p>Last but not least, let’s checkout Netrunner.</p>Netrunner — DERO Network&nbsp;Gateway<p>Now that the Engram team has given some key details on what they have added to the next release of Engram, let’s quickly cover what has been removed for stability reasons. This should help users who have been having issues with the wallet crashes. The following two items were removed from Engram but there is a standalone alternative already in place&nbsp;:</p>  Integrated Miner  Integrated Daemon  <p>These two items were just bundled together as a standalone GUI daemon and miner called <a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">Netrunner</a>. You can get Netrunner at the address below to easily run your own DERO node and CPU&nbsp;mine.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner</a></p><p>Users that want to run their own node and mine with a GUI can still run Netrunner at the same time they are running Engram. Separating the daemon and miner from the Engram wallet itself was only done in order to fix the stability issues some users had and prevent&nbsp;panics.</p><p>Overall, this is going to make DERO even easier to use for more users and unlocking more utility on the blockchain by making it more accessible to everyday users. Having cutting edge technology while making it easy to use has always been the goal of the DERO project and the Engram team has delivered on that&nbsp;front!</p><p>As always, stay tuned and keep an eye out for the official release of the all new Engram&nbsp;wallet!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/update-for-the-engram-gui-wallet-for-dero-is-full-of-new-features-79cdf84fe9a7">Update for the Engram GUI wallet for DERO is full of new features</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of a new frontier in biology and medicine unparalleled in human history. Scientific advances like the latest generation of CRISPR, new computational methods, entirely new cell and gene therapies, cell-free synthetic biology and breakthroughs we cannot even imagine today will unlock the applications and treatments of the future. Moreover, as the precision of molecular interventions and cell delivery systems improve, and manufacturing infrastructure matures, these technologies will have a positive impact on millions of people around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>At the same time new technology / tooling is changing the biology game along a few vectors: i) cost ii) ability to program, simulate and iterate and iii) entrepreneurial accessibility. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. This includes biotechnology, therapeutics, advanced diagnostics, precision medicine and genomics, as well as synthetic biology, which has the ability to revolutionise the production of advanced materials and ingredients (i.e., alternative proteins, textiles, fertilizers, energy, flavors&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>We are looking for individuals who can stake a claim at the intersection of these multiple evolving fields in human health and biology and bring a holistic view to make sense of how nature inspired technologies can transform the fundamental well-being and longevity of every human being on our&nbsp;planet.</p><p>As a generalist firm, BlueYard views the biology companies, networks and protocols we invest in as key parts of a broader fabric of systems for a more decentralized, sustainable and empowered future and we plan to continue to apply this core thesis in health, life sciences and synthetic biology (e.g. <a href="https://www.bit.bio/">Bit.Bio</a>, <a href="https://biofidelity.com/">Biofidelity</a>, <a href="https://clock.bio/">Clock.bio</a>, <a href="https://www.creasallis.com/">Creasallis</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/expressionedits-6ffe6b6b1db2">ExpressionEdits</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">Insempra.bio</a>, <a href="https://www.meatable.com/">Meatable,</a> <a href="https://www.positive.co/">Positive.co</a>, <a href="https://www.rarebase.org/">Rarebase</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/visolis-8bed9fafa93c">Visolis</a>, <a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a>), but also beyond to areas such as breakthrough engineering efforts (e.g. <a href="https://www.chemify.io/">Chemify</a>, <a href="https://www.corintis.com/">Corintis</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/freedomfi-302ef8fae260">FreedomFi</a>, <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a>, <a href="https://seeqc.com/">Seeqc</a>, <a href="https://spaero.bio/">Spaero</a>, <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a>), crypto protocols (e.g. <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a>, <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a>) and new economic operating systems (e.g. <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a>, <a href="https://dance.co/">Dance</a>, <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a>, etc.). Anyone joining team BlueYard should be excited about the prospect of connecting the dots and learning about new fields, some of which might be out of your comfort&nbsp;zone.</p><p>We are excited to be expanding the BlueYard team with a Principal position, either remote or based in Berlin, supporting the team in finding and backing entrepreneurs that are decentralizing markets and empowering humanity. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs, and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small and value-driven team, we want to hear from&nbsp;you.</p><p>The Principal role includes:</p>  Leading investments in synthetic biology, health and life&nbsp;sciences  Sourcing new opportunities mainly across Europe and the&nbsp;US  Working directly with the two General Partners, embedded in a small team, allowing for a steep learning curve and significant exposure to the entrepreneurial ecosystem  Helping develop our brand and portfolio / founder services for biology and life&nbsp;sciences  Identifying technologies and trends that will positively impact economies and societies and represent attractive venture investment opportunities  Carrying out market and company due diligence on investment opportunities  Working with our portfolio companies to support&nbsp;them  Helping with our community management and&nbsp;events  Supporting with fund reporting and&nbsp;analyses  <p>Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:</p>  A strong understanding of and passion for life sciences (biology, medicine, or similar).  Several years in a biology / life science investing role or equivalent business / corporate development experience  Self-(fire)starter — be able to run on your own, identify opportunities and prioritise without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets and companies, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Ability to carry out market and financial analyses  Native (or close to) English language skills both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>If you are interested in the position please send the following to <a href="mailto:team@blueyard.com">team@blueyard.com</a>:</p>  Your CV  If applicable, a collection of links that best characterize your online&nbsp;presence  <p>Our process will then be as&nbsp;follows:</p>  After initial screening we will invite selected candidates for a video interview  We will then invite a limited group of candidates for personal interview with both the team and our entrepreneurs in Berlin (or remote as appropriate for health&nbsp;safety)  A decision will be made shortly thereafter

<p>Guest Post By Christopher Roth</p>
<p>Leaving San Luis Obispo and heading northwest on Highway 1, you travel through several canyons – where the hillsides are decorated with a wonderful peppery scented mix of sagebrush and chaparral.&nbsp; The steeper canyon ridges are interspersed with gently sloping pastureland that is studded with the captivating elegance and expansive crown of Quercus agrifolia, the Coastal Live Oak.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain times of the year this landscape alone can resemble some sort of bizarre hybrid world – when surreal pastel base tones are overlaid with <a href="https://thomaskinkade.com/">Kinkadian</a><a>[1]</a> light filters cutting through swirling mist.&nbsp; When that dense Pacific Ocean marine layer pushes into the canyons one can spot little elfin foglets dancing in emerald fields as they evaporate in imagined splendor.&nbsp; It can be quite beautiful.&nbsp; Then you break out of the canyon, and on those clear, typically cloudless afternoons, you are confronted with the magnificent sight of a living behemoth – Morro Rock.</p>
<p>Morro Rock, if you have never seen it, is an impressive feature of the California coastline.&nbsp; Morro Rock has been known as a sacred site to at least two first world peoples in the area, the Northern Chumash Tribe, and the Salinan Indians. Just one of the “Nine Sisters” (or nine volcanic peaks in San Luis Obispo County), Morro Rock is part of a relatively small, long since extinct volcanic complex from the Oligocene epoch that formed over 23 million years ago. Morro Rock is the last of the Sisters and is the only one that sits at the water’s edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Salinan people called it Lesa’mo’ and believed it to be a holy place where the Hawk (or Falcon) and Raven of ancient legend lured the two-headed serpent <a href="http://morro-bay.com/morsels/dillon/">Taliyekatapelta</a> to the rock where it wrapped itself around the base.&nbsp; As the beast chased them into the air the birds took their knives and cut the Serpent to pieces.&nbsp; Salinan elder John Burch remembered when he was as boy his grandmother would take him to the top of Morro Rock twice a year, on the calendar Solstice’s, to commemorate the defeat of the two-headed Taliyekatapelta.<a>[2]</a></p>
<p>The council members of the Northern Chumash Tribe, however, have come to believe that the Rock was so sacred that it should never be climbed.&nbsp; The Chumash called the rock Lisamu and insisted that “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-morro-rock-20150314-story.html">Lisamu is alive with life</a> that needs to be protected and honored, not trampled upon.”<a>[3]</a>&nbsp; Since becoming a state park Morro Rock had been deemed a critical species habitat and provided an immense rookery for migratory and seafaring birds as well as raptors like the once endangered peregrine falcon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sparing the reader from the full-fledged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring">Silent Spring</a><a>[4]</a> debacle and the tendency for DDT to remain in the soil for decades, it should be noted that the peregrine falcon was an endangered species, for reasons we will not fully investigate here, and it was the kind of endangered species that was adored by the American public and Government scientists alike.&nbsp; Being a raptor, it hunts with uncanny vision and kills its food, reaching top speeds of up to 240 mph in its signature swoop.&nbsp; It hits its prey from above, knocking it unconscious before carrying it off to its nest to be picked apart by its brood.&nbsp; It is the fastest bird in the world, and it is renowned for its maneuvering abilities and trainability alike.&nbsp; It is an apex predator and has been used in falconry across the planet for thousands of years.&nbsp; In other words, it is precisely the kind of animal humans love to worship and Governments love to promote.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1969, climbing the rock was made illegal.&nbsp; By that time, Silent Spring had been out for over five years and pressure was mounting from the public to establish Morro Rock as a peregrine falcon preserve.&nbsp; It was an obvious place to make studies and record data with easy to document declines in several bird populations, not just the falcons.&nbsp; On January 1st, 1969, Morro Rock was designated California historical landmark 821 and the entire surrounding area became a State Park and peregrine falcon wildlife preserve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the years before it was afforded state protections, Morro Rock had been quarried extensively, losing up to 40% of its natural mass since colonial contact.&nbsp; Originally it was blown up to provide the rock to build the Port San Luis Breakwater between 1889 and 1913.&nbsp; According to <a href="https://www.spl.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/3141283/corps-joins-chumash-to-celebrate-reunification-of-morro-rock/">construction records</a>, approximately 250 tons of stone was taken from Morro Rock to build the breakwater.<a>[5]</a>&nbsp; And as listed on the Port of San Luis website the breakwater at the Port of San Luis wharf was constructed by <a href="https://www.portsanluis.com/2206/Port-History">congressional action</a> to provide safe harbor for the export of cattle and agriculture goods and import of lumber and dry goods.<a>[6]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morro Rock continued to be quarried off and on as needed through the decades, all the way up until It’s 1969 landmark status.&nbsp; In addition to the Port San Luis breakwater material, the stone for the enhancements at Morro Bay and structures around Morro Rock itself, including the present-day causeway connecting the rock to the shore, was also blasted off the massive rock face.&nbsp; It is hard to imagine the original size of Morro Rock and how it might have looked before it was pilfered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, before American Industrialists set up shop, and even before the Spanish missionaries and ranchos had established their dominion in the area, Morro Rock was an island, surrounded by water.&nbsp; In her research paper titled Preserving Nature and Culture at Morro Rock Angela Dillon wrote of a time she spoke with “Patti,” the sister of the well-known Salinan Tribal member John Burch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dillon recounted a phone conversation she had with Patti in March of 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patti told Dillon a story that when Patti’s mother was a little girl, water completely surrounded Lesa’mo’ and that “Kids would take rowboats out to the rock, but they were unable to land because of the hundreds of little black rattlesnakes that inhabited it.”</p>
<p>Patti also explained to Dillon that the Salinan’s believed that “all rattlesnakes originated from those on Morro Rock.” Dillon opined in her paper that perhaps this is the reason behind the ancient Legend of Falcon and Raven defeating the serpent, the rattlesnakes being the remnants of the many cut up pieces of Taliyekatapelta that fell back to the land.&nbsp; Patti also told Angela that “John had been climbing Morro Rock since he was a teenager” and wanted to obtain “legal” permission so he could continue to do so.<a>[7]</a></p>
<p>Thus, if Burch had been climbing Lesa’mo’ all those years in accordance with his tribal customs and rituals, Dillon found it a bit irresistible to ponder as to precisely why Burch had waited until the year 2000 to express his interest in “legally” obtaining a permit to ascend the rock and resume age old tribal traditions with the state’s permission.&nbsp; John Burch’s case sounded sincere.&nbsp; What sort of elite educated environmentalist or overly patronizing government agency wouldn’t abide with such a modest request by one lone Indian?&nbsp; Joe Mette, Superintendent of California Department of Parks and Recreation said at the time: “It’s broadly the policy of the department to allow reasonable requests for religious practices to take place on state park property.”<a>[8]</a></p>
<p>Although the Northern Chumash were believed to be the exclusive inhabitants of the area, John Burch from the Salinan Tribe was awarded a permit from the CA State Parks Department in the year 2000 to climb the rock for “ceremonial purposes.” By 2006, the Salinan Indians, the CA State Parks administration, and the Native American Heritage Commission had sketched a use plan for a select number of Salinan tribal members to legally climb the rock on certain pre-ordained dates.<a>[9]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps by chance, but the year 2000 was also around the same time that the Duke Energy Corporation, who was at the time the lawful owner of the old PG&amp;E steam plant directly adjacent Morro Rock, announced their intention to demolish the three iconic towers and build a new, more modern power generation station.&nbsp; Had that demolition gone through, the company would have been required by law to have any associated tribal members present to oversee excavation should artifacts or burial grounds be unearthed.&nbsp; As indicated in Dillon’s paper, some of the peregrine egg counting environmentalists and some of the local Chumash people suspected Burch may have been attempting to curry favor with Duke Energy executives in the hopes he might be awarded the responsibility of monitoring their construction project on behalf of the Salinan tribe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Salinan tribe, being much smaller in tribal enrollment numbers than the federally recognized Santa Ynez band of Chumash Indians, (and the unrecognized Northern Band of Chumash Indians) could certainly have benefited from the added attention in the spotlight.&nbsp; The process for a tribal community to become ‘federally recognized’ in the modern legal sense of the word is daunting.&nbsp; It takes years, more typically decades, and along the way it often divides whatever fragile tribal community existed as the Elders who have been holding their people together for generations are once again forced to make concessions and negotiate with the Federal Government of the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the year 2022, many modern tribes still struggled to gain recognition. I have imagined this process for the present-day Indian to entail a sort of hybrid necromancy whereby the Indian is asked to make a pledge to join the same violent fraternity that has violated him and denied him so many times before. &nbsp;Hazing rituals may include reanimating generational bloodline traumas for the sole purpose of extracting tokenized relics that could establish legitimacy before the courts and possible trading rights with the enemy.&nbsp; But then, at the very last minute, the whole hazing ritual will be exposed as a cruel joke, an elaborate production – and the room will be flooded with spotlights, leaving the poor Indian naked and exposed in his religion and worldview.&nbsp; There he stands, the entire audience staring at him, laughing at him, amused amongst themselves that he fell for the same trick, again.</p>
<p>I will not speculate a definitive motivation as to the ‘why’ and the ‘when’ John Burch appealed for ‘permission’ from the state government when he did.&nbsp; For purposes of this discussion, it does not matter.&nbsp; What does matter is that regardless of his sincerity, John Burch drew criticism from both Northern Chumash tribal members and peregrine falcon crazed environmentalists.&nbsp; In fairness of the environmentalists, there was a substantial return on investment at stake.&nbsp; “Under a cooperative effort among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state wildlife agencies, The Peregrine Fund, Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, and the Midwestern Peregrine Falcon Restoration Project, more than <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yuch/learn/nature/peregrine-falcons-recovery.htm#:~:text=In%20August%201999%2C%20the%20U.S.,of%20the%20Endangered%20Species%20Act.">6,000 American peregrines</a> have been released since 1974.”<a>[10]</a></p>
<p>Infringement into the sensitive falcon habitat of the rookery atop Morro Rock was deemed necessary if performed as part of an employee’s official duties.&nbsp; Authorized state agents and assigned personnel need not bother to obtain permission to do their job.&nbsp; Officially, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife list of Endangered and Threatened Species in August of 1999.&nbsp; However, post-delisting monitoring was set to continue until 2015.<a>[11]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘to climb or not to climb’ dispute continued well past the Duke Energy plans to demolish the power plant.&nbsp; The Chumash, despite admitting that their peoples had ascended to the top of the rock for ceremonies in the past, now insisted they would be content honoring those ancient traditions at the base of the rock.&nbsp; The Northern Chumash Tribal Council (a separate entity then the Federally recognized Ynez Band of Chumash) went so far as to file suit in 2014 to prevent any claim by Salinan people to the rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dennis J. Balsamo, attorney for the Northern Chumash council, wrote in documents submitted to San Luis Obispo County Superior Court that “there is no historic or religious connection between the ancient Salinan people and Morro Rock.”<a>[12]</a>&nbsp; The documents further asserted that the historic boundary between the two tribes was forty miles to the north at Ragged Point in Monterey County, as researched by the anthropologist Robert O. Gibson.</p>
<p>State Law in California required that the state parks department consult with Native American tribes when sacred sites of first world peoples are caught up in public works projects or marred in controversy.&nbsp; The <a href="https://nahc.ca.gov/about/">Native American Heritage Commission</a><a>[13]</a> was an organization set up in 1976 by the State of California legislature to, among other duties, act as legal counsel or mediator in such disputes as the one that brewed between the Salinan and Northern Chumash tribes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a letter dated December 4th, 2017, the Commission reached the conclusion that while “Morro Rock is sacred for many Tribal communities and individuals…any climbing of the Rock should be prohibited in accordance with federal law.”<a>[14]</a> At the time of this writing, that letter was still proudly displayed on the <a href="https://northernchumash.org/2017/12/20/honoring-lisamu/">Northern Chumash Tribal website</a>.</p>
<p>To reach this rather unclimactic finding, the NAHC contracted with two Doctors who served on the State University payroll as college professors, both of whom had “extensive education and experience” and were “experts in this field.”&nbsp; No substantiation was given as to how the experts had arrived at this distinction and no further appeal was made by the Salinan to divulge the processes the University Doctors and NAHC had used in their determination.&nbsp; The peregrine falcon, perhaps itself a descendant of the mighty bird that defeated Taliyekatapelta, had been deemed the winner and was granted supreme roost on the rock.</p>
<p>The state, always eager to absolve itself of guilt (past present or future), evaded further entanglement by reminding both tribes that Federal Law (predominantly the Endangered Species Act and its lingering preserve for peregrine falcons) should trump any ancestral claims to the rock.&nbsp; The state, despite acknowledging the rock is in fact state property and as such, did possess all legal authority necessary to permit or deny religious observances on top of the rock if it desired, did an about face and denied either party the right to climb the rock.&nbsp; The state did this by enacting collaboration between two experts who also served on the state payroll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lest I remind the reader, this is the same state who had acted as benefactor at the request of federal legislators a century prior to blast Morro Rock apart and build the Port of San Luis breakwater.&nbsp; This is the same state that led the nation and developed its own <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bk-2018-1283.ch001">pesticide law in 1901</a> requiring manufacturers to guarantee their concentrations.<a>[15]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Northern Chumash Tribal council insisted this was some sort of victory for their Tribe and that “from now and into the future our most sacred Lisamu (Morro Rock) will be honored in a good way.”<a>[16]</a></p>
<p>I see no winners. Nor do I see any losers.&nbsp; I see only confusion.&nbsp; I see confused souls swimming in a sea of cognitive dissonance where the continued tides of state violence ebb and flow, lapping relentlessly against the dwindling memories of a people that refuse to die, who refuse to drown as they bob helplessly looking for a ‘permitted’ place to moor their lost souls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Morro Rock itself, the Salinan and the Chumash have been blasted apart and stripped of their natural inherent beauty as human beings.&nbsp; And as it too often the case, if anyone, or anything is to decide their lives shall be “improved,” it shall be at the sole permission of the same state or government or military that took away their birthright.</p>
<p>In August of 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held a ceremony called “Reunite the Rock.”&nbsp; The purpose of the celebration was to “welcome home” rock that had been quarried to build the breakwater.&nbsp; Many prominent Chumash leaders and people of other tribes gathered as pieces of the original Morro Rock returned by tomol (a type of planked, seafaring canoe made by the traditional Chumash) and the pieces were carried by human chain from the landing beach up the rocky shore where the stones were placed in a circle around a fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; Col. Julie Balten, the Corps’ LA District Manager said: “The story of this reunification is one of hope and collaboration,” and “It is the story of realizing what is possible if we work together for something greater than ourselves.”<a>[17]</a></p>
<p>Despite the fact that the Corps first approached the Northern Chumash in 2017 with their intent to merely remove and replace the stone during improvements to the breakwater, this recent event was orchestrated with much publicity as a way to, according to Balten, “support the indigenous people here, bring back some of their culture and reunite this rock.”&nbsp; Only in 2021 was it determined that new, more modern rock would be required for the breakwater improvements and that the “old stone” would in fact no longer be needed.&nbsp; Thus, despite this small concession, the ceremony marked the beginning of the return of Morro Rock.&nbsp; While the project is slated to return the displaced rock, the placement area will be approximately 1500 feet west of Morro Rock in an area designed to “provide ancillary environmental benefits to marine species.”<a>[18]</a></p>
<p>During the Reunite the Rock event one tribal community was noticeably absent, despite their long and well documented connection to the sacred landmark.&nbsp; On the <a href="https://salinantribe.com/">Salinan Tribe</a> website Robert Piatti, Council member, Cultural Preservation &amp; Protection Lead, offered his own opinion, quoted in full below following the Salinan Winter Solstice ascent of Morro Rock:</p>
<p>Welcome to Winter Solstice.&nbsp; We, the people today known as the Salinan Tribe, welcome all to the base of Lesa’mo’, Morro Rock, as we share food and stories, and members of our tribe ascend to celebrate all that is sacred.&nbsp; Sacred is the defining term – the Creator made the World, all the plants and animals, even all humans.&nbsp; I personally believe, as Lakota spiritualist Little Crow taught, “Everything is Sacred.&nbsp; Everything is Related.”</p>
<p>We are often asked, who owns Lesa’mo’, Morro Rock?&nbsp; Isn’t this Chumash land?&nbsp; Our answer is easy, but not simple.&nbsp; Morro Rock belongs to nobody, but rather, we, the Salinan Tribe, belong to Morro Rock.&nbsp; Our ancestors lived and prayed here, and we continue this today and tomorrow.&nbsp; We are still here, and we will remain.&nbsp; The very Western Civilization concept of “land ownership” is part of the heart of what troubles us all today.</p>
<p>Ignorance, greed and hatred are powerful evils.&nbsp; Just look at dysfunctional Sacramento, war-ravaged Ukraine, the assault on the spirit of American Democracy in Washington D.C. for examples, and the fractionation (it’s a word, look it up some time – fractionation) of today’s world is on display.&nbsp; Ignorance and greed win too often, and when they do, we all lose.&nbsp; I’ve been trying to fight against ignorance and greed and outright hatred of others for just a short time now, and in those fights, I find myself challenged to not let those characteristics find their way into my own thoughts and words.</p>
<p>I wish to bring up something that happened this year.&nbsp; The Army Corp of Engineers planned to bring rock material back to Lesa’mo, Morro Rock, under the belief that they were doing something right, or rather, trying to “correct a past wrong.”&nbsp; The Rock should never, ever have been quarried, dynamited, but the illusionary act of returning rock added nothing positive.&nbsp; Nothing made whole, nothing fixed, just a useless gesture from which some small groups of people profited.&nbsp; Several cheered this effort, some as a public relations act by a specific pretendian (pretend Indians = Pretendians) group claiming, “see, we did good.”&nbsp; Big woo hoo.&nbsp; Our tribal council made the educated decision to not support this effort of ignorance, as we believed and still do that it was a wasteful and futile effort.&nbsp; The returned rocks, that were dynamited and hauled away to build neighboring breakwaters, were always part of Lesa’mo’, but fractionalized and divided, just like the native peoples were by governments agents and church leaders.&nbsp; Still, those rocks knew that they remained part of Morro Rock, belonging to it no matter how far away.</p>
<p>Our traditional lands the Salinan People belong to count a large swath of what is now known as the Central Coast of California.&nbsp; Our 13 known villages stretched from Monterey County to the Santa Maria River, inland along the Temblor Mountains, an all along the coast, from Big Sur to south San Luis Obispo County.&nbsp; We lived along the length of the River now known as the Salinas with which we share our name, from its Adelaide headwaters flowing north into Monterey.&nbsp; But our ancestors – whether known today as Salinan, Chumash, Yokat, or European Colonizers – didn’t own any of that land.&nbsp; The Land owned them.&nbsp; They shared what they had with any who joined with them, as we do today.&nbsp; As we recognize the Creator’s truths – Everything Sacred, Everything Related; and celebrate Solstice together, I want to say that, if you are here, today you are Salinan.&nbsp; We are still here, and will be so tomorrow.<a>[19]</a></p>

      Optimizing for Human Connection        <p>By Athena Frost</p><p>Published January 24, 2023</p>        How Clari CEO Andy Byrne’s focus on human relationships led him to reimagine the revenue process with artificial intelligence.      



 
<p>When Andy Byrne was a child in the late ’70s and early ’80s, he remembers being fascinated by the stories his father, Donn, told when he came home from work. Donn ran a commercial real estate business, leasing space to tech startups in the greater Mountain View, California, area. He talked at the dinner table about companies like Fairchild Semiconductor turning ideas into transformational technology. Byrne was mesmerized with the promise of the burgeoning tech scene. “I just loved the idea that you could create something from nothing,” Byrne says.</p>



<p>But the dinner table conversations changed when Byrne was a young teen and his parents divorced. His mother, Joyce, worked to support herself, Byrne and his two siblings. Joyce had always played guitar, so she turned her hobby into a teaching business. Byrne recalls cranking out tablature mimeographs in the garage, which Joyce had turned into a music studio with carpeting lining the walls and floors. At the same time, she started another business selling space in coupon books. Byrne remembers stories of his mom sliding coupon books in mailboxes across town. He watched her transform her little coupon business into a successful publishing company, printing chamber of commerce books from San Jose to Walnut Creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne paid attention as his mom gradually grew her businesses. “Kids would come to the back, and she would teach guitar,” Byrne remembers, “and then her salespeople would come in, five or six of them, and she’s training them on how to sell,” he says. Watching Joyce hustle, observing her passion for people—her guitar students, her sales reps, her customers—Byrne was inspired to live up to his mom’s example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Byrne is the co-founder and CEO of Clari, an AI-powered revenue platform. Clari is the fourth company Byrne’s been involved with that has received funding from Sequoia, and after more than 30 years of working together, Sequoia partner Jim Goetz describes Byrne as exceedingly thoughtful and patient. A serial entrepreneur and two-time CEO, Byrne has clearly succeeded as a builder. But today, shaped by the lessons of both success and loss, he says the key to effective leadership is a focus on building up people above all else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Byrne studied economics at the University of Nevada, Reno, and in 1994, went to San José State University to earn his master’s in business administration. There, one day he was reading about the founding companies of Silicon Valley and realized that he recognized many of the names from his father’s dinner table stories. He reconnected to what had captivated him as a kid: “You had an idea, and all of a sudden, manifest it into products and companies and value,” he says. It was something Byrne himself would do—on the other side of a time he calls “our dark year.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I realized the formula was you have to be curious. You have to be empathetic.”</p>
andy byrne</blockquote>



<p>Byrne’s first job in tech was selling networking hardware and software, and while other sales reps sold based on a one-page training guide, Byrne would take engineers to lunch and pick their brains. He tells a story about peeking over a cubicle wall when tiny wisps of smoke wafted up. Byrne asked what was going on, and the engineer explained he was soldering a chip to a motherboard. By asking questions and getting to know the engineers and their technology, Byrne could readily explain what was compelling about their products when talking to prospective customers: “I was good at that, and I realized the formula was you have to be curious. You have to be empathetic.”</p>



<p>From there, Goetz recruited Byrne for his first product management position in 1997 at VitalSigns, which Goetz co-founded. VitalSigns ran diagnostics on the nascent internet, helping users troubleshoot networking issues. This was where he met software engineer Venkat Rangan, who would later partner with Byrne to co-found Clari and become the company’s CTO. “He has a lot of passion with anything that he touches,” says Rangan, remembering how Byrne could take client feedback and translate it easily so engineers could get right to work.</p>



<p>Byrne thrived at VitalSigns. “Andy’s empowering,” says Goetz. “And he’s incredibly secure, so he doesn’t need to be the smartest guy in the room. He looks to distill the best ideas out of the collective.” Three years after VitalSigns’ founding, Lucent Technologies snapped it up in 1999. Two years later, Byrne left to found his first company, Timestock, an application-management solution for Fortune 500 companies. Byrne was in his early 30s, and as a first-time founder, he faced the challenge of starting a tech company amid the ruins of the 2001 dot-com collapse.</p>



<p>He was under incredible pressure, he says, to make things work for himself and his eight colleagues, all of whom had agreed to join the company in exchange for equity. Byrne describes the initial 18 months as “crazy.” He burned through his 401k. Then, things got more complicated. When his second son was born with critical health issues, Byrne and his wife had to learn to care for a medically fragile infant while raising a toddler without health insurance. Soon after, his father-in-law died in a tsunami in Thailand in 2004; 45 days later, his mother-in-law died of cancer. Then, Byrne was fired. “It was a time when I was not, I could not focus… I couldn’t bring my full self to work because of what was going on,” Byrne says. “I was not performing well, they let me go.” Timestock would later be sold and Byrne made whole financially, but being ousted from his own company, along with so much personal turmoil, sent him reeling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne refers to this time as “our dark year.” To cope, he read the modern classic “Man’s Search for Meaning,” by Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. He was moved by the insight that you can choose your response to life regardless of circumstances. Byrne doesn’t liken his situation to Frankl’s, but the message resonated in part because of the perspective his mom, Joyce, had modeled: “I saw my mom start something from nothing. And (she) just said, ‘I have to be resourceful, and I have to be entrepreneurial’ … It’s not about a ‘poor me’ situation. It’s about, ‘This is the hand I’ve been dealt and I’m going to figure it out.’” So that is what Byrne did. He worked his network. Goetz had joined Sequoia Capital by then, and Rangan was working there as an entrepreneur-in-residence on a company he had co-founded called Clearwell Systems. Goetz recommended Byrne when Rangan needed a brilliant program manager. Byrne joined Clearwell as a VP.</p>



<p>Clearwell used machine learning to search digital correspondence during legal discovery, replacing what had been a manual process of searching through thousands of pages. The company flourished, and Symantec acquired it in 2012. Now, Byrne when Rangan wanted to launch something as co-founders. Byrne had an idea. As an entrepreneur and leader, he had spent his career nurturing sales and marketing teams, and saw that there always seemed to be too many clients and too much communication. No amount of coaching could help teams make sense of everything, every time. Rangan explains, “There is always some information gap. People were making judgment calls on suboptimal decisions.” Byrne and Rangan felt that the customer relationship management software (CRM) salespeople were using was a waste. Byrne said, “I remember walking around the parking lot of the Sequoia offices and saying, ‘I’m telling you the CRM has totally failed sales teams; it’s horrible.’”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Byrne was convinced machine learning could help sales reps close deals faster, drive more revenue and increase revenue forecasting, predictability and accuracy, what he calls “the golden triangle.” He imagined the technological solution that would become Clari, a revenue collaboration technology that gathered sales-related data from everything—emails, meetings, outbound marketing—and applied AI to synthesize it and derive actionable insights, freeing up sales teams to connect more deeply with people, not spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Sequoia believed in Byrne and Rangan, giving them office space, and the firm joined in the company’s Series A. Initially, attracting clients was a problem. Even though Clari could help sales reps fill in knowledge gaps with data instead of guesses, they didn’t want it. Adopting Clari would mean changing how salespeople work, learning new systems and habits. “The roadblock was that our product required a change in behavior of individuals,” explains Rangan, who today is Clari’s co-founder and CTO. So Byrne and Rangan pivoted to approaching sales leaders, the people he knew could get the most from Clari’s technology. His instincts were right, and soon, Clari had 250 customers, the number Byrne felt showed viability. Clari was on its way. But Byrne would face another loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In 2017, Byrne’s brother died by suicide. Byrne says his brother had mental health issues that led to drinking and suffering. To manage, Byrne hired an executive coach who also functioned as a therapist, and started practicing Qi Gong, the Chinese technique of meditation, breathing and movement. “I feel a strong sense of duty and obligation to make sure that everyone knows, children and adults, that we are really making [mental health] a topic that’s very important, both at the dinner table and the conference table,” says Byrne.</p>



<p>Today, as a CEO and as a person, Byrne is focused on relationships. At work, he says, “When you get into leadership versus when you get into management, they’re two totally different disciplines. You realize that it’s actually not about running an operating cadence or doing code or selling stuff, it’s about human psychology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne is sincere, with a self-effacing sense of humor. In 2021, he wrote an article posted to LinkedIn titled, “The Metrics of Marriage: How My Wife and I Transformed Our Marriage By Acting Like CEOs.” He writes: “These metrics, these spreadsheets, aren’t sexy. There’s no red bows or diamonds. Making a relationship work, like leading a billion-dollar company, takes dedication and focus.” Byrne is self-aware about how this sounds: “We have vision boards, we have objectives and, yes, we have acronyms all over the house, and it drives my kids sometimes crazy. But when they’re in their 30s or 40s, they will never forget DPA,” Byrne says with a laugh, citing the acronym for “Dream. Plan. Act.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Byrne has learned through years of leadership that his management style is about empowering connection, from encouraging colleagues to leave early enough to make it to their kids’ soccer games and field trips, to making space for people to bring their full selves to work. At their Sunnyvale office, dozens of photographs hang on a wall depicting employees holding up personal belongings that showcase their personalities. A man holds a ventriloquist’s dummy. A woman looks at a book of paint samples, another reads a book. “The energy you see on that wall at Clari,” says Goetz, “from the employees, and the affinity they have for him, is that he genuinely cares about all of his team members, and will spend time with the receptionist, and the new sales rep, the junior engineer, along with his executive team.”</p>



<p>Byrne says his attention to connection comes from Joyce: “My mom has such a gift of gab, she is just so persuasive, and people just fall in love with her.” He says he’s always had some of her gregariousness, her tendency to hug people and say, “I love you.” Today, he doesn’t just live it, he shares it. As Rangan puts it, Byrne has “really been focused a lot on people’s careers, and helping them in advancing their impact and role.” Byrne has even mentored him, Rangan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne has also invested in Kurt Leafstrand, Clari’s SVP of Products. Leafstrand describes himself as an introvert, but says Byrne’s focus on nurturing relationships has influenced him. He’s learned to extend himself—to lead with enthusiasm at board meetings and with small kindnesses toward his team, which results in an unusually high team-retention rate.</p>



<p>In Byrne’s attention to cultivating connection, there is no detail too small about which to be deliberate. Leafstrand talks about how Byrne always makes sure people’s favorite music is on when they get into his car, even if it’s Toto’s “Africa,” as he did for one potential partner. It’s about making a person feel cared for, says Leafstrand. “[It’s] about the impact that you’re having, that you have a chance to help them,” he continues. “And that you should be thinking about that intentionally, like a steward.” </p>



<p>Three decades into his career, Byrne continues to mature in his stewardship of people and business, and he is excited for the future. “I’m just so proud to see a group of really, really incredible people who are trying to achieve something remarkable, who are just loving their work, loving their time together. And you know, I feel like our best work is in front of us. I’ve got so many crazy ideas… and I just can’t wait to do more.”</p>

 Scaling the Findora Blockchain for Growth and&nbsp;Success <p>NOTE: This article has been republished from <a href="https://findora.org/blog/">Findora’s blog</a>. View the original article <a href="https://findora.org/2023/01/findora-roadmap-2023/">here</a>, or follow the <a href="https://findora.org/blog/">blog</a> to read&nbsp;more.</p> Gearing Up for&nbsp;Growth <p>An updated Grants Program, augmented privacy functions, the Rosetta API — all this and more on Findora’s 2023&nbsp;Roadmap.</p><p>We are excited to share Findora’s 2023 roadmap with the community. After a year of laying a solid foundation, Discreet Labs is focused on scaling the Findora blockchain, developing its ecosystem, and securing strategic partnerships.</p><p>Learn more about key milestones below, and stay up to date by following Findora on <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://findora.org/discord">Discord</a>, or by signing up for <a href="https://findora.org/findora-newsletter/">Findora’s Newsletter</a>.</p> Highlights of Findora’s Roadmap  EVM staking <p>First stop, EVM staking! A feature eagerly anticipated by the community, it will let you <a href="https://docs.findora.org/general-user-materials/stake-fra">stake FRA</a> and earn rewards directly from a staking dashboard with your MetaMask wallet. Currently, only UTXO FRA can be staked after they’ve been transferred from MetaMask to the Findora Wallet via Prism. EVM staking will simplify the staking process for the Findora community.</p> “Triple-Masked” Transfers <p>You can already protect the token amounts and token types used in a transaction with the Findora wallet — “Triple Masking” will take that a step further. Triple Masking is an internal term for shielding the sending and receiving addresses, in addition to the token amount and type. This will be a key tool for DAOs and dApps seeking to provide their users with the privacy they expect for their personal finances and open the door to many use cases for&nbsp;Findora.</p> Multisig Wallet&nbsp;Support <p>Users will soon have the ability to set up multi-sig wallets on Findora. This is a key feature for managing community funds, and in the future will be integrated with triple masking so DAOs can protect their contractors and community members.</p> On-Chain Number Randomizing <p>Findora will work with an established partner to launch on-chain number randomizing. This feature will be essential for Web3 game developers on Findora, leveraging Findora privacy to create unique gameplay.</p> Rosetta API <p>The Rosetta API lets blockchains easily integrate their blockchain with wallets, large exchanges, and apps. Adding the Rosetta API will empower developers, and set Findora up for increased adoption in&nbsp;Web3.</p> $100 Million Grants&nbsp;Program <p>Stay tuned for the imminent opening of Findora’s Grant Program! The Findora Foundation has pledged up to $100 million, over the course of several years, for the development of Findora’s ecosystem. All teams are welcome to apply: port an existing project, build a basic infrastructure dApp, or create a dApp with privacy in mind. More information on the Grants Program will be released in February.</p> Introducing ZK-NFTs with&nbsp;Prism++ <p>Prism++ refers to a feature that will allow NFTs, typically confined to EVM environments, to migrate to Findora’s UTXO layer. The home of Findora’s zk-cryptography, the UTXO layer facilitates all privacy-enabled transactions. Moving NFTs to the UTXO will create privacy-preserving “ZK-NFTs” and open up a whole new set of use cases for NFTs in&nbsp;Web3.</p> Polygon Bridge to&nbsp;Findora <p>The <a href="https://rialtobridge.io/">Rialto Bridge</a> team is getting close to deploying a path between Findora and Polygon. The bridge will open up Findora to liquidity from Polygon and allow Polygon-based assets to migrate to Findora for confidential transfers. Rialto already connects Findora with Ethereum and BNB&nbsp;Chain.</p> App Chains <p>Findora will allow developers to deploy parallel app chains on Findora. With a dedicated chain for their app, developers will have complete freedom to develop according to their needs, balancing decentralization with through-put as needed, while still leveraging privacy features as needed. No need to share blockspace — build an app-chain with optional privacy features on&nbsp;Findora!</p> Auditability and Compliance Features <p>Initially proposed in <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora/status/1569754168755376129?s=20&amp;t=FCX9FE50ovDODmyMPJU66g">FIP-2</a>, Findora plans to deploy viewing keys to build auditability with privacy. Viewing keys will allow token issuers, like Circle, to create private assets only they can audit without making them public on-chain. They will be an essential tool for institutions, giving them the ability to move into Web3 and paving the way for mass adoption.</p> On-Chain Governance Voting <p>The community will soon play a much bigger role in Findora’s direction. An on-chain governance voting system will be deployed in 2023. FRA token holders will be able to vote on Findora Approval Proposals and other issues to determine the future of the&nbsp;chain.</p> Community Grant Approvals <p>Findora will also add a community grant, where projects can compete for funds from the community. The community will evaluate and vote on which projects they would like to see receive grant&nbsp;money.</p> Leading the&nbsp;Charge <p>Leading the charge into 2023 is <a href="https://findora.org/2023/01/findora-announces-new-ceo/">Discreet Labs’ new CEO, Sam Harrison</a>. Sam will focus on growth and adoption. Sam is a charismatic leader who will play a key role in bringing roadmap items to fruition.</p>Welcome, Sam!<p>2023 will be an exciting year for Findora as users and projects come to expect even more rigorous privacy protections from Web3 than from Web2. Findora is ready to give them exactly&nbsp;that.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability. Developers can leverage either model as they build dApps with auditable privacy.</p><p>We appreciate our developers and would love to onboard you to the Findora ecosystem.

     <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a> for the deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools was submitted recently. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>ZenIP 42204 proposes the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.&nbsp;</p> Does this mean Horizen will no longer support privacy or any type of shielded pools? <p>No. ZenIP 42204 does not propose the complete removal of the shielded pools or privacy features from the Horizen platform. It only proposes to remove the support for shielded transactions with transparent inputs (T addresses -&gt; Z addresses) on the mainchain level. Also, the proposal focuses on reducing the importance of the shielded pool by preventing new transparent inputs being sent to it. These transactions make up only 2% of the shielded transactions on the mainchain.</p> Why ZenIP 42204? <p>ZenIP 42204’s goal is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks. &nbsp;It proposes a solution to the following risks that prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Eliminate technical debt</p><p>Horizen’s implementation of shielded transactions relies on ZCash’s outdated Sprout technology. Moving away from outdated technology will give Horizen room to improve and innovate privacy technologies.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>The current regulatory environment makes privacy cryptocurrencies more difficult to access and be adopted. For example, Horizen has already been delisted from a major exchange in the Republic of Korea and excluded from popular industry applications like Crypto.com.&nbsp;</p><p>Supporting privacy features on the mainchain level is not the only way to offer privacy capability for the Horizen ecosystem. Horizen’s mission is to ensure data integrity and privacy freedom by enabling real-world use cases. Horizen’s privacy vision relies on a secure and decentralized mainchain that supports Horizen’s sidechain platform to focus on more scalable and resilient data privacy. The purpose of ZenIP 42204 is to de-risk the Horizen vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What’s Next? <p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, but how do we ensure that the community can continue to access Horizen and transact ZEN safely across the world if our technology falls behind and regulations continue to restrict our user base? Is <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a> the answer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. We will be hosting a series of town halls on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord</a> to have live conversations about this decision, but we recognize that it can be difficult to match global time zones. So to ensure that we can include everyone, we are recording a new episode of the Beyond the Horizen podcast with our co-founder Rob Viglione. We will collect your questions and feedback for the podcast in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">full ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means. We also hope to see you all join the discussion on the #zenip channel on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord server</a>. The team will be fielding questions and building a Q&amp;A for the community.&nbsp;</p><p>In his recent blog, Rob shares his thoughts on ZenIP 42204 and how this change can grow the ecosystem further in 2023. He stated, “My vote is on pivoting away from being a privacy coin and embracing the advances we’ve made in being a network of blockchains with Ethereum-compatible smart contracting. I prefer to be proactive against potentially adverse regulations and to remove the possibility that our base layer could be made illegal one day. With these foundations secure, we can focus on an explosion of use cases that add substantial value to the industry.” <a href="https://medium.com/@robviglione/my-thoughts-on-horizen-zen-being-a-privacy-coin-9a1749be3543">You can read his full blog on Medium</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We welcome all discussions about this ZenIP and hope you will all join us on Discord. We will also be sharing information on the town halls and collecting your questions for the podcast soon. Be sure to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord</a> to join the conversation about this proposal. </p>

<p>A new season for Verida, and the internet, is&nbsp;here.</p><p>After a successful six months active in private to partners and early adopters, we’re proud to announce version 2 of the Verida network and the Acacia&nbsp;Testnet.</p><p>In the early stages of the network it was much faster to create a centralized identity server to allow us having a working network sooner rather than later. This server has now been replaced with a new Verida DID method built on top of the Polygon blockchain and Verida data storage&nbsp;network.</p><p>We are entering the next phase of the network where we can move to provide a 100% decentralized network. Decentralizing identities is a critical step in that pathway. Over the remainder of 2023, we’ll progressively open up the network to the public as we increase decentralization and seek valuable feedback ahead of our mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p><p>We’re thrilled to have you part of this journey as we continue to decentralize personal data and give ownership back to individuals… to control, be compensated for, and enjoy personalized online experiences that make the world a more equitable place.</p><p><a>1. What is the Verida Network?</a><br><a>2. What are the key changes?<br></a><a>3. What do I need to do?</a><br><a>4. How can I start building the future of Web3 with Verida?</a><a><br></a> <a>5. What’s included in this testnet launch</a><br><a>6. Testnet Limitations<br></a><a>7. Protocol Audit<br></a><a>8. Network Launch Schedule<br></a><a>9. Why build Web3 with Verida?<br></a><a>10. The self-sovereign data era is here<br></a><a>Join our community</a></p> 1. What is the Verida&nbsp;Network? <p>The Verida Network comprises the underlying protocol, technology and documentation developed by Verida. Developers can leverage the Verida SDKs to use and contribute to the code to improve the network. Service providers can deliver infrastructure to the network by running nodes that users can select to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The Verida Network aims&nbsp;to:</p>  Decentralize the sharing and discoverability of&nbsp;data  Empower end users with control of personal&nbsp;data  Deliver a more equitable distribution of value to participants on the&nbsp;network  Create and share verified data in a trusted, private, secure, and decentralized manner.  <p><a href="https://www.verida.network/whitepaper">Read our Whitepaper</a> to learn how the Verida Network reflects our mission for achieving self-sovereignty of personal data and how the infrastructure works.</p> 2. What are the key&nbsp;changes? <p>A number of key changes to the Verida network have been deployed to improve speed, lower cost and decentralize the network. In&nbsp;summary:</p><p>We initially implemented a fork of <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry">ethr-did-registry</a>, however it became apparent that the performance, cost and lack of full DID document support was a sub-part solution for the objectives of the Verida&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Instead, we have designed a faster, cheaper and more flexible DID method via our Verida Improvement Proposals; <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-2.md">VIP-2 (Verida DID Method)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-3.md">VIP-3 (DID Document storage on the Verida network)</a>. We will look to have these officially included in the W3C implementations list in due&nbsp;course.</p><p>The Verida DbStore has been upgraded to provide enhanced user control and agency over their&nbsp;data:</p>  Users can delete any part of their data; <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk/data#deleting-data">from a specific row</a>, <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk/data#deleting-databases">a database</a> or <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/blob/main/packages/vda-did/src/vdaDid.ts#L245">their complete&nbsp;identity</a>  Users can control the servers that store their data (how many and which servers). A user interface for this will be made available in the Vault soon to make it accessible to everyone.  <p>The Verida SDK’s have been upgraded to support the creation of blockchain based decentralized identities. There are three new packages:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did">vda-did</a> (Creating and updating&nbsp;DIDs)  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did-resolver">vda-did-resolver</a> (Light package for read only resolution of&nbsp;DIDs)  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-web3-client">vda-web3-client</a> (A web3 wrapper that supports native blockchain transactions or routing transactions through a meta-transaction relay&nbsp;server)   3. What do I need to&nbsp;do? <p>Developers will be required to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@verida/client-ts">update to the latest SDK</a>. There are breaking changes as the protocol will now be looking up identities and data storage infrastructure from the blockchain.</p><p>End users will be required to update to the latest Verida Vault. This allows users to create new identities that are decentralized.</p> 4. How can I start building the future of Web3 with&nbsp;Verida? <p>We’re looking for innovators across Web3 (and friends in Web2) who want to provide users with greater ownership over their data and identity. If you’re an application developer or infrastructure operator, we’d love to hear from&nbsp;you.</p> Storage Node Operators <p>Soon, we’ll be opening up the Verida network to providers who have experience running network infrastructure who would like to run a Storage Node on the Verida Network. These node operators will be joining nodes operated by Verida and early partners.</p><p>To be eligible, you’ll need experience with crypto networks and the wider industry. This opportunity is particularly suited to organizations and individuals already operating blockchain nodes or data storage infrastructure across multiple&nbsp;regions.</p><p><a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem#build-with-us">Apply as a Storage Node&nbsp;Operator</a></p> Application Developers <p>We’re actively supporting developers building self-sovereign, high performance, scalable, and secure decentralized applications by integrating Verida using our&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>There are many emerging decentralized use cases that require more than just blockchain to see the light of day. We’re here to help those new projects come to life across social, insurance, healthcare, identity, and much&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Browse developer documentation</a> or <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem#build-with-us">Tell us about your&nbsp;project</a></p> 5. What’s included in this testnet&nbsp;launch? <p>We have a number of updates going live across the Verida network, Verida Vault and SDKs as part of the Acacia decentralized testnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Verida Identity <p>Verida Identity is a multi-chain decentralized identity and services framework. Decentralized Identities are a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">W3C standard</a> and core to user identities with the Verida Network. Every account on the Verida network is a decentralized identity (DID). The user’s public keys are leveraged to find and communicate with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Users control their private keys, enabling them&nbsp;to:</p>  Encrypt and access their private&nbsp;data  Control where their data is&nbsp;stored  Sign their data and messages to third&nbsp;parties  Pay for third party data&nbsp;storage  Sign into decentralized applications  Control the other services used by their identity (messaging, notifications etc.)  <p>Learn more: <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/accounts-and-identity">Accounts and Identity&nbsp;Concepts</a></p><p>A Verida account connecting to multiple application contexts</p> Verida Connect <p>Verida Connect is a QR code based multi-chain single sign-on framework to unlock off-chain data and crypto. It provides a smooth experience to onboard new users to decentralized applications on a range of supported blockchains.</p><p>Users who are signed in are provided with a private encrypted collection of databases for the application, secure messaging, and the ability to perform blockchain transactions.</p><p>The Verida Vault additionally supports the <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/single-sign-on-sdk/wallet-connect">Wallet Connect v1 and v2 standards</a> to enable developers to use familiar APIs for blockchain interactions.</p><p>Watch this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekJ-X9UAD0&amp;t=1s">Developer Tutorial: Verida Single Sign&nbsp;On</a></p><p>Learn more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/single-sign-on-sdk#what-is-the-verida-connect--sdk">Verida Connect&nbsp;SDK</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/SSO">Verida Connect Interactive Tutorial</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekJ-X9UAD0&amp;t=1s">Verida Connect (Single Sign-on) Video&nbsp;Tutorial</a>   Verida Message <p>Verida Message is a decentralized multi-chain messaging infrastructure.</p><p>The Verida Protocol facilitates decentralized messaging between Verida accounts. Users are able to communicate with other individuals and applications via real-time, encrypted, peer-to-peer messaging.</p><p>For example:</p>  One-to-one private messaging between DIDs and applications  Broadcast messages (from Applications to registered user&nbsp;DIDs)  Between datastores, no on-chain footprint, signing a off-chain consent message using your private key of your blockchain wallet.  <p>Messages sent via the Verida Network in the Verida&nbsp;Vault</p><p>Learn more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/messaging">Messaging Tutorial</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/messaging">Messaging Concepts</a>   Verida Consent <p>Verida Consent is a user-centric consent-based framework for identity, access management, and data sharing. The Verida protocol offers a great deal of flexibility and control around data access and encryption to enable consensual information sharing.</p><p>Capabilities include:</p>  Sending private individual data records to a&nbsp;user  Requesting individual private data records from a&nbsp;user  Sharing access to large quantities of structured private data (Data synchronization).  <p>The configuration for this data synchronization is pliable. An application can request access&nbsp;to:</p>  A read and/or write stream of all data of a particular type  A once-off data synchronization  A permanent sync (until the user disables)  A filtered stream of data based on a&nbsp;query.  <p>Learn more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-sharing">Data Sharing&nbsp;Concepts</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/social_media_data">Request Social Media Data&nbsp;Tutorial</a>   Verida DbStore <p>The Verida protocol provides secure, decentralized database storage for user data. Verida DbStore is the open source<a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node"> Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted database storage for one or more Verida accounts. No user data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stored on-chain.</p><p>This solution is designed for storing structured private user data. It incorporates access controls with flexible encryption and permissioned data synchronization. It’s region aware and designed to meet GDPR requirements.</p><p>Verida accounts control where their personal encrypted data is stored. Applications can provide a default storage hosting option or users can specify their&nbsp;own.</p><p>The product capabilities are beneficial for builders and users. For&nbsp;example:</p>  End users can access secure, region aware private storage for&nbsp;Web3  Application developers can provide their own default storage nodes for their&nbsp;users  Users can have increased privacy and control by hosting storage nodes for their own personal&nbsp;data  Enterprise companies can provide highly secure, private storage for all their employees  <p>Read more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-storage">Data Storage&nbsp;Concepts</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/datastores">Datastores</a> (Schema based&nbsp;storage)  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/encryption">Data Encryption</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/infrastructure/storage-node">Data Storage&nbsp;Node</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/databases">Data Storage Interactive Tutorial</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWtvvkk4WE">Data Storage Video&nbsp;Tutorial</a>   Developer SDKs and&nbsp;APIs <p>The Verida protocol is open source and provides toolkits to accelerate developer onboarding. The developer’s toolkit includes:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk">Client SDK</a>, an open source implementation of a Verida network client providing encrypted storage, identity, messaging, and schemas capabilities. It’s an easy-to-use library that abstracts the complexities behind these capabilities, thereby allowing developers to build self-sovereign applications.

This tutorial takes a developer through all the capabilities of the Verida Network and empowers them to build decentralized DApps using&nbsp;Verida.</p><p>Start building today: <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Developer Portal</a></p> 6. Testnet Limitations <p>With the public launch of the decentralized Acacia Testnet, it’s important for users and developers to keep in mind current constraints.</p>  If you had a previously had a Verida identity (DID) you will need to create a new one for this&nbsp;release.  The Acacia testnet should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It’s great for getting your application ready for&nbsp;mainnet.  Data stored and accounts created on Acacia will not be transferable to mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum’s testnets and&nbsp;mainnet.  The Acacia testnet will continue to exist as a test network once the Verida mainnet launches later this year. We’ll keep you updated on important dates.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We’ve done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but please remember, this is still a&nbsp;testnet.  Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/verida/support">opening a ticket on Github</a> or let us know in <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">Discord</a>, so we can fix them as soon as possible.   7. Protocol&nbsp;Audit <p>In preparation for the testnet launch, a <a href="https://github.com/chainsulting/Smart-Contract-Security-Audits/tree/master/Verida">comprehensive security audit</a> on the protocol and Verida Vault mobile app was completed by Chainsulting. The audit included automated vulnerability testing, manual security testing, and a review of the Verida architecture. No critical issues were found, and the team have addressed or acknowledged all other issues identified. A full report of the findings can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/chainsulting/Smart-Contract-Security-Audits/blob/master/Verida/02_Architecture_Audit_Verida_PUBLIC_19112022.pdf">here</a>.</p> 8. Network Launch&nbsp;Schedule <p>Below, you’ll see our projected timeline for the Verida Network launch. Dates are subject to change, so please connect with us in Discord to discuss any questions.</p>  First Security Audit — completed  Public Testnet Acacia Launch — January 2023&nbsp;(now)  Public Mainnet Myrtle Launch — Q2&nbsp;2023   9. Why build Web3 with&nbsp;Verida? <p>Web3 is the disruption of the ownership era. An internet where everyday people win, not just platforms. A privacy-preserving internet for the people, governed by the&nbsp;people.</p><p>To realize this, Web3 needs decentralized data and identity. Verida makes this possible.</p><p>With Verida, builders&nbsp;get:</p>  Real database with indexes, queries and structured data  Data storage that’s private and regulatory compliant  Incredibly FAST with Web2 performance  High security with authorization + encryption by&nbsp;design  Easy Sign-On, QR code based SSO for crypto wallet + data connectivity  Multi-chain decentralized messaging and data&nbsp;bridging  Rewards, tokens for developers and end&nbsp;users  Decentralized identity standards.   10. The self-sovereign data era is&nbsp;here <p>This is a new identity model that aims to fix the wrongs of Web2. The world is ready for it. Now, with the Verida Testnet open to developers and users, we’re one step closer to having it all… ownership, privacy, security, and convenience.</p><p>To continue the discussion about our Testnet launch, please join our community on <a href="https://discord.verida.io">Discord</a>.

Their first solution, MevAcid, is a platform molecule with a wide range of end products, leading to consumer applications ranging from cosmetics to&nbsp;tires.</p><p>In the future, most industrial chemicals will be produced without fossil fuels from precision fermentation with genetically engineered microbes. As Visolis continues to develop and scale their technology, they will be producing these industrial chemicals at commercial scale, which will be the foundation of the new bioeconomy.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddugar/">Deepak</a> and the entire Visolis team on their mission.

 Nym R&amp;D team provide their initial observations on the design requirements <p>Recently, the European Central Bank announced a market research exercise for the implementation of the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews230113.en.html">Digital Euro</a>. The digital euro is a CBDC issued by Eurosystem, allowing end users to exchange payments electronically with central bank&nbsp;money.</p><p>While there has been a lot of debate on the privacy properties of CBDC designs [1], we leave the discussion of concerns around those to a separate article in due course. In this post, we analyse the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs230113_Digital_euro_market_research.en.pdf?86bde70ec2cddc9f07e34921ea288e4b">technical requirements</a> outlined in the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews230113.en.html">market research exercise</a> and comment on the technologies which could be used to implement them. We limit ourselves to discussing three of them; first we share some observations and then the potential technical challenges.</p> Key observations <p>We found this a well thought out and clearly communicated set of requirements; however it is worth noting that there is no existing design that is able to fully satisfy them all. As the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs230113_Annex_1_Digital_euro_market_research.en.pdf?8f308548cc80b5f187a5560bd50e72ce">requirements</a> are very detailed, we do not present them fully here but focus on a few key interesting features.</p> No Blockchain in&nbsp;sight <p>While there is a ledger, there is no explicit mention of blockchain anywhere in the document. Thus while the Eurosystem includes a payment ledger for settlements, the designers are clearly concerned about not only the privacy of individuals’ transactions but also their linkability. Hence included is the requirement to prevent the settlement layer of the Eurosystem to link transactions involving the same physical individual, or to learn an individual’s holdings or any identifiable data [2]. This is clearly a key “must have” requirement, simple pseudonymous addresses tied to individuals are explicitly forbidden. Thus no existing blockchain solution can fully satisfy these requirements.</p> Intermediaries <p>A user has an account at an Intermediary (for simplicity one can think of this as a bank) which forms transactions for the Settlement layer. While the settlement ledger component of the Eurosystem cannot link transactions belonging to the same individual, the Intermediary can link all transactions done by their customers when they exchange payments or withdraw/deposit money. The intermediaries are also responsible to ensure compliance with AML/CFT requirements.</p> Payments <p>The technical design seems to be based around the ideas of the eCash protocols introduced by Chaum in one of his seminal papers in the late 80s [3]. The workflows for this are roughly as follows: 1) User creates a digital coin; their account is debited by this amount. 2) User pays for a chocolate bar with the coin; the shop can verify the validity and check with the bank whether the coin was not previously spent. 3) Shop deposits the coin into their bank, who checks against double-spending, and credits the bank’s account. Thanks to the anonymity property of the eCash protocol, the bank cannot link the deposited coin to its issuance, and thus cannot tell who bought the chocolate from the shop. Moreover, multiple transactions performed by the same user cannot be linked. This is actually better privacy than many blockchain systems, including Ethereum.</p> Onboarding <p>The process requires the intermediaries to run KYC checks and ensure AML/CFT compliance. The onboarding process also requires verification with the Eurosystem whether a particular individual (identified at this stage by an e.g. hash of his national id) has already accounts/wallets opened with other intermediaries. No personal data is shared with the Eurosystem or other intermediaries during the onboarding, but the Eurosystem must know which intermediaries are responsible for managing which users’ accounts.</p> Technical challenges  Offline Payment Challenges <p>Although the original Chaum’s eCash scheme does not support offline payments (neither do blockchain-based solutions!), more recent designs [4,5,6] do. One might wonder about double spending the coin and how this can be prevented offline. In the academic literature, this is tackled by allowing double spenders identification. However, the main drawback of Chaum’s design and the newer schemes [4,5,6] is non-transferability, i.e., the received coin cannot be directly spent to another user without contacting the bank and updating individual balances first (it’s not a very good coin if you have to take it to the bank instead of being able to spend it in another shop straightaway!)[7]. This requires the spender and the receiver of any system to be always&nbsp;online.</p><p>An alternative approach is a transferable e-cash [8], which allows users to re-transfer obtained coins, while at the same time remaining offline. However, the efficiency of these schemes is questionable vs the requirements of the Digital Euro. On the other hand, the document mentions the use of trusted hardware as mandatory, so perhaps this was the intended way of mitigating double-spending. Alternatively, leaving room for choice in implementation was intentional.</p><p>The key challenge with supporting offline transactions we feel is a comment in the offline section mentioning that “a card-based solution should be supported”. While clearly desirable from a user perspective, in our view, current bank cards are a) incompatible with transferable e-cash schemes and b) with implementations involving trusted hardware (Secure Elements). However, the card-based solution is only mentioned once while the rest of the offline section concentrates on mobile phone-based implementations of the offline payment workflow.</p> Moving Bank (Intermediary) <p>The key requirement is that the individual can, in case of emergency, reconstruct their account and move to another Intermediary without their old Intermediary being online. We guess this is useful to recover funds in the case of a banking collapse or technical problem with the bank. This could create challenges in the context of a) offline transactions and b) user disconnection (this cannot be extracted from the ledger as the ledger is not allowed to “know” the holdings of any individual user). Unlike in the case of the card-based implementation of offline systems, we do think there are designs that support this, but this is in our view clearly a desirable feature that is challenging to&nbsp;support.</p> Additional Payment&nbsp;Checks <p>As stated in the document, before transactions can be settled the intermediaries might be required to carry additional checks on the party with which their user is transacting, for example, to ensure that a payer is a legitimate person complying with financial regulations or legislation. However, the personal data obtained by intermediaries during the onboarding should not be shared with other intermediaries. A potential solution for a privacy-preserving KYC process is the use of anonymous credentials, like zk-nyms (based on the Coconut protocol, implemented by Nym Technologies and available on the Nyx blockchain), allowing the intermediaries to verify that the parties transacting with their users comply with a particular policy without learning any personally identifiable information about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Overall, while ECB put forward a very detailed and thought-through set of technical requirements, which appears to take privacy seriously, we stress that the entire Digital Euro implementation will require careful privacy considerations and analysis. As we at Nym Technologies have discussed at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum in 2022 [9], without privacy built in from the bottom-up, a CBDC might pose a threat not only to users’ privacy, but also national security. We recommend the European Central Bank reviews existing designs and developments in relevant privacy-enhancing technologies (for example differential privacy and e-Cash), and ensure that the solution enables financial access with full respect of privacy to ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>The above blog post was written by the Nym Research Team.

<p>2022 has proven time after time that centralised entities are prone to multiple points of failure, intentional or not. Decentralised finance (DeFi) addresses these, but the user experience has often been lacklustre compared to that from centralised finance (CeFi). Exchanges are the backbone of any market, but high throughput is required in order to ensure that both makers and takers can proficiently use them. Decentralised exchanges have long faced issues due to bandwidth constraints native to blockchains, but recent L2 scaling solutions have provided a considerable increase in terms of throughput. For example, dYdX is currently the largest consumer of STARKs, but growing institutional and retail interest in derivative financial products urges for an even better alternative.</p><p>We were joined by Antonio Juliano, founder &amp; CEO of dYdX perpetual exchange, to discuss about the upcoming transition to dYdX V4 and what challenges decentralised exchanges have to face amidst technological bottlenecks and upcoming regulations.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Antonio’s background &amp; timing products  dYdX product overview  Price feed oracles  dYdX user demographics &amp; UX  Development timeframes &amp; taking risks  Order book vs. AMM  Building a sovereign blockchain on Cosmos  The challenges of decentralising order books  IBC integrations and composability  Current state of scaling solutions  Migrating from dYdX V3 to V4 &amp; token utility  DeFi vs. CeFi  DeFi education &amp; regulatory outreach  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano">Antonio Juliano on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/dYdX">dYdX on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://dydx.exchange/">dYdX exchange</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p>Proteins are a foundational pillar in healthcare and behind every major advancement in biotech and synthetic biology for the last half-century, while biotech’s emergence as a new class of therapeutics was driven by the ability to produce proteins using cells or organisms in a controlled manner. Transgenes, artificial gene constructs designed to produce protein, are the basic building-blocks in modern biotechnology, including recombinant protein-based therapeutics, gene and cell therapies, DNA vaccines, food protein production, and more. Despite this essential role, current transgene design dates back to the 1970s and there has been little improvement in the fundamental systems behind it, leading to insufficient protein production, a key challenge for the biotechnology industry.</p><p>The ExpressionEdits team have redesigned transgenes from first principles and are building a bioinformatics platform to leverage their unique DNA intronization technology (which uses the non-coding regions of DNA called introns) to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in protein expression. The founders, Kärt Tomberg, Liliana Antunes and Allan Bradley, have worked together for the last 2 years in Allan’s lab at Cambridge University to mimic nature and, by introducing introns in mammalian cells initially, are fundamentally redefining the role of non-coding DNA in protein production and creating significant improvements in protein production.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Increasing protein expression in eukaryotic systems has boundless applications throughout the industry, ranging from antibody manufacturing to biochemical synthesis to novel in vivo and ex vivo therapies to the wider synthetic biology industry. Therapeutic markets in these areas range from over $200 billion for antibodies and recombinant proteins to $40 billion for cell and gene therapies. We believe that the ExpressionEdits platform can become the fabric for any protein expression system, from antibody manufacturing to in vivo therapeutics. The most exciting early applications, and where ExpressionEdits will eventually build an internal pipeline, are potentially in recombinant protein or gene therapies that involve complex diseases with particularly hard-to-express proteins.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tombergk/">Kärt</a> and the entire ExpressionEdits team on their ambitious mission.</p>

<p>Food production is one of the most important industries in the world. Of course, all of this food has to be safe to eat. So, how do we ensure this is the case? And can this process be improved?</p>



 An introduction to HACCP 



<p>To ensure food safety, most countries require all food manufacturers and processors to use a food safety management system. These are useful tools to ensure safe practices are followed within a business.</p>



<p>One of these food safety systems is Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), a systematic approach to identifying the food storage and preparation processes and the potential risks and threats. HACCP is widely recognised as one of the most effective ways of controlling food safety. Compliance with HACCP is also a legal requirement in various countries, such as Ireland and the UK. This means all food businesses must be managed under HACCP guidelines.</p>



<p>HACCP dictates <a href="https://www.fsai.ie/food_businesses/haccp/principles_of_haccp.html">seven principles</a>, which must be considered when developing a food safety management system:</p>



 
 Hazard identification 



 Determine the critical control points (CCPs) 



 Establish critical limits (e.g., cooking temperature/time) 



 Establish a system to monitor control of the CCP 



 Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP is not under control 



 Establish procedures for verification to confirm the HACCP system is working effectively 



 Establish documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these principles and their application 
 



 The current challenges of HACCP compliance 



<p>The proper implementation and preparation of a HACCP system can be difficult for food businesses to set up, maintain, and keep up to date. A lot of data needs to be collected, evaluated, and made available to regulators. This has proven to be a challenge.</p>



<p><a href="https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/29491/1/Phd_M_Sherif_HACCP_in_Sierra_Leone.pdf">In a paper from 2013 about the barriers to compliance with international HACCP regulations</a>, various other struggles of compliance with HACCP regulations are listed. Some of the barriers are:</p>



 
 Lack of awareness of HACCP regulations 



 Lack of adequate staff 



 Lack of self-efficacy, 
 



<p>and many more. What barriers food businesses face depend on many factors, such as geographical location, size of the business, and others. Yet, they often face the same core problems.</p>



<p>As HACCP is highly regarded in the food industry, not being compliant with its regulations often results in a severe lack of customers. Hence, this could even end up getting the business banned from importing food products into various countries.</p>



<p>Would it be possible to ease the process of implementing a proper food safety management system, and being compliant with HACCP regulations?</p>



 How FACT can enhance the process of being compliant with HACCP 



<p>Currently, HACCP compliance can be rather cumbersome, with repetitive manual checks and repetitive tasks. Luckily new applications are being developed constantly, which aim to improve the HACCP compliance process for both food businesses and regulators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">FACT</a> is one of these applications. FACT is a powerful blockchain-based, GDPR compliance tool to capture events and evidence and record the data on the blockchain for audit and traceability purposes. It is flexible and fully customisable to work with existing processes in current food safety management systems. FACT is powered by <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain</a> and delivers a toolbox for the recording of events using a simple smart form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With FACT, you can build templates for each process, then roll the process out and start using it immediately. All data is secure, GDPR-compliant, and available when needed.</p>



 How this makes HACCP food safety compliance easier 



<p>FACT can be aligned with the above principles to ensure real-time food manufacturing monitoring and up-to-date referencing for HACCP compliance. FACT can integrate with existing IT infrastructure or can be run as a standalone application to ensure cooperation with legal requirements.</p>



<p>Furthermore, FACT is designed to be intuitive and easy to understand for everyone, making sure everyone who is part of the whole process is able to use FACT.</p>



<p>On top of that, actions and tasks can be distributed to team members ensuring multi-level verification and reporting insights to management and regulators. Questions and sections can be configured to provide comprehensive risk assessment and alert management in the event of a HACCP breach. This would ensure problems get taken care of immediately and efficiently.</p>



<p>Thanks to the transparency provided by FACT and Europechain, regulators will also be able to actively monitor food businesses in an efficient and methodical manner.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 HACCP dictates seven principles, which must be considered when developing a food safety management system 



 FACT improves the HACCP compliance process for both food businesses and regulators, adding value to both the food industry and business processes 



 FACT’s blockchain-based framework enables to actively monitor food businesses in an efficient, methodical, and transparent manner 



 FACT can be configured to follow HACCP principles to ensure real-time food <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">manufacturing monitoring</a> and up-to-date referencing for HACCP compliance

The Arc America spring session will run March 6th to April 19th. Admitted companies will receive $500K-1M in funding at the start of the program. We are <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/apply">now accepting applications</a> through February 5th (11:59PM PT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 50 years, we have experienced every cycle of economic euphoria and economic gloom. While markets gyrate, outlier founders building outlier companies persist. They embrace constraints, unlock creative advantages, make technological leaps and are determined to endure. Airbnb, Block, Stripe and WhatsApp all emerged during the Great Recession. We are confident that the next legends are being formed in this moment and we strive to be their first true believers.</p>



<p>As we launch Seed Fund V, Sequoia partners on the Early team share a few emerging tech themes that have them excited about the decade ahead:<br></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a><br>“AI will be the most important theme of the next decade, driven by the scale of data, new technological breakthroughs in generative models and advancements in compute. Github Copilot has proven that we can make even top developers 10x better at what they do; ChatGPT has shown how powerful these products can be and how excited consumers are to use them. Both are just the beginning of interesting applications to come. I’m excited to see how foundation models, and a vibrant ecosystem of applications built around them will fundamentally transform every category we know of today: developer tools and infrastructure, search, the collaboration and productivity suite, games and entertainment, the creative suite, biology… to name just a few.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin<br></a>“AR will lead a revolution in the physical world. VR will change the way we have an immersive experience at work and play. Potentially the next consumer platform to drive wide-scale innovation, we could enter a world where we work and play through the “lens” of AR/VR glasses. The hardware is getting better and better: brick headsets to portable headsets, and lightweight glasses will be coming soon. One day, those glasses will be replaced with daily contacts. Imagine having all of the power of your smartphone piped through your eyes constantly. Imagine combining that power with AI algorithms to surface relevant information, suggest creative ideas and options, improve your every decision, and make your life more fulfilled, fun and entertaining.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstanine Buhler</a><br>“Enterprise AI and the data stack are promising areas for the next decade, because the virtuous data cycle is the new network effect and the sky’s the limit. The proliferation of AI into everyday office software has the potential to create a new kind of hybrid workforce that will increase individual productivity and enable leaner teams to do more. I’m also excited about enterprise fintech, because empowering the flow of money empowers commerce and progress.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/">George Robson</a><br>“Given the recent bans on new combustion-engine sales in Europe starting in 2035 (and US states following suit) and energy prices rising at the fastest rate in 30-40 years, electrification has become a magnet theme for talent. With the global ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, power consumption is projected to triple over the next 30 years as formerly gas-powered appliances plug into the grid and living standards rise. Electrification is one of the first decarbonization levers, being the lowest-cost and easiest to implement in most sectors. We are seeing disruption at each point in this value chain, from generation (solar, batteries), to distribution (virtual power plants) and consumption (the connected home).”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder<br></a>“Data is becoming the lifeblood of not only decision making through analytics but also now how products and applications work around us. The products we use will be transformed by data and the new AI models that are more advanced and accessible than ever before. Both the data infrastructure and the product layers surrounding this change are ripe for new companies to be created. Outside of the world of data and bits, I’m also excited about the huge number of talented people who are looking at the world through a climate-focused lens and solving the looming climate challenges ahead of us. Many of these businesses are incredibly hard, require moving a lot of atoms, but the market size and potential to transform the way we live is enormous.”<br><br><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a><br>“I’m excited for new developments in consumer social and self-expression. Social media has taken us a long way, but it is time to continue evolving how we interact, express ourselves, and build relationships. Two major changes are occurring: 1) People are seeking authenticity, meaningful connections and a sense of belonging in a post-pandemic world of increased loneliness and polarization. 2) AI has the potential to revolutionize content creation and self-expression—and creation tools are at the core of all consumer social. What’s next in a world where AI can generate a video you’d never be able to film yourself? Where you can livestream as an avatar that looks nothing like you, but frees you to be your real self? What would it be like to enter a chatroom filled with both NPCs and real people? The best founders will tap into our basic need for connection while pushing boundaries and avoiding the uncanny valley.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky&nbsp;</a><br>“Generative AI will transform all engineering workflows and the entire toolchain: from the IDE, to debugging, to CI/CD. Microservices have emerged as the predominant new application architecture. Every new platform solves some old problems but creates new ones: many microservices problems wait to be tackled, such as securing service to service communication. On the security side, identity and access control&nbsp; and automation are the biggest pains for many CISOs. Reasoning who should have access to what applications and resources, and what level of access is a gnarly problem in search of good solutions. Security teams have all the visibility tools they need, but struggle to take action at scale on all the problems that need to be addressed.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a><br>“First: hardware will always have my heart. The marriage of physics with a strong business model creates the largest moats and is intellectually exhilarating. Second: despite the challenges facing crypto (both in terms of token prices and public perception) I’m still very drawn to the space. If hardware is the marriage of physics with a business model, crypto is the marriage of mathematics with money. And as someone who has spent a lot of time in the developing world, I think many in the developed world underestimate how broken money is for much of the planet. Finally, I’m excited about bringing technology to legacy industries. Many of the largest industries still have relatively low software penetration. To crack one of these nuts requires a strong, unique insight about how to wedge in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a><br>“Suddenly computers can read and write. Language is central to how people do their work and interact with others in their personal lives, so I’m beyond excited to see how founders will take advantage of generative AI to build products we can’t even imagine today. That’s not to mention the world of images, where everyone from consumers to product designers can find reasons to have fun with or do work more effectively with generative models. Or the world of code, where 10x better code generation can empower technical people and aspiring toolmakers alike. Across the board in AI, including in infrastructure and developer tools, I think we’re in for a thrilling new wave of technology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a><br>“Biotechnology is undergoing a manifold revolution, driven by increasingly sophisticated computational capabilities, much-needed laboratory and workflow automations, and a deeper understanding of how we can interact with even the most fundamental building blocks of life. The applications will transform our world, from healthcare to the food we eat and the clothes we wear. I am excited to partner with the data, software and infrastructure founders who will help power that transformation, from conception to commercialization. In a similarly regulatorily complex space, I remain excited about innovations in financial services, both within the sector itself as well as the incorporation of fintech into new businesses.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/mike-vernal/">Mike Vernal</a><br>“It’s increasingly clear that AI will define the fifth major epoch of computing (after the Mainframe, PC, Internet and Mobile). I’m really interested in how this is going to redefine the consumer landscape. I think the way we make decisions—what to buy, where to go, what to do—will change dramatically as we develop personalized models with long-term memory, personalization and context. I think entertainment—both video and games—will move towards infinite, personalized depth. And I think who we connect with (and how we connect) is going to change massively. Imagine being able to find and connect with your nearest neighbors in some high-dimensional space, regardless of where they might live in the world. I’m very excited by short-term pragmatists, long-term optimists thinking about this space.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/roelof-botha/">Roelof Botha</a><br>“We’ve entered a new era of tech where, due to the return of a higher interest rate environment, there is renewed focus on operating efficiency and cash flow. Cost advantages are often overlooked and underestimated as the source of sustainable advantage in technology businesses. I’m excited to partner with founders who can build great products to solve customer problems while simultaneously innovating to build exceptional businesses. Many companies are likely to take advantage of the tailwinds that are bringing down costs across a range of sectors, such as automation, artificial intelligence, and the decreasing cost of genetic sequencing. Developer productivity alone has the potential to improve exponentially, with AI based co-pilots enabling transformation and disruption across a broad range of sectors.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/">Luciana Lixandru</a><br>“Thanks to AI, automation and the ability to start a legendary business from anywhere, we’re at the very beginning of a transformational shift in what technology will unlock for companies and consumers. This is a great moment for outlier founders, with a deep desire to fix a problem, who don’t see things the world in terms of how easy something might be, to build their company. With every early founder, I ask myself—what is the dream scenario? If the stars align, what could this company achieve? Experience and history shows innovation happens in all cycles—I’m excited about the founders emerging from this one.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/cornelius-menke/">Cornelius Menke&nbsp;</a><br>“The industrial world is currently undergoing a tremendous shift impacted by two mega trends: (1) We see an increasing disruption of global supply chains via the pandemic and geopolitical events that revert the decade-long offshoring trend towards more localized operations. (2) The race to net zero emission is pushing the industrial backbone of the world to rethink products in ways that combine ecological ambitions with a robust business model to also endure economically challenging times. I am excited to partner with founders who accelerate this transition by deploying automation solutions, optimizing procurement, improving engineering collaboration or rethinking these products from first principles.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bill-coughran/">Bill Coughran</a><br>“With rapid advances in machine learning / artificial intelligence and computing both large and mobile, ubiquitous computing will re-emerge as a reality, not just futuristic proofs of concepts. Also, adaptive consumer and enterprise offerings creating new long-term businesses will emerge. As always for a founder or an investor, there will be the challenge of separating the wheat from the chaff.”</p>

<p>We are entering a new frontier in biology and medicine unparalleled in human history, with breakthrough advances in gene editing, computational methods, and cell therapies. At the same time, our overall capability of understanding and manipulating biology is improving exponentially. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage diseases, but also will reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. In short: from cost digression to programmability: biology has and is undergoing several step-function changes. In recognition of these step-function changes, over the last years, we have backed a dozen companies in the space — ranging from <a href="https://www.bit.bio/news/bit-bio-secures-41-5-million-of-funding-from-top-life-sciences-investors">cellular reprogramming</a> to <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">sustainable materials</a>.</p><p>We believe tomorrow’s industry-defining biology companies will be founded by technologists and scientists who are building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future (see our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/an-evolution-blueyards-v2-thesis-a-new-website-gm-new-york-84080f7b191d">v2 thesis</a>). We are excited about empowering this next generation of founders. Last year we launched our first <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/welcoming-blueyards-first-bio-fellows-999fdc13d373">fellowship</a> in biology and science where we work side by side with a few exceptional individuals. As part of our goal to foster more innovation at the frontiers of science and technology at the earliest stages, today we are announcing our newest collaboration by partnering with <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, a student-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders, with chapters spanning 23 geographic regions and participation from over 120 academic institutions, providing early funding for teams in the Nucleate program (<a href="https://nucleatehq.medium.com/nucleate-announces-2m-in-venture-prizes-for-european-activator-teams-in-partnership-with-blueyard-aa82026dbb9d">read more here</a>). Via our partnership with Nucleate we plan to commit a pool of $2 million in SAFE agreements to fund the next generation of founders that have made it through the organization’s six-month Activator Program during 2023. The objective is to back 10 to 20 new teams across the European ecosystem as they migrate from the academic lab to a commercial entity and build the new platforms that re-engineer our society’s biology experiences.</p>

If you enjoy reading these newsletters, please be sure to <a href="https://a16zcrypto.substack.com/">share this link</a> with others who are interested in going deeper on crypto, web3, and the future of the internet. If you haven’t already, be sure to also <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/">subscribe</a> to ‘web3 with a16z’ wherever you get your podcasts for all-new episodes dropping soon; and, follow us @a16zcrypto on Twitter and on Farcaster…</p> 1. Big theme: progressive decentralization <p>Decentralization is more top of mind than ever. So in this special feature, we highlight the latest, just-published pieces — as well as previously published relevant resources on the topic — from us and others: </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/progressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework/">A high-level framework for progressive decentralization</a> by Jad Esbers &amp; a16z crypto’s Scott Kominers (January 2023) — on designing for future decentralization up front, including guidance for both web3 projects and more traditional organizations on how and when to decentralize. </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/">How decentralization through a blockchain can bring value to your business</a> [article] + <a href="https://youtu.be/OaZSCmjW_GE">the value of decentralization using blockchains</a> [video] by guest contributor Marco Reuter (January 2023) — on proposing a game theoretic model of a network where an entrepreneur decides to retain control of the network with centralized implementation through a regular company, or surrenders control to users with a decentralized implementation (through the “credible commitment” of a blockchain). But how do “lock-in effects” play here?</p><p><a href="https://future.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/">Decentralization for builders: principles, models, how</a> by a16z crypto’s Miles Jennings (April 2022) — Decentralization is the difference between “don’t be evil” and “can’t be evil” when a company CEO decides one course or another on behalf of countless users. So Jennings shares specific models and principles of decentralization across several use cases, and how they apply in practice.</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">Progressive decentralization</a> by Jesse Walden (January 2020). While at a16z crypto, Walden shared a three-step process proposing progressive decentralization for those building applications on smart contract platforms — outlining three components of success: product/market fit, community participation, and sufficient decentralization (community ownership). [see also: This later followup, a tactical playbook from Marc Boiron on “<a href="https://variant.fund/articles/sufficient-decentralization/">Sufficient decentralization</a>” (August 2022).]</p><p>…more from around the web/ see also:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/decentralization">The era of decentralization</a> by Packy McCormick [also a16z crypto advisor] (November 2022) — Crypto is not the cause, but the symptom, of a larger trend towards decentralization as the world oscillates between centralization and decentralization… with progress sloping upward through the turns. And the current era of greater decentralization will play out on all fronts — from geopolitics and energy to finance, education, journalism, and more — driven by technologies including the internet. But this newly decentralized era will also require new infrastructure and organizing principles that can adapt to the complexity inherent in decentralized systems.</p> 2. Big ideas 2023: Just a few of the things we’re excited about in crypto <p>Michael Blau, Joseph Bonneau, Noah Citron, Valeria Nikolaenko, Carra Wu, Guy Wuollet, Michael Zhu</p><p>This list from some of our a16z crypto partners across the engineering, research, and investing teams has something for everyone:</p>  <p>from new possibilities for developers — such as “blockchain’s mobile moment”, to more developer onboarding for zero knowledge&nbsp;</p>  <p>to key advancements such as VDF hardware; and advancements in zero knowledge, multi-party computation, and post-quantum crypto</p>  <p>to “non-transferable tokens” and various web3 applications that will be built on top of not just this primitive, but also with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials</p>  <p>as well as other trends crossing industries… including on-chain gaming, and decentralized energy.&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/big-ideas-2023/">see the list</a></p><p>related:&nbsp;On the theme of “blockchain’s mobile moment”, see also <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">Helios</a> — a fast, portable, and secure Ethereum light client written in Rust that allows users to access secure chain data from any device, including mobile phones and browser extensions — which we made <a href="https://github.com/a16z/helios">available to the public</a> to build <a href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1589773604291772416">on</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1595895860176773121">more</a>. </p> 3. Big journeys &amp; paths: Creators, creativity, technology <p>Bob Iger, Chris Dixon, Sonal Chokshi; Emily Yang/ pplpleasr</p><p>We sat down with longtime CEO of Disney Bob Iger (in an intimate chat recorded in Los Angeles a few months ago) to discuss the interplay between technology, content, and distribution… Especially as it evolved from TV and cable, to web 1.0/ internet, to web 2.0 including streaming and advertising models, and now to web3; and other emerging technologies like VR and AR. The conversation also touches on other top-of-mind topics for many in web3 and beyond, including: managing brands and IP; decentralized orgs; remote work; "build vs buy" and navigating the innovator’s dilemma; and how to manage creatives, give creative feedback, and build creative processes for innovation. (Plus some fun behind-scenes details on Black Panther, Avatar, and more!)<br><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/bob-iger-creator-content-technology-distribution-brand-disney-web1-web2-web3">listen here</a></p><p>Hearing directly from creators: Multidisciplinary artist Emily Yang aka <a href="https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1">pplpleasr</a> went from working on visual effects — her credits include feature films like Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman, and Star Trek Beyond as well as commercials and game cinematics — to defining “the look” of the DeFi movement and creating Fortune magazine’s first NFT cover. Now the co-founder of decentralized content studio and creator platform <a href="https://www.shibuya.xyz/">Shibuya</a>, Yang shared her journey as a creator — and the various forks, paths, and culmination of it all — in an interactive-storytelling talk at our recent Founders Summit. [You can also find a past talk with Yang on "Why DAOs matter for digital art", in conversation with a16z crypto's Arianna Simpson, at our NFT Summit (May 2021) <a href="https://youtu.be/A4iCiHgWEkM">here</a>.]<br><a href="https://youtu.be/WDFMZ9GYjDk">watch the talk</a><br><br><br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/22-top-pieces-from-2022/">2022 &gt; 2023</a></p><p>--Sonal Chokshi and the a16z crypto team<br><br>You’re receiving this newsletter since you signed up for it on our website(s) or elsewhere (you can opt out using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

<p>(Re-posted from MetaMask original&nbsp;blog)</p><p>Snaps is the roadmap to making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel Snaps being built&nbsp;today.</p> Web3Auth Snap <p>Snap Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/">https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/</a></p><p>Why did you build&nbsp;it?</p><p>At Web3Auth, we’ve always believed that multi-factor authentication is the best way to secure crypto assets, and is much better than seed phrases. When we saw at ETHBogota that the latest build of MetaMask Snaps allowed Snaps to provide external key management capabilities, we decided to challenge ourselves to integrate MPC tech into MetaMask at the Sozu House hackathon.</p><p>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</p>  Our goal was to allow a new user to login and set up 2FA to access their account in MetaMask. Subsequently, under the hood, whenever they try to sign a transaction, our MPC SDK does a threshold ECDSA signature. This is done by splitting a private key into two parts: a local share that’s stored in the snap and one that’s stored on a signing server. Over several communication rounds, the signing server and the snap should be able to jointly sign an Ethereum transaction and have it be confirmed on the Goerli network. Unlike seed phrases, this setup does not have a single point of failure that leads to irreversible loss of keys: if the user’s laptop is hacked, or if the signing server is hacked, the user does not lose their private&nbsp;key.  Like every other snap, our snap consists of two parts, the actual snap package, and a page that loads/interacts with the snap. Our ideal user flow was to keep all key management interactions within the Metamask extension’s UI, but due to limitations in permissions, we could not do that. Instead, the user authentication happens outside of the snap, and then once that is complete, we migrate the state into the snap. Subsequently, we hook into the RPC engine of Metamask and respond to transaction requests by using our MPC SDK and the migrated state in the snap to generate threshold ECDSA signatures on the transactions. Surprisingly, we were done with the state migration part within the first few hours of the hackathon and were just left with the signing functionality.  The rest of the process can be further split into two major&nbsp;tasks:  Repurposing existing Web3 providers with our MPC SDK to handle the incoming transaction requests  Getting the MPC SDKs running in the Metamask Snaps SES environment  If you’re familiar with how Metamask works, or how other wallets function, you’ll know that signing an Ethereum transaction requires much more work than just using a private key to sign a message. A lot of work goes into forming the message object that is to be signed. Each transaction follows a particular format that’s specific to each chain and transaction type, has legacy behaviors that need to be supported for backward compatibility, has to get information about the current gas prices, has to calculate the gas to be used / gas limits, and also has to track the account nonce, etc. Thankfully, most existing Web3 providers already do these things out of the box. However, in order to get our threshold signature library to work well with these SDKs we had to dig deep into every single module and replace the eth-sig-util library’s signing functions with our own threshold signature library signing functions, which took a significant amount of time. In addition, because our MPC SDK was chain-agnostic, and didn’t account for Ethereum-specific checks, we also had to reverse engineer and reimplement checks from the eth-sig-util libraries which we had replaced. For example, EIP-2 specifies that the s-value in an ECDSA signature must not be larger than n/2 + 1, where n is the order of the secp256k1 elliptic curve, in order to prevent transaction malleability attacks, which requires ECDSA signing libraries to do a “flip” of the signature if its s-value falls outside of this&nbsp;range.  Another challenge we faced was getting our MPC SDKs to run in the Metamask Snaps environment. Our MPC SDK uses wasm (compiled from rust) to run efficiently in the browser. Due to the multiple rounds of communication between the SDK and the signing server, it also uses Socket.IO to communicate to avoid the overhead of HTTP headers. While attempting to load our wasm code into the snap, we ran into some strange issues with mixed argument types in the wasm methods. Unfortunately, wasm debugging tools are still very lacking, with error messages being unhelpful and uninformative (eg. “Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable”). In the end, we hacked our way around this limitation by accepting all mixed inputs arguments as strings, and parsing them as integers/byte arrays within the wasm code itself. Another problem we encountered was that socket.io did not work in the Metamask Snaps environment. Socket.IO is a separate library/specification built on top of normal WebSockets that handles things like connection upgrading, dropped connections, fallbacks to long polling, etc. which are very helpful when using WebSockets in production environments. Unfortunately, we could not get Socket.IO’s libraries to run in the Metamask Snap environment. As such, we had to fallback to normal WebSockets, and also rewrite the signing server to use default WebSockets instead of socket.io, and fallback to a polling strategy if the websocket had&nbsp;issues.  <p>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>Zhen and I are the cofounders of Web3Auth, and our company specializes in providing intuitive, secure, and non-custodial key management solutions. We believe that good security must be easy to use and invisible, or it will not get adopted widely. That is why we are huge proponents of using multi-factor authentication for private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</p><p>We tried Metamask Snaps about a year ago, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the capabilities to allow us to extend the private key management functions within MetaMask back then. With the introduction of SIP-2 recently (thank you Olaf!), which allows snaps to extend MetaMask’s keyring, we’ve been very excited to see what’s possible! While building our snap, I also explored the SES system that MetaMask Snaps is based on, and I think it’s a very solid foundation for MetaMask to act as a platform for developers to add functionality through&nbsp;Snaps.</p><p>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other&nbsp;wallets?</p><p>The extensibility! I think MetaMask Snaps provides a secure interface for developers to experiment and augment MetaMask without compromising the security of the MetaMask extension itself. Unlike other types of projects, wallets require high standards of security, which means merging in new functionality from third-parties is always a long, arduous process of code review and audits, which stifles innovation. MetaMask Snaps allows the MetaMask team to continue building a secure product, while still allowing external developers to experiment and extend its functionality.</p><p>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>I think Snaps is definitely the way forward, allowing people to build functionality while still keeping the base MetaMask extension secure. There are a few kinks now but improvements are coming every day but I think it’s very exciting&nbsp;overall.</p><p>What does Snaps mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>I hope that adding multi-factor authentication capabilities to MetaMask through snaps helps the millions of mainstream users on MetaMask to more securely manage their accounts and prevents them from falling victim to scams and hacks. MFA is already doing this today for billions of Web2 users, and we want to bring those secure best practices to&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3&nbsp;space?</p><p>In general, I think Snaps represents a realistic way for MetaMask to open up its codebase for others to contribute to it without compromising security.</p><p>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask&nbsp;Snaps?</p><p>Just try it! It may seem a little new but it’s been very approachable so far and the support for it is great on the ConsenSys discord channel for Snaps. Lots of amazing devs are working on it and if you want to be part of the conversation in shaping Snaps, now is the time to be building on it and giving feedback!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-snap-integrating-multi-factor-authentication-into-metamask-4e57f07af77">Web3Auth MPC Snap: Integrating Multi-Factor Authentication Into MetaMask</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today we are detailing changes to Brave Rewards that will land in Brave version 1.48.x, which is scheduled to be <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Brave-Release-Schedule">released early February 2023</a>. Developers and early adopters who use our Nightly and Beta versions, meant for testing and development, can currently get a preview of these changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the inception of Brave Rewards, more than 1,000 advertisers have run over 5,900 Brave Ads campaigns, and millions of Brave Rewards users have earned BAT for their attention to those ads. Our <a>transparency page</a> shows the BAT we purchase from the open market to distribute to Brave Rewards users for those ads where we are paid in fiat or other crypto currencies. Brave Rewards users have also contributed more than 36 million BAT to their favorite <a href="https://creators.brave.com">registered content creators</a>, helping to support a better, more private Web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes to Brave Rewards will help us combat abuse so that we can better deliver on our promises to legitimate users and creators. They will also allow us to focus our efforts on building a more decentralized future by eliminating our current centralized “virtual BAT” system.</p>

 What’s changing for Users? 
<p>To begin earning and accruing <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org">BAT</a> for Brave Ads, you will need to connect a custodial account to your Brave Rewards profile with upcoming version 1.48. Brave currently works with three custodial account provider partners: <a href="https://gemini.com">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://uphold.com">Uphold</a>, and <a href="https://bitflyer.jp">bitFlyer</a> in Japan. Requiring a custodial account gives us a place to send you your BAT earnings, and allows us to eliminate our centralized “virtual BAT” system (see “Sunsetting virtual BAT” below for more).</p>
<p>If you’d just like to support creators as part of a more private Web, you can do so without ever connecting a custodial account by opting into Brave Rewards and using the new “creator support only” experience. A share of the ad revenue will be earmarked for creators and distributed by Brave as part of the monthly payout to <a href="https://creators.brave.com">verified creators</a>. If you want to give more, connecting a custodial account will allow you to use BAT you’ve purchased elsewhere to support creators in the Brave Rewards ecosystem, and will also unlock the Tips feature.</p>

<p>What it looks like when you start to connect a custodial account&nbsp;</p>

 Sunsetting virtual BAT 
<p>After these changes to Brave Rewards in 1.48.x, we will also be sunsetting our centralized “virtual BAT” (“vBAT”) system, used primarily for unverified users.</p>

 What is vBAT? 
<p>When you use Brave Rewards without a custodial account connected, the earnings you accrue are in something called “vBAT” (virtual BAT). vBAT isn’t BAT on the blockchain; instead, it’s a centralized point system backed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature">Chaumian blind signature</a> “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash">ecash</a>” scheme. These points can be contributed to creators or redeemed for BAT if and when you connect a custodial account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you are an unverified user and have “5 BAT” in your Brave Rewards balance after claiming your Brave Ads earnings. That “5 BAT” is actually vBAT, stored as cryptographically signed certificates on your device. When you “verify” your Brave Rewards profile by connecting a custodial account, your device submits those 5 vBAT certificates to our servers. From there, our servers utilize the APIs of our licensed custodial partners to deposit 5 BAT into your custodial account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 When is vBAT going away? 
<p>At the earliest, vBAT will go away sometime in April 2023. However, we want to ensure users have time to adjust to this change, so we will share more exact dates soon. With 1.48.x, existing users without a custodial account connected will receive a final vBAT payout for any February earnings in March.</p>
<p>Once the sunset deadline for vBAT is reached, vBAT will no longer be considered valid, and will be removed from the Brave Rewards experience. This means that even if you’re on an old version of Brave that still shows a vBAT balance, that vBAT can no longer be redeemed after the deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the vBAT sunset deadline draws nearer, unverified/non-connected users will see messages with more information and a specific date:</p>

 Users in unsupported regions 
<p>Although our goal is to maximize the number of <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469">supported countries for connecting a custodial account to Brave Rewards</a> before sunsetting vBAT, the unfortunate reality is that there will still be some countries without an available custodial option. For example, Germany is currently not serviced by any of our custodial partners, and will likely not become supported before the vBAT sunset deadline. In other cases, some serviced regions are impossible for us or our custodial partners to support due to unsustainable economics. You can find a <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10950603397645">list of these unserviced or unsupported countries here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re in an unsupported country, you will still have the option to contribute your vBAT balances to verified creators you’d like to support, and will see messages like this:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>vBAT deadline messaging for users in regions with no available custodial option</p>
<p>We understand that this may be frustrating for users in unsupported regions, and we apologize for these circumstances. We will continue to work with both existing and potential new custodial partners to maximize regional support for Brave Rewards as feasible.&nbsp;</p>

 Why is vBAT being removed? 
<p>First, vBAT was never intended to serve as a long-term store of BAT. A core assumption in our early Brave Ads abuse modeling was that vBAT would expire in order to prevent bad actors from accumulating funds across a large number of profiles, then simply waiting for an illicit avenue to open up to drain these funds out of the system. Although vBAT was originally planned to have a rolling expiry, we instead delayed it as long as possible to minimize the impact on users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, because vBAT is stored locally on users’ devices after it is issued, it is impossible to tell whether some vBAT has been lost to a discarded device, abandoned upon Brave uninstall, or lost due to profile deletion, undermining the possibility of transparent and accurate accounting within the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, with the removal of the legacy unverified user state and the introduction of the new “creator support only” experience, vBAT is no longer necessary. Removing the centralized vBAT system will allow us to focus our efforts on building a more transparent and decentralized future for Brave Rewards.</p>

 Decentralization after vBAT 
<p>We’ve already shared details about our research on decentralizing the Brave Ads system in Brave Rewards through initiatives like <a>THEMIS</a>. Eliminating our centralized vBAT system represents another step in this direction. For example, in place of vBAT contributions accounted for in our centralized vBAT system, users will, in the future, be able to send on-chain BAT directly from their self-custody Brave Wallet (or other Web3 wallets, such as MetaMask) to creators’ Web3 addresses, including Ethereum, Solana, and others. We’d also like to allow users to purchase products—such as <a>Brave Firewall + VPN</a>, <a>Brave Talk Premium</a>, etc.—with on-chain BAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a similar vein, many users have asked whether—instead of having to connect a custodial account—it will be possible to connect Brave Wallet directly to Brave Rewards, and receive BAT payouts directly to one’s Brave Wallet addresses. This is a future we’d welcome and are continuing to explore. However, in order to comply with current financial regulations (such as FinCEN and OFAC requirements, or equivalent regulators outside the United States), payouts at this time must first go through a regulated custodian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that once you receive BAT into your custodial account, you can always withdraw it on-chain to your Brave Wallet. In the future, we plan to bring Brave Rewards and Brave Wallet closer together to form a more unified user experience. More details to come.</p>

 What’s changing for Creators? 
<p>If you’re a registered <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creator</a>, we will be removing the “balance” indicator in the Brave Creators dashboard. The balance you see in your Creators dashboard mostly keeps track of vBAT that was contributed to you but is still pending to be paid out to your custodial account, so will no longer be needed.&nbsp;</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Updated creators dashboard without vBAT balance indicator</p>
<p>Note that any BAT previously paid out to your custodial account is unrelated to these changes. You will continue to be able to receive monthly Creators payouts and direct tips from users to your connected custodial account, even without the vBAT balance indicator.</p>
<p>Following these changes, we also have plans to redesign the overall Brave Creators experience. Here’s an early design preview of what your Brave Creators dashboard might look like in the future:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    


 Do I need to do anything with my Brave Rewards profile? 

 Existing verified/connected users 
<p>If you already have a custodial account—like an Uphold, Gemini, or bitFlyer account—connected to your Brave Rewards profile, then no action is required. The Brave Rewards experience you know and love will continue as you currently know it.</p>

 Existing unverified/non-connected users&nbsp; 
<p>If you don’t yet have a custodial account connected to your Brave Rewards profile and you’re in a <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469-Supported-regions-for-verifying-Brave-Rewards-with-a-custodial-account-provider-">country that’s supported by one of our custodial partners for connecting to Brave Rewards</a>, we encourage you to connect one as soon as you can. This will ensure that any vBAT balance you have as an unverified user will be transferred to your custodial account as BAT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: All unverified users will eventually be transitioned over to the new “creator support only” Rewards experience once virtual BAT has been sunsetted. Any remaining vBAT balance you have as an unverified user will be lost when this transition occurs. So, we recommend you connect a custodial account or contribute your vBAT to your favorite verified creators before this happens.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Rewards experience for unverified users before being transitioned to the new “creator support only” experience</p>
<p>Note that if you’re an unverified/non-connected user, your “Estimated earnings” counter will be blank once you upgrade to a version of Brave that includes these changes, as unverified users will no longer be accruing vBAT for themselves, and instead helping to support creators if Brave Ads is enabled. Again, this is because you will only begin to earn once you’ve connected a custodial account to Brave Rewards.</p>

 Summary 
 
 
<p>As of browser version 1.48.x (slated for February 2023), users who want to earn BAT from Brave Ads and accrue a balance must first connect a custodial account (Uphold or Gemini; and bitFlyer in Japan) to their Brave Rewards profile.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave Rewards users without a connected custodial account can still support creators by viewing Brave Ads—they just can’t accrue BAT for themselves until they connect a custodial account. (This is the new “creator support only” experience.)</p>
 
 
<p>Sometime after 1.48.x, virtual BAT (“vBAT”) is going away. Unverified users will have time to connect a custodial account to redeem their vBAT or send that balance to their favorite verified creators before vBAT is eliminated. After the vBAT sunset deadline, any remaining unverified users will be transitioned over to the new “creator support only” experience. (Existing users with Brave Ads disabled will continue to have Brave Ads disabled when transitioned over to the new experience.)</p>
 
 
<p>At the earliest, vBAT will go away sometime in April 2023, but the exact date is TBD.</p>
 
 
<p>Although we will do our best to maximize the number of supported countries before the vBAT sunset deadline, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10950603397645">some countries will unfortunately have no available custodial option.</a> Users in unsupported regions will have time to contribute their existing vBAT balances to their favorite verified creators, and then will be able to continue using Rewards to support verified creators with the new “creator support only” experience.</p>
 
 
<p>If you have any questions about these upcoming changes, please join us on the <a href="https://community.brave.com/t/brave-rewards-changes/462431">official Brave&nbsp;Community forums.</a></p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is proud to support this ambitious grassroots project that aims to have global impact through local and regional actions. We can’t wait to see how this community of creators will learn and work together to elevate and disseminate news and stories that inspire, educate, and share the promise of Zcash and financial privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to Ryan Taylor for working with ZF to bring this project to life!</p>



<p>In Ryan’s own words:</p>



<p>We are a global collective of content creators who care about privacy, Zcash, and building community. Together we will build a space to share information, skills and resources to aid production and publishing of content that covers the topics we care about. We want stories told by the people who are closest to the action, sharing their passion and lived experiences to bring privacy education and Zcash to every part of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ZF A/V Club will host regular online meetups and collaborate with local events to facilitate discussions on topics of interest to the global Zcash and privacy communities. With our focus on online audio/visual production this will be the time and place to learn more about the media needs and concerns of local Zcash and privacy-focused communities around the world and to take action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Events will be open and free, and could include many formats such as presentations, Q+A, AMA, workshops, troubleshooting, brainstorming or something else entirely. Every discussion, no matter which format, will maintain the Zcash focus on privacy as a topic and as a practice. Consent cannot be assumed.</p>



<p>The long-term goal of the ZF A/V Club is to establish a network of capable, ready and funded media producers to broadcast and share news about Zcash and privacy that is both locally relevant and globally consumed.&nbsp;</p>



 Empower and Amplify 



<p>We are a global community of voices and experiences.Through community we will empower and amplify every individual to tell the Zcash story through their own perspective, on their own terms. We will foster resources and connections that motivate and support content creators so they can bring their unique voice to the global privacy conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We envision a web of connections speaking and creating in different languages, all feeding off of, and contributing to, the information and content shared by the ZF A/V Club. We will lift each other up and together we will build the momentum needed to bring Zcash and privacy to the world. Join us!&nbsp;</p>



 Who? 



<p>Everyone is invited and welcome to be a part of the ZF A/V Club! Anyone with a passion for privacy who is interested in exploring new audio/visual and internet technology can attend meetups and participate to the degree of their own comfort. The ZF A/V Club is being launched and organized by Ryan Taylor with support from the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

EIP-4844 is also referred to as proto-danksharding as it sets the foundation for data sharding, through the introduction of data blobs.</p><p>We were joined by Carl Beekhuizen &amp; Trenton Van Epps from the Ethereum Foundation, to discuss about the upcoming EIP-4844 timeline and its KZG ceremony.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Trent’s and Carl’s backgrounds  Danksharding and scaling Ethereum  Data BLOBs and data availability  KZG ceremony  How trusted setups evolved  KZG commitment requirements  How trust is ensured  Combining randomness  How storing secrets is prevented  General contribution details  Special contributions  Quantum vulnerability  General EIP-4844 timeline  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlBeek">Carl Beekhuizen on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps">Trenton Van Epps on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-crazy-security-behind-the-birth-of-zcash">Morgan Peck's article</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

<p>The Brave Browser has had support for <a>private browsing with Tor</a> since 2018 as a way to give our users a way to protect their network privacy.</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>One request we have recently started to receive with increased frequency is support for Tor bridges. <a href="https://support.torproject.org/censorship/censorship-7/">Bridges</a> are a way for users to access the Tor network even when their government is blocking connections to the network. Starting with Brave 1.44, users in affected countries have had an easy way to circumvent these restrictions from the settings page:</p>


    
    

    


    


    
    

<p>Once the desired bridge configuration is selected, new private windows with Tor will only attempt to connect to the Tor network via the specified bridge. More details can be found in our <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/7816553516045-How-do-I-use-Tor-bridges-in-Brave-">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling our users to connect to bridges and relays graciously offered by volunteers in the Tor community, Brave will continue to contribute to increasing network capacity. Besides operating the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:723E21FD6F91905E84E583D4619A2D1E282B8180">relays</a> we have been running since we launched private windows with Tor, we are now making it easy for our users to share their Internet connections with users in censored countries.
