<p>The Zcash Foundation (ZF) is excited to share our vision for the next two Zcon conferences: ZconV (virtual) in May 2024 and Zcon6 (in-person) tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. Get ready for impactful presentations and outcomes at ZconV, under the inspiring theme “Zcash Unified!”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 ZconV 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ZconV will be a virtual conference, happening online in early May 2024. It will be a celebration showcasing how the diversity of&nbsp; individuals, organizations, and projects within the Zcash ecosystem contributes to its success and innovative spirit. Our goal is to open doors for inclusive and widespread participation from our global community, while maintaining our commitment to fiscal responsibility amidst the uncertainties surrounding the Dev Fund and market conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using the popular Whova web and mobile app, which received rave reviews during our last conference, ZconV will offer an interactive and dynamic platform for real-time Q&amp;A, discussion boards, polls, chat, and video conferencing. Keep an eye on the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/zconv/">ZconV webpage</a>&nbsp;for continuous updates and ways to engage in these enriching discussions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zcon6 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As for Zcon6 we plan to bring the Zcash Community together for an in-person event in Mexico City in early 2025. This gathering will focus on strategic planning and commitment to long-term projects, empowered by a clear understanding of available resources. The timing in Q1 2025 not only offers cost-effectiveness but also a warm and inviting atmosphere during the colder months in many parts of the world, adding an extra layer of appeal for attendees. Stay tuned for more details on Zcon6, including the exciting reasons behind choosing Mexico City, coming your way by the end of Q3 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us for these two landmark events as we continue to propel Zcash into a bright and unified future!</p>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support, patience, and feedback: we could not do this without you.&nbsp;</p><p>Testnet Stage 3 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 4 of our testnet is live. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p><p>Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p> Protocol rewards update: <p>Before diving into the new features supported by Stage 4, we need to announce our enhanced protocol reward mechanics:</p>  Automatic conversion of pending PRPs into available PRPs upon spending of UTXO/s during transfers and withdrawals  A flat PRP bonus upon spending UTXO/s   Wallets, accounts, and transactions <p>Stage 4 testnet now supports internal transfers and withdrawals.</p> Internal transfers (send and receive) <p>Users can transfer zAssets to other Panther users inside the shielded pool using their zAddress. Every Panther user is assigned a zAddress upon sign-up. Find your zAddress in the dashboard by clicking the Receive button, as shown in the screenshot.</p><p>You can also share your Panther account address (zAddress) via a QR code from the receive screen. </p> Withdrawals <p>Users can now withdraw zAssets from the shielded pool to their external, linked wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>This external wallet may be the wallet linked to the original Panther account. Alternatively, testers may create a new Panther account with an alternative external wallet and withdraw to an account that did not originally deposit assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The withdrawal process performs compliance checks to ensure that users own the zAccount they are interacting with. This step also verifies that the wallet accepting withdrawals has no illegal association as part of the KYT (Know Your Transactions) check.</p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p> Get started with Stage 4 testing <p>To start testing Stage 4, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps outlined.</p> Internal Transfers <p>Log into your MetaMask wallet and sign into the Panther dApp.</p> Step 1: Navigate to the Send screen <p>Send is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt;Send tab  zAssets &gt; Portfolio card &gt; Send button  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the amount to send and choose the token from the menu. Currently, zMatic and zZKP are supported.	</p><p>	</p> Step 3: Manage UTXOs&nbsp; <p>The Stage 4 testnet dApp allows the selection of a maximum of two UTXOs in a given transaction, i.e., up to two UTXOs may define a selected balance.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: you don’t have to actively choose as, by default, UTXOs with the top two balances are selected. If the chosen UTXO/s total value exceeds the transfer amount, the balance is returned as a new UTXO in the user’s zAsset list.	</p> Step 4: Specify the destination&nbsp; <p>Provide the destination address in the Panther account format: beginning with “ZK” and totalling 42 characters.</p><p>&nbsp;Enter a new address or select from previously-used addresses.	</p> Step 5: Send <p>Press the Send button to initiate the internal transfer.&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations, your transfer is complete!</p> Withdraw  Step 1: Navigate to the Withdraw screen <p>Withdraw is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt; Withdraw screen  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the withdrawal amount and choose the token from the menu. Currently, zMatic and zZKP are supported.</p> Step 3: Manage UTXOs <p>The Stage 4 testnet dApp allows the selection of a maximum of two UTXOs in a given transaction, i.e. up to two UTXOs may define a selected balance.&nbsp;</p> Step 4: Specify the destination <p>Provide the destination address in the Polygon network format: beginning with “0x” and totaling 42 characters. Either enter a new address or select from previously used options.</p> Step 5: Withdraw <p>Press the Withdraw button to initiate the withdrawal.&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations, your withdrawal is complete!</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks a significant advancement in the protocol’s capabilities and gets us ever closer to our V1 release. As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in testnet Stage 4! </p><p>Note: An issue was reported after Stage 3 that made a specific zZKP UTXO unusable. This UTXO was created by converting PRP to zZKP. Because this UTXO was unusable, we made a custom filter on dApp to not fetch them thus avoiding confusion between good and bad UTXO.&nbsp;</p><p>Users who had those zZKP UTXO, however, will be compensated by a direct distribution to their externally owned account thereby ensuring rewards are not lost. Users do not need to perform any action on their side. </p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

    <p>On February 7th, 2024, at approximately 12:00pm UTC, ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via hard fork at block #1502800. As previous communications have stated, after this hard fork it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then.&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to remove shielded ZEN from shielded addresses prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your shielded ZEN. It’s important to note that transparent ZEN is not affected by the hard fork, just shielded ZEN.&nbsp;</p><p>This move came with the successfully passed <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a> earlier this year, which enabled the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain. This change built upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">ZenIP 42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features. As a result, it will no longer be possible to conduct a private transaction on Horizen or access private addresses as of February 7, 2024.</p><p>This is a complete removal of all private payment features from Horizen, effective Feb 7, 2024. There will be no private payment capabilities in Horizen as of this change. Regular public payments, just like Bitcoin, will continue to be supported by Horizen. Horizen will not be a privacy cryptocurrency anymore when this takes effect on Feb 7, 2024.</p><p>Again, we strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses transfer their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 7th, 2024. After February 7th, 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p><p>There is a guide on the Horizen Blog on how to De-Shield ZEN on Sphere Wallet, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool. Please reference the guide here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/</a></p><p>The Horizen Ecosystem Team remains readily available to answer any questions around this, please open up a ticket, or reach out to us on our Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a></p>

<p>This post has been adapted from <a href="https://twitter.com/venturetwins/status/1741147864498397328">a thread from a16z Partner Justine Moore</a> on X. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/venturetwins">Justine on X</a> for more analysis and observations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2023 was a breakout year for AI video. At the start of the year, no public text-to-video models existed. Just 12 months later, dozens of video generation products are in active use, with millions of users worldwide creating short clips from text or image prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These products are still relatively limited — most generate 3 to 4 second videos, the outputs tend to be mixed in quality, and things like character consistency have yet to be cracked. We’re still far from being able to create a Pixar-level short film with a single text prompt (or even multiple prompts!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the progress we’ve seen in video generation over the past year suggests that we’re in the early innings of a massive transformation — similar to what we saw in image generation. We’re seeing continued improvements in text-to-video models, as well as offshoots like image-to-video and video-to-video gaining steam.</p>
<p>To help understand this explosion in innovation, we’ve tracked the biggest developments so far, companies to keep an eye on, and the remaining underlying questions in this space.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GenAI-Video-Timeline-Inline-1-1.png"></a></p>
 Where can you generate AI video today? 
 Products 
<p>We have been tracking 21 public products so far this year. While you’ve likely heard of Runway, Pika, Genmo, and Stable Video Diffusion, there’s a long list of others to discover.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AI-Video-Products-Inline-2-1.png"></a></p>
<p>Most of these products come from startups — many of which begin with Discord bots, which have a few advantages:</p>
 
 You don’t need to build your own consumer-facing interface, and can focus exclusively on model quality 
 You can tap into Discord’s base of 150 million monthly active users for distribution — especially if you <a href="https://discord.com/servers">get featured</a> on the platform’s “Discover” page 
 Public channels provide an easy way for new users to get inspiration on what to create (by seeing what others generate) and provide social proof for the product 
 
<p>However, we’re starting to see more video products build their own websites or even mobile apps, especially as they mature. While Discord provides a good launchpad, it’s limited in terms of the workflow you can add on top of pure generation, and teams have very little control over the consumer experience. It’s also worth noting that there’s a large percentage of the population who don’t use Discord and may find the interface confusing or don’t return to it frequently.</p>
 Research and Big Tech 
<p>Where are Google, Meta, and others? They’re conspicuously missing from the list of public products — though you may have seen their splashy posts announcing models like Meta’s <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/">Emu Video</a>, Google’s <a href="https://sites.research.google/videopoet/">VideoPoet</a> and <a href="https://lumiere-video.github.io">Lumiere</a>, and ByteDance’s <a href="https://magicvideov2.github.io/">MagicVideo</a>.</p>
<p>Thus far, the big tech companies — with the exception of Alibaba — have chosen to not publicly release their video gen products. Instead, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FZqG6ESvUzfkZB7AOW5YE9pOYOUfjzw7h6XLREvOJo8/edit?pli=1#gid=514547156">they’re publishing papers</a> on various forms of video generation and dropping demo videos without announcing if or when their models will ever be public.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLDR: Meet Lumiere our new text-to-video model from <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleAI?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GoogleAI</a>! </p>

<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These companies all have massive distribution advantages, with billions of users on their products. Why not drop their video models, when their demos look strong and they could have the opportunity to capture meaningful market share in this emerging category?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that these companies move slowly. Most still haven’t released text-to-image products, though Instagram <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-now-offers-ai-generated-backgrounds-on-stories-115054259.html">shipped</a> an AI background generator for Stories late last year, and TikTok has been quietly launching AI filters. Legal, safety, and copyright concerns often make it difficult to convert research into products at these companies and delay rollout — giving newcomers the chance to gain a first-mover advantage.</p>
 What’s next for AI video? 
<p>If you’ve ever used one of these products, you know that there’s much to be improved before AI video is ready for primetime. Getting a “magic moment” where a model generates a beautiful clip that matches your prompt is possible, but relatively rare. It’s more common that you need to hit re-generate a few times and crop or edit the output to get professional-grade clips.</p>
<p>Most of the companies in this space are focused on tackling a few core (and as of yet unsolved) issues:</p>
 
 Control — can you control both what happens in a scene (e.g., if you prompt “man walking forward,” is the movement as described?) and how the “camera” moves? On the latter point, a number of products have added features that allow you to zoom or pan the camera or even add special effects.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The former point — is the movement as described? — has been more difficult to tackle. It’s an underlying model quality issue (does the model understand and can it execute on your prompt), though some companies are trying to give users more control pre-generation. Runway’s motion brush is a good example of this, as it allows you to highlight specific areas of an image and determine how they move.</p>
<blockquote>

<p></p>
 
 Temporal coherence — how can you make characters, objects, and backgrounds stay consistent between frames and not morph into something else or warp? This is a very common problem across all of the publicly available models. If you see a temporally coherent video today that’s longer than a few seconds, it’s likely video-to-video, taking a video and transforming the style with something like <a href="https://stable-diffusion-art.com/animatediff-prompt-travel-video2video/">AnimateDiff prompt travel</a>.

 Length — can you make clips beyond a couple of seconds? This is highly related to temporal coherence. Many companies limit the length of the videos you can generate because they can’t ensure any kind of consistency after a few seconds. If you see a long-form AI video (like the one below), you’ll notice it’s comprised of a bunch of short clips and required dozens, if not hundreds, of prompts! 
 
<p></p>
 Outstanding questions 
<p>It feels like AI video is at GPT-2 level. We’ve made big strides in the last year, but there’s still a way to go before everyday consumers are using these products on a daily basis. When will the “ChatGPT moment” arrive for video? There’s no broad consensus among researchers and founders in the field, and a few questions still to be answered:</p>
 
 Does the current diffusion architecture work for video? Today’s video models are diffusion-based: they essentially generate frames and try to create temporally consistent animations between them (there are multiple strategies to do this). They have no intrinsic understanding of 3D space and how objects should interact, which explains the warping / morphing. For example, it’s not uncommon to see a person walking down a street in the first half of a clip and then melting into the ground in the second — the model has no concept of a “hard” surface. It’s also difficult (if not impossible) to generate the same clip from a different angle due to the lack of 3D conceptualization of a scene.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Some people believe that video models don’t fundamentally need an understanding of 3D space. If they’re trained on enough quality data, they will be able to learn the relationships between objects and how to represent scenes from different angles. Others are convinced that these models will need a 3D engine to generate temporally coherent content, particularly beyond a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Where will the quality training data come from? It’s harder to train video models than other content modalities, largely due to the fact that there’s not as much quality, labeled training data for these models to learn from. Language models are often trained on public datasets like <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/">Common Crawl</a>, while image models are trained on labeled datasets (text-image pairs) like <a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/">LAION</a> and <a href="https://image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>. 
 
<p>Video data is harder to come by. While there is no shortage of publicly accessible video on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, it’s not labeled and may not be diverse enough (things like cat clips and influencer apologies are likely overrepresented in the dataset!). The “holy grail” of video data would likely come from studios or production companies, which have long form videos shot from multiple angles that are accompanied by scripts and directions. However, it’s TBD whether they’ll be willing to license this data for training.&nbsp;</p>
 
 How will these use cases segment between platforms / models? What we’ve seen across almost every content modality is that one model doesn’t “win” for all use cases. For example, Midjourney, Ideogram, and DALL-E all have distinct styles and excel at generating different types of images. 
 
<p>We expect that video will have a similar dynamic. If you test today’s text-to-video and image-to-video models, you’ll notice that they’re good at different styles, types of movement, and scene composition (we’ll show two examples below). The products built around these models will likely further diverge in terms of workflow and serve different end markets. And this doesn’t even include adjacent products that aren’t doing pure text-to-video, but are tackling things like animated human avatars (e.g., <a href="https://app.heygen.com/">HeyGen</a>), VFX (e.g., <a href="https://wonderdynamics.com/">Wonder Dynamics</a>), and video-to-video (e.g., <a href="https://domoai.app/">DomoAI)</a>.</p>

 Who will own the workflow? Beyond pure video generation, making a good clip or film typically requires editing, especially in the current paradigm, where many creators are using video models to animate photos created on another platform. It’s not uncommon to see a video that started as a Midjourney image, got animated on Runway or Pika, and upscaled in Topaz. Creators will then take the video to an editing platform like Capcut or Kapwing and add a soundtrack and voiceover (often generated on other products like Suno and ElevenLabs).&nbsp; 
 
<p>It doesn’t make sense to go back-and-forth between so many products. We expect to see the video generation platforms start to add some of these features themselves. For example, Pika now enables you to upscale video on their site. However, we’re also bullish on an AI-native editing platform that makes it easy to generate content across modalities from different models in one place and piece these things together.&nbsp;</p>

  Partnering with Oasis Security: The Stars Align  <p>At Sequoia, we look for strong teams going after growing markets—and in Danny Brickman and Amit Zimerman, and non-human identity security, that’s exactly what we found.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published January 31, 2024
  



Bogomil, Danny and Amit hiking Twin Peaks in San Francisco.



 
<p>When we first met Danny Brickman in the summer of 2021, we identified him as a young star in the Israeli entrepreneurial ecosystem and someone we should watch. At the time, he was still ideating and had not started a company. But we recognized in him the same passion and drive we’d seen in the founders of Sequoia portfolio companies Wiz and Cyera (who, like Danny, are graduates of the elite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot program</a>).</p>



<p>At the same time, we at Sequoia were developing a thesis that identity was the largest remaining opportunity in security. Why? In part because when we asked CISOs to name their top three priorities, identity security was the most frequent theme. In the lingo of security pros, identity is the new perimeter, with the majority of security attacks today occurring via a malicious actor stealing a user’s identity. It is more important than ever to tighten that perimeter, and to have solid answers to questions like who should have access to what—and who is actually accessing what. Which team members need to use which apps and resources? What kind of access should they have? Are their current privileges too broad?</p>



<p>Most of us are very familiar with the process of securing how humans access systems. We may even get annoyed by the constant reminders to choose stronger passwords—but we know how costly it can be to have our private identity stolen or to allow an attacker into our corporate systems. What comes as a surprise to many, though, is that only a very small fraction of access requests in a company today actually come from humans. In the age of distributed systems, microservices, APIs, automation and AI agents, the overwhelming majority of these requests are from systems and machines—with their own identities, just like ours—accessing other systems and machines.</p>



<p>These non-human identities now outpace human ones by a factor of at least 10, and in some companies 50 or 100—an abundance of riches for an attacker to go after! But even more important, some of these non-human identities like service accounts and secrets (API keys, tokens and certificates) have much broader privileges than most human users; they may be able to not only access an application but also modify its settings or even delete it entirely! And in the hands of bad actors, such identities can wreak yet more havoc—from deleting an entire AWS environment to exfiltrating a lot of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As critical as non-human identities have become, however, the processes and tools for securing them and managing their lifecycle are still emerging—and that can leave teams vulnerable to ticking time bombs, just waiting to explode. One security leader told us about a key generated with permission to read all of the company’s email, with no constraints—which was then emailed to an external contractor who used it to write software on their personal device. Another security admin found a Slack app designed for Christmas greetings that also had full read access to all conversations. Then there was the small recruiting product with root access to all Gmail.</p>



<p>As we at Sequoia explored the challenges and opportunities in the identity security space, we wrote an internal white paper detailing the need we saw, and were considering incubating a company in the domain. But Danny and co-founder Amit Zimerman were recognizing the same opportunity—and they decided to tackle it themselves.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oasis.security/">Oasis Security</a> takes a holistic approach to securing non-human identities, solving for the specific issues that make managing their lifecycle so different from managing human identities. This includes not only the scale, but the rate of change. Human identities change at the rate of employees joining and leaving the team—or changing their passwords. Non-human identities, on the other hand, can be ephemeral, including short-lived tokens and certificates that expire in seconds. Oasis Security’s platform also accounts for the “blast radius” of non-human identities, which are more likely to interfere with entire systems than with individual users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sequoia team is thrilled that the stars aligned for us to support this important work and lead Oasis Security’s Series A, and we are proud to be in business with Danny, Amit and their team as they work to build a generational company. In the face of the huge and growing challenge of securing non-human identity, they are leading the charge toward a solution—and we will all be safer for it.</p>

<p>January 31, 2024, San Francisco, California— Today Brave Software announced the launch of Brave Ads Manager, a new platform to buy, manage, and report on privacy-preserving ad campaigns in the Brave ecosystem. The platform had been in limited <a>beta</a> since last spring and is now offering open <a href="https://ads.brave.com/">registration</a> to customers worldwide.</p>
<p>The Brave browser has grown to an audience of over 65 million monthly users while Brave Ads, which was <a>introduced in 2019</a>, has successfully run 9,000+ campaigns for 1,500+ advertisers in 200 countries. Throughout 2023, Brave Ads also expanded with the help of early adopters to ad placements on <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, the fastest growing search engine since Bing. Brave’s recent clients include Ford, Intuit, Norton, Swarovski, and Wayfair.</p>

 Reaching the next generation of early adopters 
<p><a>Brave users</a> are lead users and are passionate about their role in the future of the Web. As early adopters of emerging technologies like Web3 and AI, they value independence, quality content, and privacy above all when browsing. This makes them engaged but not easily reachable through conventional channels.</p>
<p>Brave Ads reconnects users with advertisers and enables direct relationships where users and brands meet on their own terms. Users set preferences for privacy-respecting ads, choosing when, where and how often to engage. Advertisers signal care for customers by respecting these choices, building goodwill and trust. No trackers or cookies are ever used. Ultimately, both parties benefit from Brave’s model of transparency and control over online experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With over 65 million users and growing, Brave can’t be ignored by brands who want to reach the people at the frontier of the Web. What Brave users do, buy, and talk about today, the rest of the world will be doing, buying, and talking about in years to come.”</p>
<p>Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations</p>
</blockquote>

 The easiest way to advertise with privacy in mind 
<p>Customers can navigate a familiar and streamlined campaign creation process to create their Brave Ads campaigns in minutes. Once a campaign is submitted for review, customers can expect launch within 48 hours. Throughout the campaign, customers will have access to a dashboard to view campaign performance through a range of basic and advanced tools, all designed for practical use in the cookieless Web.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



    
    

Brave Ads Manager campaign creation</p>

 Unique browser-based ad placements 
<p>Brave Ads Manager customers have the option to buy Notification and Newsfeed ad placements, two of four available ad types found throughout the Brave <a>browser</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/notification/">Notification ads</a> were the first—and remain the most popular—ad unit to launch with Brave Ads in the browser. For acquisition-based campaign objectives, advertisers can leverage Mindset Ad Targeting, Brave’s unique ad-matching technology that delivers precision, interest-based targeting at the browser level without risks or harm to privacy.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/news/">Newsfeed ads</a> are native image and text placements integrated seamlessly within Brave News, a free and customizable RSS and news aggregator available in the Brave browser via a new tab page. Ads in Brave News are always 100% SOV (share of voice)—two ads will never display in the feed at the same time.</p>

<p>Brave’s two other ad placements—<a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/ntt/">New Tab Takeovers</a> and <a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-search/keyword/">Search keyword ads</a>—are available as managed service buys and can be booked by <a href="https://ads.brave.com/contact">contacting Brave’s ad sales team</a>.</p>
<p>About Brave Ads</p>
<p><a>Brave Ads launched in 2019</a> with the goal of reforming an increasingly user-hostile Web, made worse by ever-invasive tracking from innumerable ad-technology firms competing to capture as much data—people’s data—as possible. Brave Ads are cookieless, don’t track or identify users, and offer choice in how brands engage with them as they browse and search the Web.</p>

 Consensus 2024 — Verus Showcases Fully Completed PBaaS Blockchain Technology  Verus showcases its fully completed Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology at Consensus 2024, May 29–31, Austin, USA. The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.  The L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks <p>Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (<a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID</a>) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to&nbsp;them.</p><p>All these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts — it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0">read more</a>] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">more on the&nbsp;Bridge</a>].</p> Showcasing Verus App-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024 <p>Get ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today’s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.</p><p>Build applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday’s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have&nbsp;been.</p><p>Write applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one or more blockchains. Use, create, sell, and provision your application’s permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on the rent-free, credibly neutral and fully decentralized Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p><p>Builders of applications, organizations, and businesses can use the Verus Protocol to provision IDs, manage and interact with users and user state at any scale, launch currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity baskets [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">see docs</a>]), even fully interoperable, independent, customizable worldwide blockchains with their own economics and fee structure, while sharing mining and economic power across the entire Verus Protocol network of unlimited PBaaS chains. All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">see docs</a>] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic&nbsp;control.</p><p>With Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">see docs</a>], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamlessly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.</p><p>All currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.</p><p>Whether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you’ll be left behind if you don’t deep dive on Verus&nbsp;first.</p><p>Join us in the next crypto revolution. Verus, with truth and privacy for&nbsp;all!</p><p>Come to the Verus booth on May 29–31 at Consensus 2024. The worldwide community is happy to get you started with a free VerusID, the easy to use Verus Mobile or any of the wide range of protocol features.</p> Amazing Verus Community <p>The Verus community united to facilitate participation at Consensus 2024 by generously contributing VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR, Bridge.vETH and BTC. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors! ❤️</p><p>The Verus community used the funds to secure a two-block booth at Consensus, along with other facilities that we can not disclose&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Numerous members of the Verus community are participating in Consensus 2024, and we invite you to be a part of it too! Let’s create a significant presence and showcase to the world the wide range of capabilities of Verus.

<p>Happy 8th birthday, PIVX!</p><p>It’s time to celebrate another incredible year of achievements and growth. Over the past year, PIVX has reached new heights, expanding its use cases, increasing rewards, gaining listings on various exchanges, and engaging with its vibrant community.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of this remarkable year for&nbsp;PIVX:</p><p>Rewards Increase: <br>The most significant highlight was the rewards increase. With the mandatory PIVX v5.5.0 update in January 2023, payments to the treasury, staking rewards, and Masternode rewards all received a significant boost. Treasury payments surged by an order of magnitude to 10 PIV per block, staking payments doubled to 4 PIV per block, and Masternode payments also doubled to 6 PIV per block. These increases have incentivized more participation and further strengthened the PIVX&nbsp;network!</p><p>Use Case Expansion: <br>PIVX expanded its use cases throughout the year. PIVCards, Coinsbee, and <a href="https://www.travala.com/">Travala.com</a> embraced $PIVX as a payment option. Users can now purchase gift cards from all over the world with PIV on<a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/"> mypivxwallet.org, PIVCards</a>, <a href="https://shopping.io/">Shopping.io</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coinsbee.com/">Coinsbee</a> offers a platform where $PIVX can be used to purchase various gift&nbsp;cards.</p><p>Listing Growth: <br>PIVX experienced significant listing growth, providing more opportunities for PIVX enthusiasts. New listings included <a href="https://whitebit.com/">Whitebit</a>, <a href="https://changeangel.io/">Changeangel</a>, <a href="https://houdiniswap.com/">Houdini Swap</a>, <a href="https://cointopay.com/">Cointopay</a>, <a href="https://swapuz.com/">Swapuz</a>, <a href="https://easybit.com/">Easybit, </a><a href="https://www.coinex.com/">CoinEx</a>, <a href="https://dex-trade.com/">Dex-Trade</a>, Securus Wallet, <a href="https://www.biconomy.com/">Biconomy,</a> Coinstore, <a href="https://nonkyc.io/">NonKYC</a>, <a href="https://changenow.io/">ChangeNOW </a>widget added to PIVX.org, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/markets">TradeOgre</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/breaking-news-9615d5416f6c">P2P payments on Binance,</a> <a href="https://www.lbank.com/">LBank</a>, <a href="https://arcticwallet.io/">Arctic Wallet</a>, <a href="https://finchpay.io/">FinchPay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xt.com/en">Xt.com</a>.</p><p>Enhanced Trading Options: <br>PIVX gained enhanced trading options with various exchanges. In addition to the PIVX/USDT Binance trading pair, some other exchanges introduced BTC as well as USDT options, allowing for more convenient and accessible trading options for the PIVX community.</p><p>Community Engagement: <br>PIVX actively engaged with its community through various activities. These included YouTube shorts, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), the SuperBlock Report (PIVXLabs), PIVXcommunity contests, and the Privacy Roundtable, a collaborative group consisting of PIVX, BasicSwapDEX, Particl, and Firo. The Privacy Roundtable, hosts monthly Twitter spaces where trending privacy topics are discussed and other privacy projects are introduced. These initiatives are fostering a more vibrant and engaged community.</p><p>As we celebrate PIVX’s 8th birthday, we can proudly reflect on these achievements over the past year. The rewards increase, expanded use cases, listing growth, enhanced trading options, and community engagement have all contributed to the growth and success of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>On this special day, let us say that growth is not a destination, but an ongoing journey. As we celebrate PIVX’s achievements, we recognize that it is through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the embrace of new opportunities, and the adaptability to changing circumstances that PIVX continues to evolve and expand. Let us come together as a community committed to learning and adapting, keeping PIVX at the forefront of innovation and progress in the pursuit of privacy and financial sovereignty</p><p>Happy 8th birthday, PIVX!

<p>As students of financial markets, we’re keenly interested in moments of inflection which alter market structure, spawn dominant new institutions, and catalyze the growth of new asset classes. Historically, these shifts have been driven by both technology and policy change – think microprocessors and the deregulation of fixed income trading commissions in the 1970s. Innovations in capital markets and the development of new exchanges lead directly to increased price transparency, liquidity, and a broader ecosystem of market participants. Furthermore, early movers benefit from compounding competitive advantages as new supply begets demand and so forth, resulting in higher valuation multiples than almost any other category in fintech.</p>
<p>We believe we are at another moment of inflection at the intersection of renewable energy and financial markets. Increased investment in areas like advanced manufacturing, novel battery storage technologies, and new energy production are furthering American energy independence and laying the foundation for a more resilient and sustainable future. The recent passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) promises to significantly accelerate this trend, specifically, through the expansion and extension of tax credits related to clean energy and decarbonization. While these credits have existed in various forms for decades, the IRA made them transferable for the first time. Over $280 billion of new clean energy projects have been announced in the last year, including battery plants in Georgia, geothermal projects in Utah, and solar installations in Arizona. These and other large scale investments have brought tens of thousands of jobs across the United States, and we are just at the beginning – <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/the-us-is-poised-for-an-energy-revolution.html">Goldman Sachs estimates that $3 trillion will be invested</a> in clean energy and decarbonization over the next 10 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.cruxclimate.com/">Crux</a>, the leading ecosystem for transferable clean energy tax credits. Through powerful software at the center of the largest network of market participants, Crux has quickly become the de facto platform for buying and selling transferable tax credits. Crux launched about 9 months ago and is already working with more than 100 partners and has over $8 billion of credits currently available for sale. They are already making transactions more efficient, facilitating price discovery, enhancing transparency, and providing instantaneous access to billions of dollars of active buy-side interest.</p>
<p>Historically, developers have sourced around 30% of their capital through tax credits. Large financial institutions have been the most significant providers of this form of project finance — known as traditional tax equity partnerships. Institutional investment would accelerate working capital for developers while generating attractive yields and offsetting corporate tax liabilities for the investor. While these partnerships have been lucrative for both sides, they’ve been highly bespoke offline transactions and thus were limited to the largest and most sophisticated developers and institutions. Plus, traditional tax equity required investors to be equity partners in the projects, requiring a higher level of diligence and involvement than perhaps either side desired. The transferability of these tax credits, however, significantly lowers the barriers to entry for smaller developers and corporate buyers alike. Furthermore, it also enables the participation of new intermediaries like regional banks, as well as tax advisors and syndicators to play an important role in facilitating transactions for their clients. We believe there is a significant commercial opportunity to aggregate these market participants through software and a network, and to drive the growth of this emergent asset class. Importantly, transferable tax credits offer corporations with taxable income a chance to both cut their tax liability and seize a financial opportunity while supporting sustainability and energy independence. It’s a savvy fiduciary move with a benevolent impact.</p>
<p>We’ve had the pleasure of getting to know Crux co-founders Alfred Johnson and Allen Kramer for several years and have been impressed by their quick execution – leveraging their prior entrepreneurial experience building marketplace businesses and their deep knowledge of policy from prior work in the White House and Treasury Department. They’ve assembled a world class team of technologists, energy professionals, and capital markets experts – including Rob Parker, Chief Commercial Officer, who brings more than 20 years of energy finance experience to the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that Andreessen Horowitz will be leading Crux’s Series A round of financing and that I will be joining their board of directors. We’re thrilled to be partnering with Alfred and Allen and to be investing alongside existing investors Lowercarbon Capital, Ardent Venture Partners, New System Ventures, Overture, Canapi Ventures, Orsted, LS Power, Hartree, CIV, as well as individuals like KKR founder Henry R. Kravis to support Crux’s next phase of growth. </p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This latest version is a hotfix release, to temporarily remove the experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature introduced in the preceding 1.5.1 release. Following the 1.5.1 release on GitHub, we identified difficulties in publishing the&nbsp;zebra-chain&nbsp;crate to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, to resolve this challenge, which involves an unpublished dependency, we had to temporarily remove the internal miner support introduced in version 1.5.1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 1.5.1 release includes a utility for reading results from the zebra blockchain scanner, thus finalizing a minimum viable product for scanning the Zcash blockchain with a viewing key. It also added an experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature, temporarily removed with the 1.5.2 hotfix release, which can mine blocks within&nbsp;zebrad. This feature is only supported on testnet as you need to use a more efficient GPU or ASIC for mainnet mining.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We plan to reinstate the&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature once our PRs are merged and released into the&nbsp;equihash dependency. You can track development progress on this issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/8183">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of this release we have also improved our documentation with details on how to use the new blockchain scanning feature as well as making it easier to find documentation for all our crates in <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see a full copy of the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.1">v1.5.1 Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.2">v1.5.2 Release Notes</a> on github.</p>

<p>Few people love the software they use to get things done. And it’s no surprise why. Whether it’s a slide deck builder, a video editor, or a photo enhancer, today’s work tools were conceived decades ago — and it shows! Even best-in-class products often feel either too inflexible and unsophisticated to do real work, or have steep, inaccessible learning curves (we’re looking at you, Adobe InDesign).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generative AI offers founders an opportunity to completely reinvent workflows — and will spawn a new cohort of companies that are not just AI-augmented, but fully AI-native. These companies will start from scratch with the technology we have now, and build new products around the generation, editing, and composition capabilities that are uniquely possible due to AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the most surface level, we believe AI will help users do their existing work more efficiently. AI-native platforms will “up level” user interactions with software, allowing them to delegate lower skill tasks to an AI assistant and spend their time on higher-level thinking. This applies not only to traditional office workers, but to small business owners, freelancers, creators, and artists — who arguably have even more complex demands on their time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But AI will also help users unlock completely new skill sets, on both a technical and an aesthetic level. We’ve already seen this with products like Midjourney and ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter. Everyone can now be a programmer, a producer, a designer, or a musician, shrinking the gap between creativity and craft. With access to professional-grade yet consumer-friendly products with AI-powered workflows, everyone can be a part of a new generation of “prosumers.”</p>
<p>In this piece, we aim to highlight the features of today’s — and tomorrow’s — most successful Gen AI-native workflows, as well as hypothesize about how we see these products evolving.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GenAI-Native-Workflows-Inline.png"></a></p>
 What Will GenAI Native Prosumer Products Look Like?  
<p>All products with Gen AI-native workflows will share one crucial trait: translating cutting-edge models into an accessible, effective UI.</p>
<p>Users of workflow tools typically don’t care what infrastructure is behind a product; they care about how it helps them! While the technological leaps we’ve made with Generative AI are amazing, successful products will importantly still start from a deep understanding of the user and their pain points. What can be abstracted away with AI? Where are the key “decision points” that need approval, if any? And where are the highest points of leverage?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few key features we believe products in this category will have:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Generation tools that kill the “blank page” problem. The earliest and most obvious consumer AI use cases have come from translating a natural language prompt into a media output — e.g., image, video, and text generators. The same will be true in prosumer. These tools might help transform true “blank pages” (e.g., a text prompt to slide deck), or take incremental assets (e.g., a sketch or an outline) and turn them into a more fleshed-out product. 
 
<p>Some companies will do this via a proprietary model, while others may mix or stitch together multiple models (open source, proprietary, or via API) behind the scenes. One example here is <a href="https://www.vizcom.ai/">Vizcom’s</a> rendering tool. Users can input a text prompt, sketch, or 3D model, and instantly get a photorealistic rendering to further iterate on.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Vizcom_Render__V1.gif"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example is <a href="https://durable.co/">Durable’s website builder product</a>, which the company says has been used to generate more than 6 million sites so far. Users input their company name, segment, and location, and Durable will spit out a site for them to customize. As LLMs get more powerful, we expect to see products like Durable pull real information about your business from elsewhere on the internet and social media — the history, team, reviews, logos, etc. — and generate an even more sophisticated output from just one generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Recorded_screen_1_V1-1.gif"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Multimodal (and multimedia!) combinations. Many creative projects require more than one type of content. For example, you may want to combine an image with text, music with video, or an animation with a voiceover. As of now, there isn’t one model that can generate all of these asset types. This creates an opportunity for workflow products which allow users to generate, refine, and stitch different content types in one place. 
 
<p><a href="https://www.heygen.com/">HeyGen’s</a> avatar product is one example of such a tool. The company merges its own avatar and lip-dubbing models with <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a>’ text-to-speech API to create realistic, talking video avatars (check out Justine’s <a href="https://twitter.com/venturetwins/status/1743302133624307917">here</a>). HeyGen’s product also has templates and a Canva-esque editor to put avatars within a deck or video, create slides, or add text or other assets, eliminating the need to take your avatar to Powerpoint or Google Slides.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HeyGens-Avatar-Editor-Inline.png"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Intelligent editors that enable more iteration. Almost no work product is “one shot” — especially with AI, when there’s inherent randomness in every generation. It’s rare that you get exactly what you want on the first run. Hitting the re-generate button and/or revising your prompt is a critical, but time-consuming and frustrating, part of the process.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The first wave of AI generation products didn’t allow for any iteration: you created an image (or video, or music), and that was it. If you re-ran the same prompt, you’d get completely different results. We’re now starting to see features that enable users to take an existing output and refine it without completely starting from scratch. Midjourney’s variation and zoom tools are a good example of this.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Midjourneys-Zoom-Feature-Inline.png"></a></p>
<p>In video, <a href="https://pika.art/login">Pika</a> provides similar functionality. Users can take a clip they’ve already created and modify a specific region — for example, changing the gender or hair color of a character or adding or removing an object. Users can also expand the canvas by inpainting in blank space around the existing video.&nbsp;</p>
 
<a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pika-Workflow.mp4">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pika-Workflow.mp4</a> 
 
 In-platform refinement. Another crucial (and related) element to intelligent editing is refinement; the final 10% of polishing work is often the difference between creating something good, versus something great. But it can be a challenge to: (1) figure out what needs refining; and (2) make these refinements without needing to move into other products. 
 
<p>AI workflow products can help users identify what can be improved, and then automatically make these improvements. Think of this like Apple’s “auto-retouch” feature on photos, but as “auto-retouch” for anything! The most literal interpretation of this is upscaling, which platforms like <a href="https://www.krea.ai/home">Krea</a> provide. Within one interface, users can generate an image or design and then enhance it — getting them much closer to a final product.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Untitled_Project_V1.gif"></a></p>
<p>ElevenLabs’ audiobook workflow is another good example. You can use the tool to generate voices for specific characters to narrate sections of a book, and then, refine the output to perfection by adjusting pauses, stability, or clarity of a sentence or phrase.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ElevenLabs-Audiobook-Workflow-Inline.png"></a></p>
 
 Output that is remixable and transposable. AI makes content uniquely flexible — every piece of content is a potential “jumping off” point for another iteration. If you’ve ever copied and tweaked a prompt from someone else’s generation in Midjourney or ChatGPT, you’ve participated in this.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Platforms that play into this flexibility may build stronger and stickier products. For the initial creator, there is huge value in being able to transform your work across mediums,&nbsp; e.g., turning a video into a blog post, or a text explainer into a how-to animated video. This is a core feature of <a href="https://gamma.app/">Gamma</a>’s publishing platform. Users can generate a deck, document, or webpage from a prompt or uploaded file, and switch formats if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Recorded_screen_1_V1.gif"></a></p>
<p>From an external-facing perspective, these products can allow users to expose their workflow for others to iterate on. This might be a series of prompts or a combination of models — or simply a “copy” button for less technical users to mimic an output or aesthetic.</p>
<p><a href="https://imagen-ai.com/">Imagen AI</a>, an editing platform for professional photographers, is one example of this. The company trains a model on each photographer’s individual style, allowing them to batch edit more easily. However, users can also choose to edit in the style of industry-leading photographers who have made their profiles available on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Imagens-Talent-AI-Profiles-Inline-1.png"></a></p>
 How Will Prosumer Products Evolve?   
<p>It’s still early days for the next generation of prosumer tools. While existing tools’ abilities to generate core assets are finally strong enough to add meaningful workflows, most products are still only focused on one type of content — and are fairly limited in terms of functionality. Here are a few things we’re hoping to see in the coming months:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Editing tools that combine content modalities. Video might be the best example of this. Today, creating a short film with AI requires generating multiple clips in a product like Pika or Runway, and then moving them to another platform like Capcut or Kapwing for editing or sound mixing (or adding a voice that was generated elsewhere!).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What if you could do every step of this process in one platform? We expect that some of the emerging generation products will be able to both add more workflow features, and expand into other types of content generation — this could be done through training their own models, leveraging open source models, or partnering with other players. We may also see a new standalone, AI-native editor emerge that enables users to “plug in” different models.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/From-Standalone-to-Full-Stack-Inline.png"></a></p>
<p>2. Products that utilize different modes of interaction. Text prompts aren’t always the most effective way to communicate with AI products. We believe that you should be able to work with generative tools like you’d collaborate with a human brainstorming partner — whether that’s via speech, sketches, or sharing inspo photos. </p>
<p>We’re particularly excited about voice as a modality that allows users to share more sophisticated and complex thoughts (or simply ramble in a way that’s not possible with text). Such products have already started to emerge, with <a href="https://www.theoasis.com/">Oasis</a>, <a href="https://talknotes.io/">TalkNotes</a>, and <a href="https://audiopen.ai/">AudioPen</a> all able to transform voice notes into emails, blog posts, or tweets. We expect audio and even video as an input source to arrive in many more workflow products, transforming how and when users can get work done.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Oasis-Voice-Capabilities-Inline.png"></a></p>
<p>3. Products that treat human and AI-generated content as equal citizens. We’d love to see tools that enable you to work with AI and human content side-by-side. Most products today are focused on one or the other. For example, they’re great at enhancing real photos, but do nothing to AI images. Or they can generate a new video, but can’t enhance or restyle a clip from your iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, we expect that most professional content producers will work with a mix of AI and human-generated content. The products they use should welcome both types of content, and even make it easier to combine them. <a href="https://runwayml.com/">Runway</a>’s editing tools exemplify this. You can pull in clips and images from the company’s generative models and upload real assets to use in the same timeline. You can then use the company’s “magic tools,” such as inpainting and green screen, on both types of content.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Runways-Editing-Tools-Inline.png"></a></p>
<p>Content workflow products, which we’ve focused on here, are just one important component of the future of prosumer software. Come back soon for our deep dive into a second key component — productivity tools — which we feel are equally ripe for reinvention in the AI era.&nbsp;</p>

 Zcash Viewing Keys 



<p>When a Zcash user creates a shielded transaction, they encrypt it to the recipient’s address. Being able to access the data hidden behind the encryption is a necessary condition for the recipient to spend the funds, but it’s not sufficient since the recipient also needs to prove ownership of the spending key corresponding to the address. To decrypt the shielded transaction, the recipient uses a so-called viewing key, which they derive from their spending key. A viewing key allows decryption of the shielded data but reveals nothing about the spending key, effectively allowing “viewing” of shielded transactions but not spending of them.</p>



 Blockchain Scanning with Zebra 



<p>All Zcash users use their viewing keys to learn about what transactions belong to them. They try to decrypt each transaction in the blockchain to see if they can unlock the shielded data. We refer to this process as scanning or trial decryption. Light clients can perform the scanning locally so that the public server they communicate with doesn’t learn anything about their transactions. However, some users operate their own infrastructure. These are typically enterprise users, such as exchanges, which are best served using a scanning service closely linked to their full node.</p>



<p>At Zcon4, the Electric Coin Company and Zcash Foundation agreed to move the Zcash ecosystem to Zebra. To be able to do so, Zebra needs to support wallets capable of replacing the wallet in zcashd. As a first step toward this goal, we decided to extend Zebra with a blockchain scanner that accepts viewing keys and performs the trial decryption of shielded transactions. The scanner then stores the results in persistent storage. This functionality should allow for an efficient implementation of wallets relying on Zebra.</p>



 Implementation Details 



<p>The current scanner is a new crate in the Zebra repository, in the form of a minimum viable product. It relies on the librustzcash library to perform the scanning, and supports only Sapling. It reads all blocks through Zebra’s internal state service and stores the TXIDs, referring to transactions that contain notes decryptable by the provided viewing keys. The storage is a separate instance of RocksDB that Zebra also uses for storing the state.</p>



<p>The current version of the scanner is documented for users in our <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">Zebra book</a>. If you want to give it a try, you can use <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-utils#scanning-results-reader">this tool</a> to read the scanning results. If you submit the scanning <a href="https://zecpages.com/boardinfo">key from ZECpages</a>, it will print all posts from the board to standard output. The next step for the scanner is to implement a gRPC frontend, exposing the scanner’s capabilities to Zebra users.</p>

<p>With today’s desktop browser update (v1.62), we are excited to announce that we have integrated Mixtral 8x7B as the default large language model (LLM) in <a>Leo</a>, our recently released, privacy-preserving AI browser assistant. <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is an open source LLM released by <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a> this past December, and has already seen broad usage due to its speed and performance. In addition, we’ve made several improvements to the Leo user experience, focusing on clearer onboarding, context controls, input and response formatting, and general UI polish.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    



    
    

    


    



    
    


 Unveiling Mixtral 8x7B 
<p>Mixtral is now the default LLM for all Leo users, for the free version and the Premium version ($15/month). The free version is rate limited, and subscribers to Leo Premium benefit from higher rate limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Among other benefits, Mixtral can:</p>
 
 Handle larger contexts 
 Interact in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish 
 Generate code 
 
<p>Brave is already using Mixtral for its newly released <a>Code LLM</a> feature for programming-related queries in <a>Brave Search</a>, and the combination of Mixtral’s performance with its open source nature made it a natural fit for integration in Leo, given Brave’s commitment to open models and the open source community.</p>
<p>“Since its release, Brave Leo has been adopted by tens of thousands of free tier users and paid subscribers, and we expect even greater adoption as we expand our availability of LLMs to include Mixtral,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder at Brave. “Our aim is to create novel and convenient use cases in the context of users’ browsing sessions, and to help our users interact with the Web in groundbreaking ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very happy to see Mixtral being used to power CodeLLM in Brave Search, and to now have Mixtral integrated in Brave Leo,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO at Mistral Al. “Making Mixtral available as an open model enables Brave to easily integrate it and to fulfill their users’ growing AI needs.”&nbsp;</p>

 Giving Leo users choice with a variety of LLMs 
<p>Unlike other AI assistants, Brave Leo offers its users the flexibility to choose from different models according to their needs and budget. While we’ve added Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for both the free and premium versions of Brave Leo, we also offer Claude Instant from Anthropic in the free version (with rate limits) and for Premium. The free and premium versions of Leo also feature the Llama 2 13B model from Meta.</p>
<p>With Mixtral’s integration, Leo users will notice a significant performance improvement in the answer/result quality. Regarding the free Leo version, users will also have the option to revert to the previous Leo experience with Llama 2 and continue their AI experience once they reach the rate limits for Mixtral.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>Privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. Privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers. 
 No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp; 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 Ready to try Brave Leo? 
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it’s built right into the browser, so no extra apps or extensions are required. Leo provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or as a sidebar, chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage. Leo helps users with all sorts of tasks in the context of the page they are on by creating real-time summaries of webpages or videos. Leo can also answer questions about content, generate new content, translate pages, analyze them, and rewrite them. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, writing code, or creating content, Leo is integrated in the browser for enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>To access Leo, Brave desktop users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in the Brave Sidebar.</p>
<p>Leo has been available to Brave desktop users since November (<a>version 1.60</a>). Leo will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) soon. Learn more about <a>Brave Leo</a>, or see a <a>roadmap</a> for Leo.</p>

  To kick off 2024, we're thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed.

<p>To kick off 2024, we’re thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed. The improved Brave News creates an even more seamless experience for catching up on personalized news, by simply scrolling down in a new browser tab. Brave News is free and the update includes a streamlined interface as well as an upgrade to the local personalization algorithms. These changes make Brave News both easier to use and smarter about the stories you see, while maintaining Brave’s privacy promise.</p>
<p>This newly optimized Brave News feed gives users more choice and control over what they see, and options for filtering content by channel or publisher. The improved local feed algorithm helps users discover new and interesting stories and provides suggestions for following channels and publishers they might enjoy. Users can also add RSS feeds, and choose to view content only from their favorite local publishers, blogs, or community sites.</p>
<p>Key updates include:</p>
 
 A For you section that shows stories based on your interests and local browsing history - while never infringing on your privacy 
 An updated top news section and story clusters 
 A filter view for viewing content by channel, source, or RSS feed 
 An easily visible news preview on the new tab page, with the latest news that may be of interest to you 
 

 One place, better control 
<p>In this update, we were hyper-focused on the way news is presented. We redesigned the Brave News space to show more articles and be more conscious about how we display images so you can get more value from a glance. We also added a side navigation panel so you can explore your favorite channels and publishers in a single click.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking for an interesting mix of daily news, then check out the For you and Following feeds. Whether you want an overview of the day’s news, or you’re looking for something specific, Brave News puts you in control of your news experience…all while protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>To find Brave News, just open Brave on your desktop, then open a new tab and scroll down.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




    
    

Redesigned Brave News feed page</p>

 Content that’s relevant to you 
<p>Endlessly scrolling through irrelevant news can be a real time waste. That’s why we overhauled how your feed is created and personalized, making it smarter and more attuned to your interests. The improved Brave News now prioritizes showing you content you may actually want to read.</p>
<p>Some new features take the form of new types of cards displayed in the feed. Channel cards, for example, are single-themed deep dives into the channels and topics you care about the most. And for US users, Top stories cards neatly summarize the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



    
    



    
    

    


    



    
    
</p>
<p>Left: Channel card: single-themed deep dives into topics you care about most. Right: Top Stories card: summaries of the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>To make customizing your feed even easier, we added Customize cards to the feed. These cards will recommend new publishers and/or channels you might be interested in, based on your existing preferences and signals.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




    
    

Brave News customization cards</p>
<p>The customization menu is also accessible via the settings button at the bottom right, or via the Add button in the new side navigation panel.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>News aggregators are a common way to consume news. However, the way most popular aggregators work is by collecting and storing your preferences, consumption habits, and other behavioral data to determine what news to show you.</p>
<p>But the news you consume can tell a lot about you, from your political beliefs to fine-grained interests (e.g. a review about a self-help book) and more. For these reasons, we believe that the news you consume should have the same privacy protections as anything else you do online. Unlike others, Brave does not collect or store your data.</p>
<p>From how articles are delivered to how and where personalization happens, Brave News has been designed with privacy in mind. Information about your consumption habits—what channels and publishers you follow, the exact articles you click and read, and more—never leaves your computer. Because a great news experience does not require data collection, Brave’s local personalization mechanisms ensure the news in your feed is relevant, interesting, and private.</p>

<p>Backing open-ended breakthrough research is at the core of BlueYard’s investing philosophy, whether it’s nuclear fusion, programmable stem cells or novel crypto-compute infrastructure. Hackers and researchers remain the essential backbone of the crypto industry. We are proud to have supported the work of research-focused companies like <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>, <a href="https://www.tromero.ai/">Tromero</a> and more in solving critical crypto compute and infrastructure challenges, including those that could be key to unlocking adoption and enabling groundbreaking novel use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>This brings us to our core thesis underpinning our crypto investing strategy:</p><blockquote>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</blockquote><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Within this context, it is essential that individual researchers and hackers continue to explore open-ended research, despite the current funding and regulatory headwinds in the industry. Individual research is often the nucleus of a future key component of the crypto industry. ​​In that spirit, we are announcing BlueYard DYOR (Do Your Own Research, and pronounced like <a href="https://youtu.be/HPsgY7zCtck?feature=shared&amp;t=41">this</a>) funding program. We’re offering $100k to thoughtful researchers and builders to pursue their curiosities and research in crypto, with an open-ended outcome if their work is contributed to the industry and/or forms the nucleation of a new company or&nbsp;network.</p><p>As the name suggests, we expect the BlueYard DYOR cohort to conduct independent crypto research and/or work on a project. You don’t currently have to have a company, team, or a specific idea of what you want to build or research. Simply a direction of what you want to pursue. We are geography agnostic and excited to work with the best minds wherever they might&nbsp;be.</p><p>You are someone&nbsp;who:</p>  Has a track record of experimenting and building (show us your&nbsp;work!)  Might be sitting on the sidelines waiting for the bear market to blow over (now is the best time to start something new) or don’t have the personal funding to spend more time pursuing your crypto curiosities  Is independent, insatiably curious, and excited to try novel things in&nbsp;crypto  Understands the potential of crypto beyond its speculative value and wants to build for the long&nbsp;term  <p>What you can expect from BlueYard&nbsp;DYOR:</p>  Access to the BlueYard team and its crypto portfolio (and the wider science and compute companies in our broader portfolio) to support you in your&nbsp;work  A cohort of 10 other builders experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in&nbsp;crypto  Help in publishing / releasing and distributing what you have&nbsp;built  Access to crypto and science events alongside meetups within the BlueYard&nbsp;family  Help in setting up an entity through which the DYOR funding will be received via an uncapped&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">SAFE</a>  <p>You can learn more about our crypto portfolio <a href="http://www.blueyard.com">here</a> and apply for BlueYard DYOR&nbsp;<a href="https://blueyard.typeform.com/to/vvc3f8BC">here</a>.</p>

      ZEN 5.0.0 is the official Mainnet Release  ZEN 4.1.1 (previous version) is going to deprecate on Mainnet at block #1502084, on February 6th, 2024 at approximately 6:00 AM UTC. Please, update to ZEN 5.0.0 before February 6th, 2024.  ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via Hard Fork at block #1502800, on February 7th, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled so that it will no longer be possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded, and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.  Only nodes running on Mainnet have to be updated.      <p>IMPORTANT: 5.0.0.<br>After the previously mentioned Hard Fork, it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br><br></p><p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0.md">Here.</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a> is developing hardware to speed up zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic scheme that secures much of web3 and is a critical component for scaling Ethereum.</p><p>ZK proofs allow verification that a transaction or smart contract was executed without revealing any of the details. This was first used to support private transactions in protocols like ZCash. The even more promising application is to increase the scalability of protocols such as Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions such as StarkWare execute transactions and smart contracts for users and then post a ZK proof to Ethereum. This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on Ethereum and enables transaction volumes similar to traditional payment networks such as&nbsp;Visa.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Inside of every CPU are specialized circuits for speeding up the cryptography used to secure the internet today. At first, Ingonyama might look like a niche business designing specialized hardware for scaling crypto protocols. As the internet becomes more decentralized, the same hardware could secure every internet-connected device.

<p>Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase: A Gateway to Promising Opportunities</p><p>As we commemorate the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://pivx.org/news/pivx-rewards-increase">PIVX’s rewards increase,</a> it is a moment of celebration and reflection on the positive impact this decision has had on the PIVX ecosystem. On January 22, 2023, coinciding with block 3715200, PIVX embraced the version 5.5.0 upgrade, marking a significant milestone in its financial structure. This upgrade brought forth remarkable changes, including increased payments to the treasury, staking and Masternode rewards, setting the stage for further growth, innovation, and community engagement.</p><p>Expanding Opportunities and Strengthening the Network:<br>With the rewards increase, maximum treasury payments soared to 10 PIV per block. This surge in funding allows for greater support for listings, use cases, development, marketing, and essential initiatives within the PIVX community. Simultaneously, staking rewards doubled to 4 PIV per block, providing an incentive for more PIVX holders to actively participate in securing the network. Doubling of Masternode payments to 6 PIV per block further encourages the growth of Masternodes, enabling them to vote on treasury expenditures and contribute to future PIVX applications. These advancements not only strengthen the PIVX network but also open doors to exciting opportunities for growth and development.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>As we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the PIVX rewards increase, we acknowledge the positive impact it has had on the project’s financial structure. The rewards increase is succeeding in enhancing funding, stimulating proposal submissions, expanding use cases, and attracting more listings for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX.</a> It has played a vital role in supporting various initiatives and contributing to the growth and opportunities of the&nbsp;<a href="http://Discord.PIVX.org">project.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/celebrating-one-year-of-pivx-rewards-increase-9c4146cd3e17">Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol's zero-knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><blockquote>Disclaimer: Panther is not recommending that readers engage in cryptoasset trading activity, and users or potential users of the protocol should not regard this message or its contents as involving any form of recommendation, invitation, or inducement to deal in cryptoassets. Due to the potential for losses, regulators consider this asset class to be high risk.</blockquote>

<p>Web2 file storage relies heavily on centralised entities, which have mostly outgrown their competitors, establishing a quasi-monopoly. The reasons for this are twofold: enormous operating costs and seamless user experience (e.g. social logins and account recovery), which, until recently, could only be solved through centralisation. Add to this the reluctance to change platforms as users need to re-upload their files, and you get an ossified user base. However, data leaks and hacks are a constant threat to users’ privacy, and indicate the disruptive potential of decentralised file storage and sharing.</p><p>We were joined by Andreas Tsamados &amp; Vijay Krishnavanshi, co-founders of Fileverse, to discuss their decentralised file sharing solution and how they plan to disrupt the Web2 quasi-monopoly.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Returning to the P2P roots of the Internet  Web2 vs. Web3 user experience (UX)  Business models for Web2 data  Decentralising data  Web3 data storage  Costs of data storage  Managing file updates and permissions  Fileverse use cases  The business model of Fileverse  Improving UX  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/miroyato">Andreas Tsamados on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0x6b8">Vijay Krishnavanshi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/fileverse">Fileverse on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

     Introduction <p>The target date for full secure node depreciation is Mar 11, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> was introduced and voted on in November 2023 and the community overwhelmingly voted in favor of deprecating secure nodes and repurposing the coinbase reward that secure nodes were receiving to EON forger nodes.&nbsp; However, secure nodes have not yet been fully deprecated.&nbsp; This blog post outlines the steps remaining, the timeline to full secure node deprecation, additional information on EON forger nodes and a link to instructions on setting up a forger node.</p> Details <p>This date listed above represents the date that the secure node tracking system is shut off, and that changes to both EON and Horizen are implemented (and sufficiently tested) to enable the movement of the coinbase reward from Horizen to EON, and then the subsequent distribution of the coinbase reward to forgers who have forged blocks.</p> Timeline   Jan 25, 2024 – changes to EON implemented  Feb 7, 2024 – next mainchain hardfork  Mar 10, 2024 – last secure node earning period ends  Mar 11, 2024 – last secure node payment performed, secure nodes fully deprecated  Mar 18, 2024 – first coinbase rewards deposited into Horizen EON   What are Horizen EON Forger Nodes and Why are they Important? <p></p><p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>  Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral.  Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded.  Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss of rewards if they behave maliciously.  Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power.  Sybil attack resistance: The larger the number of honest forger nodes, the harder a sybil attack becomes.  Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved.  <p>Learn more about Horizen EON Forger Nodes and why they are important by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-are-horizen-eon-forger-nodes-and-why-we-need-them/">reviewing our blog post on the subject.</a>&nbsp;</p> EON Forger Node Instructions <p>For step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run an EON forger node, please visit <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified">our GitHub repository below</a> to learn more. If you intend to run a forger node, please select ‘forger’ when executing the ‘init.sh’ script for the first time. Keep in mind that both the Mainchain node and the Sidechain node will require some time to fully synchronize the entire chains.</p>

<p>Crypto token staking is a rapidly growing multi-billion market, set for further rapid expansion as more Proof of Stake (PoS) becomes the de facto standard model for consensus among crypto networks. This also opens more opportunities for capital vs machine deployment within crypto networks. However, running staking nodes is a difficult task, akin to the challenges and expenses of running a production data center coupled with the complexity of orchestrating bleeding edge software from multiple blockchains in an environment in which security is paramount. These challenges aren’t just faced by institutional capital, but also by retail or exchanges &amp; custodians seeking to provide staking services to their customers.</p><p>That is why <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a> has built a full-stack “staking as a service” platform, allowing pools of capital to participate in PoS, through a platform that enables investors and builders to manage validators and read-write nodes on multi-cloud infrastructure in a simple, fast and secure way. Kiln allows customers to securely deploy, manage and monitor blockchain validators across several networks in a single space — while users continue to control their private keys. The company runs a SaaS model for its services, dashboard and APIs. Kiln has partnered with Ledger Live, Crypto.com and Coinbase to provide pooled staking services, allowing every ETH holder to access staking with any amount of ETH access to value creation in the digital assets ecosystem. Further, Coinbase Cloud has integrated Kiln’s On-Chain platform into its product offering allowing Coinbase Cloud to bring on-chain partial ETH staking capabilities to their clients, with limited engineering effort needed to integrate. Kiln runs validators on all major PoS blockchains, with over $3.6b of stake under management (up 4.4x y-o-y), running on a multi-cloud, multi-region infrastructure.

<p>Following the recent listing of <a href="https://www.bitmart.com/en-US?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP on BitMart</a>, Panther's CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart's community. This post provides a summary of the conversation. Firstly, let's quickly revisit the BitMart:Panther partnership.</p> BitMart:Panther partnership <p>In December 2023, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitmart-lists-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">Panther Protocol's $ZKP was listed on BitMart</a>, a leading cryptocurrency exchange serving a global user base spanning 180 countries.</p><p>This partnership with BitMart and upcoming listings on other trusted exchanges are part of Panther commitment to make <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/tokenomics?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP more accessible</a> to the wider Web3 community.&nbsp;</p> Panther's value proposition <p>Oliver Gale, Co-founder and CEO of Panther, presented his vision of how Panther Protocol solves some of the pressing pain points that act as barriers to entry to both retail- and institutional-level investors in DeFi.</p><p>Oliver asserts that, for the decentralized Web to scale and attract more users, it must first overcome several significant challenges that crypto faces. He summarized these as four key issues:</p>  Exposed investment strategies: with the rise of blockchain analytics solutions such as Nansen, institutional investors are increasingly worried about exposed investment strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fragmented liquidity: the inability to leverage liquidity across multiple chains makes it difficult for institutions to buy and sell their preferred crypto without affecting the price.  Lack of transaction security: since June 2020, MEV bots have made at least $1 billion in profit across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana chains by exploiting transaction queues.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Compliance and privacy: existing privacy-focused DeFi products lack features to comply with AML/CTF requirements amid increased regulatory scrutiny.  <p>Oliver explained how Panther's privacy-preserving infrastructure for the decentralized Web, consisting of a shielded pool, cross-chain bridges, and ZK compliance tooling, solves these issues. This means that users can send, swap, and receive shielded assets through Panther while their on-chain privacy is being protected.</p> Panther Protocol: the product suite <p>Oliver gave BitMart's audience a run down on how Zones within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs) empower users by providing a unified privacy set for all assets within a given smart contract environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther allows users to trade stablecoins, utility tokens, and NFTs within a single shielded pool, simplifying trading in a privacy-preserving environment. The innovation of Zones represents the first coherent solution to enable institutional access to DeFi, as they enable AML compliance, customization, and enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver expanded on how Panther Protocol’s rich feature set positions Panther as the go-to solution to onboard users to private DeFi in a privacy-preserving manner. Panther’s strong position is, in part, due to its integration with third-party on-chain compliance providers. This enables the protocol to authenticate users — solving for the KYC demands of regulators by offering users a unique set of credentials on completion of verification. This key innovation is that the user data is private thanks to zero-knowledge proofs generated directly within the user's browser. The credential provided allows the user to seamlessly integrate with blockchain-based DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and similar platforms.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the flexibility of its design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider. Similarly, financial institutions can benefit from flexible zero-knowledge compliance tools or fully integrate their existing AML controls.</p> The current status of Panther <p>Oliver shared that Panther is currently deploying testnet versions of Panther Protocol in 9 Stages. Multiple protocol functionalities, such as intra-shielded pool transfers, DeFi swaps, and zTrade, are being tested during these stages. Through zTrade, users can conduct OTC transactions while enjoying unprecedented data privacy-preservation. More on Panther testnet stages <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> BitMark asks: What are you looking forward to? <p>Oliver, as always, enthused about the growing interest in privacy-preserving infrastructures. He feels that, thanks to the recent paper by prominent authors such as Vitalik examining <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Dark Pools</a>, this is a clear signal that the market is ready for such solutions. As he points out, Panther is a pioneer in the space — having been building for over 2 years, and is looking forward to releasing the V1 of the protocol once testnet rollouts are complete.</p> Want to get involved? <p>If you are interested in joining our community of testers, there is still time. Panther is rewarding engaged community members with $ZKP in return for battle-testing the testnet version of the product. Learn how to <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">get started</a> as a community tester.</p> About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>This is the 28th post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in the Brave browser. This post describes work done by Sr. Research and Privacy Engineer Arthur Edelstein, and was written by Edelstein and by Privacy Engineering Lead Shivan Kaul Sahib.</p>
<p>With desktop and Android version 1.64 in a couple of months (and in today’s <a>Nightly</a> release for testing), Brave will sunset Strict fingerprinting protection mode. This does not affect Brave’s industry-leading fingerprinting protection capabilities for users. Instead, it will allow us to focus on improving privacy protections in Standard mode and avoid Web compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Brave currently offers two levels of fingerprinting protections. which make it harder for tracking companies to identify you as you browse the Web: Standard and Strict mode. Over time, however, we have observed significant disadvantages of Strict mode:</p>
 
 
<p>In order to block fingerprintable APIs, Strict mode frequently causes certain websites to function incorrectly or not at all. This website breakage means that Strict mode has limited utility for most Web users.</p>
 
 
<p>Fewer than 0.5% of Brave users are using Strict fingerprinting protection mode, based on our <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/P3A">privacy-preserving telemetry</a> data.</p>
 
 
<p>This tiny cohort of users could be more vulnerable to being fingerprinted because they stand out as a result of using Strict mode. Although we have not seen issues around this, it is a valid concern given that users who select Strict fingerprinting protection might have done so because of an elevated concern about tracking.</p>
 
 
<p>Maintaining Strict mode and debugging why some websites are broken on Brave takes our engineers’ time away from focusing on default privacy protections that can benefit all of our users.</p>
 
 
<p>These observations have led us to the conclusion that sunsetting Strict mode in Brave will actually be beneficial to our users’ privacy.</p>
<p>Brave’s Standard fingerprinting protection is already very extensive and the strongest of any major browser. Brave’s innovative <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protections">farbling</a> of a number of major fingerprintable Web APIs makes it difficult for fingerprinters to get a reliable unique ID on your browser. Going forward, we will continue to strengthen and expand Brave’s Standard fingerprinting protections so that all our users have ever-improving protection against fingerprinters, while maintaining the highest possible level of compatibility with websites.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/wallets/spherebyhorizen/">Sphere by Horizen</a> is a desktop wallet created by the Horizen ecosystem team. It features both lite and full clients, offering wallet functionality that currently supports transparent and soon-to-be deprecated, shielded transactions. Sphere allows funds to be restored using a seed phrase and supports backward and forward transfers between Horizen’s mainchain and sidechains.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Sphere was able to send two different types of transactions: transparent transactions and shielded transactions:</p>
 
 Transparent Transactions: These are similar to Bitcoin transactions. The details of the transaction, including the sender’s and receiver’s addresses and the transaction amount, are visible on the blockchain. This transparency allows anyone to view and verify transactions, contributing to the network’s auditability. 
 Shielded Transactions: In contrast, shielded transactions offer enhanced privacy. They use advanced cryptographic techniques (like zk-SNARKs) to encrypt transaction information. This means the details of the transaction, including who sent or received the funds and the amount, are hidden from public view.&nbsp; 
 
 The Need for De-shielding 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">Horizen has announced that ZEN will be discontinuing support for shielded transactions with the release of Zen v5.0.0.</a> Consequently, Sphere, Horizen’s multifunctional app, will also cease supporting these types of transactions. To ensure the accessibility of their funds, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Who needs to De-shield their ZEN? 
<p>The upcoming changes to ZEN and Sphere necessitate action from all users who possess shielded addresses. If you have any ZEN in a shielded address, it’s crucial to de-shield these funds to avoid any loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine if you need to take any action:</p>
 
 If You’re Using Lite Mode: If you’ve only used the lite mode in Sphere and never switched to full mode, you don’t need to do anything, as shielded addresses are only available in full mode. Your funds are secure and no action is required on your part. 
 If You’re Using Full Mode: In full mode, look through your wallets. If you don’t see any addresses with a small shield icon next to them, you’re all set. No action is needed. 
 
<p>For any address with a shield icon, you should move (de-shield) these funds to a transparent address (one without a shield icon). This is important to ensure your funds remain accessible and secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another check is to look at the prefix of the address. Addresses start differently depending on the network and the type, so this also helps you identify your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>On mainnet:</p>
 
 “zn” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zs” (or rarely “zr” or “zt”) for multisig address 
 
<p>On testnet:</p>
 
 “zt” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zr” for multisig address 
 
 Step-by-step Guide to De-shielding Your ZEN 
 Prerequisites 
<p>As a reminder, de-shielding to an exchange deposit address is strongly discouraged. Before you begin de-shielding your shielded addresses in Sphere, it’s important to have at least one transparent address where you can transfer your funds. If you don’t already have a transparent address (any address without a shield icon next to its name, or that is not prefixed with “zc”), you’ll need to create one. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar select one of your wallets. 
 Click on the “Add Address” button. 
 Give a name to the new address, and make sure that, if there’s any “Private” checkbox, it remains unchecked. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once you have a transparent address, you can proceed with the de-shielding process for your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>You can get your new address by hovering over the information icon and clicking on the “copy” button that appears:</p>
<p></p>
 De-shielding Process 
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to de-shielding your funds in Sphere by Horizen:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar take a look at your wallets.&nbsp; 
 Select the wallet containing a shielded address. If you have multiple wallets with shielded addresses, you’ll need to repeat this process for each one. 
 Within each wallet, follow these steps for every shielded address:
 
 Select the shielded address you want to transfer the funds out of. 
 Click on the “Send” tab. 
 Enter a regular, transparent address that you own, where you wish to receive the funds. 
 Click on the “MAX” button to transfer all the funds from the shielded address. 
 Click the “Confirm” button and wait for the transaction to complete. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once the transaction is successful, you have de-shielded your funds. Repeat this process for every shielded address in your wallets.</p>

  Today we are excited to announce a new feature that allows Brave Creators to receive on-chain contributions for their content from their fans.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today we are excited to announce a new feature that allows  <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> to receive on-chain contributions for their content from their fans. Creators can now add Ethereum and Solana addresses to their registered websites and channels, allowing their fans to send them contributions directly on chain. On-chain contributions currently support BAT on Ethereum, BAT (Wormhole) on Solana, as well as ETH and SOL.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards users will now see the option to use their Web3 wallet when sending contributions to creators who’ve set up crypto addresses for their sites or channels.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



    
    

The Web3 wallet button in the Brave Rewards contribution interface</p>
<p>The Web3 wallet button will open up a creator’s Web3 contribution page, where users can make contributions via any Web3 wallet—including <a>Brave Wallet</a>, other Web3 wallets, and even mobile wallets. Creators can also share a link to their Web3 contribution page with anyone, allowing them to receive contributions not only from Brave Rewards users, but from anyone on the Web.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



    
    

A creator’s shareable on-chain contribution page</p>
<p>Contributions made through your Web3 wallet are completely on-chain and decentralized. That means they’re uncensorable, and any contribution you make goes directly from you to the creator, without any intermediaries.</p>
<p>Direct, on-chain contributions reinforce Brave’s mission to put users first, and to provide them with more control over how they use the Web and connect with their favorite creators. It’s also a step toward progressively decentralizing the Creators, Rewards, and Ads ecosystem—a long-standing objective at Brave. Try on-chain contributions for a completely self-custody experience to support your favorite creators. If you’re a creator, <a href="https://creators.brave.com">add your Web3 addresses to your sites and channels</a> today. It’s easy and free.</p>

 Instructions for Brave Creators 
 
 Log in to your Brave Creators account at <a href="https://creators.brave.com">https://creators.brave.com</a>. If you don’t already have one, you can quickly sign up. 
 Next to your registered channel of choice, select Add crypto address. If you haven’t registered any channels, add some channels first. 
 You’re ready to start receiving Web3 crypto contributions! You can also share the URLs to your Web3 contribution pages however you like. 
 
<p>If you need help or would just like to discuss this exciting new feature, join us on the <a href="https://community.brave.com">Brave Community forums</a>.</p>
 
<p>Brave currently has over 60 million monthly active users and over 1.8 million Creators. Brave Creators can receive contributions from their audiences for their content across a wide range of platforms, including YouTube, Twitter/X, Vimeo, Github, Twitch, or their own website.</p>

<p>In the blockchain world, scalability is not just a technical issue but a crucial factor impacting user experience and the ability to build compelling applications. Traditional blockchains, while groundbreaking, have often been hampered by limited scalability, leading to congested networks, slow transaction times, and high costs. As teams have worked to solve these issues in the Ethereum ecosystem with layer 2 chains, the experience only continues to degrade with bridges, fragmented liquidity and unwieldy lists of networks users must maintain in their wallets. These issues significantly degrade the user experience, deterring widespread adoption.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://massa.net/">Massa</a>, a response to the critical scalability and user experience issues in blockchain technology. Its innovative multithreaded block graph architecture significantly boosts transaction capacity, effectively addressing the major pain points of network congestion and slow processing times. This approach not only enhances the system’s performance but, unlike the leading alternatives solving blockchain performance issues today, also upholds the essential principle of decentralization.</p><p>Massa goes beyond mere transactional efficiency and decentralization. Its autonomous smart contracts represent a leap in blockchain functionality, allowing contracts to operate independently based on predefined conditions. This reduces reliance on external triggers and opens new avenues for decentralized applications. Additionally, Massa’s on-chain web page storage marks a significant stride towards a truly decentralized web, ensuring secure, immutable, and censorship-resistant hosting of web&nbsp;content.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>We believe that Massa’s approach to scalability, without sacrificing decentralization, is pivotal for the next generation of blockchain applications. The platform’s ability to handle high transaction volumes with low fees is not just a technical success; it is a gateway to making blockchain technology accessible and practical for everyday use. Massa’s technology is not just an incremental improvement; it represents a leap forward in the blockchain space. By resolving the longstanding challenges of scalability and user experience, Massa opens the door to widespread adoption of blockchain technology.</p>

      5.0.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of 5.0.0 to Mainnet later in January 2024.  Pre-release 5.0.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1404200, on January 16th, 2024 at approximately 02:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release on Testnet:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates.  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled, so that it will be no longer possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.      Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 5.0.0 will be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pools before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br>  <p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0-rc1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0-rc1.md">Here!</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

    <p>2023 was an incredible year of growth for the Horizen ecosystem! Lots of milestones were reached including:</p>  The mainnet launch of Horizen’s first EVM-compatible sidechain, EON&nbsp;  The launch of the Horizen DAO and pivot from Zen Blockchain Foundation (ZBF)&nbsp;  Passing two major ZenIPs (42204 &amp; 42206)  Onboarding new partners and projects into the Horizen ecosystem  <p>It’s an exciting time for the Horizen ecosystem and the team has hit the ground running in 2024! We will be sharing details on our 2024 proposed roadmap but before we get there, let’s dive into what happened in 2023!</p> 2023 Highlights <p></p> Community Growth <p>Discord</p><p>In 2023, we reached over 20,000 members of our Horizen Discord, a growth of over 5,000 users throughout the year. With the launch of Horizen EON and various growth campaigns on platforms like Galxe and Layer3, we have had new community members learning about the Horizen ecosystem and exploring the new integrations. We look forward to seeing more of this growth in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Discourse</p><p>In 2023 we established the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse forum</a>, to facilitate active community discussions around the Horizen Ecosystem. In 2023, activity on this platform increased as the broader community discussed ZenIPs, shared tutorials, explored content created by the Horizen Ambassadors, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage the Horizen community to join Discourse and engage with the rest of the community on the platform!</p> 2023 Highlights – Our Technology <p>In October of 2023, Horizen EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain went live on mainnet, marking a new milestone in the Horizen multi-chain ecosystem!&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Horizen EON ecosystem has continued to grow, with additional partnerships, integrations, and tools launching on the platform. There has also been a significant influx of TVL and developer activity on Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p><p>The full range of dapps and partner integrations can be found on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">EON Ecosystem</a> page – let’s dive into a few of the major announcements. </p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-interport-finance/">Interport Finance Integration</a></p><p>At the beginning of December 2023, we announced an integration with Interport Finance, which brought cross-chain trading capabilities to Horizen EON! This integration not only boosts the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions but also signifies a step towards a broader vision of a cohesive digital finance ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate fluidly across diverse blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/archon-bridge-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">Archon Bridge</a></p><p>Archon Bridge launched on Horizen EON in Q4 of 2023, bringing a new bridging protocol to the ecosystem. This protocol facilitates the transfer of various cryptocurrencies including ETH, WBTC, WZEN, USDT, USDC, DAI, and LINK, between the Horizen EON network and the Ethereum and Avalanche networks.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-layerzero-to-boost-trustless-cross-chain-communications/">LayerZero</a></p><p>Another innovation to enhance cross-chain communications on Horizen EON saw an integration with LayerZero go live, ensuring seamless and direct communication between various blockchains via arbitrary message bridging. This integration offers enhanced interoperability, allowing data, assets, and information to be transferred across blockchains without compromising on efficiency or security. Beyond just messaging, this integration signifies a broader vision of creating a unified digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/spookyswap-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">SpookySwap</a></p><p>Another exciting announcement for Horizen EON came in November 2023, when we announced an integration with SpookySwap! This helped bolster DeFi innovation, bringing a DEX multichain integration and yield farming to EON. USDC is tradable against ZEN and wZEN, with additional pairs being enabled once sufficient liquidity develops.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-ascent-exchange-with-simple-liquidity-opportunities-via-ichi-vault-to-boost-the-defi-ecosystem-on-eon/">Ascent Exchange</a></p><p>The DeFi ecosystem on Horizen EON was boosted with the integration of Ascent Exchange, supported by the automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, enabling simple yield opportunities for EON users. This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Ascent Exchange is the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, marking a major milestone!</p><p><a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/service_providers/eon_native_stablecoin/">Stably/ZUSD</a></p><p>2023 marked the 1st native stablecoin to be launched on Horizen EON, ZUSD, which was made possible by our partnership with Stably! The collateral for ZUSD is held in liquid USD-denominated assets by a designated trustee for the benefit of verified ZUSD token holders. This ensures that each ZUSD token can be minted or redeemed at a 1-to-1 rate with USD or USDC by users who passed Stably’s KYC verification process.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/yuzu-finance-horizen-eon-unlocking-yield-opportunities-in-the-horizen-ecosystem/">Yuzu</a></p><p>Our last major partnership announcement of 2023 welcomed Yuzu Finance onto Horizen EON! This integration unlocked yield opportunities for the Horizen Ecosystem, including borrowing, lending, and yield farming (soon)! Yuzu is a non-custodial decentralized liquidity market protocol that enables users to deposit or borrow crypto assets securely. Depositors provide liquidity on Yuzu, while borrowers can take out overcollateralized or undercollateralized loans.</p> Horizen EON TVL &amp; Metrics <p>As of December 31st, 2023, Horizen EON had $3.08M in TVL (as tracked by <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Horizen%20EON">DefiLlama</a>), highlighting impressive ecosystem growth within the first few months of mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the mainnet launch of Horizen EON in October 2023, there have been over 900,000 total transactions across over 18,000 wallet addresses. There have also been 950+ contracts in total since Horizen EON went live on mainnet.</p> Launch of the Horizen DAO <p>In 2023 the Horizen ecosystem reached a key milestone in decentralized governance by launching the Horizen DAO! The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system. $ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. All $ZEN holders can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">blog post</a>, as well as joining the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse!</a></p> ZenIPs (<a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">42204</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">42206</a>) <p>Building off of the launch of the Horizen DAO, 2023 saw two very important ZEN Improvement Proposals (ZenIPs) pass with overwhelming community support.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">ZenIP 42204</a> – Deprecation of Shielded Pools  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> – Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON&nbsp;  <p>Let’s take a closer look at both.&nbsp;</p><p>ZenIP 42204</p><p>This ZEN Improvement Proposal proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, preventing shielded transaction (t addresses to z addresses) support at the consensus level. The goal of ZenIP 42204 was to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risk. Regulatory threats are top of mind, they are not friendly towards privacy coins and that drove a lot of the ambition to propose ZenIP 42204, which passed with overwhelming community support. Additional information can be found <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">here.</a></p><p>ZenIP 42206</p><p>In August of 2023, ZenIP 42206 was proposed, to redirect the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. This will help drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network. There is a strong need for forger nodes in EON to help enhance the security of the network, and for decentralization, which the current secure node reward can be put to better use by redirecting. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Horizen Node Network <p></p> Horizen Ambassador Program <p>Throughout 2023, we were very proud to see all of the work accomplished by our amazing Horizen Ambassadors. Here are some highlights we wanted to showcase:&nbsp;</p>  2 new languages added: Turkish and Hindi  More than 30 articles translated into Turkish  More than 30 articles written across the ambassadors  5 global events attended  Successful HallowEON community-led party  The launch of the $LOVE faucet on Horizen EON testnets and mainnet  An immeasurable number of tweets, threads, hours spent helping the community, and shared love!  <p>We are beyond excited to welcome new ambassadors in 2024 and see what they accomplish for the Horizen Ecosystem!</p> Events <p>Throughout 2023, the Horizen ecosystem and Horizen Labs team were able to attend lots of global events, educating folks about our ecosystem, forging new connections, and exploring innovations in the web3 space.&nbsp;</p><p>From ETHDenver to Consensus, Token2049 in Singapore to Future Blockchain Summit in Dubai, we were able to accomplish a lot with events in 2023 and looking forward to the same in 2024!</p><p>Let’s look back at some of these incredible events with some photo recaps.&nbsp;</p>

We launched EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain, which significantly helped Horizen’s journey into the contemporary Web3 world. That’s especially important because it allows Horizen Labs to leverage its relationships and bring more companies, developers, and brands directly into the Horizen ecosystem. We’ve been hard at work bringing best-in-class partners to EON, from oracles like Pyth and Band to DeFi protocols like Spooky, Yuzu, and Ascent to RPC providers such as Ankr and Tatum. We’ve built a strong relationship with LayerZero as well, which will lead to many exciting things happening within the ecosystem.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mainchain saw the introduction of forward and backward transfers, a technological feat that sometimes gets overlooked but is significant. How many UTXO-based tokens can be used on EVM chains? Beyond Bitcoin and ZEN, not many! We also saw the start of the deprecation of shielded pools and ZEN’s move away from being a privacy token.</p><p>Now, as we enter 2024 we’re gearing up for what should be the most exciting year in Horizen’s history. In the coming weeks and months, we’ll announce a slew of new partners, initiatives, and focus areas relating to the Horizen Ecosystem through a significant expansion and push on DeFi to RWA programs. We’re also working hard on expanding access to ZEN and directly to the EON ecosystem, along with making sure that EON can host a sustainable, consistently growing ecosystem as it moves forward.</p><p>And the vision of a New Horizen is on the docket too. I can’t wait to talk to you all about it and the modular future that Horizen and Horizen Labs will push forward together.”</p> Additional Links:&nbsp;   <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q1-2023-report/">Q1 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q2-2023-report/">Q2 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q3-2023-report/">Q3 2023 Report</a>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support and feedback: we could not do this without you. Testnet Stage 2 is now completed and it provided us with valuable insights resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 3 of our testnet is live. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>On depositing $ZKP, users may divide their ZKP deposit holdings to store it as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay for Protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services.</p><p>One of the key compliance requirements on the Panther roadmap is building different disclosure mechanisms. Stage 3 includes basic disclosures, which can be found under the History tab. We expect to improve the information within the History tab in future testnet stages.</p><p>This testnet stage comes with an enhanced circuit to improve KYT/KYC signer fields, overall protocol security through extended zAccount UTXO, and further improvements related to scaling and rewards. Supporting these updates required retrofitting previous stages and end-to-end testing, resulting in Stage 3 being released later than we initially planned. </p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.<br></p> Get started with Stage 3 testing <p><br>To start testing Stage 3, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated test link and follow the steps outlined below. Here are a few additional details to consider before you start testing:&nbsp;</p>  Previously created testnet accounts will need to be reactivated for Stage 3. The protocol will treat these as new accounts. To that effect, all prior testing Rewards (ZKP and ZKP equivalent of your PRPs) will be sent to your EOA (externally owned account) used for creating the account.  You can also create a brand new account and complete the KYC process to continue. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#gid=0">Here’s</a> a guide to creating your account.   After activating your zAccount, if you immediately go to the ‘Deposit’ or ‘Voucher’ etc. screen, you may see the action button with the status “Oshiya Processing/Syncing/Mining.” It may take a few minutes for the testnet to complete as it waits for Oshiya to process your account activation. The buttons will be active once that is done.  During the first interaction with the dApp, it downloads the ZK proof information in the background (close to 100MB). While this happens, you may see a status on your action button saying “ZK Proof downloading,” this needs to be completed before any user action can take place.   Onboarding rewards have been increased to 5000 PRPs to reflect that this stage retests the onboarding flow.  <p>Once you’ve created your new testnet account, follow these steps to make a deposit to your account:</p> Step 1: Initiate a deposit <p>Go to the Deposit screen by selecting any of the available options: </p>  Within the zAsset menu item, click on the Deposit button as shown in the screenshot below.  Within the My Public Asset section in the Dashboard, select the token; this takes the user to the Deposit screen.  The Private zAsset section; which also has the option to select and deposit  On zAsset Portfolio, click on the balance card.   Step 2: Select the token type <p>Select the token to deposit if it is not preselected, or adjust your selection via the token selection modal window.</p><p>NOTE: ZKP has its own dedicated deposit flow, which supports splitting a deposit amount between two zZKP subaccounts, zAsset and Gas. The Gas can be used to pay for relayer or verification services in a privacy-preserving way; with no direct interaction with a blockchain.</p> Step 3: Set up the deposit <p>3.1 Enter the amount to deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>3.2 Click the Deposit button and complete the transaction.</p><p>Congratulations, the deposit is complete!</p><p>You may now view the updated balance in your Dashboard, your Private zAssets section, and the adjusted balance of the deposited asset.</p><p>You can view your transaction history under the History tab.&nbsp;</p><p>This screen provides information about different types of transactions you performed within Panther, along with its transaction hash and the date/time of the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks a significant advancement in the protocol's capabilities and gets us a step closer to our V1 release. As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in Testnet Stage 3!&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases.

      Arvind Jain Pushes into AI-powered Productivity         
	By Zee Zakheim

Published January 10, 2024
        Glean solved enterprise search. Now it’s unlocking generative AI for the workplace.      



 
<p>Arvind Jain hunched over his desk, sifting through hundreds of employee surveys, searching for the answer to a problem. Rubrik, the cloud security company he had co-founded four years earlier in 2014, was one of the fastest-growing businesses in cloud data management. Since its launch, it had scaled from a handful of employees to almost a thousand. But a problem came to light in 2018: Productivity had stagnated. The company’s output wasn’t growing with its scale.</p>



<p>Jain pored over the results of the survey that had been commissioned, scouring for patterns. Was it talent? Not a chance. Company culture? Not according to the surveys. And then, a troubling insight: Employees reported spending hours of their time trying to find and piece together fragmented bits of information from across the 300 SaaS products Rubrik used in its internal operations—onboarding materials, meeting notes, support tickets, project archives and more. In their quest to find answers, they were stalled and sidetracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rubrik’s problem, Jain realized, wasn’t Rubrik-specific, but universal: the seemingly impossible task of wrangling digital information from every facet of an enterprise. What if there was something like Google Search, but for the workplace? Jain began researching search engines for enterprises, but none could do what he imagined. “I spoke with other CEOs to see if they had solutions I’d missed,” Jain says. “Their response was, ‘If you find something like that, let us know.’”</p>

<p>Search engines are notoriously difficult to build—they require crawlers sophisticated enough to index data in a multitude of formats in real time and algorithms smart enough to sort and rank that data with precision for any given search. What Jain was considering developing would be even more complicated, as every search would need to be personalized for every employee based on their degree of access to a company’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, this provocation became the springboard for Jain’s next startup: an AI-powered search engine for enterprises called <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a>. As it happened, Jain was the perfect person for the job.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In 2003, hundreds of employees unpacked boxes and settled into office space in Mountain View, California. Google had officially signed its new lease in the heart of Silicon Valley, taking over the former Silicon Graphics campus. While the new digs were reflective of Google’s success, the company was also at a crossroads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch in 1998, Google had gained a loyal following of users. But as the internet evolved—growing rapidly in size and shifting from rudimentary websites to include pages that were more complicated and nonstandard—Google Search wasn’t able to keep up with the velocity of new data. Meanwhile, alternative search providers were closing in, the most competitive of which was Yahoo. “Google and Yahoo were locked in a battle for the most sophisticated, comprehensive web indices,” says Bill Coughran, a Sequoia partner who was then SVP of engineering at Google.</p>



<p>Coughran gathered the web crawler team and told them they needed a new system design. It would have to be able to respond to diverse and rapidly changing data, and do it at scale. The timeline for the new system? As soon as possible.</p>



<p>Arvind Jain, a recent hire then in his late 20s, was one of the leaders of what became the new effort. Over the next few weeks, Jain and his colleagues spent days analyzing Google’s search engine. Eventually, they approached Coughran with an idea for the new design.<br>“What was interesting about their vision is that it took advantage of the basic primitives Google’s web crawler already had in place and built on top of those,” Coughran says. “The design showed a system that could index not just websites, but dozens of file types from HTML to PDF, including PowerPoint, Flash, PostScript and JavaScript. And, as the web continued to scale, it could operate more and more instances of itself and do more and more work.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”</p>
Bill Coughran</blockquote>



<p>Some senior executives, however, viewed the proposed framework with skepticism. “They looked at the design and just didn’t believe it would work,” Coughran says. But he was convinced. “My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain and his colleagues spent a year building out the system, which launched in the fall of 2004. In November of that year, Coughran published a blog post on the Google website with the headline “Google’s Index Nearly Doubles.” He says, “It could inhale hundreds of gigabytes of traffic at a given time and it could do it quickly, so when you searched something, you weren’t getting stale information. It was a difficult undertaking, but it worked. They pulled it off.”</p>
 





 
<p>The thoughtful meticulousness Coughran observed in Jain grew out of an introspective childhood in Jaipur, a tourist destination in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. “My father always encouraged me to be confident,” Jain says. “To look people in the eye and talk to them, but extroversion wasn’t something that came naturally to me.” Instead, Jain took after his mother, who exuded a quiet confidence and had an ability to defuse conflict with calm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain became fascinated with computers after his older brother introduced a PC—loaded with Pac-Man—to the family home. Jain delighted in the game, but even more so in the idea that coding had real-world applications, for video games or otherwise. Jain decided to pursue computer science in earnest, placing into an advanced high school track and then gaining admission to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. After graduating, Jain set his sights on the U.S. Following a stint at Microsoft, the allure of Silicon Valley beckoned, and Jain cut his teeth in the startup world at Akamai and Riverbed before joining Google.</p>



 



<p>“I’m not an entrepreneur,” Jain said. It was 2013 and he sat across from Bipul Sinha, an engineer who had an idea for a cloud security company and wanted Jain as its technical co-founder. Jain was taken aback. “I was like, ‘Of all your contacts, why me?’” he says. Sinha explained that, more than anyone else, he believed in Jain to build a product from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the years since arriving at Google and working on Google Search, Jain had left his mark on a series of other projects. He had helped engineer YouTube’s video serving system—which pulled up videos related to a user’s search, but also recommended content based on their browsing history. Jain had also worked on the search functions for Google Maps, which were more technically ambitious by far than Google Search and YouTube. “Maps’ data is the most chaotic,” Coughran says. “You’re dealing with ever-changing, wildly inconsistent data, coming from many disparate sources—public records, land developers, people taking photos, enterprises submitting information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, Maps was rewarding, not just because it challenged him as an engineer, but because of the app’s real-life, societal impact. “Maps changed the way people understood and navigated the world around them,” Jain says. He loved seeing couples on the street pull up Maps to direct them to a restaurant, or a family open the app to walk to a relative’s house. The Maps team was also deep in the weeds documenting places that weren’t previously mapped, including small towns in rural areas of India. “Making these places accessible and seeing the impact of that was just amazing,” Jain says. “It was very meaningful to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain’s contentment with his work at Google was one reason he wasn’t sure about founding a company with Sinha. The other reason was philosophical. “I always thought that people became entrepreneurs when they encountered a problem that nagged at them and that nobody else wanted to solve or knew how to solve, but them,” Jain says.</p>



<p>Despite these reservations, Sinha was convincing—he would build the business while Jain built the product. He won Jain over, and in 2014, they launched Rubrik. Four years later, Jain would encounter a problem that nagged him. One that nobody else wanted or knew how to solve, but him.</p>

<p>Sitting at his desk in the Rubrik headquarters in 2018, reviewing his employees’ notes on the challenges of finding information within the company, Jain thought to himself, “Data should not be the reason why you fail. It should be the reason you succeed.”</p>



<p>Jain convinced co-founders T.R. Vishwanath, Piyush Prahladka and Tony Gentilcore to tackle the project with him. They built Glean, which officially launched in 2019, to solve what Jain believes to be the most urgent problem in today’s workplace: that it’s often easier to find answers in the vast expanse of the internet than it is within a single organization. “Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally,” Jain says. “Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally. Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”&nbsp;</p>
arvind jain</blockquote>



<p>Even with Google Search, YouTube and Maps’ search engines under his belt, Jain knew building Glean wouldn’t be easy. The difficulty of creating a search engine for an enterprise is that, unlike the information in a general-purpose internet search engine, “company data doesn’t live in readily organized forms,” Jain says. “Information can be fleetingly exchanged over one communication suite, like Slack or Google Chat, but not formalized in another. And it’s not just that data is spread across a range of SaaS tools—each individual has their own level of access to those systems. The CEO has access to different data than someone in research and development who has access to different data than someone in human resources.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain assembled a team of engineers to help him bring Glean to life, many who had worked with him at Google, others who were familiar with his reputation as one of the best search engineers in Silicon Valley. The company described its initial product, launched in 2021, as a “work assistant with intuition,” modeled on a Google-like search engine. It worked by transforming the entirety of a company’s data, in all its various forms, into nodes on a knowledge graph. And it was able to do this in under two hours, meaning it was Google-fast and required minimal onboarding time. Glean then used state-of-the-art natural language processing and deep learning to deliver individualized search results. “AI was always core to our product,” Jain says. “But in the last year, the shift in the capabilities of AI models—it’s changed everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spring of 2023, Glean announced it was incorporating generative AI into its product. “If Glean’s user interface started out with a feel similar to Google Search, now it’s more like Google plus ChatGPT,” Jain says. “Glean is no longer just surfacing information, it’s taking that information, consuming it and then performing a task. For example, if an employee were to ask Glean to provide a list of the company’s top 10 customers who are likely to churn, our engine can actually go and hunt through information in your enterprise corpus, figure out what makes it likely for a customer to churn, go to your metrics dashboard, look at whether those metrics are looking bad for certain businesses and actually give that answer back to you.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”</p>
Sonya Huang</blockquote>



<p>The integration of enterprise search capabilities with generative AI has become Glean’s superpower. “CIOs and knowledge workers have been waiting for an enterprise AI product that is workplace-knowledge-aware,” says Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia who serves on Glean’s board. “Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, the challenge of Glean wasn’t only in developing its product, but in growing into the role of CEO and leading an entire company. Jain rose to the occasion by drawing on the traits of his parents: his father’s confidence and practice of reaching out to others, and his mother’s approach to conflict, which prioritizes listening and never saying “I told you so.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Glean serves over 200 enterprises, some with hundreds of employees, others with hundreds of thousands, saving them hundreds of hours of work per month and millions of dollars per year. “Similar to how Google Maps changed our navigation of the world, soon, Glean will alter the way we work, period,” Jain says. He envisions that one day, every employee who uses Glean will have a “work double,” essentially a digital assistant who can perform tasks and track every project, every communication and every piece of company knowledge. It’s a world in which employees aren’t impeded by the challenges of locating information, but empowered by data to tackle their next challenge—maybe even the thing that won’t stop nagging them.</p>

<p>Today, Brave Search added its newly built CodeLLM to its search engine. CodeLLM is aimed at queries that involve programming, and combines the depth and quality of search results with the summarization and explainability power of large language models (LLMs). CodeLLM offers programmers an option to get AI code snippets grounded in search results, with step-by-step explanations and citations of the sources for reference and validation. CodeLLM is free and is integrated in Brave Search so users do not have to switch apps or compromise on privacy.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>Figure 1: Query “kill all processes listening to port 80”</p>
<p>CodeLLM&nbsp; is available to all Brave Search users, on desktop and mobile. To access it, head to privacy-preserving Brave Search and try it out with your favorite programming query:</p>
 
 If Brave Search is your default search engine, simply start a search in your browser’s address bar 
 If Brave Search isn’t your default, visit <a href="https://search.brave.com/">search.brave.com</a> and start your search that way 
 
<p>CodeLLM automatically detects programming-related queries, so there’s no need to generate a special search. On top of the search results, if an answer is possible there will be a widget to trigger the CodeLLM response. The detection of programming queries happens outside of the LLM, by other search components (similar to the ones able to detect queries about the weather, queries that lend themselves well to be summarized, queries about stock prices, etc).</p>

 How we built CodeLLM 
<p>The underlying technology is built on top of <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral</a>, a large language model that can use text prompts to generate code, and it is further equipped to answer questions by tapping into our unique capabilities as a search engine, in real-time. As the models get more accessible, and more affordable to run, the value-add is the context we’re able to provide to them. This highlights how vertical search engines can be easily replicated, and also emphasizes how important it is to be independent and to own the whole stack, like Brave Search.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>Figure 2: query “install fzf mac”</p>
<p>We are excited to release CodeLLM in Brave Search, and are already considering a number of improvements and additions to its capabilities. CodeLLM results will also be offered via the Brave Search API in the near future.  See something you like? Wish it could do more? Tell us! Simply click the Feedback button at the bottom of the CodeLLM window to share feedback.</p>

 About Brave Search 
<p>Brave Search is the only independent, global-scale search engine outside Big Tech. It’s the default search engine for many of the Brave browser’s over 60 million users, and is available on any browser at search.brave.com. Since its launch two years ago, Brave Search has grown to serve an average of 25 million queries per day.</p>
<p>Rather than adding layers on top of third party APIs and services, Brave Search is truly innovating in the search space. From <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/goggles">Goggles</a> (which allows community-driven alternative rankings) to <a>AI summarizer</a> (which offers AI-powered answers at the top of SERP, similar to the <a>Leo</a> experience in the browser), and more, Brave offers novel ways to search the Web and engage with its content. All this while maintaining Brave’s user-first promise: Brave Search does not track users, their queries, or their clicks.</p>
<p>The power of Brave Search is also now available to businesses. <a>Brave Search Ads</a> allow advertisers to reach Brave’s global audience in a way that still respects their privacy.</p>
<p>Its index, meanwhile, is powered not just by simple crawlers, but also by the <a>Web Discovery Project (WDP)</a>. This mechanism allows users to anonymously contribute data about searches and page visits, thus ensuring the index is constantly refreshed with the content real humans are searching for and engaging with. The index comprises more than 20 billion quality pages, with 700 million pages indexed each day, 15% of which are new. This index is now available to power other search and AI applications, train models, and more with the <a>Brave Search API</a>.</p>

 Brave Rewards 
<p>Brave Rewards allows users to earn Basic Attention Tokens (<a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">BAT</a>) for privacy-preserving ads—called Brave Ads—they choose to see in the Brave browser. Users can control how many ads they see, and easily support their favorite content creators with on-demand and automatic contributions using their BAT. Users’ browsing data remains private and never leaves their device. Users can also use earned BAT to buy gift cards, exchange for other currencies, and more.</p>

 Privacy Pass 
<p>Brave Rewards currently uses a privacy-preserving protocol called “Privacy Pass” as a key&nbsp; component of its system, enabling users to earn rewards in a privacy-respecting way. For example, when users engage with Brave Ads or perform certain actions (such as viewing an ad or clicking on one), Privacy Pass generates cryptographic tokens (not to be confused with BATs) to validate these interactions without revealing specific details about the user’s identity or browsing habits.</p>
<p>These cryptographic tokens act as a form of proof that the user has completed the required actions, allowing them to earn Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) through Brave Rewards. By incorporating Privacy Pass, Brave Rewards ensures that users can participate in earning rewards without sacrificing their privacy, maintaining a balance between user anonymity and the verification of legitimate interactions.</p>

 Boomerang 
<p>Privacy Pass, while effective in preserving user privacy in systems like Brave Rewards, operates in a centralized manner, lacking the decentralized properties commonly sought in blockchain-based solutions.</p>
<p>Developed by the Brave Research team, the Boomerang protocol is a novel, decentralized, and privacy-preserving incentive protocol that leverages Black Box Accumulators and Zero-Knowledge Proofs to securely store user interactions. By utilizing this protocol, Brave can replace its current rewards system, based on Privacy Pass, with a more secure and decentralized alternative.</p>
<p>The Boomerang protocol simultaneously ensures privacy and verifiability by utilizing Zero-Knowledge Proofs based on Bulletproofs, and verifying the proofs in a smart contract on a Layer 1 blockchain. This approach allows users to prove their eligibility for rewards without revealing any sensitive information about the reward calculation (for example, about which specific advertisements the user interacted with), while still maintaining transparency and public verifiability. The protocol also employs Black Box Accumulators to securely store user interactions with Brave Ads, further enhancing privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boomerang leverages Bulletproof zero-knowledge proofs as its fundamental mechanism, ensuring privacy while enabling verifiable reward generation. These zero-knowledge proofs are verified on a Layer 1 blockchain, ensuring public verifiability and transparency in the reward generation process. Figure 1 below shows the interaction between an user, the issuer (Brave) and a L1 blockchain that verifies the rewards proofs that are generated by the user.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What began as an AI company trying to seek solutions in order to pay remote (unbanked) workers, Near AI became, in 2018, Near Protocol. Its sharded design was inspired by modern database architecture and large language model (LLM) training. Near Protocol aimed to solve the scalability trilemma, through a modular approach, combining data availability sharding with stateless validation. By abstracting away archaic blockchain standards, Near basically enabled decentralised full stack development and, in terms of UX, a distributed custodial solution via chain abstraction and account aggregation.</p><p>We were joined by Illia Poloshukhin, co-founder of Near Protocol, to discuss Near’s journey, from AI company to high-throughput L1 blockchain, and how LLM training influenced the modular design choice.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Illia’s background in AI &amp; ML  Scaling large language models (LLMs) and the role of attention  Stochastic Parrot vs. Understanding spectrum  From Near AI to Near Protocol and the role of LLMs  How Near abstracted the blockchain away and enabled decentralised full stack development  Defining ecosystem standards to improve UX  Chain abstraction, account aggregation and interoperability  Chain threshold signature  Near’s intent layer  Near’s modularity, Nightshade sharding &amp; stateless validation  EigenLayer integration  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon">Illia Polosukhin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol">Near Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

    <p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">ZenIP 42207 </a>for the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain was submitted on January 4th, 2024, opened for Community voting on January 8th, with voting closing on January 11th, resulting in 99.97% vote share “for”. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ZenIP proposed the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP-42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Complete Disabling of Shielded Transactions: All functionalities related to the shielded transactions (z-addresses) will be completely deactivated, preventing any type of transaction related to the shielded pool. 
 Removal of Related RPC Calls: RPC calls specifically related to shielded transactions, such as z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress, will be deprecated. 
 Migration Path for Users: A migration path with the necessary tools and guides will be provided to users to move their assets out of the shielded pool before the hard fork. Community support and detailed documentation will be available to facilitate this transition. 
 Network Upgrade: The deactivation of the shielded pool will occur through a network upgrade at a specified block height (TBD). Extensive testing, community preparation, and communication will precede this upgrade. 
 Communication and Timeline:&nbsp;Representatives of the Horizen ecosystem will communicate regularly with the community about the timeline, necessary user actions, and available support resources throughout the transition process. 
 
<p>IMPORTANT: ZEN 5.0.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible to send any shielded transactions, including transactions to de-shield coins from shielded to transparent addresses.</p>
<p>ZenIP 42207 goes further than the hard fork originally announced with ZEN 4.2.0-rc1, ZEN 5.0.0 will completely remove the shielded pool. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. &nbsp;Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged. Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>
 Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, we encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> around ZenIP 42207 and voice your thoughts. We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">full ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42207 started on January 8th, 2024, 5pm UTC and ended on January 11th, 2024, 5pm UTC. The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was also taken. <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">You can view the results of the vote here on Snapshot.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP 42207</a> voting period ended on January 11th, 2024, at 5pm UTC, and passed with 99.97% of votes “for”, with .03% of votes “against.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to thank the community for their engagement on this new ZenIP. The voting participation marks a new step in the progress of the Horizen DAO and we are glad to see that our community is involved in the project’s decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successfully passed ZenIP 42207 enables the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by ZenIP 42204 and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step is to unshield your ZEN on private addresses. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>

Published January 3, 2024
        2023 was a frenzied year in AI. 2024 will be a year of exploration and discovery.      



 
<p>Over the Christmas holiday, I had time to reflect on 2023 and the whirlwind year we had in AI. </p>



<p>The “Big Bang” of ChatGPT in late 2022 unleashed a fervor and, ultimately, a feeding frenzy in 2023. Not only was AI the #1 story in Silicon Valley, but it became a hot topic in every corporate boardroom, in the media and even in Washington, DC. AI drove public market stock performance too.</p>



<p>For a technology so nascent and still with low usage, as we covered in <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/">Generative AI’s Act Two</a>, the feeding frenzy of 2023 had a key weakness. It was an assumption that the hard problems in AI had been solved, and therefore it’s a foregone conclusion that AI will become ubiquitous and powerful.</p>



<p>This fallacy is understandable. It is human nature to avoid ambiguity because humans desire certainty. The idea that AI is the “end of history”—and that we’re within sight of that—appeals to this instinct. This is an easier idea to hold in our minds than the reality we are living in: We are in the primordial soup phase of AI. There is much potential in the air, and yet it is still amorphous. Vision is required to convert it into something real, tangible and, ultimately, impactful.</p>



<p>In Silicon Valley, the frenzy of 2023 was productive in attracting talent to AI. But it was also unproductive in the type of company formation it drove and the psychology it induced. Specifically, it led to implementation-oriented thinking vs. vision-oriented thinking. If you believe that the hard problems have already been solved, it changes the nature of the company that you build. Instead of building deep-benched teams that are eager to face down new, unsolved problems, you build shallower organizations.</p>



<p>As a result, you had themes in AI with five or six new companies being formed, each with one or two great technologists and a very similar objective. One of the biggest challenges for startups in 2023 was convincing talent to join their companies—everyone wanted to start an AI company of their own.</p>



<p>In 2024, we need to look farther out and build companies that are fundamentally architected for the murky reality of AI. When we realize that we are in the primordial soup phase, we begin to think not about how we can win the race, but about how we can invent new things. And we realize that we need to join forces to do that. By focusing on impact, we can assemble teams capable of taking on demanding challenges and surmounting them.</p>



<p>I want to draw an explicit contrast to SaaS. SaaS was an evolution from on-premise, license-based software to cloud. AI is a revolution, where we are building new intelligence for the first time. There is no precedent, so we don’t even know what problems are worth solving. Fundamental innovation is going to be exceptionally important.</p>



<p>The primordial soup phase will give rise to visionary founders. I believe we will see more visionary thinking emerge in 2024. In times of murkiness and uncertainty, vision is required to see through the fog and understand what needs to exist on the other side. Vision is also necessary to attract a team capable of getting there.</p>



<p>We are going to move away from “AI for X” toward customer-centric companies. The goal of solving deep societal problems by building hard technology will reshape the culture of these companies, how they are built and the type of talent they attract. We will see innovation in the company formation process itself—the AI research labs are one expression of that creativity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, we will build from the substrate of Transformers, GPUs, RAG, Diffusers, open source and everything else that has been floating around the ecosystem in 2023. From these primitives, we will discover new ideas and new insights about how to build advanced AI systems. We will look back at 2024 and say, this is the year that we began to convert AI’s potential into real solutions.</p>



<p>At a conference in September, I heard Jakub Uszkoreit, one of the inventors of the Transformer, say he thought we had prematurely jumped from the exploration phase of AI to exploitation. 2024 will be a reset year, where those focused on quick and easy exploitation of this technology lose steam, and founders who are driving deep exploration toward value creation will pull ahead.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of turning this primordial soup into impactful products and companies. And here’s to the daring founders who will build them.</p>



<p>If you are building a visionary company in this primordial soup, I’d love to hear from you. Please reach out at <a href="mailto:dcahn@sequoiacap.com">dcahn@sequoiacap.com</a></p>

   In December, we opened a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment […]

<p>In December, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment on the question of whether the Dev Fund should be replaced after it expires in late 2024.</p>



<p>The poll closed this morning and the results are in. </p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The results of the ZCG election are as follows: </p>



 
 Jason McGee – 111 votes 



 Michael Harms – 96 votes 



 Amber O’Hearn – 89 votes 



 Roosevelt Gordones – 69 votes 



 Kworks – 45 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>Congratulations to Jason, Michael and Amber, who are duly reappointed to the ZCG Committee. Thank you also to Roosevelt and Kworks for volunteering to serve the Zcash community. </p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>The poll respondents voted in favour of amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, with 99 votes in favour versus 39 against. </p>



<p>We will therefore draft an appropriate amendment to ZIP 1014. </p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we put the following question to ZCAP: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>111 respondents voted Yes, and 27 respondents voted No. </p>



<p>We look forward to seeing further discussion and proposals from the community in the coming weeks about what form a new funding mechanism might take. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Through techniques like ZK rollups, multiple transactions are bundled into a single proof, streamlining the verification process. This compact form of verification reduces computational requirements and enhances the network’s overall scalability. By processing larger volumes of transactions more efficiently, zero-knowledge proofs boost blockchain network throughput without compromising security or decentralisation. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic tools that work like magic tricks, allowing one party to prove they know something without revealing the actual details. They maintain confidentiality while confirming specific information and have a key role in web3. This article will explain what they are, how they work, their use cases in web3, and take a deep dive into how zero-knowledge proofs improve blockchain scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 What are zero-knowledge proofs? 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs, often referred to as ZKPs, are a clever way to prove something without revealing any details about it. Imagine being able to show you know a secret password without actually saying what the password is. That’s the magic of ZKPs – they allow one party to confirm they have certain information without giving away the information itself.</p>



<p>In every zero-knowledge proof, there’s a prover and a verifier. The prover wants to show the verifier that they know something without disclosing what it is. They do this by demonstrating knowledge of some facts that only the rightful owner of the information would know. It’s like solving a puzzle without showing the solution.</p>



<p>They can be used for a variety of purposes. Still, their main applications include improving data security, scalability, and privacy in blockchain transactions, safeguarding sensitive information in industries like healthcare and finance, and enabling secure authentication without unnecessary exposure of personal details.</p>



<p></p>



 How zero-knowledge proofs work (in simple terms) 



<p>While relatively simple at the surface, understanding the intricacies of zero-knowledge proofs can be complex. To explain how they work we will use a simple analogy:</p>



<p>A scientist claims to have discovered a complex mathematical proof for a groundbreaking theory. Verifying this proof conventionally requires extensive computational resources and time. Alternatively, using a zero-knowledge proof, the scientist can demonstrate the proof’s validity without divulging the entire process, significantly reducing the time needed for verification while ensuring the credibility of the discovery.</p>



<p>In essence, the zero-knowledge proof is a distilled version of the proof containing only the details necessary to prove its validity. When using zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain for improved scalability and privacy it works in similar ways. To explain how this works, consider the following scenario:<br><br>A validator has verified and put together a block of transactions that produces a certain hash value. To verify this hash (and thus the transactions inside the block), someone could verify this hash by following the exact same energy- and time-consuming process of recreating this block. However, another option would be for the validator to provide a succinct zero-knowledge proof to make it easy to verify the validity of this block without revealing the details. This proof is called a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument, widely known as a ZK-SNARK.</p>



<p>Similar to the mathematical proof example, the validity of a statement can be verified quickly without revealing the underlying details of the statement.</p>



<p></p>



 Use cases of zero-knowledge proofs in Web3 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs have a variety of use cases within the web3 space, with some of the main ones being:</p>



 
 Enhancing privacy 



 Improving scalability 



 Enabling regulatory compliance 



 Secure authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s look at each of these in more detail and how methods using zero-knowledge proofs differ from traditional methods.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy within web3 by concealing transaction details, such as sender addresses, transaction amounts, and contract terms. Unlike traditional blockchain transactions that are transparent and visible to all, zero-knowledge proofs enable confidential transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This heightened level of confidentiality ensures that sensitive data remains protected within decentralised systems. Moreover, zero-knowledge proofs facilitate private interactions, allowing users to engage in transactions and collaborations while maintaining their privacy. This advantage is particularly beneficial in business environments where discretion and confidentiality are paramount.</p>



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs surpass traditional methods by offering a higher level of confidentiality. By concealing transaction details and protecting sensitive data within decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs address concerns related to data breaches and unauthorised access. Additionally, their ability to enable private interactions ensures that users can engage securely in web3 environments without compromising their privacy. Another thing that sets them apart from existing privacy solutions is their ability to offer increased privacy with similar levels of security as their non-private counterparts.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for greater scalability 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are increasingly used in layer 2 scaling solutions as well as modern blockchain protocols for their ability to improve blockchain scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They achieve this by optimising data processing and reducing blockchain congestion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to traditional methods, zero-knowledge proofs offer an optimised approach to data processing, reducing computational overhead and enhancing efficiency. This streamlined verification process improves scalability by enabling the processing of larger transaction volumes without congesting the blockchain network.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for better regulatory compliance 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can be useful in ensuring compliance with data regulations. They provide a more secure way to handle user data while keeping it private. By hiding sensitive bits, zero-knowledge proofs balance showing what’s needed and keeping things secret. This helps decentralised systems follow the rules without giving away personal details. They check data without revealing everything, keeping user info safe from breaches and hacks which happen regularly.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, zero-knowledge proofs are a clever way to aid in sticking to complex privacy rules while still being open. They make sure user data stays safe in decentralised systems, meeting rules and keeping trust and privacy intact in the web3 world.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for secure authentication 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs offer a secure method for verifying identities or approving actions without revealing unnecessary personal information. They function by allowing individuals to prove specific credentials without disclosing the exact details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In scenarios where secure interactions are vital, like proving age without revealing the birthdate or approving a transaction without disclosing account specifics, zero-knowledge proofs enable individuals to authenticate themselves or authorise actions while keeping sensitive information private. Amid B2B collaborations, where confidentiality is paramount, zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure interactions by permitting verifications without unnecessary exposure of private details, establishing trust without compromising confidentiality.</p>



<p>Overall, they serve as a discreet way for parties to validate identities or approve transactions securely. They enable necessary verifications while protecting sensitive information, and ensuring trusted and confidential interactions, particularly vital in B2B environments where secure collaborations rely on maintaining confidentiality.</p>



<p></p>



 Deep dive: Blockchain scalability with ZK Rollups 



<p>Let’s take a deeper dive into one of the most prominent applications of zero-knowledge proofs in web3. Scalability is a challenge as old as blockchain, and with an ever-increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is also a constant need for increased scalability. ZK Rollups emerged as a potential solution for this challenge.</p>



<p></p>



 How ZK Rollups work 



<p>ZK Rollups function by grouping multiple user transactions off-chain and then submitting these bundled transactions as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Alongside this batched transaction, a succinct proof, derived from zero-knowledge proofs, is added to validate the correctness of these bundled transactions. To be specific, a ZK rollup follows these steps:</p>



 
 Transaction bundling: Initially, numerous individual user transactions occur off-chain, which are grouped or bundled together into a single package. 
 



 
 On-chain submission: This bundled package is then submitted as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Rather than posting each transaction separately on the main chain, ZK Rollups compress these transactions into a single entry. 
 



 
 Accompanying zero-knowledge proof: Alongside this single transaction, a concise proof is included. This proof is derived using zero-knowledge techniques, ensuring that it confirms the validity of all the transactions within the bundle without disclosing the specific details of each individual transaction. 
 



 
 Verification process: On the main chain, validators or smart contracts verify this bundled transaction using the accompanying proof. The proof allows for a swift verification process without unravelling the details of each transaction within the bundle. 
 



 
 Final confirmation: Once verified, the bundled transactions are confirmed on the main chain. The main chain acknowledges the validity of these transactions, thereby updating the blockchain’s state. 
 



<p>This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain. At the same time, it maintains the ability to verify the accuracy and integrity of these transactions. It optimises blockchain scalability by condensing multiple transactions into a single entry and facilitating a more efficient verification process using the accompanying zero-knowledge proof.</p>







<p>To make this even more clear, the above image visualises these steps.</p>



<p></p>



 The benefits of ZK Rollups 



<p>The efficiency of ZK Rollups lies in their ability to maintain security guarantees of the underlying blockchain while vastly improving its scalability. Users benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction finality, making ZK Rollups a promising avenue for scaling Ethereum and other blockchain networks. This technique optimises the blockchain’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions, paving the way for broader adoption and enhanced usability of dApps.</p>



<p>As the development and adoption of ZK Rollups continue to evolve, ongoing research and advancements aim to further enhance their efficiency and usability. The synergy between ZK Rollups and zero-knowledge proofs showcases a promising path towards resolving scalability issues faced by blockchain networks. It offers a scalable solution without compromising the foundational principles of security and decentralisation.</p>



<p>In summary, ZK Rollups represent a significant leap forward in addressing the scalability concerns of blockchain networks. By leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs, they pave the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem, laying the groundwork for a future where decentralised applications can operate at scale without compromising on security.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are complex mathematical proofs that effectively allow parties to prove information without divulging the details. They can be used in web3 to improve scalability, increase privacy, boost compliance, and allow for better authentication. They are the cornerstone to the future of web3 and will be central in existing and future web3 use cases.</p>

Manwendra brings diversified experience across industries, including as the first marketer for blockchain analytics firm, <a href="https://www.merklescience.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Merkle Science</a>. Before moving to Web3, Manwendra was a marketer at leading cybersecurity firm, <a href="https://www.radware.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Radware</a>(NASDAQ: RDWR).&nbsp;</p><p>Panther plans to further expand its marketing team with two more hires in the coming weeks.</p> R&amp;D Updates  Product Updates <p>In 2023, we made significant product development progress. We started the year with a workshop in Dubai (UAE) to evaluate our progress, examine the market fit of our product, compliance requirements, and institutional perspectives.</p><p>The workshop's goal was to strategically position Panther and our suite of products to align with the anticipated growth and adoption of the DeFi. After the conclusion of the workshop, we recognized that privacy as a feature couldn’t be a differentiator if we can’t enable practical applications of it. And, to achieve this for a DeFi protocol, compliance support is essential. We noted that privacy and compliance should coexist, but it requires more effort and innovation, particularly in leveraging zero-knowledge technology. Additionally, we aimed to enhance the efficiency of our protocol without overwhelming the user experience with an excess of Zero-Knowledge proofs.</p><p>As a result, we revamped our Product Architecture to align with industry needs, incorporating several outcomes from the workshop:&nbsp;</p>  Integrate with third-party compliance providers that can satisfy the new Panther design requirements.  Create a bank account-like on-chain identity ( zAccount) which acts as a link for all transactions users perform. zAccount is further crucial for compliance as it is activated only after a successful KYC completion.&nbsp;  Data Safe mechanism to satisfy AML requirements.&nbsp;  Introduce Zones to allow institutions to become licensed Zone Managers and run a dedicated zone to enable their customers to trade with whitelisted assets and counterparties.&nbsp;  Oshiya (referred to as Panther Miner) for off-chain zero-knowledge proof computation and to reduce the update on every transaction by batching 64 transactions into one. A concept that lets users put their transactions on a “bus queue”.  DeFi adaptors logic to align with the new architecture.  Support interchain communication, scheduled for V2.  <p>After 4-6 months of development, including smart contract development, circuit development, and integrations with PureFi, we began deploying features on the Mumbai test network. This process involved continuous and iterative development of the dApp. We further devised an incentivized testnet plan, organizing the testnet releases into 8 stages.</p><p>Initially, we estimated three weeks of dApp development. However, we encountered internal bugs and external issues during the testing phase, doubling the anticipated duration.</p> Testnet Updates <p>The testnet currently has 400 users and we’ve distributed a total of over 200,000 $ZKP as rewards. The proposed total amount of Testnet rewards is 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover any additional rewards, if necessary.</p><p>Have you signed up for our testnet yet?<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTB8MP6VMtJ2VMERcwLokZ3LLSHZdKn3j32QqLN1FMFRN/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Sign up here</a> to join our community and receive your $ZKP rewards.Here’s a quick recap of our testnet stages.</p><p>Testnet Stage 0</p><p>In July this year, we launched Panther Stage 0. In this Stage, we released the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network. This testing stage (and activity in production) is directed towards miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem, as opposed to DeFi users. Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 1</p><p>After a successful Stage 0, in August this year, we released Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. In this Stage, testnet users were allowed to test two of Panther’s most anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts. Learn more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 2</p><p>In November, we released the second stage of our testnet. This second phase was designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. More information on Stage 2 <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3 development is complete, and internal testing has begun. This third phase will allow users to whitelist test Matic in addition to test ZKPs into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>Further, when it comes to $ZKP, users can now deposit and store $ZKP either as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as a zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). At the time of deposit, testnet users will have the flexibility to divide their ZKP deposit amount between the two. The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services beyond the core.</p><p>Stage 3 is undergoing internal testing at the time of publishing this year-end update and will be released immediately after the tests are completed.</p> V1 Launch Updates <p>We've been working to streamline our development process, make integration testing more efficient, and possibly work on two testnet stages parallelly to ensure we meet the deadline for the V1 release.</p><p>Audits</p><p>The suggested plan is to undergo two sets of audits before the mainnet launch. A pre-audit will be done in January and then a final audit will be done once all stages are released, tested and bugs are resolved. </p><p>V1 Launch and expansion to multiple chains</p><p>V1 is expected to be live after the second Audit. After the successful launch of V1, the plan is to extend V1 to different EVM chains, subject to community voting and approval.&nbsp;</p> Research Initiatives <p>In 2023, we published two research papers in the International Association for Cryptologic Research: (1) A flexible Snark via the monomial basis, and (2) An optimization of the addition gate count in Plonkish circuits.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1255?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">first paper</a> presents a new pairing-based Snark. The principle advantage of which is, in contrast to other Snarks such as Groth16 and Plonk, it allows freedom in the choice of an elliptic curve with the consequential benefit of supporting non-native field arithmetic (a considerable bottle-neck for other Snarks). This research was also presented at the ETH Privacy Conference in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1264?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">second paper</a> proposes a generalization of Plonk’s permutation argument to obtain a protocol on weighted sums which has the benefit of eliminating intermediate gates from high fan-in additions in circuits with Plonkish arithmetization.</p><p>Other research work includes a survey paper (to be completed soon) that focuses on different approaches to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) clients via snarks.&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that strive to meet regulatory standards and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

      4.2.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of ZEN 4.2.0 to Mainnet later next January 2024.  Pre-release 4.2.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1396500, on January 3rd, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 4.2.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible anymore to unshield funds from private addresses to normal transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen. Unshielding will still be possible to P2SH (multisignature) addresses, but the process to do so will be more involved.  Because of this, we recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses in Sphere by Horizen before February 2024. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.    <p>Main Features (from 4.1.1 to 4.2.0-rc1):&nbsp;</p>Shielded Pool Deprecation:<br>Unshielding RestrictionsPR <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/624">#624</a> is a follow-up in the gradual path of shielded pool deprecation, it introduces a hard fork requiring the unshielding of private funds to target only script addresses. After the hard fork, unshielding to P2PKH addresses or to P2PK addresses will not be allowed. For this reason, the following RPC commands have been (partially) deprecated: z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress (check inline documentation for additional details).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until December 31st. The purpose of this poll is threefold:&nbsp;</p>



 
 to fill three seats on the Zcash Community Grants committee,&nbsp; 



 to solicit feedback from the community on a proposal to pay a stipend to ZCG committee members, and&nbsp; 



 to assess community sentiment on the question of whether a new funding mechanism should be introduced to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year. Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcash-community-grants-committee-december-2023/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Five candidates are standing for three seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/kworks-for-zcg-december-2023/46168">Kworks</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Last Thursday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KbIM4yNRxts?si=NhncKMnXzd1j4oDq">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your Spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!&nbsp;</p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>Since its inception, the Zcash Foundation has provided a stipend to members of the Zcash Community Grants committee. Last month, we shared the news that this stipend would be reduced from its current level of $1,725 USD to $650 USD (paid in ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several community members have expressed concerns that this reduction may have a detrimental impact on the Zcash Community Grants program. ZCG committee member GGuy has proposed that the stipend be maintained at its current level by funding it from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, we are putting the following question to ZCAP: Do you support amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forum discussion of this proposal can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">h</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">e</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">re</a>.</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves this proposal, we will draft an amendment to <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> to permit for a stipend to be paid from the Major Grants slice, with the hourly rate and cap to be set or changed by ZCAP poll. Note that the text of the amendment will be finalized by the Zcash Foundation after the results of the ZCAP poll are known, and following consultation with legal counsel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves the stipend, it is expected that any time for which ZCG Committee members claim the stipend would be in furtherance of the stated purpose of the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and the ZCG Committee, as set forth in ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If approved, the stipend will be subject to the same policies that govern similar payments by ZF, and may be subject to veto if the Foundation judges them to violate U.S. law or the ZF’s reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regulations.</p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>Earlier this year, members of the Zcash community began discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. In October, we published a <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-future-of-zcash-ecosystem-development-funding/">blog post</a> explaining how the Zcash Foundation will support the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During discussions on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dev-fund-2024-community-poll-discussion-megathread/44527">Zcash Community Forum</a> and community-organized <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaKbrNVmmVKX">Twitter Space discussions</a>, some strong opinions have been expressed both for and against the concept of renewing or replacing the current Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we are initiating an advisory poll of ZCAP on this question: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that the result of this advisory poll (which will be released alongside the results of the ZCG election in early January) will help move discussion about Zcash ecosystem funding forward, and help community members draft more specific proposals in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s my great honor to be asked to lead ECC as CEO.</p>



<p>I want to thank Zooko for everything he’s taught me in the six years that I’ve known him. I have deep respect and admiration for Zooko and his contributions to this industry and to mankind. He is a truly remarkable human. There will only ever be one Zooko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a special project. Its purpose to empower economic freedom is wholesome and good. Its legacy is indelible. The innovation within and the talent behind it are undeniable. That it flourishes is vital. All the earth must have access to private, self-sovereign money if we are to be free.</p>



<p>To realize it, we must begin to move into a new season with a different rhythm. Our focus will be to find product-market fit. That will require a continuous and iterative process of observation, hypotheses development, and testing. We will work with you to invent new things.</p>



<p>This will be a time of wide-eyed discovery, experimentation, and pulling our strengths together to make magic happen. We will be one team, in concert with one another, rapidly ideating and iterating, while working collaboratively with many across the Zcash and crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>My near term priorities are threefold:</p>



 
 Remove friction and barriers, at ECC and within the community, that impede our ability to iterate quickly 



 Focus efforts to exponentially increase Zcash utility through user-focused products and continual feedback 



 Secure ECC financial sustainability so we can deliver more, for longer 
 



<p>In support of these priorities, a few changes will immediately take effect:</p>



 
 We will optimize ECC’s organizational structure to support efficiency and improve the likelihood of our success. 



 Internal processes and policies will change to support increased focus, empowerment, and voice. 
 



<p>While I have been asked by ECC to formally help forge a new path ahead, ECC is only one participant in the Zcash community. Realizing a renewed Zcash requires a chorus of voices, both within ECC and across the Zcash community. I look forward to collaborating with you.</p>



<p>I’d like to thank Zooko and the other Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board members, including Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, and Zaki Manian, for your leadership, and thoughtfulness. This trust is the honor of my professional life.</p>



<p>I’d also like to thank the many of you across the community who have engaged with me in recent weeks on the future of Zcash — ideating, dreaming, encouraging, and collaborating. You know who you are, and you’re invaluable both to me and this legacy we’re collectively building with Zcash. We all need each other, now more than ever. Let’s go!</p>



<p>Josh</p>

<p>We are writing to share some significant news regarding the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and our path ahead. We are opening a new chapter in our story, with a new strategic roadmap, under new leadership.</p>



<p>Since 2015, when ECC (then known as the Zcash Company) was formed, Zooko has been our leader — and one of the most important and revered figures in the crypto and blockchain universe. Under his leadership, ECC launched Zcash in 2016 and since then has contributed groundbreaking technology that underpins Zcash — and a majority of respected crypto projects that exist today.</p>



<p>A few highlights:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In Zcash, ECC delivered the first real-world application of zero-knowledge proofs, a novel method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This is one of the most important contributions to blockchain tech since 2008.&nbsp; 



 The Sapling upgrade for Zcash made mobile-wallet shielded transactions possible for the first time, paving the way for broader adoption of private money. 



 Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way. Halo on Zcash made trustless, private digital cash payments on mobile phones possible for the first time.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Now, it’s time to start a new chapter. Josh Swihart, formerly SVP of Growth at ECC, will return to ECC and take over the reins from Zooko as CEO. He will be responsible for all strategic and tactical decisions. Zooko will remain in his role as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, the parent company of ECC. And first, he will take some much-deserved time off. Together, we will fully support and enable Josh to lead ECC into a new chapter of service to humanity.</p>



<p>Fulfilling our mission of economic freedom requires not just groundbreaking technology, but also great products that bring joy to the people who use them. So today we’re excited to redouble our focus on the Zcash user, and we feel confident in Josh’s leadership — in finding product-market fit, unlocking new partnerships and collaboration, improving Zcash usability, and increasing adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to a vision for ECC and an optimistic passion for Zcash, Josh has a strong entrepreneurial, technical, and product background. He is committed to fostering broad inclusivity within the Zcash community, and he’ll share more on that with you shortly.</p>



<p>We have challenging but exciting days ahead. We’re here for it. Thank you for standing with us.</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>



<p>The Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board of Directors: Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, Zooko Wilcox, and Zaki Manian</p>

<p>This post describes work done at Brave by Senior Security Engineer Kyle Den Hartog, Senior Software Engineer Oleg Isupov, Senior Software Engineer iOS Stephen Heaps, and Principal Software Engineer Anthony Tseng. In addition, we would also like to thank the co-authors of EIP-6963 for helping to find an interoperable solution to this long standing issue. In particular, thank you to Pedro Gomes (<a href="https://github.com/pedrouid">@pedrouid</a>), Kosala Hemachandra (<a href="https://github.com/kvhnuke">@kvhnuke</a>), Richard Moore (<a href="https://github.com/ricmoo">@ricmoo</a>), Gregory Markou (<a href="https://github.com/GregTheGreek">@GregTheGreek</a>), Kyle Den Hartog (<a href="https://github.com/kdenhartog">@kdenhartog</a>), Glitch (<a href="https://github.com/glitch-txs">@glitch-txs</a>), Jake Moxey (<a href="https://github.com/jxom">@jxom</a>), Pierre Bertet (<a href="https://github.com/bpierre">@bpierre</a>), Darryl Yeo (<a href="https://github.com/darrylyeo">@darrylyeo</a>), and Yaroslav Sergievsky (<a href="https://github.com/everdimension">@everdimension</a>). Finally, we’d like to thank the participants of the 6963 task force Telegram channel and those who participated in discussions on the AllWalletDevs Discord channel. This post was written by Kyle Den Hartog.</p>
<p>Today, Brave is announcing the launch of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963">EIP-6963</a> support in Brave Wallet on iOS, Android, and Desktop. Together with other digital wallets and connection libraries, this update is the first step to improving the UX onboarding experience shared between DApps and wallets. With the addition of EIP-6963, we’ve worked with various wallets to coordinate and ship a modification to a very specific implementation decision made early on in Metamask—a decision that ended up becoming a de facto standard, and limiting users’ experiences with Web3. In a nutshell, EIP-6963 support makes it easier than ever for users to use many different wallets without hidden workarounds like changing settings or setting up separate browser profiles for each wallet.</p>

 How did we get here? 
<p>When extension-based wallets were first created, there was a pattern established around how DApps communicated with wallets: they used extension scripts to inject a JavaScript object called “window.ethereum”, which DApps then built around in order to communicate with the wallet. Due to the way JavaScript works in the browser, this pattern worked well when there was only a single wallet. However, once people began installing multiple wallets, the pattern created a new and frustrating problem. Wallets had to “fight” over the window.ethereum object by treating prototype pollution as a feature instead of a bug.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this created odd interactions for end users: when they clicked “connect” on the DApp, it had no way to communicate with the wallet the user selected on the page. Worse, the wallet had no way to detect which wallets the user had installed, and so many of the DApps just assumed the user was using MetaMask. This explains why, when you try to use a DApp, clicking MetaMask will actually pop up a different wallet.</p>

 How does EIP-6963 fix this? 
<p>Essentially, we as a group of wallet developers and connection libraries decided in this spec to define a different communication method—one that didn’t require wallets to compete over a single JavaScript object. Instead, wallets could all “announce” themselves individually, providing the DApp a way to simply listen for all of these announcements. Furthermore, the various wallet options could identify themselves more easily and supply an image to the page, thus optimizing the process of selecting a wallet. This was achieved through an event-concurrency loop built on EventListeners and Events.</p>

 What does it look like? 


    
    

    


    



<p>Just like that, you can now utilize many different wallets at the same time with DApps that support EIP-6963.</p>

 What’s possible with this new pattern? 
<p>This work opens new patterns that weren’t previously possible. DApps can even choose to ignore window.ethereum altogether and communicate with multiple wallet providers at the same time. That means, for example, that your favorite DeFi DApp can simultaneously connect your cold wallet with a ledger hardware via Brave Wallet, and your hot wallet in Metamask. You could thus have two addresses connected at the same time, perform a swap, and more seamlessly move your tokens between a hot and a cold wallet. These possibilities only scratch the surface, and over time we should see some new and interesting user experiences (ones we at Brave are excited to support) especially in the form of additional privacy for users.</p>
<p>To conclude, with friendly coordination of leading wallet builders, users should expect to see improved wallet connection experiences across the Web3 DApp landscape, ready for the next major influx of users. To try the new connection experience with Brave Wallet, visit <a href="https://eip6963.org">https://eip6963.org</a> made by the <a href="https://github.com/walletconnect/eip6963/">WalletConnect</a> team. And be sure to let your favorite DApps know they should start supporting EIP-6963 too!</p>

<p>We are entering a new frontier in life sciences unparalleled in human history, as emerging technologies are changing the biotech industry along a few vectors including decreasing costs in sequencing, synthesis, etc., the ability to program, simulate and iterate in silico and in vivo and entrepreneurial accessibility. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer and understand biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. In recognition of these step-function changes, over the last years, we have backed a dozen companies in the space — ranging from <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/clock-bio-7275d798ba82">cellular reprogramming to combat aging</a> to <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">sustainable material</a>s produced in microbes.</p><p>We believe tomorrow’s industry-defining biology companies will be founded by technologists and scientists who are building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future (see our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-3-74255d983edc">thesis</a>). We are excited about empowering this next generation of founders and have renewed our partnership with <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, the student-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders, aimed at fostering innovation in science at the earliest&nbsp;stages.</p><p>This year, Nucleate has expanded in Europe by opening core chapters in Germany and Denmark. Via our partnership, Nucleate has committed a pool of up to $2 million to fund the next generation of founders that have made it through the organization’s six-month Activator Program during 2024. The objective is to back 10 to 20 new teams across the European ecosystem as they migrate from the academic lab to a commercial entity and build the new platforms that re-engineer our society’s biology experiences.</p><p>We are also excited to announce the winners of the 2023 Nucleate Venture Prize. In total we awarded $1.45 million in the form of uncapped SAFEs to fund early-stage companies working across synthetic biology, therapeutics and drug delivery:</p>  Fusix (Technical University of Munich) — Fusogenic oncolytic viruses.  Nanograb (Imperial College London) — Generating paratopic binders for cell specific delivery using&nbsp;AI  PanTOx (University of Oxford) — Platform for novel antibody therapeutics targeting the tumor microenvironment  Dart Biosciences (University of Oxford) — Novel therapeutics platform for monogenic and common&nbsp;diseases  Jodo Biotech (Cambridge University) — Next-generation legume&nbsp;GMOs  Eterna Therapeutics (University of Oxford) — Novel RNA-targeting therapeutic platform.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.0.</p>



<p>This release includes a “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP) implementation of shielded scanning, with a new “zebra-scan” crate and behind an experimental “shielded-scan” feature. This marks the first step towards full support for shielded scanning in Zebra and we’re excited to continue building out the functionality. Ongoing development is tracked in issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7728">#7728</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Important Security Warning 



<p>This new feature is for experimental use only and has known security issues. We recommend that you do NOT use regular or sensitive viewing keys with Zebra’s experimental scanning feature. You should also NOT use this feature on a shared machine. If you do want to <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">try this out</a>, we suggest that you generate new keys for experimental use.</p>



<p>Also included in this release:</p>



 
 A fix for a panic that was introduced in Zebra v1.4.0, which happens in rare circumstances when reading cached sprout or history trees. 



 Further improvements to how Zebra recovers from network interruptions and prevents potential network hangs. 



 Improvements to limit the ability of synthetic nodes to spread throughout the network through Zebra, to address some of the Ziggurat red team report. 
 



<p><br>As of this release, Zebra requires Rust 1.73 to build. </p>

  Partnering with Tacto: Future-Proof Supply Chains  <p>André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building the modern supplier-management solution millions of businesses need.</p>   
	By Luciana Lixandru, Julien Bek, and Cornelius Menke	 



Published December 11, 2023
  



TACTO CO-FOUNDERS JOHANNES GROLL, NICO BENTENRIEDER AND ANDRÉ PETRY.



 
<p>Sometimes you meet a team and you just know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first learned last year about Tacto co-founders André Petry, Nico Bentenrieder and Johannes Groll and the procurement solution they were building, we already had a keen interest in the category. While businesses have for decades used CRMs (customer relationship management systems) to grow their revenue, where was the SRM (supplier relationship management system)? More attention to the supplier and cost side of the equation was clearly needed, as geopolitical tensions, COVID ripple effects and regulatory changes have created unprecedented supply chain uncertainty and price volatility.</p>



<p>For the world’s largest companies producing physical goods, some supplier relationship tools are available via incumbents. But for millions of mid-sized businesses (SMBs), these options are too cumbersome and too expensive; 90% have no procurement solution at all. Instead, they’re stuck tracking every supplier, certificate and quote manually, in email and Excel. It’s a daunting proposition—especially when you realize that even a company making a seemingly simple product like tape might have hundreds of suppliers and procure tens of thousands of different articles.</p>



<p>Those mid-sized industrial companies are exactly who <a href="https://www.tacto.ai/">Tacto</a> was built to serve, so in late 2022, we reached out to their team to discuss the possibility of a partnership. Unfortunately for us, they’d just finished raising their seed round. But we didn’t want to give up—so we started speaking with customers in the sector, hoping to learn more about the business. What we heard made us even more interested in the product André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building.</p>



<p>Customers told us Tacto had helped them streamline every aspect of the procurement process, from requesting, evaluating and responding to quotes; to tracking suppliers’ regulatory certifications; to analyzing prices and preparing for negotiations. Where their employees once spent hundreds of hours on interviews, questionnaires and data entry, the platform now automatically gathers and standardizes that information—and of course, uses AI to help them make sense of it. Tacto has also dramatically simplified compliance with Germany’s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which imposes stricter supplier reporting to every business with at least 1,000 full-time employees. Even better, it’s easy to integrate—no year-long sales cycles or big IT projects—and, thanks to André, Nico and Johannes’s insistence on an elegant, consumer-grade UI, it’s easy to use, as well.</p>



<p>But customers didn’t just sing the praises of Tacto’s product; we also heard amazing things about its team. André, Nico and Johannes have stellar credentials—all three met at the elite Center for Digital Technology and Management in Munich. They started Tacto in early 2020 after seeing the challenges of procurement firsthand, pushed ahead when skeptics in the space told them it wouldn’t work, and now, have stuck with it long enough to prove those skeptics wrong. They are high-energy, thoughtful and relentlessly focused on performance—and, importantly, they have an impressive ability to attract talent. Tacto’s team members deeply understand the problems their customers are facing, and they work quickly to solve them.</p>



<p>After hearing those rave reviews, we knew we had to try again—so we traveled to Munich to meet André face-to-face. We walked out of that first one-hour coffee with a high degree of conviction in Tacto, and a couple of weeks later, flew back to spend the day with the team and offer them a term sheet. Sequoia was far from the only firm vying for Tacto’s attention—but in that high-pressure environment, we saw for ourselves the qualities that make André, Nico and Johannes great leaders. We were thrilled that they chose us to lead their Series A.</p>



<p>Today, the future is bright. Tacto is now serving customers across a wide range of industries, from mechanical engineering to packaging to medical technology, and impressively, they have grown quickly while retaining every one of their happy customers. In the months and years ahead, as supply chain challenges continue and new regulations expand beyond Germany across Europe, André, Nico, Johannes and their team will be there to make life better and easier for even more companies—and we are excited to support them along the way.</p>

<p>The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology adoption across industries has indicated widespread organisational acceptance of the novel technology. The advent of this new technology has brought more efficient and creative possibilities. However, the use of language models in AI raises concerns about trustworthiness in its training and the output it generates. This leads us to the question: How can we leverage existing technologies to bridge this lack of trust?</p>



<p>This article explores the challenges surrounding trust in AI system inputs and outputs, how blockchain could be the solution to establish trust, and various integration challenges that need to be accounted for.</p>



<p></p>



 Trust challenges of AI systems 



<p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, organisations have made enormous strides to implement AI within their technological systems. Enthusiasm for this new technology promising productivity enhancement, has also generated discussions on whether we can trust these systems. Who has been training these AI models? How can we be sure that the information output it generates is reliable and unbiased? </p>



<p></p>



 Transparency of AI language models  



<p>AI systems require a large language model (LLM) to learn and have a basis to create outputs from. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the LLMs, doubts arise on data input authenticity and reliability.</p>



<p>Authenticity: If the origin, quality, and representativeness of the input data are not transparent, it raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the model’s understanding.</p>



<p>Reliability: Lack of clarity regarding the source of training data leads to scepticism about the model’s ability to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and diverse perspectives. This creates uncertainty on whether the model’s output can be trusted and used accordingly.</p>



<p>Explainability: There is a lack of self-explanation in AI systems on how a specific outcome is generated when prompted. This poses a significant hurdle to understanding and trusting AI’s outputs. What data did the system pool together to carry out its decision-making process when prompted?</p>



<p></p>



 Ethical standards in AI training 



<p>AI systems often make decisions based on complex algorithms and data that include principles governing the training of AI models. Thus creating the need for a standardised set of ethical guidelines governing the training of AI models.</p>



<p>One primary concern is the ethical framework guiding the selection of data used in training these systems. The opaqueness surrounding the training data raises ethical concerns, particularly related to bias. If the data used to train AI models contain biases, the model may unintentionally perpetuate those biases in its outputs. Without transparency, it becomes challenging to identify and address biases in the training data. Therefore making it difficult to avoid potential negative consequences.</p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. AI output 



<p>Another significant challenge revolves around the ability to distinguish between outputs generated by AI systems and those by human intelligence. Can we reliably identify whether the output presented is a result of human thought or an algorithmic process? </p>



<p>Authentication is particularly crucial in scenarios where information transparency is essential, such as journalism, content creation, or academia. This distinction between human and AI-generated content also carries ethical implications. It prompts discussions on attribution, accountability, and the potential influence these systems might have in shaping public opinion. As AI becomes more integrated into society, different mechanisms are needed to transparently demonstrate the origin of information.</p>



<p></p>



 Output challenges 



<p>When speaking of trust within AI, we must also evaluate the ownership and intellectual property rights of AI-generated output. The challenge lies in determining whether outputs are established through AI’s novel agency or the accumulation of various other sources that warrant intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The artwork industry can be used to illustrate the debate on whether generative AI should give credit to artists. Since the system draws inspiration from its training model, would the new artwork’s ownership belong to AI? This debate highlights legal and ethical dilemmas, due to a lack of established frameworks that promote fair compensation for contributors. As AI systems evolve, there is a pressing need to redefine traditional notions of ownership. Acknowledgment of the collaborative nature of AI development is needed while safeguarding the rights of those involved in the generative process.</p>



<p></p>



 Role of blockchain in establishing trust 



<p>Based on the trust challenges discussed above, blockchain technology could be the solution as a trust layer for AI. Blockchain’s decentralised design, using transparent and immutable data records, guarantees universal accessibility, enhanced authentication, and verification processes for all users.</p>



<p></p>



 Ensuring transparency in data processes  



<p>One of the fundamental challenges in trusting AI, as discussed, lies in the lack of transparency regarding data input processes. Blockchain can resolve the transparency issue by recording every step of the AI training and data input process. This ensures that the origin and reliability of the data used to train AI models are traceable and verifiable to reflect real-world conditions.</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain, organisations facilitating AI technology can instil confidence in stakeholders regarding the reliability of its AI-generated outputs. This safeguards against potential misuse and establishes a foundation for accountability in the development and deployment of AI.</p>



<p></p>



 Tracing decision-making processes  



<p>Transparency enabled by blockchain technology can address the inherent explainability challenges associated with AI’s black-box nature. Establishing a transparent trail of the data and model processes integrated enhances the reliability of AI decisions.</p>



<p>The availability of a comprehensible trail can address the lack of confidence and scepticism present in generative AI. Traceability encourages independent evaluation, empowering users to revisit and assess AI’s decision-making steps, thereby contributing to a more accountable and trustworthy AI environment.</p>



<p></p>



 Leveraging immutability to validate data input reliability 



<p>The immutable nature of blockchain technology contributes to providing security to data records and data transactions. Every piece of information entered into the blockchain is time-stamped and linked to previous data blocks, creating an unbroken chain of custody. This not only enhances the accountability of data sources but also enables stakeholders to verify the authenticity of inputs. As a result, users can confidently rely on the integrity of the data feeding into AI algorithms, knowing that any attempt to manipulate or compromise the information would be immediately detectable. On the other hand, blockchain can be used to drive sustainability goals for successful operations in the long run. For further understanding of how blockchain can sustain long-term ESG goals for organisations, refer to this ebook on <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">using blockchain for sustainability.</a></p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. machine contributions 



<p>Distinguishing between outputs generated by human intelligence and those crafted by AI is critical. The widespread use of AI in optimising many of our daily processes is bound to be used in other various domains, such as work-related situations and advisory roles.  This has caused increasing evaluation on whether information distributed is completely human or contains traces of AI contribution. </p>



WorldID is used as a global digital identity to anonymously prove a person’s unique identity.



<p>Thus the use of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem provides a mechanism for creating verifiable identities for both human and machine contributors.  OpenAI’s <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">WorldID</a> initiative is an example of how smart contracts can be employed to authenticate the origin of contributions. Its application will enable a clear distinction between human and AI-generated outputs. Their initiative could address future concerns about accountability and ethical considerations in various domains such as authentic journalism and recognition.</p>



<p></p>



 Establishing auditable trails for tracing errors 



<p>In the complex landscape of AI, errors and biases in outputs can have significant consequences for end users. Blockchain-based systems can offer the solution of an auditable trail that records every transaction and interaction within the AI ecosystem. In the event of errors or biases in AI outputs, this auditable trail provides a comprehensive analysis of the training data and its parameters, facilitating the identification and rectification of issues. This auditable trail also serves as a critical tool for post hoc analysis, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of AI algorithms to meet evolving ethical and performance standards.</p>



<p></p>



 Challenges between AI and blockchain integration 



<p>The integration of AI and blockchain technology may provide us with a starting point in establishing trust, however, there are still potential challenges that experts should address when considering this integration.</p>



<p></p>



 Scalability 



<p>One prominent concern is the scale and scope of AI applications. AI systems often work with massive datasets, and to fully integrate them with blockchain, a highly efficient, low-cost network is essential. However, the transactional and resource costs associated with blockchain networks remain a significant hurdle.</p>



<p></p>



 Cost efficiency 



<p>Initial setup costs can involve acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure to support both AI algorithms and blockchain networks. Maintenance costs also arise as ongoing updates and improvements are essential to keep both technologies optimised and secure. Transaction costs associated with blockchain networks, such as fees for data storage and processing, can accumulate. Particularly when dealing with large-scale AI applications that require frequent interactions with the blockchain. Lastly, organisations will need to invest in skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain, adding to the overall human resource expenses.</p>



<p></p>



 Interoperability 



<p>There are various blockchain platforms available, and achieving interoperability between them poses a challenge since smart contracts and AI applications might need to interact across different blockchain networks. AI models and algorithms may be developed using different frameworks and technologies. Therefore, ensuring a seamless integration with blockchain platforms can be a complicated process. </p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Compliance 



<p>The topic of interoperability across both technologies also highlights regulatory challenges on two fronts. The decentralised and global nature of blockchain introduces uncertainty, as compliance requirements vary across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, the use of AI, particularly in sensitive domains, is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny with a focus on data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Combining these technologies requires a dual compliance effort of addressing regulations specific to each domain and staying up to date with technical developments, to develop a standardised process for compliance.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The widespread integration of AI technology has prompted critical discussions surrounding transparency, authentication and ethical standards in AI language models. Blockchain, through its transparent and immutable nature, emerges as a promising solution to address these concerns. It offers transparency in data processes, traceability of decision-making, and validation of data input reliability. However, the integration of AI and blockchain presents a set of challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Thus, when leveraging this integration, a balance is needed between innovation, and ethical considerations. AI developers should ensure that the collaborative development of AI is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy for the benefit of its users.</p>

<p>1) Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p><p>I’m what everyone knows as ‘JSKitty’ — the infamous dev cat of Labs (since the SnappySnap days)! Young British dev, a never-ending interest in tech, from crypto to global-finance, game-dev and AI, I’ve pretty much touched every computer-related subject that anyone could think of — and my end interest ended up being with crypto, after I found Bitcoin around early&nbsp;2014.</p><p>Before PIVX, I worked at ZENZO, before ZENZO, I worked on multiple early projects, like the “DeepOnion” privacy coin, or “eXperience Points (XP)” back in the 2017&nbsp;bullrun!</p><p>Before all those, I was a Game Developer, with two published games, and a handful of unpublished ones, mostly solo-built, some with friends, but all of them were built in a home-schooled method, I do not have a single academic grade to my name, and I don’t need&nbsp;one!</p><p>2) When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>In early 2013–2014 I ended up coming across (in a way that is now lost to my memories) a Bitcoin faucet, the ancient “Freebitco.in” site (which is still running today, damn!), at that point, I was just barely a game developer, had zero knowledge (hah) of Bitcoin, crypto, most of programming, and even finance in general — over the years, I collected Bitcoin, I learned about it, got incredibly obsessed over the technology from the newfound of decentralised systems and “programmable money”, I joined the BitcoinTalk forum and engaged, actually got a fairly reputable BitcoinTalk account in those days, back when coins would often do “Banner Campaigns” where BCT users would advertise a coin on their banner, fun times,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>3) When and why did you get into&nbsp;PIVX?</p><p>This is an interesting one, around late 2017 roughly, I was effectively a serial-tipbot-dev as a kid, a surprising amount of projects used to have my Tipbots, I built them from scratch, they had various community-building features, and I would bounce from project-to-project hooking them up and watching the communities enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>In that time, I met Snappy and the original-ish tipbot operator (Buer), in which I poked around for the status of it, and saw that it was effectively dead — so I teamed up with Snappy, who LOVED the idea, and immediately helped me to make the ‘PIVX Tipbot’ a reality — and for those months that it ran, I remember it was a huge success, with a bot-powered Radio and DJ system that members would gather and rock with — Snappy would act as a host — that, that community spirit, is what kept me in PIVX, even if the original idea, was merely to propagate a&nbsp;tipbot.</p><p>4) What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;market?</p><p>It’s teams (Core and Labs), it’s long-lived testament of surviving the harshest markets, it’s unique blend of Bleeding-Edge tech with PoS, in which a dozen “PIVX-firsts” occurred and continue to occur. — PIVX as a technology, and a currency, is an incredible feat, to say the least, one that is underappreciated by the wider&nbsp;market.</p><p>5) Can you tell us about your journey as a developer and engineer that led you to the creation of PIVXLabs; mypivxwallet and PIVCards?</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/PjuCvCHDyp">PIVX Labs,</a> or at least the ‘soul’ and idea of it, was born of Snappy — the Catalyst of PIVX Labs as-of-today was back when me, Snappy, Kyeno and various other developers, some long gone now — decided that PIVX needed more than just a Core Wallet, the problem with 2017–2020 PIVX was that there were a severe barrier to entry, as well as a UX that is not up to the modern standards of&nbsp;‘Web3’.</p><p>Labs came to fruition from the demand of Labs being needed — we knew PIVX needed a lighter, faster, easier wallet that anyone in the world, on any device, with any experience level; could setup and use, without compromising on security. <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> was Labs first creation.</p><p>We also knew that PIVX needed more than wallets to thrive as a currency — <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/">PIVCards </a>enabled using PIV in the real-world, easier than any other platform on the market — What will we build next? I’m not sure yet, but it will be another pillar to PIVX’s real-world adoption and usage — That, is why Labs&nbsp;exists.</p><p>6) As a developer, what are some of the technical aspects or challenges you encountered while building mypivxwallet, and how did you overcome&nbsp;them?</p><p>In general, there are three-ish ‘pillars’ of MPW’s architecture to decide&nbsp;upon:</p><p>- Convenience.</p><p>- (De)centralisation and/or&nbsp;Privacy.</p><p>- Security.</p><p>Increase one, and generally, the other two decrease, how do you build something perfect in all three? Truthfully, you can’t, there are trade-offs to be made somewhere, for something.</p><p>My first and foremost priority for MPW has been Security: for example, MPW since even the first day, NEVER allowed saving a wallet to disk without an encryption password — ironically, this is a more secure practice than the Core Wallet, which does not force this measure on first&nbsp;launch.</p><p>But for Privacy? This is tough, MPW uses Blockbook explorers to sync your transaction history, which requires the app to send your Public Keys to said Blockbook to retrieve your balance — this is not fun, but the alternative: chain header sync, would lengthen the synchronisation time of MPW MASSIVELY, which is a huge hit to Convenience.</p><p>Sure, only a gone-rogue Blockbook can actually collect, store, analyse that data — but it is still a possibility, depending on your threat model, that may already be too much data exposure for&nbsp;someone.</p><p>Back to security: many platforms, like Password Managers, will encrypt your password data locally, and then upload your encrypted data to their Cloud storage — this means you can retrieve your data from the internet, or cross-sync things across your devices, which is incredibly convenient: but what if that service gets compromised? It’s a ticking time bomb before your data is decrypted by an attacker, and boom, account gone — MPW could add encrypted cloud-sync for convenience, and to give users the ability to recover their wallet even if their device exploded randomly — sure, but is it worth the&nbsp;risk?</p><p>This is our daily challenge, a balancing act of conflicting design philosophies.</p><p>7) How does mypivxwallet simplify the onboarding process for new users, particularly those who may be unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets?<br> <br> <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MPW </a>focuses massively on: “less is more” in a User Experience sense — the default design assumption of MPW is to assume the user is the least knowledgeable in any area of the wallet, as such; complex features are walled off behind “Advanced Mode”, which hides complex things by default — users can create an MPW wallet, jot down their seed on paper, and encrypt their wallet, within just 1–2&nbsp;minutes!</p><p>8) With the recent launch of PIVCards could you share a little about this phenomenal PIVX use&nbsp;case?</p><p>PIVCards was, funnily, a completely random whim-idea I had a few months ago and decided to prototype in a single week of spare time — having gotten the ‘itch’ to do something new outside of MPW, PIVCards was a massive technological and logistical challenge, and I am surprised that such a small team managed to build it as well as we&nbsp;did.</p><p>PIVCards has processed almost 400 orders, worth a total of ~$17,500, since the initial prototyping, and we HUGELY underestimated the volume we’d be handling, so PIVCards had a full two/three weeks of additional polishing by me, to get it scaling better and with less manual input needed — now, although still imperfect, the service runs entirely autonomously, with near zero manual labour required aside from the occasional logistical ‘edge-case’ we&nbsp;hit.</p><p>9) Finally, what advice or encouragement would you give to aspiring developers and entrepreneurs who are looking to make an impact in the cryptocurrency industry?</p><p>Find what excites you, fascinates you, what grabs at you with the grasp a black hole has on the cosmos: and dive in to it, trust the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Why keep what you love, as a mere side-hobby, rather than a way of&nbsp;life?</p><p>Work doesn’t have to be ‘for someone’, nor does it have to be boring, unexciting — break the chains of being a corporate cog, find what you love, master it, and with enough time and energy (and very importantly: networking), you will make a living with it, doing what you&nbsp;love.</p><p>Sending gratitude to JSKitty for taking the time to sit down with me and share some insights into his background and experiences.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/decembers-pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-jskitty-founder-and-developer-of-pivxlabs-487e2cc3ba5f">December’s PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on JSKitty, Founder and Developer of PIVXLabs.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 TL;DR 



<p>As Electric Coin Co. (ECC) and the Zcash community prepare for public retrospectives of zcashd Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) and what has become known as the sandblasting attack, this blog post details ECC’s motivations, challenges, and accomplishments with regard to each.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The NU5 upgrade was an ambitious undertaking to eliminate the need for trusted setups, increase user confidence, and enhance Zcash’s security and scalability. 



 The implementation of Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, on Zcash made possible trustless, private, digital-cash transactions for the first time on mobile phones. 



 A malicious attack following the upgrade led to significant wallet performance issues, prompting ECC to enter Emergency Mode. Our response involved multiple technical updates, performance improvements, and the release of new mobile-wallet SDKs. 



 Despite the challenges and delays, ECC succeeded in improving the security and resiliency of Zcash. 
 



 



 



<p><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86440711631">Public retrospective: Wednesday, Dec. 13 at 22:00 UTC/17:00 EST</a></p>



 



 



 What the FUD? 



<p>ECC’s mission is to empower economic freedom, and most organizations that work on Zcash-related projects, like the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), have similar community-minded objectives for the betterment of humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, since Zcash came into the world in 2016 a stream of misinformation (and some coordinated propaganda) has been circulated on social media, forums, and other community platforms meant to incite FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>The rumors claimed that Zcash was compromised, or that it was vulnerable to counterfeiting, or that there was a backdoor that would allow third parties to access a user’s transaction information without their consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unfortunately, until NU5 was released, there was a major obstacle in confronting these attacks: the trusted setup. When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup phase, to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations using complex security measures.</p>



<p>Regardless of the extra-careful planning and execution plus redundant security, Zcash users and observers had to trust the historical fact that the ceremony participants weren’t conspiring to deceive the public. Trusted setups don’t allow for a mathematically verifiable supply, and as long as these complicated procedures were required for major Zcash upgrades, there would always be doubters and detractors. And the doubters would have a point — mathematics is verifiable, but history isn’t. The reputation and integrity of Zcash was being challenged, and in ECC’s view, this was an issue the community couldn’t afford to ignore.</p>



 NU5: A call to action 



<p>In 2019, ECC engineers Sean Bowe, Daira Emma Hopwood, and Jack Grigg had been working on scalability design and experimenting with a solution for efficient recursion when Bowe made a discovery.</p>



<p>“I just stumbled upon a technique to do this zero-knowledge proof construction on completely ordinary elliptic curves,” Bowe said. “And so over the course of maybe 24 hours, it went from, ‘Ooh, that’s really exciting, that’ll be neat if we can do that’ to ‘Holy crap, now that we don’t have trusted setups or anything, it’s all really simple. It was a series of steps that turned from a nice insight into a complete paradigm shift.”</p>



<p>Halo, as it would come to be known, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bowe’s discovery was a cryptographic breakthrough heralded by the industry, and in 2021 ECC committed to implementing Halo in Zcash.</p>



<p>Halo on Zcash would make trustless, private, digital-cash transactions possible for the first time on mobile phones. It would serve as a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and provide a path to much greater scalability, while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the ECC blog:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Halo on Zcash would enable circuit upgrades without the need for trusted setups, making the Zcash shielded protocol more agile for future improvements, such as supporting additional assets like [Zcash Shielded Assets, or ZSAs]. We want to make it easy for other projects and tokens to benefit from Zcash features, such as privacy through encryption. Trusted setup will become a remnant of the past.</p>



<p>In addition, this upgrade would pave the way for shielded Zcash scale through proof aggregation and blockchain succinctness, two scalability improvements. This would improve the user experience by eliminating frustrating synchronization time that plagues all blockchains today, reducing the traditional blockchain bloat, and allowing for non-escalating fees as usage increases. In conversations with large social platforms who expressed interest in native Zcash support, a viable path to scalability was given as a requisite near-term consideration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2021, after more than a year of Halo R&amp;D, ECC concluded that the benefits of Halo on Zcash outweighed other protocol priorities, and we proposed implementing it in NU5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/8qSA29vWWds?si=6hvbieHC23DzuvmX">Zcash Media video</a> about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes trusted setups obsolete.</p>



 NU5 objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our NU5 goals from the outset were to (1) make Zcash more secure, (2) give Zcash users confidence by making the supply mathematically verifiable, (3) make future upgrades easier, and (4) enable future upgrades to benefit from recursive proofs for scalability and programmability improvements.</p>



<p>Our original estimate of 6-7 months turned out to be overly optimistic — as new discoveries were made, opportunities were revealed in the process, and technical complexities arose — and in the end the journey took almost a year and a half.</p>



<p>Along the way, we confronted a number of technical challenges. For example, the complexity of including Orchard support in the zcashd embedded wallet was not properly accounted for in the original estimates for the NU5 timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECC faced time-consuming engineering hurdles, like building a complicated circuit for Halo-plus-Orchard to make it work on mobile devices. And midstream, we made the decision to implement <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified addresses</a> (UAs) to enable shielded by default in supporting wallets. The design and build-out of UAs were difficult, and if ECC had been practicing product-driven planning and development at the time (like we are now) we believe we would have identified the need for UAs sooner and their implementation would have been smoother.</p>



<p>In addition to battling technical obstacles like these, plus a few <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-4-5-1/">surprise bugs</a>, ECC spent significant time and resources advocating for and defending our roadmap decisions against criticism for: our rationale (getting rid of trusted setup wasn’t worth the time and effort, ZSAs were more important), our planning (we kicked off the discussion publicly before planning enough -and- we planned too much before starting the work), the decision to license Orchard under the Bootstrap Open Source Licence (BOSL), the decision to implement Unified Addresses (UAs), and our overall approach to network upgrades (our priorities were arbitrary and out of touch).</p>



<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we had significant community support during the process, too. Overall, community sentiment was positive. We received valuable insight and feedback from our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/team/">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and crucial security audits from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@qedit/zcash-nu5-audit">Qedit</a> and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/02/public-report-zcash-nu5-cryptography-review/">NCC group</a>.</p>



 NU5 timeline and accomplishments 



<p>Not including the pre-implementation research and development, NU5 was a 17-month endeavor that delivered novel technology and improved Zcash user experience.&nbsp;</p>

 May 31, 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">NU5 activates on mainnet</a>, eliminating trusted setup for the new Orchard pool and launching a new era for Zcash 
 



<p>When Zcash NU5 activated on mainnet May 31, 2022, it was one of the most important milestones for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016. As ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “an historic step forward for human society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In launching the Orchard shielded payment protocol utilizing Halo, we eliminated the trusted setup to improve Zcash security and sustainability, made the supply mathematically verifiable, improved scalability because future network upgrades won’t require a complicated setup ceremony, paved the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale, and introduced BOSL which has returned value to the Zcash community (e.g., Filecoin Foundation and Ethereum Foundation grants to Brave and Edge).</p>



<p>It was a massive effort, and after almost a year and a half of building and wrestling with the technical challenges of NU5, the ECC Core team was ready for some rest. But almost right away, Zcash was hit with another issue we couldn’t ignore.</p>



 



 The sandblasting attack 



<p>In June 2022, almost immediately after ECC launched NU5, a serious problem emerged. The Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction size and activity. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets (Nighthawk, Edge, and Unstoppable) from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. Wallets weren’t syncing and some users weren’t able to access their funds.</p>



<p>This was a problem that ECC, as the primary maintainer of zcashd and supplier of mobile-wallet SDKs, was best-positioned to confront.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: A call to action 



<p>Some parties at ECC did not initially want to make the assumption that this unusual transaction load was the work of a malicious actor. Eventually however, the evidence that it was a malicious actor became overwhelming — and we have reason to believe it may even have been coordinated by the same actor or group of actors who spread Zcash FUD, and that they may have been paid to do so.</p>



<p>But solving that mystery was less important than fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could regain access to and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world, private digital cash.</p>



<p>As an initial line of defense, we released&nbsp; performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80%. We also began working on performance upgrades to our mobile wallet SDKs.</p>



<p>In August 2022, with lots of work left to solve these wallet performance issues, ECC went into Emergency Mode. This was our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>The wallet performance issues presented a complicated series of challenges to address, and they required developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that would give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. The solution required changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



<p>Internally, fee changes were debated from the get-go, but for the first few months, the ECC team focused on additional performance improvements and worked to resolve the issue without fee changes. Later, we decided to implement fee changes to throttle the spam attack.</p>



<p>As users became frustrated with their user experience, some community members became vocal and publicly criticized ECC for not being prepared for the attack and slow to respond.</p>



<p>In February 2023, we were notified by blockchain security firm Halborn of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">vulnerabilities</a> inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains, including Zcash. This was another all-hands-on-deck emergency on top of the wallet performance issues, and as ECC was the only team notified of the vulnerability, we were the only ones who could make the necessary fixes. The coordination of the disclosure and remediation consumed approximately a month of our time.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, ECC as an engineering organization was attempting to do too many things at once: core node maintenance, supporting CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini, backports from Bitcoin, mobile SDKs, mobile wallet applications, and future protocol improvements. ECC <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">restructured</a> in May 2023, which further strained resources temporarily.</p>



 Additional challenges 



 
 At the time, ECC internal communication and project management practices weren’t organized for an Emergency Mode situation. This affected our understanding of priorities and workflow across teams. 



 Before the attack, ECC product strategy focused on adoption first, instead of performance and scalability. Users want new features, and working on improving performance slows feature releases. But the attack took Zcash UX to the limits immediately. 



 Technical debt: We had implemented previous network upgrades with only limited performance improvements. 



 ECC vastly underestimated how long it would take to fix outstanding wallet performance issues. 



 Other technical issues arose that caused delays, such as when speed.z.cash bitrotted and then got deleted while ECC was without a devops manager.&nbsp; 



 The ECC Core team had three different managers during Emergency Mode. 



 Emergency Mode slowed development of our planned wallet product, now known as Zashi. However, we were able to leverage the prototype internally to validate and test SDK improvements. 
 



<p>ECC was lucky to have proactive wallet partners — Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable — who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Timeline and accomplishments 



<p>In all, ECC’s sandblasting response and implementation by third-party wallets consumed about 16 months. By November 2023, Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable were working again (better than ever), and we announced an end to Emergency Mode.</p>



 Timeline 



 
 June 2022: Network spamming began; shielded outputs jumped from a monthly average of 42,600 to 21,622,590 in June alone 



 July 2022: Implemented performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80% and began working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs 



 August 2022: ECC officially entered <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860">Emergency Mode</a>, although we didn’t use that term in public written communications until March 2023; started researching Spend Before Sync 



 September 2022: While working on zcashd and improved mobile sync experience, re-opened research into possible fee change mechanisms (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317">ZIP 317</a>) and syncing efficiencies (<a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">DAGSync</a>/Spend Before Sync) 



 October 2022: Released zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-3-0/">5.3.0</a> with additional performance improvements to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the zcashd node 



 October 2022: Reaffirmed our immediate objectives regarding syncing issues with our wallet SDKs and <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/29">communicated our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode</a> 



 October 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-thirty-year-vision/">Communicated our intent </a>to have wallet performance issues resolved by the end of February 2023 



 October 2022: Changes to zcashd increased its robustness against the attack 



 November 2022: Identified and fixed the last known bugs that were blocking the first phase of SDK releases, continued progress on Spend Before Sync, and began prepping both zcashd and mobile wallets for ZIP 317; squashed the last known librustzcash bugs that were blocking wallet release and completed Android &amp; iOS SDK integration 



 December 2022: Completed the implementation of zcashd optimizations expected to save memory and to reduce orphan rates for miners 



 February 2023: Released zcashd<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-4-0/"> 5.4.0</a> to introduce a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase 



 March 2023: Published an <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">update and release schedule</a> calling for an end to Emergency Mode by the end of May 



 April 2023: ECC released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-5-0/">5.5.0</a> with the completed transaction-fee-structure change (ZIP 317) and infrastructure improvements that laid the groundwork for 5.6.0. 



 May 2023: (Restructuring at ECC) Pushed the release date for zcashd 5.6.0, lightwalletd, and SDKs to mid-June. As zcashd 5.5.0 began to be adopted by miners on the network, the fee structure changes began to blunt the efficacy of the sandblasting attack, reducing the rate of blockchain growth and wallet scanning load. 



 June 2023: Released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-6-0/">zcashd 5.6.0</a>, introducing the functionality necessary for light wallets to access spendable funds without fully scanning the blockchain; included updates to address issues related to the ZIP-317 implementation and privacy policy features. 



 July 2023: Lightwalletd 0.4.14 was released, which meant the mobile wallet SDK was the only outstanding piece in ECC’s plan to resolve wallet performance issues and exit Emergency Mode. At this point, we had hoped to release the SDKs in mid-July. 



 August 2023: By the end of July, the adoption of zcashd 5.5.0 by the network was complete, and network transaction load had returned to pre-NU5 levels. However, the accumulated chain data to this point still presented a problem for wallet scanning, and so to mitigate this issue ECC announced the pre-release availability of the Spend before Sync capability in our mobile SDKs and made this functionality available to wallet developers for testing. Several bugs and UX issues were discovered. Timeline for the SDK releases was shifted to mid-September. 



 September 2023: New bugs, UX issues, and dependencies arose that pushed the SDKs release date out to the end of September. 



 Sept. 26, 2023: ECC <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/162">released the updated mobile SDK 2.0</a> for both iOS and Android developers. This was the final deliverable for exiting Emergency Mode. 



 Nov. 1, 2023: After a month in production, no related, major wallet issues were reported and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/wallet-performance-issues-resolved-ecc-exiting-emergency-mode/">ECC declared an exit from Emergency Mode</a>. 
 



<p>The culmination of our sandblasting response was that third-party Zcash wallets were working again, and future attackers were further disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



 



 The work continues 



<p>NU5 and the sandblasting attack consumed nearly three years. But faced with organized adversity, competing emergencies, and community criticism (some of it warranted), ECC did not stray from our commitment to build. With allies along the way, the community overcame unprecedented technical challenges and resource constraints to make Zcash more resilient, reliable, and safe.</p>



<p>We learned a lot, and although we’d love to step back and take a break, we know the work is more important now than ever. We look forward to distilling the lessons from these experiences in the upcoming retrospective, and we’re honored to continue the effort to build for economic freedom and a world-class Zcash user experience.</p>

  Black Holes and the Intelligence Explosion  <p>Extreme scenarios of AI focus on what is logically possible rather than what is physically possible. What does physics have to say about AI risk?</p>   
	By Dan Roberts	 



Published December 7, 2023
  



 
<p>For better or for worse, physicists will try to understand things that are not obviously physics, with physics. As a <a href="https://danintheory.com/">physicist-turned-AI-founder-and-researcher</a>, I liked to imagine black holes as computers. (In some sense, they’re the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound">largest</a> and maybe the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/49">fastest</a> kind.) In this essay, we consider whether some very special computers will become black holes before they become gods.</p>



 Rising machines 



<p>Artificial intelligence has been a part of speculative fiction long before there was a specific genre called science fiction. AI has also been a part of computer science (though not exclusively so) for (almost) as long as there have been computers. In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop coined the name “artificial intelligence” for the study of machines that think like humans, and set out to solve the task in a <a href="https://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf">single summer</a>.1 &nbsp;That didn’t really work out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">as planned</a>.</p>



<p>One peculiar thing about progress in artificial intelligence is that the science is far outpaced by the technology: AI is still a “black box” that produces magical results such as winning Go moves, poker bluffs, emotional poems, compelling stories and stunning images. It’s easy to read about how to build such a system—though good luck actually doing so without a huge amount of capital and engineering talent—but nobody knows why, for example, a chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT produces this sentence and not that sentence when given a particular prompt.</p>



<p>But if AI is magic, then it can literally do anything … within the realm of logical possibility. Such possibilities include, according to some whose views are becoming <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">mainstream</a>, eliminating all biological life on earth.</p>



<p>How can we possibly evaluate these claims? If AI is a black box, how do we know what’s possible? <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-joe-biden-mission-impossible-ai-tech-order-1850980643">How do we separate sci-fi trope from scientific truth?</a></p>



 
 <p>No, seriously, in their above-linked proposal, they say, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems [of how to make machines think like humans] if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”</p>   
 



 Simulated in our universe 



<p>To start, I think that AI systems are not black boxes and can be understood in the same way that we understand any other physical system—through physics!</p>



<p>Okaaaay, you say, what does the abstract AI model that implements ChatGPT have to do with, say, the thermodynamics of the gas inside a room?</p>



<p>(It’s really funny and great that you picked that particular comparison to physics, I’d say!2)</p>



<p>To determine the properties of the collective gas in the room—its thermodynamics—from the underlying motion of the ~1025 or so gas molecules—their statistical mechanics—we needed physical intuition and a set of mathematical tools. Together, these let us zoom out of the microscopic perspective—where we keep track of their individual positions and velocities—to derive macroscopic features—like temperature, volume and entropy.</p>



<p>Another type of microscopically complicated system is the deep neural network (DNN) architecture that underlies recent successful AI models. These models are built from taking a simple but programmable mathematical operation—the artificial neuron—arranging them in layers to perform many such operations in parallel—and then stacking many layers in series to get a complicated function that can, if asked, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">write a play</a> proving the infinitude of primes in the style of Shakespeare. In this case, the microscopic description of the DNN is the literal code that the AI programmer writes, specifying how input is transformed to output.</p>



<p>For a language model, the text is broken up into pieces called tokens that loosely correspond to words; each token is mapped into a high-dimensional vector; the sequence of high-dimensional vectors are mixed up, re-weighted and biased in various ways according to the precise numerical values of the model’s parameters that are learned over the course of a training process; and finally, the model determines a probability distribution over all possible next words given the input and can generate a new word by sampling from that distribution. However, that code is the answer to the how question—how is an output computed from this input—but not the why question—why this output and not another for this input?</p>



<p>This description of how a chatbot works is like the following (microscopic) way of thinking about the pressure exerted by a gas: pressure is force per area; each individual gas molecule imparts a force on the wall every time it randomly collides with the wall; so, we can understand pressure by tracking the position and velocity of every gas molecule in the room, track their collisions with the walls, and add up all the forces. Analogously, this answers the how question for the gas—how does pressure arise—but not the why question—why does pressure rise when the temperature increases?</p>



<p>To answer the why questions, what we found—and, to be clear, by we here I mean historical physicists—is that for some types of microscopically complicated systems, simple macro-level descriptions emerge as the number of the elementary components of the system grows very large. (For example, we can derive the ideal gas law and show pressure is proportional to temperature by studying the distribution of velocities of the gas.) Moreover, we historical physicists were then able to find iterative refinements to these simple descriptions to understand how changing the size of these systems changes their behavior.3 (In this way, we can systematically model deviations from the ideal gas law.) It turns out, that as a complicated system with a large number of elementary components, deep neural networks also have precisely the right properties that enable such a physics-inspired approach to help us understand why they work as they do.4</p>



<p>But this is just an analogy to physics. There also is an explicit reason why physics matters for simulating an AI on a supercomputer.</p>



<p>To see why, consider that when we—and by we here I mean <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1726542556203483392?s=20">the people of OpenAI</a>—build ChatGPT, we need a physical object to contain ChatGPT’s parameters—the weights and biases that control the behavior of the artificial neurons in the network and thus define and implement ChatGPT—and make them available to process input prompts. This object is (vestigially) called a graphics processing unit—a GPU—and each GPU has a fixed amount of internal memory for storing the parameters of AI models.</p>



<p>To train and then run frontier AI systems like ChatGPT, you must leverage not one, but many such GPUs, organized together into a kind of supercomputer: groups of eight GPUs are assembled and connected together in a type of box called a GPU node so they can communicate at high speeds, and then GPU nodes are further stacked and connected together in a GPU cluster inside of a room known as a data center.</p>



<p>At the risk of being pedantic, let’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/4VjlheyWjFRHi4yxu06nenOa">imagine</a> that that room—the data center that contains the supercomputer running ChatGPT—also contains the gas whose thermodynamics we were just discussing. As anyone who is old enough to have bought a GPU for its original purpose—gaming—knows, GPUs come with fans because they generate a lot of heat. Needless to say, thermodynamics of the gas inside a data center is very much impacted by running ChatGPT!</p>



<p>In other words, AI systems are physical objects, and AI inference plays out in physical space. As such, all purported superintelligences are ultimately subject to the physical limits of computation. That’s the main point of this essay.</p>



 
 One could say that the proverbial “black box” was originally just a (black) box of gas… 



 In physics, this goes by the name of the renormalization group, which is a kind of physical refinement and extension of the central limit theorem in math/statistics. 



 For some details, check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00008">essay,</a> and for a full blueprint of this approach, check out this <a href="https://deeplearningtheory.com/">book.</a>   
 
 







 
 Collapse into a black hole 



<p>To see why this matters, I want you to now take a moment and imagine an AGI with access to unbounded computational resources. To those worried about the risk such systems may pose to humankind, this thought experiment is often tantamount to imagining an all-powerful <a href="https://ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">god</a> that can do anything. For instance:</p>



 
 It could be an information oracle—the ultimate successor to Google—as it would encapsulate and reason about the sum total of human knowledge.5 



 It could be used to “solve” science and create new technologies that we can hardly imagine. 



 It could escape the confines of your laptop by using the internet to synthesize artificial life.6 



 It could capture you inside the confines of your laptop by simulating you so accurately that you’d have no objective way of knowing whether you’re the physical you or the simulated you… and then torture that simulation to make you do its bidding. Maybe it creates one billion such simulations, making it near certain that the you having subjective conscious experiences is being simulated?7&nbsp; 



 (I’ll patiently wait here while you ask ChatGPT for a continuation.) 
 



<p>Where did this list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark">jump the shark</a> for you? As for me, rather than enumerating the possibilities of god, I started by imagining a black hole.</p>



<p>Lurking at the very extreme of any physical system lie black holes. Try to pack too much stuff—matter or energy—into any fixed volume, and you’ll find yourself a black hole; try to gather a large enough collection of identical objects together, and you’ll also find yourself a black hole. Although it may not be intuitive, this also places a limit on the amount of computation you can put together in any region of space.</p>



<p>To see why, consider what would have to happen if we scaled up our AGI system towards unbounded computation: as our hypothetical AGI becomes larger, we’ll need more and more GPUs to physically run it. This means constructing more and more GPU nodes, and networking them together in increasingly bigger GPU clusters.</p>



<p>So, how big of a GPU supercomputer can we—and by we here I mean literally anyone, whether humanly or artificially intelligent—actually make?</p>



 
 And it would not hallucinate facts or sources when providing responses. 



 Example from Yudkowsky’s recent Time <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">essay,</a> where he suggests that “to visualize a hostile superhuman AI …[v]isualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds …allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing.” 



 See e.g. this short <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c5GHf2kMGhA4Tsj4g/the-ai-in-a-box-boxes-you">post</a> by Stuart Armstrong, or perhaps watch some <a href="https://streamberry.tv/">Streamberry.</a> 
 



 Bounding computation 



<p>Untangling various network cables and contemplating a bound, let’s consider the interplay of economic limitations, technological limitations and, finally, physical limitations.</p>



<p>As anyone working in AI right now knows, procuring GPUs is extremely difficult, so even an order for only a finite number of GPUs will still take an undefined amount of time to materialize. These supply issues are of course not fundamental obstructions to building, but they do point to the heart of economic issues in scaling: how much of the world’s resources can actually be put to training a single AI model?</p>



<p>Estimates for the cost of supercomputers capable of training the current state-of-the-art LLMs are of order $100M. If the next-generation cluster <a href="https://twitter.com/pfau/status/1644741636172251137?s=20">costs $1B</a>, how many more generations remain? Sure, some very big (as in tech) corporations will be able to spend $10B, though beyond that, there are only ~150 companies globally with a market cap above $100B, and today’s biggest company, Apple, has a market cap of (only) ~$3T. Beyond even that, while the U.S. government can command more resources than an Elon Musk—though let us ignore the near-impossible amount of coordination it would take to incorporate frontier AI efforts into a functioning government institution—$100B–$1T is a likely overall U.S. maximum.8 Even so, imagine that we—and by we here I mean literally everyone—band together and devote all economic productivity towards building the biggest computer, there’s still not much room until we surpass the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD">gross world product </a>(which itself just crossed $100T in 2022). Altogether, this points to roughly 2-3 non-government iterations left (e.g., OpenAI can release GPT-6 or 7), or 5 all-in-world iterations left, before the end of economic scaling.</p>



<p>Ignoring the economics for the moment, couldn’t we in principle just keep making our supercomputers faster? Following the current gradient of innovation, we can see this strategy at work both at the level of the GPU—where we’ve been squeezing more and more transistors together on the same chip—and at the level of the cluster—where we’ve been networking together more and more GPUs in increasingly larger data centers.9 However, trends of smaller transistors and larger clusters are powered by breakthroughs in technology—stacks of innovations that enable us to engineer smaller transistors or efficiently power and connect clusters of GPUs—that are increasingly on a collision course with fundamental limits of physics.</p>



<p>While it’s more difficult to do in-context napkin-math as we did two paragraphs ago, we can give some intuition. The driving inspiration for faster GPUs is Moore’s law, one version of which—the empirical observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years—has held since its first observation in 1965.10 Unfortunately, such observations are likely to be discontinued: <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">estimates</a> predict that transistors made of silicon can be shrunk only by an additional factor of four before the hot environment of the GPU will begin to create computational errors.11</p>



<p>Moore’s-over, making bigger clusters is more than simply stacking server racks in bigger and bigger buildings: each node needs to be properly powered and cooled and networked.12 The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/06/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">interconnections</a> between GPUs are an essential technology of the supercomputer, since each GPU needs to communicate with every other GPU for a supercomputer-sized AI model to function. Note though that as the earthly footprint of any cluster grows, the typical distance between GPUs is growing with the square-root of that footprint (e.g. the typical linear dimension of the data center): thus, regardless of how good interconnect technology becomes, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1996/08/id/">the speed of light sucks,</a>” and latency is unavoidable in any superbrain.</p>



<p>So at some point (soon) we’ll reach a bound of how transformer-dense a chip can be, and putting more transformer-dense material together in the same room may not help us because the different parts of that material will be increasingly separated in space, making it harder and harder for it to communicate internally. Perhaps we can account for the former limitation by replacing transistors—e.g., move from electronics to photonics—or maybe we can somehow address the latter constraint by inventing better distributed computing algorithms? Now as computational optimists, let’s say we—and by we here I mean … you know what, I suppose that by we here I mean an actual superintelligent AGI—redirected our entire economy to further scaling the AI, converted all of our natural resources—perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">literally the planet</a>—into GPUs, and remedied the technical limitations above. What then?</p>



<p>Unfortunately there’s still a terminal point to this kind of scaling due to a more fundamental kind of physics: if you put enough GPUs together, eventually something very surprising is going to happen; they’re going to collapse into a black hole!13 &nbsp;The gravitational attraction of each of the GPU servers to one another is outrageously tiny, but, if you stick roughly 1037 of them together, they will eventually matter in a very serious way.14</p>



 
 As a point of comparison, the entire U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget">budget</a> for 2024 is (only) $842B. 



 N.B. there are also gradient-free, if you will, <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">innovations</a> to pay attention to. 



 An alternate version of Moore’s law—which observes that every two years the number of transistors doubles at the lowest price per transistor—has already <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">broken down.</a> 



 In technical terms, this is the scale at which <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/106/19/193503/27706/The-fundamental-downscaling-limit-of-field-effect">thermodynamic fluctuations</a> will begin to dominate. 



 Okay here’s some in-footnote napkin-math: a state-of-the-art GPU node (Nvidia’s DGX H100) uses about <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">10 kilowatts</a> of power; ignoring all the other power needs of the data center—e.g., cooling—a cluster of a million such nodes (8,000,000 GPUs)—roughly ~360x larger than the largest <a href="https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding">publicly known</a> AI cluster and a naive sticker price of ~$500B—would require the amount of power needed at peak by all of NYC in the summer. (See, e.g., Table I-3a, Zone J, <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2022-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf/cd2fb218-fd1e-8428-7f19-df3e0cf4df3e">here.</a>) Generating and delivering even that lower-bounded amount of power would be extremely nontrivial. 



 More in-footnote napkin-math: one of Nvidia’s <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">DGX H100 servers</a> contains 8 GPUs, has a volume of 0.15 m3, and weighs 130 kg. Meanwhile, the Schwarzschild radius Rs = 2GNM relates the mass of a black hole to its radius, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, M is the mass, and GN = 6.67 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 is Newton’s gravitational constant. If you try to pack enough mass into a small enough region with linear dimensions R such that R/M = 2GN, you will form a black hole. For any collection of N objects of constant density, the mass of the collection scales like N, but the radius of the collection scales like N1/3. Thus, R/M ~N−2/3, and you will always eventually form a black hole by increasing the number of objects in your collection.&nbsp; 



 For comparison, GPT-4 was trained on an order of only 104 GPUs. I hope it’s obvious, but not even the biggest AGI <a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets">accelerationist</a> is likely to bet on the actual existence of 1037 GPUs. 
 



 Practically speaking 



<p>1037 GPUs is a lot. So is 1036. (And so is 101, if you’re a startup, and 100 if you’re just a person. GPUs are expensive.) So what?</p>



<p>Is there anything on our list of unbounded-compute god-like AGI powers above that we expect is limited at 1036 GPUs but permitted at 1037 GPUs?</p>



<p>Items (i) and (ii) are the entire point of investing in AI today. It would be a tragedy if they were not possible. LLMs with the right guardrails and retrieval abilities already are information oracles. Given that humans can reason and do science—some of us without even any GPUs(!)—it’s not clear that a scaling bound from physics will limit AI.15</p>



<p>The <a href="https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/">original AI doomer concern</a> is born out of the idea of an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604180">intelligence explosion</a>: future AGI systems will have a general intelligence that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems…</p>



<p>This idea is sometimes called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/recursive-self-improvement">recursive self-improvement</a>; it’s really just the basic idea that investments—in this case, in intelligence—compound exponentially.</p>



<p>The point of this discussion is really just to illustrate the point that there’s no such thing as unbounded computation. This cycle will stop. All aspiring AGIs and their companies are first subject to practical constraints on computation—such as raising an enormous amount of capital to build or access a supercomputer—but even if those “prosaic” limitations are overcome, any derived AGI systems are ultimately subject to a variety of fundamental physical constraints.16</p>



<p>So, does a physical limit of computation perspective on AI matter in practice?</p>



 
 If your conception of AI is as new technology—perhaps even the most incredibly transformative technology—then, I think, likely no. 



 If your conception of AI is creating an infinitely powerful god (or maybe summoning a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzb_CSRO-0g">demon)</a>—a technology that may as well be unbounded magic—then, I think, likely yes. 
 



 
 For items (iii) and (iv), I really don’t know. We—you and me(!?)—should do some physics calculations and find out! 



 Not to mention any <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">“artificial” compute bounds</a> that may be put in place. 
 



 Cutting tails 



<p>By discussing a limit and embedding it in physics, I hope to differentiate between AI—the technology—from AI—the religion. Of course, if you are worried about an infinitely-powerful AGI god, then (self-consistent) fiction shapes your thinking about AI: anything permitted by logic raises a valid concern. My point is that that’s far too broad: thoughtful applications of physical constraints can cut off the very long tail of AI risk and restrict us to a more limited set of outcomes.17&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limited, but not any less crucial. For this reason, I think we should focus on the costs and benefits of AI as we would other revolutionary technologies, rather than treating it as something mythical. Demoting AI from god to tech, from religion to science, still leaves us the ability to accelerate both technology and science—right up to the limits imposed by the laws of physics. In other words, the really exciting outcome from our list of (i)-(v) above is the one where we build a toolfor scientific reasoning.</p>



<p>To get there, we’ll need new ideas that go beyond <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">pure compute scaling</a>. For researchers, for engineers, and for founders, that’s a (scientific) reason to be optimistic.</p>



 
 Just so we are clear, we are not claiming that a superintelligent AI would, as a cartoon villain set on world domination, choose to ignore the laws of physics and hubristically find itself confined in a black hole. On the one hand, this would certainly be very funny and a hilarious failure mode for any AI that aspires to commit malfeasance via item (iii) above. On the other hand, if you attempted item (v), as I did, you might have noticed that nowhere among ChatGPT’s very imaginatively-boring answers does it make this point; the current AI is blissfully unaware that its successors may be limited by physics. On our third hand, at the very least we may assume that some future chatbots may read this essay…

<p>COPY FROM BELOW THIS LINE TO VERIFY SIGNATURE BELOW</p><p>One of the first and most important things to announce is that no funds on the Verus network or in Verus wallets were compromised due to this attack, as they were not subject to the vulnerabilities this hacker group exploited. We hope that the hackers were unable to fool anyone into giving up the funds from their Metamask or other Web wallets and that the criminals’ efforts resulted in a negative&nbsp;return.</p><p>This should be a cautionary tale for any communities using Discord, and we will detail what we experienced, in hopes that it might prevent another Discord community from experiencing the same or similar issues. The hackers used a Discord session hijack vulnerability that is currently in use across some notorious hacking groups along with social engineering to inflict significant damage on the Discord server where the Verus community spends much of its time when coordinating. These attacks had no effect on the Verus network, and although the hackers did get control of the Discord server, they did not need to get full control or credentials for any account to inflict their damage on the Discord server. We believe the attack could easily have been cut short immediately if Discord could improve their false positive account disablement as well as their response time to critical support requests.</p><p>What we have determined so&nbsp;far:</p><p>1. The group targeted me and worked to establish trust as journalists for weeks, always persistent, never pushy. After working with me on an article, where I contributed the following content (<a href="https://medium.com/@michaeltoutonghi/what-inspired-the-creation-of-verus-coin-and-how-long-has-it-been-in-development-12731aaa9be4">Verus Article from&nbsp;Hack</a>).</p><p>2. After they said they had completed their article, they worked for 2 days on getting me to accept a content release form, even rewriting it after I refused to agree to their first&nbsp;version.</p><p>3. Once they rewrote it, I clicked a link from their Discord server, and although they weren’t able to get login credentials, they exploited a session hijack link, and immediately went to&nbsp;work.</p><p>4. After they had my account, which had setup the Discord server so many years ago, under their control, they kicked off all admins, installed their own admins, and did something that Discord would have to help explain that got Discord to instantly ban my account, the only one besides Discord that could have kicked them&nbsp;off.</p><p>5. Since then, they started announcing scam links, claiming fraudulent giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus on websites that if someone with a Metamask or similar wallet engages with, there is a risk of taking assets from them on Ethereum or possibly other networks, not&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>6. We still have not heard from or gotten help from Discord Support since this event began, except that they banned my account, and to our knowledge the scammers are still in the old Verus Discord server attempting to scam an ever dwindling group of members who haven’t left by&nbsp;now.</p><p>7. If you know anyone in the old Discord, please inform them to leave the Discord asap and not engage in any of the announcements, as they are made by impersonators, while people trying to warn are banned and the original admins are locked out of the&nbsp;server.</p><p>8. My old Discord ID is now disabled by Discord, and I no longer have access to our conversations. My new account is miketout.vrsc (this ID), which is not the owner of this Discord, and we have implemented a set of processes for all Discord admins to prevent any such event from occurring again.</p><p>Since the Verus Community is much more than a Discord Server, though we still haven’t found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to&nbsp;join.</p><p>Though we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways. If you have experience writing Discord bots and especially secure servers, please get in touch. Until then, we hope you will rejoin or join the Verus Community’s Discord server and the worldwide, unlimited scale, fully decentralized blockchain protocol conversation.</p><p>Get an invite for the new Verus Discord Community Server: <a href="https://verus.io/discord">https://verus.io/discord</a></p><p>COPY UNTIL THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE THIS&nbsp;ONE</p><p>This article is signed by my ID, mike@ on the Verus network with the following signature:</p><p>AX8OKwABQSBhYU0ShQsu6LSRVay8IY7avMhoy3ub8jhznZnlhD5nGRE4h4U5MEWiPg+DXGJRSXd3bWou5TfNHn/zEPfbMA7d</p><p>(if you are using Safari or possibly another browser, you may need this signature, as the copy comes out a bit different):</p><p>AZAOKwABQSCaekvVN3CBbneot9AHby8S0+YCYevJDSfps3iaML8BF0j9PMdO/37JYxHbuDy/R11hWe9tCI5AInjppcQhQ3hD</p><p>You can verify my signature on any Verus node or lite mode API, by copying the article between the instructions above and entering the ID as mike@ and the signature above to check.

 Introduction <p>Did you know that besides being able to mine XLA, you can also be rewarded for providing liquidity on our exchanges? Moreover, by doing so, you contribute to making our order books much healthier and more attractive.</p><p>Actively contributing liquidity to our exchanges allows you to play a crucial role in strengthening and sustaining a stable and highly efficient trading environment for Scala. This active involvement enhances market depth and reduces the risk of sudden price fluctuations, ensuring that XLA’s value remains steady and supports smooth trading experiences.</p> What is a liquidity pool? <p>A liquidity pool refers to a collectively sourced pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked within an exchange, serving the purpose of facilitating trades between different assets. In contrast to traditional markets with distinct buyers and sellers, liquidity pools utilize automated market maker algorithms (AMM), enabling the automatic trading of digital assets through the utilization of these pools. The primary objective of liquidity pools is to address the issue of illiquid markets by encouraging users to contribute cryptocurrency liquidity in exchange for a portion of the trading fees. Unlike traditional trading, utilizing liquidity pools eliminates the need for matching buyers and sellers, allowing users to seamlessly exchange their tokens and assets using the liquidity provided by other&nbsp;users.</p> What exchanges support liquidity pools? <p>Liquidity Pools for Scala are currently supported on these exchanges:</p>  Xeggex: <a href="https://xeggex.com/markets">https://xeggex.com/markets</a>  NonKYC: <a href="https://nonkyc.io/markets">https://nonkyc.io/markets</a>   Earn profits for providing liquidity <p>By participating as a liquidity provider, users have the potential to receive a portion of the trading fees generated within the pool, creating a steady stream of income. Furthermore, users can seize the opportunity to accrue daily profits, which are automatically credited to their AMM accounts.</p> Risks <p>Impermanent Loss</p><p>Assets held in the AMM Account will be incorporated into the liquidity pool for automated market making. Potential impermanent losses may arise due to fluctuations in asset prices, leading to changes in the ratio of the two assets with the price movements. As the price ratio eventually reverts, impermanent losses gradually diminish, and users can ultimately realize profits from participating in liquidity provision.</p><p>Trusting a third-party</p><p>Storing funds on an exchange always involves risk, as it entails trusting a third-party platform with your assets. We advise against keeping substantial amounts on any exchange and instead suggest securely storing them in one of Scala’s official&nbsp;wallets.</p> How to add liquidity <p>Note: The steps to add liquidity are the same for Xeggex and NonKYC, as they share the same user interface. For this guide, we will use&nbsp;Xeggex.</p><p>Step 1</p><p>Visit <a href="https://xeggex.com/markets">Xeggex</a> or <a href="https://nonkyc.io/markets">NonKYC</a> official website and log in to your account. Click on ‘Liquidity Pools’ in the drop-down menu of the main&nbsp;menu.</p><p>Step 2</p><p>Select the trading pair for which you want to add liquidity, for example, XLA/BTC, then click on “Add Liquidity”.</p><p>Step 3</p><p>Enter the amount of XLA you want to add as liquidity. The amount of the other cryptocurrency (BTC in this case) will be calculated automatically.</p><blockquote>Make sure you have enough XLA and BTC in your account, otherwise, the “Add Liquidity” button will be disabled. If not, you need to deposit the required funds on the exchange and then try&nbsp;again.</blockquote><p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully provided liquidity to the XLA/BTC pair and can now begin earning rewards. We look forward to having numerous Scalanauts contribute to creating a more robust and liquid order&nbsp;book.</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/add-liquidity-and-get-rewarded-4795fdf2f292">Add liquidity and get rewarded</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The integration is supported by an automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, that enables simple yield opportunities on day one for all users on EON. &nbsp; 



<p>The Horizen ecosystem is excited to announce its integration with <a href="https://docs.ascent.exchange/">Ascent Exchange</a> with simple yield opportunities via <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vault</a>. This integration is set to significantly enhance the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> platform’s capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, bringing a new level of innovation and efficiency to the industry.</p>



 A New Chapter in DeFi: Horizen EON Meets Ascent Exchange 



<p>This integration represents a major step forward for the Horizen EON ecosystem. By joining forces with Ascent Exchange, Horizen EON leverages Ascent’s expertise in decentralized exchange operations, propelling our platform to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Moreover, this integration underlines a shared vision for a unified and interoperable digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can flourish across various platforms.</p>



<a href="https://ascent.exchange"></a>



<blockquote>
<p></p>



<p>“Our integration with Ascent Exchange is a testament to Horizen EON’s commitment to interoperability and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent’s expertise, coupled with Horizen’s EVM-compatible platform, marks a significant milestone towards creating a more interconnected and robust DeFi ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent Exchange’s early adoption of the Horizen EON platform is set to redefine the DeFi trading space.”&nbsp;</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



 Simple Yield Opportunities on Ascent Exchange via ICHI Vaults 



  
<p>Ascent Exchange was launched on day one with the support of an automated liquidity management protocol called <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vaults</a>. </p>



<p>This will enable liquidity providers to earn yield with their favorite tokens on Ascent Exchange. Each ICHI Vault allows a depositor to deposit a single token which will then be used as liquidity in an underlying liquidity pool. The Vault prioritizes deposit token yield while protecting from impermanent loss. ICHI Vaults will be launched for a wide range of assets supported by Ascent Exchange.</p>
 <a href="https://ichi.org/"></a> 



 The Ascent Exchange Impact on Horizen EON 



<p>The integration of Ascent Exchange into the Horizen EON ecosystem is expected to bring numerous benefits. As the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, Ascent Exchange is poised to establish a new benchmark in DeFi trading. This strategic move by Ascent Exchange is anticipated to attract a substantial volume of trading activities and users, thereby reinforcing Horizen EON’s position as a leading platform for developers and DeFi enthusiasts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As Ascent Exchange embarks on its journey with Horizen EON. We are positioned at the forefront of decentralized exchanges, leveraging a first-mover advantage that sets the stage for unparalleled innovation. </p>



<p>Horizen EON’s exceptional scalability and efficiency empower us to process an increased volume of transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, revolutionizing our operational capabilities. Fundamental to our ethos, the robust security protocols of Horizen EON ensure an unwaveringly secure and trustworthy environment for our users. Embracing the shared values of decentralization and innovation, we join hands with the vibrant Horizen community, further enriching our community-centric approach. </p>



<p>This pivotal shift not only reflects our evolution but also embodies our commitment to exploring new horizons in decentralized finance, inviting our community to be a part of this exciting journey.”</p>
-Bones, Founding member of Ascent Exchange</blockquote>

  Partnering with Squint: Instructions for the Real World  <p>Devin and his team are bringing cutting-edge AR to the factory floor.</p>   
	By Jess Lee	 



Published November 29, 2023
  



Team Squint



 
<p>Every once in a while, technology brings us a magical moment of delight. I remember the first time I used an Apple AirTag. The navigational arrows, haptic feedback and “10 ft away” message created a simple, intuitive way to find my erstwhile keys—and effectively bridged the gap between my mobile device and the real world.&nbsp;</p>



Magic



<p>Squint brings that same Apple-like magic to industrial work. Much in the same way an AirTag can help you find your keys, Squint is a mobile app for the industrial floor—that shows workers step-by-step instructions for how to use machinery.</p>



More magic, on the factory floor



<p>Imagine you’re a worker in a high-stakes industrial setting, navigating a maze of complex equipment on a factory floor. You’ve just been asked to switch production lines because the factory is understaffed, but you’re not familiar with the new machine you need to use. Your options are: a) ask the worker who’s been at the factory for 10 years and knows how to use everything—but they’re super busy, b) read the paper manual—but it’s buried in a binder in the storage room and difficult to find, or c) just wing it—but that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Squint, you have a better option: simply point your mobile device at the equipment to get instant help. Teams can document and record every step of an important procedure, then the app guides workers through it in the real world, augmented with video and all the institutional knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. You can even use it to check logs, leave notes for the next shift and report maintenance issues. It’s the digital equivalent of the person who’s been at the factory for 10 years, hovering over your shoulder, helping you out.</p>







<p>As America faces an industrial labor shortage, Squint also offers a sorely needed boost in manufacturing productivity and worker retention. Manufacturing is the nation’s fifth largest employment category and growing, as more companies move operations to the U.S. from Asia. However, a quarter of industrial workers are older than 55 and will soon retire, leaving a widening skill gap behind. To bridge it, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Michelin, JTEKT, Siemens and Volvo are using Squint to train and retain employees, increase productivity and ensure safety. Colgate-Palmolive, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhGSvkapruc">found</a> procedures were completed 50% faster with Squint—regardless of a worker’s experience level with the equipment. They also saw greater accuracy and reduced training times, and unlocked new insights through Squint’s built-in analytics.</p>



<p>When I first met Squint founder and CEO Devin Bhushan in 2015, he was a 23-year-old software engineer at Yahoo, tasked with writing the Flurry mobile app all by himself. Despite having no prior iOS experience, he did just that—and helped Yahoo’s customers understand their product analytics. He later joined Splunk, where he led the mobile AR team that made data visible for industrial companies. There, he was inundated by requests from customers to see not just their Splunk data, but all their data—and thus Squint was born. Devin’s experience across mobile, AR and product analytics makes him uniquely suited to lead Squint and pioneer this new category of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia had the privilege of leading Squint’s $3.5M seed round earlier this year, and we got a front-row seat to the team’s incredible pace of progress when Devin and founding PM Dylan Conway joined us for Sequoia <a href="http://arc.sequoiacap.com">Arc</a>, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Over the last six months, Squint’s tremendous market pull gave us the conviction to lean in and lead the Series A.</p>



Squint Founding PM Dylan Conway and Founder and CEO Devin Bhushan at Sequoia Arc



<p>We’re thrilled to be in business with Devin and his team, and excited for the possibilities they’ll continue to unlock with AR and AI. While today Squint is focused on industrial use cases, we can imagine the app someday becoming the instruction manual for any device or place—from your new coffee maker or camera to your Airbnb stay. This is only the beginning for Squint, and we’re excited to be their partners for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Phone numbers are pervasive and continue to proliferate as digital identifiers. In many ways, they are a person’s most personal digital identifier. However, the traditional framework doesn’t allow users to have true ownership of their numbers, and hence, their primary digital identities. Given that phone numbers are allocated by centralized entities, securing a number often means disclosing personal information, thereby posing a risk to individual privacy.</p><p>This conventional setup is susceptible to SIM swapping attacks, a rising concern as highlighted by the FBI. In fact, the number of SIM swap fraud cases <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">increased by 400% year over year since 2020</a>. according to a report by the Federal Trade Commission. Such scenarios have led to numerous high-profile thefts, particularly targeting crypto assets and hijacking prominent social media accounts to mislead followers.</p><p>Moreover, the existing reliance on SMS technology, which debuted over 30 years ago, is outdated and lacks security measures. The architecture remains largely unchanged, without encryption support, thus exposing messages sent via SMS to unauthorized access within a given cellular&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="https://www.3num.co/">3NUM</a> is poised to revolutionize phone communication systems. They are developing a phone number and messaging system&nbsp;that:</p>  Ensures end-to-end encryption for secure communications.  Provides true user ownership of mobile phone numbers, fortified by public key cryptography.  Preserves privacy, enabling users to join the network without relinquishing any personally identifying information.  Maintains the confidentiality of phone numbers, preventing public disclosure.  Mitigates SIM-swapping threats as it transcends the dependency on SIM cards or centralized, vulnerable services.  Integrates with alternative identifiers like ENS, facilitating user-friendly name addressing as opposed to cumbersome multi-digit numbers.  <p>Mobile communication has become the primary modality for people to stay in touch with each other and with the important events happening around them. The time to upgrade this core infrastructure is long overdue. BlueYard is proud to support the 3NUM team in this important mission.</p>

<p>Multi-signature structures have been around for a while and are securing billions of euros in digital assets. But how do they work? And what are the main differences with a simple single-signature structure?</p>



<p>In this article we will discuss what multi-signature structures are, the use cases of multi-signature structures, and how multi-signature structures work.</p>



 What is a multi-signature structure? 



<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



 
 Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions. 



 Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance. 



 Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud. 



 Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval. 



 Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters. 



 Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings. 
 



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>







<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>







<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>

Flashbots is the silent protector of Ethereum, a shield against the forces of centralization that silently sneak into our cryptosystems and turn them into TradFi. It’s one of the unsung heroes of crypto.</p> <p>The guests we have on today are from Flashbots, Phil Daian, and Andrew Miller. They believe the biggest centralization threats in crypto still lie ahead. And they’ve got a new platform that’s being built to defend against them. It’s called “Suave”, and we’ve been hearing a lot about it recently - “Solving MEV” - “Decentralizing block building” - but going into this episode, we weren’t sure exactly what it was.

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.

 ZenIP 42206 is open for voting. All ZEN holders have until 11/23/2023 00:00 AM UTC (11/22/2023 7:00 PM ET) to cast their vote via <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">Snapshot</a>. 
<br>
<p>We’ve noticed that regardless of the voting instructions and documentation that have been provided and positive sentiment towards this proposal, some of the community members may be still experiencing technical difficulties in the voting process. </p>
<p>We have identified four blockers that may be preventing some community members from being able to vote easily. </p>
<p>Here are the solutions for each of these blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1) Voting from a multi-sig wallet 
<p>If you have ZEN on a multi-sig wallet, you are not able to link it to Horizen EON as this is currently not supported. Multi-sig wallet users can still vote by proving the ownership of their wallet that contains ZEN. Follow these steps:</p>
<br>
 
 You have until the last block before 11/22/2023 08:00 PM UTC (11/22/2023 3:00 PM ET) to send a transaction of 100 zatoshi (0.00001 $ZEN) to this address znmJjX4QyLeZJFawTCP35T7tqfdhNQMNZEJ (Horizen faucet) with the multisignature address you’d like to link. 
 <a href="https://forms.gle/fC24DFkMjPZiZu3dA">Submit this form </a>to claim your multi-sig wallet address before 11/22/2023 09:00PM UTC (11/22/2023 4:00PM ET). 
 Right after that, we will collect, share and apply the allowlist of multi-sig wallets eligible to vote. 
 







 2) Voting from a non-Sphere wallet 



<p>If you have your ZEN in a wallet other than Sphere, such as Arizen or a hard wallet, you can sign a message right from the application/hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your wallet doesn’t support signing custom messages, you can paste your private key at <a href="https://getzen.cash/sign/">https://getzen.cash/sign/</a>, and produce the signature. The procedure is the following:</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your private key making sure you are in a private location.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your EON wallet address, and press on “Sign”.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Copy the signature you have generated.</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a>.</p>



<p>NOTE: Make sure no one can look at your screen, you may expose your private key. Do it at your own risk.</p>



 3) Voting with ZEN staked on a Horizen Node 



<p>If you have ZEN staked on a Horizen node, you can just sign the message with the command:</p>



<p>zen-cli signmessage %ZEN_ADDRESS% “%YOUR_EON_ACCOUNT%”</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a></p>



 4) Voting with ZEN stored on an exchange&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to vote using a ZEN balance that is stored on an exchange at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOTE: miners may experience a discrepancy between the balance available on the explorer and the one available as voting power. That’s because the new Coinbase output is not seen until it’s involved in the first transaction.</p>

<p></p><p>London, 20th November 2023 – The GBBC Digital Finance (GDF) team led engagements around the world last week. Whilst our policy team and Chair of the Board soft-launched GDF’s Digital Finance All-Party Parliamentary Group in London at Digital Assets Week, GDF CEO, Emma Joyce and GDF Head of Community, Madeleine Boys, made their way to Asia to join many industry leaders, regulators, and policymakers at Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF).</p>
<p>As a prelude to the Festival, Elevandi – a not-for-profit organisation set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – curated and hosted Elevandi Insights, a day of thoughtful roundtable discussions focused on digital finance. AI and Financial Inclusion were both important themes of the day, alongside tokenisation, payments, and digital financial market infrastructure as prevailing discussion topics which set the tone for SFF.</p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised money took the centre stage for the Festival’s payments discussions. Several panels mentioned the crucial role of interoperability in the evolution of CBDCs. Speakers also emphasised its broader application in asset tokenisation, which was highlighted from both the public and private sector – find out more from MAS’ recent <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/guardian/interlinking-networks-technical-paper-vfinal.pdf">“Interlinking Networks Technical Whitepaper</a>”.<br><br>Central banks examined the role of CBDCs as drivers of financial inclusion and vehicles to minimise prudential risks once the onset technological risks are overcome. Large financial institutions and private sector representatives highlighted the importance of tokenised money – whether it be in the form of a CBDC or other forms of tokenised money – as the key to settlement as well as the broader scalability of the industry.</p>
<p>Building on these discussions, MAS published the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/project-orchid/orchid-blueprint-final.pdf">Orchid Blueprint</a> outlining the necessary technological infrastructure for future digital currency transactions in Singapore. This blueprint, derived from insights gained during the Project Orchid industry trials, identifies four essential building blocks to support the effective use of digital money in Singapore:</p>
 
 Settlement Ledger: This component is designed to record digital money transfers, featuring native programmability and the atomic settlement of digital tokens. 
 Tokenisation Bridge: Serving as a vital link, this bridge connects existing account-based settlement systems with ledgers that are compatible with tokenised forms of digital money. 
 Programmability Protocol: The blueprint proposes a common protocol, known as Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling the specification of conditions for the use of digital money. 
 Name Service: To enhance accessibility and verification, a Name Service is recommended, translating between complex wallet addresses and alternative name identifiers that are readable and meaningful. 
 
<p>The importance of resilient digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) emerged as another theme in these discussions, emphasising its role as a key enabler to the broad adoption and growth of digital assets. The value of open and interoperable networks among global banks and regulators cannot be understated, and the SFF set the scene for another major announcement in this area.</p>
<p>MAS also unveiled a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiativeshttps:/www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives">Project Guardian</a>, which will delve into promising use cases of asset tokenisation on a public blockchain. The most significant aspect is the introduction of new initiative called Global Layer One (GL1), conceived as an open, digital infrastructure fostering cross-border transactions and global liquidity pools. Major institutions such as BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, DBS, and MUFG will participate. This marks a pivotal step toward integration across the entire capital markets value chain, encompassing listing, distribution, trading, settlement, and asset servicing. Key highlights include:</p>
 
 J.P. Morgan and Apollo are collaborating on leveraging digital assets to facilitate more seamless investment and management of discretionary portfolios and alternative assets. The collaboration also involves automated portfolio rebalancing and customization at scale, promising time savings and a reduction in manual processes related to asset servicing. 
 BNY Mellon and OCBC are engaged in a trial for a cross-border FX payment solution, aiming to facilitate secure and interoperable payment solutions across diverse networks. 
 
<p>GDF convened its members its members together on two distinct occasions, both characterised by the same positive atmosphere that resonated with the overall optimistic outlook of SFF.</p>
<p>Our dinner, which we hosted in partnership with Hogan Lovells, focused on the challenges to building digital trust, and facilitating tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), and the role regulators and policymakers have to play in balancing innovation with safe regulatory frameworks. Ken Coghill from the DFSA and Danny Russell from the Bank of England joined us and shared some opening remarks on behalf of their agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lunch, which we hosted in partnership with Clifford Chance, brought together technologists and policy experts for a comprehensive discussion on challenges and essential components for institutionalising digital assets, emphasising ongoing technical efforts to enable financial institutions to leverage public blockchain technology. Malcolm Wright, OKX and former VARA regulator, and John Ho, Standard Chartered, opened the lunch with some optimistic remarks about the&nbsp;direction of travel for industry, with a keen focus on the APAC region.</p>
<p>We could not be more grateful for the continued support of our association’s mission to promote best standards of practice for the digital asset ecosystem, and look forward to continuing to bring together and building our community in the APAC region.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Basic Attention Token announces the ‘Sage Burn’, the final mint phase of the BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection, set for December 7th, 2023. NFT holders can join this event on Bandit Network, exchanging three NFTs for a rare Sage NFT. This event kicks off a series of exciting BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.</p>
<p>December 5th, 2023—Basic Attention Token (BAT) is thrilled to announce the “Sage Burn,” the concluding mint phase of the <a>BAT x Adam Ape Brave NFT collection, first launched in November 2022</a> on Solana. Starting on Thursday, December 7th, 2023, we invite holders of BAT x Adam Ape NFTs to participate in the Sage Burn event by <a>“burning”</a> a set of three specific NFTs—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen—to receive one of the highly exclusive Sage NFTs, featuring bespoke artwork from <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ape_">Adam Ape</a>, and limited to just 300 pieces.</p>

The Sage</p>
<p>Bandit Network, a Web3 platform focused on developing multi-blockchain NFT minting and quests, is hosting the Sage Burn event. With their expertise in crafting engaging and accessible NFT experiences across the many networks supported in Brave Wallet, Bandit brings a fresh perspective to this project. We look forward to this being the first of many BAT NFT collaborations with Bandit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the outset, the goal of the BAT x Adam Ape NFT project has been to showcase BAT/NFT capabilities within the Solana ecosystem. During the premiere mint on November 9th, 2022, fans could purchase BAT x Adam Ape NFTs using <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana-wrapped BAT</a> in addition to SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. The BAT and Solana NFT communities launched the mint with tremendous success, with all 2500 NFTs from the first three tiers minting within three hours.</p>
<p>For collectors and enthusiasts of Brave and Basic Attention Token, owning a Sage NFT is akin to possessing a piece of digital history. These NFTs symbolize the culmination of the first-ever cross-chain BAT NFT mint, and the inaugural BAT NFT collection launch on Solana.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For existing BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT owners, access to our exclusive #holders-chat and #holders-giveaways channels is available upon verification.</p>

 What does ‘burning an NFT’ entail, and is it reversible? 
<p>‘Burning an NFT’ refers to the irreversible process of permanently destroying it by transferring it to an address from which it cannot be retrieved. In the Sage Burn event, you’ll encounter several prompts to confirm your decision, emphasizing the irreversible nature of burning your NFTs. Once an NFT is burned, the action cannot be reversed.</p>


    
    

    




    
    


 Who can join the Sage Burn, and is it limited to certain regions? 
<p>Anyone worldwide can participate in the Sage Burn, as long as they possess the requisite set of NFTs.&nbsp;</p>

 Which specific NFTs are required to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>You must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers: Curious, Dabbler, and Degen. The NFTs can be purchased separately on secondary marketplaces. (See below.)&nbsp;</p>

 I missed the first phase of the mint. Can I still join the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely! You can purchase BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFTs on secondary marketplaces using Solana (SOL). These marketplaces include <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, and <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Acquiring a set containing a Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT enables you to participate in the Sage Burn event.</p>

 What do the numbers on my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs signify, and do they impact my participation in the Sage Burn? 
<p>The number on each BAT x Adam Ape NFT indicates its minting order within the collection. For instance, an NFT numbered #139 signifies it was the 139th to be minted. These numbers do not influence your eligibility for the Sage Burn. To participate, you must possess at least one NFT from each of the three tiers—Curious, Dabbler, and Degen – in your connected wallet at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Is it possible to burn multiple sets of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs to acquire several Sage NFTs? 
<p>Certainly. You have the option to burn any number of Curious, Dabbler, and Degen sets that you possess. If you own multiple NFTs from each tier, you can decide to burn only some of the sets. The choice is yours!</p>

 What if I choose not to burn my Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs? 
<p>That’s completely fine! Holding onto your Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFTs is entirely your choice. Participation in the Sage Burn is optional, and you are free to decide whether or not to take part.</p>

 Is it possible to get a Sage NFT without participating in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Certainly! After the Sage Burn event, Sage NFTs will be available for purchase on secondary NFT marketplaces.</p>

 What happens if not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted? 
<p>In the event that not all 300 Sage NFTs are minted, the outcome is a smaller circulation of these NFTs. This limited availability inherently increases the rarity of the existing Sage NFTs.</p>

 What is the total supply for each tier in the collection? 
<p>The BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection is distributed across four tiers:</p>
 
 The Curious: 1400 NFTs 
 The Dabbler: 800 NFTs 
 The Degen: 300 NFTs 
 The Sage: 300 NFTs maximum*&nbsp; 
 

 What Web3 wallet is needed to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>To join the Sage Burn, you can use your Brave Wallet or any other Solana DApp-compatible wallet, such as Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, and more. You can also use a hardware wallet, such as a Ledger or Trezor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please ensure that all the BAT x Adam Ape NFTs you plan to burn are consolidated in the same wallet. This wallet should be connected to Bandit Network at the time of the Burn.</p>

 Do my BAT x Adam Ape NFTs need to be in the same wallet? 
<p>All NFTs you plan to burn for the Sage Burn event must be in a single Web3 wallet. This wallet should be the one you connect to Bandit Network for participation in the Burn.</p>

 Can I use the Brave Wallet in my Brave mobile app to participate in the Sage Burn? 
<p>Absolutely. To participate, visit Bandit Network and connect using your Brave Wallet when prompted.</p>

 How can I see my NFTs in the Brave Wallet? 
<p>To view your NFTs, simply go to the NFTs tab in your Brave Wallet.</p>

 I want to sell, trade, or transfer my NFTs. Where can I do this? 
 
 To transfer an NFT: In your Brave Wallet, select the NFT you wish to transfer, click on ‘Send,’ and enter the recipient’s address. 
 To sell or trade: Visit platforms like <a href="https://magiceden.io/marketplace/bat">Magic Eden</a>, <a href="https://hyperspace.xyz/collection/batxadamape">Hyperspace</a>, or <a href="https://www.tensor.trade/trade/bat">Tensor</a>. Connect your Brave Wallet or another Solana DApp wallet to carry out the transaction. 
 

 What are wrapped tokens and what is sBAT (Solana-Wrapped BAT)? 
<p>Wrapped tokens facilitate the use of assets across different blockchains, improving functionality and interoperability. This process locks the original tokens on their native blockchain and creates an equal number of wrapped tokens on a smart-contract blockchain such as Ethereum</p>
<p>sBAT is an example of this. There are several ways to buy or bridge BAT on Solana:</p>
 
 Purchase wBAT directly in the Brave Wallet using Ramp’s fiat-to-crypto service or convert existing SOL to wBAT. 
 Bridge BAT from Ethereum to Solana using the Wormhole Bridge. 
 

 Where can I purchase SOL? 
<p>You can purchase SOL, the Solana network’s cryptocurrency, directly in the Brave Wallet using fiat or crypto via Coinbase Pay, Link by Stripe, Ramp, or other available options. Alternatively, SOL is also available on any cryptocurrency exchange that supports Solana.</p>

 When will you reveal utility for the Sage? 
<p>While there is no guarantee of added utility for the Sage at the time of the Burn, we are collaboratively exploring future options with the BAT Community. Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> and Tuesday <a href="https://talk.brave.com/this--is--your--weekly--bat-community--call">BAT Community Calls</a> at 2pm PST/5pm EST to contribute to this ongoing process.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to last week. Here's everything that transpired at Panther last week:</p> Marketing Updates  Extension of the Advanced Staking Program <p>Advanced Staking V4 is now live for the next four months and $ZKP holders can now stake their tokens again. This was made possible due to the successful approval of PIP-19 and the commendable efforts of our <a href="https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/pull/12/commits/eb1a943766befac076922ffd5f7d1d1ceac616fa?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community members</a> for updating related smart contracts and deploying a new frontend on IPFS.

This panel was part of the Secret Soiree side event on the final day of the convention. You can watch a recording of the session below.</p> Product Updates  Stage 2 Developments  Recharge Functionality <p>Making further advancements on Stage 2 of the protocol, the development of recharge functionality for Protocol Rewards has been completed and will be announced separately once the vesting of $tZKP is configured. The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about our reward structure <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a></p> Stage 3 Developments  Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3 and the team will perform the unit testing of the Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker this week. Panther Core dApp user interface is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts <p>The main transaction function of the Pool contract which is the foundation for the stage 3 development has been implemented. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p> UI/UX Design <p>A new version of Panther V1 Design is being worked on and the community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Community Questions <p>When will the team publish the updated roadmap?</p><p>The team plans to release an updated product roadmap this week. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs.

<p>Plants have long produced potent human therapeutics and contributed to over 20% of drugs approved since the 1980s, including Morphine and Artemisinin. Although monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), a promising class of plant-derived compounds with unique pharmacological properties that have already produced drugs such as the chemotherapy vinblastine, could help to revolutionize treatments in mental health and pain management, obtaining sufficient quantities of MIAs for the development of new drugs remains a major challenge due to reliance on natural sources and difficulties scaling chemical synthesis, both of which severely limit the quantities of MIAs that can be produced.</p><p><a href="https://biomia.com/">Biomia</a> has developed a platform for mass-producing plant natural products, particularly MIAs, using engineered yeast. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-krogh-jensen-1a589b6/?originalSubdomain=dk">Michael</a> and <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jie-zhang">Jie</a>, now Biomia’s CEO and CSO respectively, led the collaborative research effort in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-keasling-6783754/">Jay Keasling</a>, a well-renowned researcher and entrepreneur in the field of synthetic biology and a Scientific Advisor for Biomia, funded with $10 million by the EU through the <a href="https://www.miami-project.eu/">MIAMI</a> project, a $3 million grant from the Bio-Innovation Institute in Denmark, as well as substantial soft-funding from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Their breakthrough Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05157-3">study</a> showcased de novo microbial biosynthesis of vinblastine (brand name Velban®), a clinically-approved cancer treatment molecule, achieving the longest biosynthetic pathway replicated in yeast. Expanding upon their initial discovery, the team has also achieved the ability to enhance natural molecules with chemical halogens, creating the possibility to develop novel drugs inspired by natural products with enhanced therapeutic properties — and potentially fewer side&nbsp;effects.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>MIAs are a promising therapeutic class to treat pain, mental disorders and substance abuse disorders, all indications with markets &gt; $10bn globally each, and with an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics. Alone the growing opioid crisis has amplified the need for novel, effective pain medication and therapies for substance abuse, and most anti-psychotics have severe adverse effects with no alternative treatments available. We believe Biomia has the potential to harness its drug discovery and MIA manufacturing platform to revolutionize the treatment landscape for numerous mental and physical disorders through countless novel, nature-inspired molecules.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing the Biomia team on their mission to mass-produce plant natural products from some of the world’s most intractable diseases and additions.

      The Next Billion Developers         
	By David Cahn	 





Published November 15, 2023
        The developer revolution will be as important as the AI revolution.      



 
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is Silicon Valley’s latest obsession. Brilliant minds like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/elon-musk-reveals-xai-efforts-predicts-full-agi-by-2029/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman</a> believe achieving AGI is not just likely, but inevitable. Others disagree. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_i-think-the-phrase-agi-should-be-retired-activity-6889610518529613824-gl2F/">Yann LeCun</a>, one of the godfathers of machine learning, has said “there is no such thing as AGI.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea">Jack Clark</a> of Anthropic has described the “breathless enthusiasm” for AGI as a “misplaced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2DaQxTihc">religious impulse</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a lightning rod, AGI captures our imagination. AGI promises <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-altman-on-the-a-i-revolution-trillionaires/id1548604447?i=1000525043188">free education and housing</a>, the eradication of poverty with universal basic income, and a reallocation of human capital to science and art. These are worthwhile objectives.</p>



<p>But what if AGI is a distraction? What if there’s another path to this same future—one that does not require a technological leap of faith and is already underway?</p>



<p>There are more developers today than ever before. And the population is starting to snowball. Our thesis is that bringing 1B developers into the software economy could rival AGI in terms of its economic impact.1</p>



<p>Software engineering is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. If we can make it even more widely available—assisted and accelerated by AI—it could result in the automation of many non-tech industries, creating an economic surplus.</p>



<p>But is this target of 1B developers really achievable? Isn’t software engineering too hard to teach to so many people? And what would we do with all those developers?</p>



<p>Let’s start with the goal of 1B developers. This year, the developer population crossed <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">100M</a>, up from 24M when Github first started reporting the metric in 2017.2 In Github’s recently published <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">State of the Octoverse</a> report, they shared that the global developer population grew 26% in the last year. Github added 21M new accounts in 2022.</p>



<p>We have three reasons to believe hypergrowth in the developer population will persist.<br></p>



<p>First, it’s been getting much easier to become a developer, and we expect this flywheel to continue. In just the last decade, Cloud abstracted away the server. Databases like MongoDB and Postgres simplified the back-end. Vercel and React reshaped the front-end. The best software engineers continue to focus on improving the discipline itself. By iteratively building better and better abstractions, software engineers have created a flywheel that reduces complexity while increasing potency. As a result, a 12 year-old in India can now build a web app in a matter of days, something that would have taken a professional developer weeks before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, market forces continue to attract more and more young people to become software engineers. Already, the best and brightest are disproportionately learning to code. Rather than dampening as more talent has entered the field, the economic returns to software engineering only seem to be expanding. What this means is that the productivity of software engineers, and the applicability of their skills, is expanding faster than the supply.</p>



<p>Third, AI has been an unanticipated accelerator. Today, <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/">Github Copilot</a> is writing 46% of users’ code. <a href="https://zapier.com/ai">Zapier</a> enables developers to build automations with text descriptions. <a href="https://openinterpreter.com/">Open Interpreter</a> is turning the command line into a chat interface. With AI copilots, we may eventually be able to program computers using natural language alone.</p>



<p>Growth in the developer population enables the software economy to broaden its scope and impact. For example, companies like Stripe, Twilio and Plaid have created essential building blocks for payments, telecommunications and banking. Traditional companies in mature industries are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/despite-mass-layoffs-led-by-meta-its-still-hard-to-fill-tech-jobs.html">bringing on</a> more and more software engineers to drive internal digitization. Newer startups are also taking software and AI and applying these technologies to sectors like mining, robotics, construction, accounting and legal. The opportunity with 1B developers is to drive automation not just in the digital economy, but in the physical economy as well.</p>



<p>Unlike AGI, the promise of 1B developers is not about eliminating work altogether. Rather, it is about taking our resources—human resources—and leveraging them to have more and more impact. Thus, the story of the coming decades may be about the increased power of AI. But more quietly, the methodical march of the developer revolution will continue.&nbsp;</p>

      Finding Her Place in the Sun         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published November 14, 2023
        Lynn Jurich’s unwavering determination to unlock cleaner, greener energy powered the rise of Sunrun.      



 
<p>In March 2023, solar entrepreneur Lynn Jurich took the stage for the Stanford Graduate School of Business’s Climate, Business &amp; Innovation Summit. In the 15 years that had passed since she had attended the school herself, solar energy had come of age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in history, the cost of solar energy has fallen below that of fossil fuels, and Sunrun, which Jurich co-founded in 2007, is now the largest installer of residential solar panels in the U.S., with more than 800,000 customers in 20 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. Her unwavering determination to change energy infrastructure (and the world) is what brought Jurich back to GSB that day. But these achievements, and the survival of her company, were never a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich took her audience back to Sunrun’s early days, to a time when consumer solar was still the wheelhouse of “hippies and hobbyists,” and installation and hardware were expensive. Back then, Jurich and her co-founders had waded through the complexities of the green energy space without a clear sense for how to make their business model, much less the world, sustainable. And they were perilously close to burning through their venture capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our initial vision was that we would be pretty asset-light,” Jurich told the audience. “The existing solar installers out there would be doing the construction and selling to homeowners. We would raise the capital, and own and monitor the systems. So we’d only need a few employees. But we were wrong. Very, very wrong.”</p>



 



<p>The sun had already set, but the teenage Jurich refused to go back inside without sinking a few more shots. She wouldn’t feel content calling it a day until she was, according to her sister Tracy, “basically shooting NBA free-throw percentages.” Focus, which in this case earned Jurich a spot on the Pac-10 recruiting list for basketball by 8th grade, had been Jurich’s speciality since kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At five years old, Jurich had started writing to-do lists. “My list would be like, ‘invent something.’ Or, ‘make a scientific discovery,’” she remembers. At age six, reading biographies became her pastime of choice, an activity that suited her introverted nature. She’d go to the public library in her neighborhood near Point Defiance, a lush peninsula jutting into the Puget Sound, and work her way through their nonfiction section. She had lots of things she wanted to accomplish, and was looking for proofs of concept. “I was always attracted to people who mastered their craft,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her early favorites centered on strong women: Florence Nightingale, Betsy Ross, Anne Frank. But fittingly, no biography captivated her more than that of Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb (and 1,000 or so other things). In a prescient 1931 exchange between Edison and Henry Ford, Edison notes, “We should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind and tide.” (According to recent sources, the sun produces enough sunlight to power Earth’s electricity needs for a year every hour.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But truly mastering one’s craft was no easy feat—Jurich had internalized this from her biography obsession. It required resolve and concentration, which Jurich maintained through high school and then college at Stanford, where she earned top honors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating, Jurich landed a competitive role at a prestigious private equity firm. Her job was to get in front of entrepreneurs by any means necessary—cold-calling, attending the same conferences as them, befriending their assistants so that she could sit next to them on a plane—and evaluate them for potential investment opportunities. This was daunting for the self-described “strong introvert,” but once she worked up the nerve she found that pushing herself had an important upside. Like her biography kick on steroids, she got to observe dozens of highly accomplished individuals modeling potential paths to success, an experience that made it clear to her that “if there’s a good company out there, it’s going to get funded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After three years working on the investor side, she needed no further proof of concept. “It was just very clear to me that I wanted to be on the entrepreneur side,” says Jurich. This hard-earned clarity led her to return to Stanford for business school.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“How do we get people to give solar a shot?” It was January 2007, and this was the question Jurich, Ed Fenster, a Stanford GSB classmate, and Nat Kreamer, a childhood friend of Fenster’s, had been debating for weeks over pizza and Diet Coke in the living room of Fenster’s San Francisco apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’d filed the paperwork for their company Sunrun just a few days earlier, officially making this question of particular interest for the group. Jurich was fresh off a summer banking internship in Shanghai, where she had been struck by the density of construction and urban energy infrastructure. She couldn’t stop thinking about clean energy and how to make continued infrastructure development more sustainable. Kreamer was recently back from a tour in Afghanistan and motivated to seek energy independence after fighting in a war he’d concluded was mostly about fossil fuels. Fenster had connected the dots, uniting the team in his apartment to solve the challenge of solar expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fueled by cheesy carbohydrates and artificial sweetener, they concluded that the real opportunity lay not in developing cleantech, but in deploying it. “We saw that VC money was already being put toward making solar panels cheaper. We were quite certain that innovation was going to happen,” says Jurich. “So we thought, ‘Why don’t we solve the problem of convincing people to give solar panels a shot, and figuring out how to interface with the electric grid?’ That was gonna be the bigger challenge and the bigger area to add value.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer they settled on was to lower the barrier to solar adoption as much as possible for homeowners. Sunrun would offer ‘solar-as-a-service,’ leasing solar panels with a small upfront cost at a time when owning and installing one’s own solar panels was still logistically challenging, and prohibitively expensive for many. “The business model innovation was that we would put solar panels on your rooftop for very little money, and you would sign a 20-year contract to buy the electricity from us for X cents per kilowatt hour,” says Jurich. “So it was a long-term contract for us, the customer didn’t have to spend the money up front, and they could get cheaper power. Win-win all the way around.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going the consumer route, as opposed to leasing solar panels to corporations, was an added challenge, however. It meant figuring out how to install and operate panels on houses of all shapes and sizes in varying conditions around the country. But if they could manage all of that, Jurich believed this approach would ultimately make a more defensible business. “We believed costs would hit grid parity first at the consumer level because consumers pay the most money for power,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By narrowing their focus to homeowners, the founders were actually thinking bigger—not only would they be spreading clean energy, they could reduce inefficiencies in energy infrastructure. “What’s really innovative about solar is you can use an existing roof,” says Jurich. “You don’t have to acquire land. You don’t have to build big transmission lines. You don’t have to interrupt the ecosystem.” The value prop and climate impact seemed undeniable. They’d soon find out it wasn’t such an easy sell.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>Jurich’s voice was hoarse from hollering at passersby. This was her third county fair in as many days, dusty and hot, and a far cry from her time in private equity traveling on private jets (which, at least on an environmental level, felt like karmic justice). Again, Jurich had found herself in the challenging situation of having to talk to strangers. This time, Jurich was donning her company swag (an oversized white tee that read, “A penny for your watts?”) and standing next to an oversized pumpkin. She was desperate to make a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fenster, they decided early on, would take the role of CEO and focus on raising capital; Kreamer, as president, would take on installations, billing, and system monitoring; and it was up to Jurich as COO to build out their business pipeline (read: sales). She had deduced that the quickest way to sell consumers on solar panels was to go straight to the source. “This was 2007. There weren’t a lot of people online searching, you know, ‘I want a solar energy system,’” says Jurich. “So we were like, ‘Where do you find a homeowner who would be interested in Sunrun?’ I decided to go to places with lots of homes and lots of sun.”</p>



<p>From the rare fair-goer who agreed to chat, Jurich gleaned that “going green” still wasn’t enough—they were willing to consider solar only if it saved them money. Even after Sunrun’s upfront costs (initially about $10,000 for installs, still well below the cost of buying and installing one’s own panels), Sunrun would save them money, but only over the course of years—a commitment most consumers weren’t willing to make with a startup that had existed for just a few months. “What I always told them was, ‘If someone came to your house and said they would install a gasoline tank, and you could buy gas for $1 per gallon for the next 20 years, would you do it? That’s what we’re offering: Electricity at a fixed price for 20 years and it’s cheaper,’” says Jurich. “People thought it was too good to be true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After dozens of refusals, Jurich finally caught the attention of a woman named Sue who ran a trucking company. Jurich made her pitch, highlighting the fixed, long-term rate, which was much lower than traditional electrical costs. She told Sue that Sunrun would own, operate and maintain the solar panels on her roof, but that they outsourced sales and installation to existing solar installers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sue, excited to bet on a young female entrepreneur, was convinced. And Jurich, after months in the summer heat hawking her solar wares, made her third sale (Sunrun’s first sale was to Fenster, and the second was to his therapist). “Seeing that there was actually consumer interest in this helped me so much,” says Jurich, “It gave me the conviction that this was gonna work, that all the hustle was worth it. That conviction can get you through some pretty hard times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hard times turned out to be just around the corner, and she’d need all the conviction she could muster.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“We’re done for,” Jurich thought as she read the headlines announcing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Bank. It was September 2008, and Sunrun was desperately in need of funding—money that suddenly seemed entirely unattainable.</p>



<p>Sunrun’s early sales had put its business model to the test. Since the company was covering most of the upfront purchase and installation costs, its ability to sell was contingent upon its ability to raise money. But banks wanted proof of sales before lending. “We had a chicken and an egg problem,” says Jurich. The co-founders were forced to use their seed money—a few million they’d managed to raise from contacts in private equity and banking—to finance their earliest installs. But with dwindling funds and no guarantee that they could secure investments to stay afloat, “it made for an extremely stressful time,” Jurich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They had finally managed to raise $12 million in June 2008, a lifeline as sales were starting to take off—but nothing close to what they needed to scale. Just as new term sheets began to come their way, Lehman Brothers went under, signaling a complete collapse of the financing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, another bank pulled out of negotiations. Sunrun’s point of contact would be fired, or the entire financial institution would dissolve. But then, in November 2008, there came a flicker of hope. The Sunrun founders received a callback from U.S. Bank, the rare financial institution that hadn’t been decimated by the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this was likely their only shot, the founders negotiated a deal they hoped would be hard to refuse. “We were panicking,” Jurich says. “But at the same time, we were like ‘We are going to close this deal because we have no choice.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2008, Sunrun closed a $40 million debt financing round from U.S. Bank. “Looking back, we call this moment our big awakening,” Jurich says. Fenster agrees. “Had we not gotten that deal,” he says, “the company might not have made it another four months.”</p>



 



<p>Six years after bringing Sunrun back from the brink, Jurich’s sense of solar inevitability was feeling like less of a moonshot with every passing day. For one, Sequoia became a believer (and led Sunrun’s Series C), as did traditional energy giant, PG&amp;E, who had invested an additional $100 million to finance installations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which isn’t to say things were entirely sunny. Solar gaining traction threatened most other incumbent utilities, who did all they could to block Sunrun’s growth through lobbying. And then there were the government subsidies—hugely positive in the ways they pushed growth in a sustainable direction, but wildly destabilizing from a business perspective, with one subsidy or regulation unlocking a market one month, and an expiring subsidy making another disappear the next.</p>



<p>In 2009, the Obama stimulus package extended a solar tax credit to homeowners who bought their own system. This lowered the purchase price of solar panels overall, which made it harder for Sunrun to convince homeowners to buy into their leasing model, in particular paying for the company’s upfront installation costs. “That blew up our whole transaction model,” says Fenster. Jurich and Fenster, by then co-CEOs (Kreamer left the company in 2009), decided they needed to eliminate upfront costs entirely in order to remain competitive. To compensate, they increased their new customers’ monthly payments while still managing to stay below traditional utility rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their new no-upfront pricing structure made it easier than ever for homeowners to give solar a shot, but not enough to edge out their competition. Elon Musk’s SolarCity had just gone public and was starting to outpace Sunrun. And SolarCity had something crucial that Sunrun lacked: their own operations and installation capabilities. Seven years in, Sunrun was still essentially operating as a management and financing company, relying on third parties for construction, installation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they wanted to scale, Sunrun would have to take over the third-party labor themselves. This, of course, required a huge amount of capital that Sunrun didn’t have. But, no stranger to complex negotiations, Jurich and Fenster managed to secure a massive acquisition of their largest installations partner, REC Solar’s Residential Division (AEE Solar and SnapNrack), in an all-equity deal as a workaround. Overnight, Sunrun grew from 150 employees to 550. That same year, signaling just how much Jurich had grown as a leader since her days of reluctant cold-calling, Fenster stepped down as co-CEO of Sunrun, and Jurich stepped into the role. “Lynn was a better head for the company than I was,” he says. “There are really smart people who are excellent at making decisions but who aren’t great at managing people. Lynn’s unique in that she can do both.”</p>



<p>Poised for expansion, and in the wake of SolarCity’s IPO, the pressure was on for Sunrun to follow suit. “I knew we needed to go public,” Jurich says. “There were a handful of solar IPOs that had just happened that we didn’t believe in, and we thought they were gonna spook the market. So I didn’t really feel that I had the luxury to slow down at any point in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even when she learned she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich’s daughter Blythe was born just a few weeks before Sunrun’s IPO on August 5, 2015, and was in Jurich’s arms when she rang the Nasdaq bell. “I got on a conference call the day I got home from the hospital, and my mom moved in and helped me,” says Jurich. (While Jurich, who had her second child in 2018, didn’t take maternity leave, she expanded maternity leave benefits for the rest of the company, signaling that she didn’t expect others to make the same choice that she had.)</p>



<p>Sunrun’s share price dropped roughly 20% on its first day of trading, which only fed Jurich’s resolve to be as present at the company as possible. She started her investor roadshow when Blythe was just five weeks old, bringing her mother and a nurse along for support. “I was constantly pumping and shuttling milk back and forth between hotels and hedge fund offices,” Jurich says. “It was exhausting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2017, Sunrun had rebounded from its post-IPO dip to become the largest publicly traded rooftop solar company in the U.S. following Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. After years of fundraising, surviving a recession, battling incumbent utilities, navigating company altering climate legislation, IPOing and becoming a mother, Jurich felt like things were finally in a good place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s when the Wall Street Journal article came out.</p>

<p>In the May 2017 piece, former Sunrun employees claimed the company hadn’t reported order cancellations that may have affected sales data in financial disclosures leading up to the IPO. Jurich denied all wrongdoing, claiming the journalism was “not representative of the company and suspect.” Despite Sunrun’s assurances, the article triggered a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) of Sunrun and its competitor, SolarCity. Sunrun’s stock bottomed out. And shareholders filed a class action suit against Sunrun.</p>



<p>Jurich remembers this time, as her company’s reputation and her own integrity were called into question, as one dominated by a profound sense of grief and powerlessness. Ever since her days of writing her first to-do lists, she’d been laser focused on success. But suddenly, no amount of resolve, no degree of hustle could change the way the world perceived her and her company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, months after the initial article broke, Sunrun released a statement saying that after conducting an internal audit, the SEC didn’t find any evidence of manipulated sales data. Still, the company ended up making a $30 million settlement with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Sunrun’s name had technically been cleared, in the weeks following, Jurich continued to struggle emotionally from the toll the probe had taken. For the woman who had defined so much of her life by her achievements, this failure—which she certainly saw it as—felt existential. She faced a choice: “Your options are either to crumble because you can’t deal with it, or to figure out how to keep going and operate at a higher level,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time, she decided that “higher level” didn’t mean working harder. It meant “reflecting on my values, starting a meditation practice, keeping my fitness going, and not caring too much about what other people think,” says Jurich. She was able to let go, minding public perceptions less as her company slowly but surely regained its footing and earned back consumer trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, from their all-time low in share prices, something surprising happened. “The WSJ article was an interesting inflection point for the company,” says Fenster, “because after it caused the stock to bottom, momentum started to come back.” Over the next two years, Sunrun’s stock rose roughly 400%, signaling to the world that Sunrun had staying power.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Just before Thomas Edison’s death, in that same 1931 conversation with Henry Ford, he said, “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” Today, Jurich feels closer than ever to paying out her hero’s bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, Sunrun has deployed 5.7 gigawatts of total solar capacity, making it one of the world’s largest sources of networked solar energy. In 2019, Sunrun overtook Tesla’s SolarCity as the leading installer of residential rooftop solar panels in the U.S. “We’re at this inflection point where consumers have wrapped their minds around solar power, and they accept it,” says Jurich, who stepped down as CEO of Sunrun in 2021, but remains the company’s Co-Executive Chair.</p>



<p>Part of that acceptance comes from a greater understanding of climate urgency. It comes from legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other clean energy initiatives, reinstates generous tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels. And it comes from increasingly affordable solar hardware, a trend the founders predicted at Sunrun’s outset (today, solar panel prices are down nine times since 2006). An additional factor is technological advancement: “One of the challenges with solar was always that you couldn’t store it,” says Jurich, “but now, batteries have completely changed that. You can generate, store and distribute energy to the grid without building new plants, or even solar farms. You can just use existing roofs!” To that end, in 2020 Sunrun funded and helped found Lunar Energy, an independent company focused on building the next-generation home battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade and a half working in clean energy has made Jurich a realist about the magnitude of her company’s undertakings. Which is why, more than ever, she’s looking to others to share the burden, and in part why she returned to her alma mater in March 2023. This was a chance to speak to a new generation of potential clean energy leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do worry that the United States broadly has lost the skillset to develop large-scale infrastructure,” Jurich said toward the end of her keynote. “But I encourage all of you to help. I’ve already talked to a couple of you who have great business ideas around trying to make labor more efficient, making large-scale construction more efficient. And I do think we will get there.”</p>



<p>By “there,” Jurich means a sustainable future of clean energy abundance. And on a personal level, she hopes for a future with more balance, filled with more of the hard-earned equanimity on display at the GSB climate summit. “One of the things I’ve come to appreciate in life is that in order to be most effective, you need periods of both intensity and periods of rest and renewal,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest, as always with Jurich, is a relative concept. She’s Co-Executive Chair of Sunrun, Chair of Lunar Energy, and she’s launching a women’s health institute and writing a novel—imagining different worlds while working to improve our own. But at the very least, “I’m no longer trying to do it all at once,” she says. That simply wouldn’t be sustainable.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 4th December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-December the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis. </p>



<p>From January, Committee members will receive a nominal stipend of $650 per calendar month from ZF (paid as shielded ZEC). This stipend may be subject to review, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces.</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

 The Horizen DAO increases community involvement in decision-making for improvements to the protocol and ecosystem. 



<p>The Horizen community is excited to announce the Horizen DAO is now open for all $ZEN holders to participate in governance and take an active role in the direction of the project!</p>



<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. A strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is informed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/guiding_values">Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 How to Participate in Voting 



<p>Voting for the Horizen DAO is done on Horizen EON, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain including the $ZEN you have staked with the Horizen EON validators. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold,&nbsp; the more voting power you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.jpg"></a> 


<p></p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours. For more information about the process of voting, please start <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing the Horizen DAO Special Council 



<p>What is the Horizen DAO Special Council?</p>

<p>Despite the many alternative flavors of NoSQL databases that have caught the attention of developers over the years, relational databases remain the de facto standard for storing and retrieving digital information. Every technology worker from the back-office IT personnel to the modern Web developer has been trained to use, manage, and query relational databases. SQL, the language used to interact with relational databases, is the lingua franca of data management. Yet, while blockchains can be thought of as decentralized databases, they are not geared for the same storage and query tasks as relational databases, making them too slow, too expensive, and decidedly foreign for the average developer to interact with. This creates a paradoxical and undesirable situation in which developers of decentralized technologies choose the path of least resistance for their data storage needs: traditional, centralized, relational databases.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>, a multi-chain relational database network that brings SQL to smart contracts. Using this foundation, Tableland is developing Basin — a product for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) projects. With a focus on user-friendly tools and cryptographic data formats, Basin is designed to make data secure and usable for generations to come. Provenance tracking ensures a transparent data lineage, while Filecoin guarantees decentralized data accessibility and permanence. With Basin, Tableland is <a href="https://mirror.xyz/tableland.eth/UJMDvy8vAqekOGpPmspRGzdl2-osjPeGVaIv2Lv4Oh0">solving a critical pain point </a>for DePIN projects by creating a more secure, efficient, and transparent decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Tableland launched their community in Q2 of 2022 with 3000 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/tableland-rigs">utilitarian NFTs</a> with their metadata stored in relational tables in Tableland itself, showcasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAc0xDyQDZbo-PnGBbv1aBTVMVwd4qncL">tangible use case</a> for the product. The NFTs sold out in under 5 minutes. Since then, they’ve launched on Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and other L2&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As crypto continues to grow and quickly evolve, developers will lean toward tools and technologies that make them more productive. Tried and true, widely adopted patterns such as relational tables and SQL will continue to play an important foundational role, even as applications become decentralized. With growing momentum behind DePIN projects, Tableland can position itself as a foundational building block for a world where crypto-economic incentives are used to coordinate physical infrastructure. We are excited to be backing the entire Tableland team on their&nbsp;mission.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.4.0.</p>



<p>This release includes support for mining RPC methods in all release builds, bundles the Zcash verification parameters into the zebrad binary, and updates Rust dependencies to match the zcashd 5.7.0 release.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some notable improvements from our previous release include <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7772">better recovery from brief network interruptions</a>, and mitigation of potential network and verification denial of service and performance issues. We have restored our macOS tests in CI, and now support macOS on a best-effort basis.</p>



<p>We have also changed our documentation website URL, and are considering deprecating some Docker image tags from release 1.5.0 onwards.</p>



 Mining RPCs in Production Builds 



<p>Since the 1.4.0 release, Zebra’s mining RPCs are <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7740">available in release builds</a> so that any Zebra instance can be used by a solo miner or mining pool. With this release, we are providing production level support to 12 mining related RPCs, including getblocktemplate,&nbsp; submitblock, getmininginfo, getnetworksolps, [z_]validateaddress and getblocksubsidy. Do <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">let us know</a> if your mining pool requires any extra RPC methods or fields!</p>



 Zcash Parameters in zebrad Binary 



<p>zebrad now bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly into its binary. This increases the binary size by a few megabytes, but reduces the size of the Docker image by around 600 MB because the parameters don’t contain the Sprout proving key anymore. We have also removed the “zebrad download” command as it is no longer necessary. If you have upgraded zebrad to 1.4.0 or later, and zcashd to 5.7.0 or later, you can delete the zk-SNARK parameter files to save approximately 700 MB disk space. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a>.</p>



 macOS Support 



<p>We have restored support for macOS x86_64 on a best-effort basis. macOS builds and some tests run in Zebra’s CI. You can check out the list of Zebra <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/supported-platforms.html">supported platforms</a> for more details on the different tiers of support we provide for the listed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Deprecation Warnings 



<p>In an effort to remove redundancies and simplify things, we would like to share the following deprecation warnings.</p>



 DockerHub Image Tags 



<p>Zebra currently publishes 11 DockerHub tags for each new release. We want to reduce the number of DockerHub tags we publish in a future minor Zebra release. Based on usage and user feedback, in release 1.5.0 we could stop publishing:</p>



 
 The 1 tag, which updates each release until NU6 



 The 1.x tag, which updates each patch release until the next minor release 



 The 1.x.y tag, which is the same as v1.x.y 



 The sha-xxxxxxx tag, which is the same as v1.x.y (for production releases) 
 



<p>We also want to standardise experimental image tags to -experimental, rather than .experimental.</p>



<p>This means that, for release 1.5.0 onwards, we are considering only publishing the following tags:</p>



 
 latest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 latest-experimental (a new tag) 



 V1.5.0 



 v1.5.0-experimental 
 



<p>Please let us know if you need any other tags by <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">opening a GitHub ticket</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend using the “latest” tag to always get the most recent Zebra release.</p>



 Documentation Website URL Change 



<p>We have replaced the API documentation which was previously available on the doc.zebra.zfnd.org website with <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>. Zebra’s API documentation can now be found on:<br></p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>, which renders documentation for the public API of the latest crate releases; 



 <a href="https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/">doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org</a>, which renders documentation for the internal API on the main branch. 
 



<p>This API documentation is in addition to the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/">Zebra Book</a> user documentation, which is still available as usual.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra-1-4-0-release/">Zebra 1.4.0 Release</a> appeared first on <a href="https://zfnd.org">Zcash Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>Bootstrap Org, the nonprofit parent organization of Electric Coin Co., has added long-time Zcash community contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/michlai007">Michelle Lai</a> to its Board of Directors. Michelle joins members Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Zaki Manian, and Zooko Wilcox.</p>



<p>“Michelle has worked hard to support Zcash and the cause of financial freedom for years,” Fairless said. “We love her insight and imagination on tech product use cases.”</p>



<p>A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2007), Michelle has spent half her career in crypto and half in financial services, including stints at Anchorage Digital, Bitpay, Credit Suisse, a private equity buyout fund, and as a consultant to CEOs of large financial services companies. She’s performed a wide range of roles, including COO, BD and product roles, and says she most enjoys solving tricky business problems and managing high-stakes negotiations.</p>



<p>She is passionate about crypto-related technology as “a means of achieving a fairer and freer world.”</p>



<p>In Michelle’s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My journey with Zcash started in 2018 when I worked at a crypto asset custodian and we were looking to support $ZEC. Since then, I’ve fallen further down the privacy money rabbit hole, becoming a member of the first grant organization in 2021 (the Zcash Open Major Grants committee) and then staying involved as someone who actively advocates for privacy and freedom applications in crypto.</p>



<p>My vision of tomorrow’s Zcash is one that earns its place back as a leader of privacy tech in crypto so that we can keep supporting the universal values of privacy and freedom. We did it once with the best talent in ZK and engineering, and we can do it again.</p>



<p>Today, as the crypto privacy community faces several challenges, including market sentiment and regulatory onslaught, I join the Bootstrap team to navigate the turbulent waters we find ourselves in. I have had professional experience in turnaround situations and hope to bring that to bear in this new role on the board of Bootstrap.</p>



<p>The road ahead is strewn with both extremely difficult questions and compelling opportunities for all ZK and privacy projects, including us. It will take a grand effort for us to arrive at a new horizon, but this is the moment where we dig in, gear up, and keep marching on in service of humanity.</p>



<p>If you have ideas and opinions from anywhere in the crypto community, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.</p>

   The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities.

ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

<p>A busy month just went by! Here’s everything we did and what’s on the horizon for Panther.</p><p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>October has been a productive month for us, and we’re excited to share our progress in many areas as we work towards Panther v1. <br>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 2 <p>The latest development sprints were focused on solving a bug related to an external library used for Stage 2, an external factor that has caused a delay. <br><br>Our Incentivized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Testnet Stage 2 </a>is now officially underway, bringing a wave of features and rewards to the Panther community. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Stage 2</a> is critical as it puts our user interaction and reward mechanisms to the test, laying the groundwork for Panther Protocol’s privacy-preserving features. Our protocol’s privacy is intricately tied to unique game-theoretical features that encourage active user participation, making this stage a pivotal moment for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Stage 2 includes creating and activating your Panther Account, finding your onboarding bonuses, and claiming your vouchers. <br>Your participation and feedback are crucial as we move closer to our v1 release. Thank you for being a part of Testnet Stage 2, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts through our community channels!</p> V1 redesign <p>Over the past weeks, we have done some UX refinements too. The focus was reviewing what we have learned from the previous design iterations and expanding on it further while also elevating the user experience. Another objective was to revamp and update the onboarding process for more seamless account setup.</p><p>You can take a look at a quick preview below:</p> Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi Protocol <p>Just in case you missed our last update, on October 2nd we hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqKVqmnqaaxB?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a great conversation via Twitter Spaces</a> with our partners at PureFi.

<p>Now and through the end of January 2024, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) objectives center on delivering an improved ZEC user experience, primarily through the Zashi wallet. Across teams — Product; Engineering; PeopleOps; and Communications and Advocacy — ECC employees are focused on work that either directly contributes to the wallet or in some way makes ZEC and Zashi adoption more viable.</p>



<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

 Intro <p>Panther community,</p><p>As we conclude Testnet Stage 1 with a number of learnings and upgrades, we are thrilled to announce the commencement of Stage 2 of our Testnet.</p><p>This second phase is designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. As Panther’s privacy is built upon unique game-theoretical features fostering user activity, Stage 2 is key for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Stage 2. It comprises three main categories of reward mechanisms: Rewards, Recharge pool, and Vouchers.</p> 1. Rewards <p>Rewards or protocol reward points (PRPs) are created as an incentive for users to join and continuously use Panther Protocol. This implies converting the ‘Available PRP’ to ZKP which is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided AMM</a> (automated market maker) pool. It is one-sided because users can only convert their PRP to ZKP and not vice versa. The exchange rate of this conversion is dynamic in nature and depends on several factors, including the amount of ZKP in the pool and the total available PRP held by users at any given point in time, among other factors. For details on how Panther Rewards works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p><p>There are two types of PRPs:</p>  Available PRPs which can be exchanged to zZKP (ZKP within the MASP) immediately.  Pending PRP is the accrued rewards that are not realized yet because a user has not spent those UTXOs. To make it available, the UTXO's should be included in transactions that a user performs within Panther.<br>   2. Recharge Pool  <p>The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol. </p> 3. Vouchers <p>Vouchers are a reward mechanism that can be used by the Protocol to incentivize certain functions that have to be triggered by Users. We refer to them as Admin functions. Those could include but are not limited to functions such as:</p>  Recharging Reward Pool  Trigger conversion of token&nbsp;  <p>Note: the onboarding reward voucher issued atThe voucher this Stage is only for testing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a new account is created and activated successfully, a user gets (a) 100 zZKP onto his zAccount and (b) 1 voucher which is worth 500 PRP. This is valid for all new users and the users who have created accounts during Stage 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: it can take up to a minute to get the voucher screen updated to let a user find his onboarding voucher.</p><p>The voucher has a stable predefined value which can be different depending on the type of performed action (onboarding = PRP 500, triggering recharge the reward pool = PRP 100). The voucher is nominated in PRP.&nbsp; To get those PRP, one should claim a voucher - it is about submitting a transaction “burn a voucher - get the corresponding PRP”.&nbsp;</p><p>Vouchers are grouped per type of action performed. Stage 2 will have two such groups - (1) Onboarding bonus voucher and (2) Recharge bonus voucher. Vouchers can be claimed by group only, which means a user gets the total PRP for all vouchers in a given group. When claiming is completed successfully, a user will see an updated balance on his (a) Dashboard → Panther Rewards Points section → Available PRP amount and (b) Rewards page → Redeem PRP screen → Available PRP section. &nbsp;</p> STAGE 2 TESTING <p>As we progress through our Testnet stages, we want to express our gratitude for your continued support, feedback, and enthusiasm. To start testing Stage 2, please visit Panther docs <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> to get the most updated test link and follow the steps:</p>  New user creates and activates Panther Account (existing users go through the same step but the onboarding process bypasses the KYC verification) - see <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">the Stage 1 functionality and instructions</a>.&nbsp;  <p>Note 1.1: both (a) new accounts and (b) previously created during Stage 1 Panther accounts both are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>When your account is successfully created, you will find a success screen:</p>  Find the first part of your onboarding bonus on your dashboard. This bonus is in the form of Panther Account zZKP which is expected to fuel all types of transactions within Panther such as paying Protocol fees, paying to Relayer for gasless transactions, paying Miner’s fee etc. Users are expected to maintain a sufficient balance of this account in zZKP using transfer functions available in later stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Find the second part of your onboarding bonus - an onboarding voucher,, which equals 500 PRPs. The voucher should be claimed to get the PRPs into your account. To find the second part, please follow the Rewards menu item =&gt; Vouchers screen =&gt; Onboarding Reward Vouchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Note 3.1: It takes time to detect and reflect the corresponding group of vouchers so there can be a case when the screen is empty before the data is updated:</p><p>Note 3.2: It takes time to make your voucher available for claiming, as the zAccount UTXO must be mined in advance. The UI will reflect your bonus voucher. Please be aware that claiming the voucher may take a few minutes in the test environment (due to lower mining activity which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The claim button is disabled until claiming is available.&nbsp;</p>  Claim your voucher via the Vouchers screen functionality. After Voucher is claimed successfully (Voucher screen will go back to the state mentioned in Note 3.1 upon a successfully claimed transaction), you can find the corresponding amount of PRP on the Redeem PRP screen, Available PRP field&nbsp;  <p>Note 4.1: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes to display the PRP available for redeeming (due to lower mining activity in the test environment, which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The button is disabled until Redeem is successful.&nbsp;</p>  Redeem your PRP from the Redeem PRP screen to get your zZKP. This zZKP will now be available in your Private zAssets section and zAssets Summary section balance in the Dashboard screen.  <p>6. Recharge the reward pool of PRP/zZKP AMM:</p><p>Step 1: Go to the Rewards page and click on recharge pool.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to the Goerli network. The recharge triggers the Vesting contract on the Goerli testnet (Ethereum on production). This requires users to switch networks if they are not on Goerli. This can be done using either in-dApp functionality (Switch Network option) or via Network Management modal (when you are already connected to the product), or via MetaMask functionality. </p><p>Step 3: Check available $ZKP for recharge. Checking that there is enough $ZKP for recharge helps make the decision to trigger the function. The Recharge button will be active only when the ‘Recharge size’ field is non-zero, however, it is not recommended to trigger this function for a smaller recharge amount. </p><p>Also, a zero or a low ‘Recharge size’ means that the recharge was done by other users.&nbsp;</p><p>Step 4: Check and top-up your Goerli ETH balance - this is required to pay for gas to trigger this functionality. To get a test Goerli ETH use the faucet e.g. <a href="https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/</a>.<br></p><p>Step 5: Complete the recharge-triggering transaction on the Goerli side by pushing the Recharge Reward Pool button.</p><p>Note 6.1: The recharge executes through bridging functionality which moves $tZKP from Goerli (Ethereum) to Mumbai (Polygon). This operation is dependent on the bridge and may take up to 20 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 6: Check the updated current recharge ratio field. Recharging the pool means injecting more rewards into the Reward AMM, hence, it impacts the ZKP:PRP ratio. The new ratio can be viewed here: </p><p>Note 6.2: Smaller recharge size value will make an insignificant impact on the rate. Testnet allows for multiple recharge to test functionality and bridging. However, it is advised to propose a maximum of once per day recharge in production which will also have a positive impact on the rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 7: Check the Vouchers screen. The protocol rewards users for performing the recharge function. Switch to the Mumbai network to view and claim your Recharge Reward Voucher.</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks not just an advancement in the protocol's capabilities, but gets us a step closer to our v1 release.

  Partnering with Factory: Autonomous AI for All  <p>Matan and Eno are building fully-autonomous programming “Droids” to unlock creativity within and beyond engineering teams.</p>   
	By Shaun Maguire	 



Published November 2, 2023
  



 
<p>Like any VC partner, I get a lot of cold emails. But when Matan Grinberg’s note appeared in my inbox in March, it got my attention right away. Just from the subject line—”Chat with a fellow former hep-th physicist”—I knew we shared a background in the same tiny sub-field of high-energy physics theory. And as I read on and Googled a bit, I discovered that what he humbly described as having “worked with Juan” actually referred to co-authoring a paper with Juan Maldacena—a professor at the elite Institute for Advanced Study and arguably the world’s best-known living physicist—when Matan was still an undergrad.</p>



<p>I wrote back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>A few days later, Matan and I went for a walk. He’d been working at the intersection of physics and AI at Berkeley and pursuing a PhD, but was considering a transition from academia to a start-up—and though he hadn’t yet settled on a specific idea, it was clear that he wanted to build a company. It was also clear that he had a high EQ to match his exceptional background. I encouraged him to take the leap.</p>



<p>He started iterating, and within a week was working on the autonomous coding project&nbsp; that would become <a href="https://www.factory.ai/">Factory</a>—and working with a co-founder who, as it turned out, was in Sequoia’s orbit as well.</p>



<p>Eno Reyes, who grew up in Atlanta and first met Matan at Princeton, had recently accepted a job as an ML engineer at Hugging Face and moved to San Francisco’s Mission District—just a block from where his grandparents had settled down and set up a restaurant after immigrating from Puebla, Mexico. Shortly before he and Matan reunited at a hackathon and started building Factory, the Sequoia team met Eno at AI Ascent, a small gathering of the leading minds in AI that we held in March. Just a year out of college and a few months into his new role, he had already impressed enough to join CEO Clem Delangue at the event.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno’s idea was to build on the historic momentum in AI and unlock even more creativity in software development—and not just among engineers. In the face of a persistent tech talent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent">shortage</a>, with many Fortune 500 companies still running infrastructure built decades ago simply because they don’t have enough people to update it, these two co-founders understood that handing off time-consuming tasks like code review, documentation, testing, project management and debugging to fully autonomous “Droids,” or agents, would indeed be a game-changer for engineering teams. But they also understood that for every software developer, there are another 100 people who don’t have highly technical backgrounds—but do have great ideas that software could bring to life.</p>



<p>It is a next-generation vision for AI, and just a year ago, it would have been too ambitious. But Matan and Eno’s timing is perfect—and they are perfectly suited to the task, not only because of their deep domain expertise in ML, AI and physics, but also because they move at lightning speed. Once they’d landed on an idea, it took them a day to sign a term sheet, incorporate the company and start to build.</p>



<p>Six months later, Factory is delivering value to early customers that include two public companies and two decacorns. Meanwhile, Matan and Eno have more complex functionality on the roadmap, and they are <a href="https://www.factory.ai/careers">growing</a> an amazing team to build it. It has been a joy to welcome them to the Sequoia community, and we look forward to supporting them over the months and years to come as they work toward a world where programming capacity no longer limits our collective creativity.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

      Battling the Trojan Horse in Open Source         
	By Ananya Menon	 



Published November 1, 2023
        Chainguard’s Dan Lorenc is taking on software supply chain security.      



 
<p>Dan Lorenc was at a restaurant in downtown Austin with friends when he received an unusual text. It was the summer of 2021, and the message was from his former coworker, Matt Moore. Lorenc was a software engineer at Google, and he and Moore had worked together on its cyber-security team. The past year had been especially challenging, as the security industry as a whole had faced a reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, SolarWinds reported that its network monitoring platform had been hacked by operatives suspected of working for Russian intelligence. The attackers had planted malware in SolarWinds’ code, which allowed them to access the data of thousands of SolarWinds’ clients, from Microsoft to the U.S. government. The hack exposed a critical flaw in the security of software supply chains. Just as in real-world manufacturing, software is assembled from components created by developers all over the world. At some point during SolarWinds’ development process, malicious actors inserted malware into two software updates, which were then installed by customers all around the world. SolarWinds’ data breach was a wake-up call. Without verifying the integrity of software at every stage of its lifespan this type of hack could and would happen again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore had left Google earlier in the year, and Lorenc had called him every month since, hoping to convince him to return. Moore was one of the finest software engineers Lorenc knew, and if anyone could find a solution to supply chain security, it was him. That night, Moore’s text to Lorenc said he was ready to get back to work—but not at Google. “Let’s start a new company,” Moore texted. Lorenc didn’t need to think twice. He was in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, Lorenc put in notice at Google, bought a new laptop and began work on Chainguard, a company focused on software supply chain security. Although technically the company was born that night in Austin, Lorenc had been preparing for this moment for years.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The late 2000s ushered in a fundamental shift in the way tech companies approached security, as alarm around new types of digital threats grew. In what became known as Operation Aurora in 2009, Chinese hackers attempted to access and change source code in a series of attacks against companies like Google and Adobe. In the Snowden leaks in 2013, a contracted employee for the NSA hacked its database and leaked classified documents.</p>



<p>Lorenc joined Google in 2012, working on the company’s efforts to secure its own code and protect its databases from external or internal attackers. In 2016, after he and his team had implemented Google’s new, refined security system, Lorenc shifted focus to work on Minikube, a tool for open-source Kubernetes container management. This was Lorenc’s first time working predominantly with open-source code—code that’s freely available for anyone to download, modify and exchange. As Lorenc was building and shipping Minikube to users all over the world, he realized he could have easily slipped malware into the software. The container’s label would read “Minikube,” but few would take time to comb through the thousands of lines of code in every directory of the program to determine exactly what was inside. Proper verification was something that would take an engineer days, weeks or even months to complete—bandwidth they almost certainly didn’t have, and therefore a task that would fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>Lorenc was terrified. Wasn’t it just a matter of time before someone packaged up open-source software that secretly contained code that could put an entire company and its community at risk? “I realized how much damage I myself could do, and how easily,” Lorenc says. “And if I could do that, so could anyone.”</p>



<p>The concern over how to protect software from hidden malware isn’t a new one. In 1984, an engineer named Ken Thompson wrote an article called “Reflections on Trusting Trust” that demonstrated how easy it was to hide Trojan horse viruses in a computer program. Thompson’s point was that you could never fully trust any code you hadn’t written yourself. According to Lorenc, 90-98% of code used today is open source. Most companies focus resources on making sure the tiny amount of code they write themselves is secure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. “The 2% of proprietary code is the only part you see over the water, but beneath that is the 98% of code you’re not responsible for yourself,” Lorenc says. “In some ways, open-source code is amazing. It’s enabled all this innovation and velocity and reuse. But it’s also scary because that means 98% of your code is written by strangers on the internet. Which is great when people are well-intentioned, but not everyone on the internet is nice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite evidence of the risks open-source code can pose to a company’s security, Lorenc learned that managing these risks wasn’t something widely prioritized. When he spoke with engineers at other software companies, supply chain security wasn’t a top concern. “Being a software engineer is like playing Whac-A-Mole. There are so many issues you have to deal with on a constant basis that you can’t spend time on preventive measures,” Lorenc says. “You only pay attention to a problem when it rears its head. At this point, there hadn’t been large instances of open-source vulnerability being a problem, so no one seemed to think much about it.”</p>



<p>No one but Lorenc. That is, until December 2020.</p>

<p>Lorenc was at home when he received a news alert about the SolarWinds attack. Thousands of companies were reporting their data, networks and systems compromised—exactly what Lorenc had been worried about. He stood and walked to his car. Lorenc’s house in Austin was close to SolarWinds’ headquarters. He drove there and took a picture of himself in front of its sign. It would serve as a reminder of how important it was that he continue to raise a red flag about the software supply chain. But it was also a moment of validation—he had seen this coming, and he felt vindicated that his concern was justified. Maybe now people would take the problem seriously.</p>



<p>Although Google was not affected by the breach, Lorenc and his coworkers were intimately familiar with the type of attack that SolarWinds fell victim to because they had spent years building internal systems at Google to prevent it. Dan and team would end up working closely with engineers from SolarWinds to help them do the same. (The following year, when Chainguard held a conference to announce its launch, a SolarWinds engineer spoke about how instrumental Lorenc’s team had been in designing its new security system.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question of how to entirely prevent these attacks remained: When programs are built on hundreds of thousands of lines of open-source code, how do you ensure that every line is as advertised and secure? It’s a problem so large in scale that it feels almost impossible to figure out. Luckily, that’s kind of Lorenc’s thing.</p>



 



<p>Lorenc’s love of solving difficult problems began when he was a kid, fixing up damaged stock cars with his grandfather. They’d spend hours after school and on weekends tinkering together in a small garage. Once the cars were up and running, Lorenc’s grandfather (and after he got his license, Lorenc himself) would race them in community events. When the cars would break down, they would take inventory of the problems and fix them up again. This was the part Lorenc loved most—looking at the engine as a system of parts, understanding how each one functioned and then using that knowledge to fix what wasn’t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In college, Lorenc pursued mechanical engineering. During his junior year he took a programming class and was hooked. “I was building stuff, but it was a lot faster,” Lorenc says. “You didn’t have to order parts and wait a week for them to ship. You could build those components yourself with a laptop, anywhere.” Software engineering offered the same thrill as fixing up old cars. “It’s that loop of trying to solve a problem, and then either seeing it work or seeing it fail miserably and getting to debug it live. You keep going and get real-time feedback until you solve it. That’s why I liked the computer world. I could do more of that in a lot less time.”</p>



<p>One of the first pieces of code he wrote was a program to solve Rubik’s cubes. The program didn’t work—it kept running without ever arriving at a solution. One of his peers laughed when he saw the code and showed Lorenc how to fix it. It was an important moment. “That’s when I realized, with programming, there’s always a solution,” Lorenc says. “It might not be obvious at first, but it’s there. You just have to find it.”</p>



<p>Lorenc began working at Microsoft soon after he graduated college. He remembers the environment as rewarding, but also stressful. There was a weekend when he and his colleagues were working overtime for an upcoming release, and during a particularly tense moment, his manager pantomimed a Monty Python sketch. Lorenc and his team broke into fits of laughter, and the mood instantly brightened. This left an impression on Lorenc: the need for a work environment that balanced hard work with humor.</p>
 



Chainguard founders Kim Lewandowski, Ville Aikas, Dan Lorenc and Matt Moore.



 
<p>“You’re doing what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogomil Balkansky, Chainguard’s partner at Sequoia, sat across the table from Lorenc and Moore, not sure he was hearing them right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months since Moore’s initial text to Lorenc at the restaurant in Austin, Chainguard had officially launched, and its founders had begun building its product and seeking out investors. Lorenc says starting a company at the beginning of 2022 wasn’t easy. Inflation was rising and a wave of layoffs at tech companies meant Lorenc would pitch Chainguard to software engineers—potential customers—one day, only to learn the following week that they had been laid off. After months of meetings, they finally gained traction. The need for supply chain security tools was too great, and companies realized they couldn’t handle the job alone.</p>



<p>Lorenc and the Chainguard team first met with Sequoia in the spring of 2022. Balkansky was impressed by Chainguard’s initial product in development, Chainguard Enforce, a program that scans containers and produces an itemized list of the code inside. Engineers can then review the list for malware and loopholes that might make the containers vulnerable to hackers. And so Balkansky was surprised to learn, just days after Sequoia’s partnership with Chainguard was finalized, that, according to Lorenc, Chainguard was in the midst of building out a far more ambitious product: Chainguard Images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computing, a “container image” refers to a static collection of executable code. Chainguard Images would be a library of these files, made from open-source code that Chainguard engineers would verify, sign, patch and secure. With Chainguard Images, customers would no longer have to opt for open-source code they’d found on the internet and hope for the best. Instead, they could select an image from Chainguard’s library and feel confident that their code was as advertised and could not be edited by bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a massive undertaking, which explained Balkansky’s incredulity when he first learned of it. To execute Chainguard Images, Lorenc and his team would first have to build a Linux distribution, an operating system on which Chainguard Images could run. Balkansky had worked with other companies who had endeavored to do this but hadn’t succeeded; he knew it was an incredibly complex task that could take years to complete, and even then there was no guarantee it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky wasn’t the only one who was skeptical. Other software companies with thousands of engineers struggled to believe that Chainguard, with only 25 engineers, could not only build a Linux distribution, but also comb through and verify numerous libraries of code. “Yes, it seemed impossible,” Lorenc says. “Yes, just based on the sheer numbers, the lines of code we would need to pore over and adjust to make secure, it was daunting. Everyone else looked at it and saw it as too hard of a problem, too massive to actually solve. But it seemed obvious it was something we needed to do.” Lorenc shrugs, “To me, it didn’t seem impossible, it just seemed hard. And I’m okay with hard.”</p>



<p>“Hard” paid off. Lorenc and his team spent a year working tirelessly on Chainguard Images. To motivate and energize his team during long days and even longer nights and weekends, Lorenc pulled from the lesson learned at Microsoft, making sure that hours of focus were interspersed with jokes, lighthearted stories and plenty of room for laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky was sitting in a conference room in early 2023 when Lorenc let him know Chainguard Images was live. Balkansky’s first thought: “Pretty damn impressive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Chainguard has rebuilt around 80% of the open-source code most companies use, and because Chainguard is the only company offering access to this type of library, they’re racing to keep up with demand for the remaining 20%. Chainguard also takes custom orders—if a company needs a certain container specific to their product verified, Chainguard will take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As time consuming and challenging as building out Chainguard Images continues to be, Lorenc recognizes its payoff for users. It’s akin to building a house—yes, you can use cheap and readily available materials for construction and deal with a rickety staircase or a toilet that won’t flush later, but Chainguard’s philosophy is that it’s worth the extra time, money and labor to start with high-quality products. Lorenc believes in taking every measure possible, no matter how complicated it might be, when it comes to keeping software and its users safe.</p>



 



<p>Working in security necessitates a certain amount of paranoia—the fear of what you’ve missed, of an unseen crack or fatal flaw, is relentless. Lorenc’s use of humor to assuage the high-risk, high-anxiety environment has paid off in more ways than one. He regularly makes his own memes, many of which have gone viral within software development communities. One meme shows Ken from the Barbie movie, with the caption “My job is just CVEs.” (CVEs meaning “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.”) Another depicts Ned Stark from “Game of Thrones,” with a caption that reads “Brace yourselves. VEX is coming.” (VEX is an open platform for sharing information about software vulnerabilities.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorenc’s goal in creating memes was originally to provide levity and form a community with people working in security, so he was surprised when his social media presence ended up being one of Chainguard’s most successful marketing strategies. Lorenc regularly sees his memes making rounds on LinkedIn and X, formerly Twitter. Chainguard’s TikToks are also popular among engineers, many of which feature Lorenc, in his trademark backward baseball cap, speaking to viewers as though he was guiding a friend through a casual tutorial on software security. Lorenc attributes the love for Chainguard’s social media to his users’ desire for authenticity. He’s not some faceless CEO of a corporation; he’s a software engineer, just like his customers, and he speaks their language. It’s not a traditional avenue for a security company to market itself, but Chainguard has always done things its own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his numerous duties as CEO, Lorenc’s favorite part of the job is still working with other engineers to solve complex and granular problems. He thinks Chainguard was able to attract some of the best engineers in the industry precisely because the company has such lofty goals. “The people on our team were drawn to the difficulty of our mission,” he says. “Smart people want to work on hard problems.” Often when people encounter what seems like an impossible series of problems, they get overwhelmed, but not Lorenc. He knows every inch of this engine, and working on it part by part, he’s confident he can get it to run.</p>

 Introducing PIVX Perspectives:<br>Engaging conversations with remarkable contributors to the PIVX community. Get ready for insightful dialogues about PIVX’s journey and future. Stay tuned for inspiring stories from various individuals who have played an important role in the PIVX ecosystem. <p>Our first guest is Jeffrey, PIVX Business Development Lead and a key driving force behind the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Can you tell us a little about yourself please?<br>Hey everyone, my name is Jeffrey, I currently live in South Africa but I have also lived in Indonesia and Singapore. I’m an extremely passionate and energetic person when it comes to digital finance and privacy, advocating for secure and efficient financial solutions in a digital age. My academic journey took me to Singapore where I completed my Bachelors in IT with Distinction. During this time is where I became deeply interested in the world of digital finance, as Singapore is a hub for&nbsp;fintech.</p><p>I’ve been a proud member of the PIVX family since early 2017, joining right around the time of the rebrand. It’s been a fortunate journey, allowing me to witness the remarkable growth of the project and actively contribute to its&nbsp;success.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?<br>My cryptocurrency journey goes quite far back and is actually thanks to a stranger, I was part of a social group where people share discounts or deals on servers. Someone wanted to pay on this particular website for a linux VPS but they wanted PayPal. So in return he sent me my first ever Bitcoin and I paid using PayPal. I believe this was back in late 2012 or early 2013. The wallet at the time I used was called MultiBit if I recall correctly. During this time I also experienced so many issues with online payment methods especially since I am from South Africa and many at the time did not provide their services or had lengthy and often privacy invading verification processes. Bitcoin was so fast, I remember being like wow I received this already and didn’t need to register or provide any of my information. My passion grew and I loved superior technology. Sadly I did end up using it as my main payment method for online goods and services lol so could not really enjoy the extreme growth over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>When and why did you choose to get involved with PIVX?<br>Cryptocurrency was starting to go really viral in 2017, It was at this time myself and some online friends were all looking to invest and buy more. The best way to find new cryptocurrencies to invest in at this time was to browse BitcoinTalk. I was lucky enough to find the PIVX post in 2017 on the forum. I read it was a coin dedicated to privacy which piqued my interest. The forum post also provided a Slack invitation link so PIVX ended up being the first cryptocurrency that I joined the official community for. So I guess initially my first finding out about PIVX was for investment purposes however the community was so helpful. I learned so much in just a week there amongst all the “Purple Rain” showers of PIVX tips flying out to everyone. I dedicated so much time that I ended up assisting with the support team by providing technical assistance as well as hosting calls to show people how to trade&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market?<br>For me it’s the human touch. PIVX is the only community where anyone can just join in and discuss openly and share ideas with developers, graphics designers, moderators and others from many backgrounds. PIVX may be a privacy coin but it’s extremely human-centric. What I love most is the aim to redefine privacy to its root. That privacy is not for criminals but simply a human right to protect oneself from malicious parties. PIVX makes this privacy option dubbed “SHIELD” completely optional therefore giving the user complete control over how they spend their PIV. PIVX also is a DAO with a treasury guaranteeing constant development and growth therefore PIVX in my opinion has a stable future and is here to secure your digital financial footprint.</p><p>How do you envision PIVX’s role in the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies?<br>PIVX has an ambassador program as well as community members that are introducing PIVX for the first time to many people, many of which will be their first ever crypto and therefore the beginning of their cryptocurrency journey. PIVX sets a benchmark through their meticulous development process that ensures the safety of their blockchain and privacy protocol.</p><p>This unwavering commitment to user safety and the protection of their assets sets a noteworthy example for other cryptocurrencies to follow almost like a benchmark. By establishing such high standards, PIVX contributes to the creation of a safer and more secure environment for newcomers, ultimately fostering increased adoption.</p><p>Can you share any success stories or notable achievements during your time at PIVX?<br>Honestly my biggest achievement in my cryptocurrency career with PIVX is getting feedback from our community on their experiences with PIVX and seeing how positive it is. I work as the lead of business development, I secure new listings and integrations. When I come across fellow Pivians enthusiastically sharing how they’ve started accepting PIVX through platforms like NowPayments, booked flights on Travala using PIVX, or found joy in trading on exchanges such as WhiteBit and LBank, it represents the pinnacle of success for me. More recently, learning how PIVX is enabling our community to make a difference by assisting families in need through the purchase of gift cards on Coinsbee is both humbling and inspiring. It’s not just about me, it’s about the collective impact my decisions make and how they can help others. I hope all my work and achievements combined empowers our community and fellow PIVX holders to explore new possibilities with&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>How do you approach building strong relationships with exchange platforms and integrating PIVX into their trading systems?<br>I begin this first with market research, identifying areas that we lack. For example an exchange that doesn’t require KYC or perhaps provides GBP withdraws to a bank, Once I establish a decent list of exchanges that provide our needs I proceed to contact&nbsp;them.</p><p>The most important thing is a mutual understanding of the objective. Once we establish that we would like a relationship that is more than just trading PIVX but actually engaging with both communities and building together then I can proceed to discuss listings. Exchanges and cryptocurrencies work hand in hand in securing the future of Crypto. Not everyone supports centralised exchanges however it is thanks to them that cryptocurrency is thriving and vice versa. If an exchange wants to foster a relationship that involves us potentially collaborating on future marketing events or conferences then this is a good sign. If an exchange simply wants a listing fee and nothing more then that is a red flag in my&nbsp;book.</p><p>Obviously I will always advise anyone to do their own research on the exchange before trading however if an exchange is positive and wants to highlight the growth of PIVX and be apart of it, I will do my part by making this known to our communities and giving them the thanks they deserve as well as collaboration on any marketing from our&nbsp;side.</p><p>Thank you for reading our PIVX perspectives, stay tuned for more exciting insights and future&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/introducing-pivx-perspectives-engaging-conversations-with-remarkable-contributors-to-the-pivx-bcc9f0698ed8">Introducing PIVX Perspectives:

<p>Introduction:<br>In the world of cryptocurrency, liquidity plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and efficient trading. PIVX has experienced significant improvements in liquidity thanks to the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on Binance. Over the past seven weeks, this program has not only enhanced trading opportunities but also increased the chances of reintroducing a USDT pair on the exchange.</p><p>Enhanced Liquidity on Binance:<br>Since the launch of the <a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/market/76?snapshotTimestamp=1698515760000&amp;interval=1">Hummingbot Liquidity Program, </a>PIVX has witnessed a notable improvement in liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance. The sufficient liquidity provided by HummingBot has allowed for a more stable market that meets the supply and demand of services such as payment gateways that use Binance as an exchange. Sufficient liquidity provides a better market for traders and service providers.</p><p>Positive Results and Future Prospects:<br>During the campaign, Hummingbot miners have traded over $1.5 million worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair. The campaign has consistently ranked among the top three in terms of performance, with an average of 15.5 active bots, $9.93k in open order volume, and $35.1k in daily filled order volume. These figures account for nearly 6% of the total traded volume for PIVX/BTC on&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>The success of the campaign has prompted a proposal to extend it for another eight weeks on the PIVX/BTC pair. If this extension proves fruitful, there are plans to introduce a longer campaign with increased rewards in both PIVX and HBOT tokens, the native crypto of Hummingbot.</p>First 8 weeks of Hummingbot Liquidity Program on&nbsp;Binance.<p>About Hummingbot:<br><a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/">Hummingbot</a>, developed by the Hummingbot Foundation, is an open-source market-making bot that aims to democratize high-frequency trading. It provides a platform for token projects, trading firms, and individual traders to own their liquidity and earn rewards through liquidity mining. Hummingbot has evolved from a simple market-making bot into a powerful platform that allows users to create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots running various trading strategies.</p><p>The Importance of Liquidity:<br>Liquidity is a crucial metric for financial assets and trading venues. Traditionally, market making, the provision of liquidity, has been limited to a few participants such as quantitative hedge funds and large financial institutions. However, the Hummingbot Liquidity Program enables anyone to become a market maker and contribute to liquidity provision in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>A Marketplace-Based Approach:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program takes a marketplace-based approach to promote consistent liquidity provision, improve matching efficiency, and mitigate the risk of manipulative practices. Inspired by successful two-sided digital marketplaces in other industries, this approach tackles the liquidity fragmentation problem in the crypto market, benefiting both exchanges and token&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program has proven to be highly beneficial for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX</a>, enhancing liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance and fostering increased trading opportunities. With impressive results and a positive outlook for the future, continuing the program will contribute to the long-term growth and success of PIVX. By leveraging the power of Hummingbot and its marketplace-based approach, PIVX can further strengthen its position in the crypto market and attract more liquidity providers, ultimately supporting a USDT pair too, perhaps with its own Hummingbot Liquidity Program, benefiting all stakeholders involved</p>Miners on Hummingbot have traded over 1.5 million dollars worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair during the first campaign. <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-beneficial-impact-of-the-hummingbot-liquidity-program-on-pivx-b2cd2734b75e">The Beneficial Impact of the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is happy to announce the release of Zebra version 1.3.0, which now includes support for the Spend before Sync algorithm for lightwalletd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means that a Zebra-backed lightwalletd server can now query Zebra using the new and updated RPC methods for the Spend before Sync light wallet feature.</p>



<p>One other notable feature released in this version is the ability to enable progress bars in Zebra’s config file. When progress bars are enabled, users will be able to see Zebra’s blocks, transactions and peer connections in their terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like Zebra users to <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/README.md#configuring-progress-bars">test out this new feature</a> and give us feedback on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-progress-bars/44485">forums</a>.</p>

<p>Stablecoins represent a safe haven against crypto’s volatility, allowing participants to remain in the market, without off-ramping to fiat. While the major stablecoins are centrally issued (e.g. USDT, USDC, BUSD), there is a pressing need for an algorithmic variant or a synthetic dollar asset. (DAI is somewhere in between since approximately 50% of its collateral is USDC). After Luna’s collapse, many jumped to point out its design flaws, yet such a concept would be crucial for crypto’s decentralisation and self-sustainability. Arthur Hayes proposed an interesting concept of NAKA synthetic dollar (NUSD), backed by Bitcoin and its inverse perpetual swap short. However, yield generation on $BTC is significantly lower than that of $ETH. A sustainable yield would help balance the cases in which funding rates would be negative (a minority in crypto).</p><p>We were joined by Guy Young, co-founder of Ethena, to discuss the stablecoin landscape and their synthetic eUSD, backed by staked ETH and its inverse perpetual swap.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Guy’s background and founding Ethena  The history of stablecoins  The stablecoin trilemma and transparency  eUSD synthetic dollar mechanics  Ethena’s insurance fund and hedging  Minimising the impact of depegging  Leveraging centralised liquidity while maintaining self custody through MPC  User experience  Risk factors  CEX vs. DEX: liquidity, infrastructure, UX  The potential of fixed return rates  Supply &amp; rates equilibrium  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_">Guy Young on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs">Ethena Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/dust-on-crust-300d4b5cf3ec">Arthur Hayes' article proposing the Naka synthetic dollar</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

<p>The hype of web3 in marketing has entered the chat. More and more businesses from various industries turn towards leveraging web3 opportunities within their marketing campaigns. To put this into reality, so has the <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-loreal-is-gearing-up-for-the-metaverse/">L’Oréal Group</a> utilised the variety of web3 in several of their latest marketing campaigns, especially the metaverse, gamification as well as NFT drops. As more companies seek innovative ways to connect with audiences, the marketing department often takes the lead in experimenting with these modern approaches. Let’s dive in and explore what web3 means for the future of marketing.</p>



 Traditional vs. Web3 Marketing: Effectiveness&nbsp; 



<p>In the dynamic landscape of marketing, two distinct paradigms emerge: web3 marketing and traditional marketing. Web3 marketing harnesses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to empower users with greater control over their digital presence. In contrast, traditional marketing relies on established channels and centralisation. Web3 marketing is an unchartered field with creative means of disrupting traditional marketing models. The characteristics of web3 marketing are (logically) close to what benefits web3 can offer in general:</p>



 
 Decentralisation  



 Transparency  



 Tokenisation  



 Community  



 Ownership  
 



<p>Especially decentralisation is the pillar that differentiates web3 marketing from traditional marketing practices. Decentralisation is giving individuals control over their data. This shift creates a cooperative and mutually beneficial environment, strengthening the bond between brands and consumers.</p>







<p>When evaluating the effectiveness of web3 marketing in both the short and long term, one key aspect stands out: customer loyalty. Ultimately, it’s the bedrock of long-term success in web3 marketing. Without a loyal customer base, your marketing endeavors lack purpose. While many aspects of web3 may currently seem like mere buzzwords, the cultivation of a strong community sets apart effective web3 marketing from fleeting traditional campaigns (through e.g., print, radio, TV, or social media), as the latter often yield only short-term results. By embracing the user-centric essence of Web3 technologies, businesses can lay the foundation for long-lasting effectiveness. This approach enables them to cultivate trust and engagement with their consumer base, and forge meaningful connections with their target audience, ultimately leading to sustainable marketing success in the long run. One of many ways to achieve this is through, e.g., the introduction of loyalty programs, to keep customers hooked and committed.</p>



 Community-centricity: Reinvented brand-customer power dynamics 



 The community 



<p>“Commonality is a purpose, meets frequency of touch” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qu5KQJGCs">Swan Sit – web3 developer</a>). Establishing meaningful connections between a brand and its customers is a fundamental objective in marketing. This involves not only targeting customers who align with the brand’s values but also striving for maximum customer engagement. What sets web3 marketing apart is its participatory nature, where customers are not only part of a group but actively engage within that collective. Furthermore, the notion of tangible value comes into play, as the community can receive incentives or rewards from the brand they support, fostering a sense of pride in being part of that specific community. How these incentives could look like, is touched upon later in the article (see NFTs).</p>



<p>Navigating the integration of web3 into your marketing practices may encounter resistance from existing communities that are resistant to change. To overcome potential backlash, open and transparent communication is essential. Engage with your community, address their concerns, and emphasise how the shift to web3 benefits them. Demonstrating a clear understanding of their needs and a commitment to preserving what they value can help ease the transition. Additionally, gradual implementation and education about the advantages of web3 can mitigate resistance and pave the way for a smoother transition, ultimately ensuring the long-term success of your brand’s evolution.</p>



 New power dynamics  



<p>In today’s evolving landscape, we can witness a shift in power dynamics, where the consumer takes a central stage and wields a more significant influence on brand decisions. This represents a stark departure from the traditional paradigm where brands held the upper hand, often due to information imbalances. Web3 technology is a game-changer in this context, offering the potential to rebalance these dynamics. What’s particularly noteworthy is the active involvement of brands in these online communities, signifying a fundamental transformation in how businesses approach marketing.</p>



<p>In this new era, understanding your audience and constructing strategies tailored to their preferences and behaviours becomes paramount. It’s a shift towards a more consumer-centric approach, where the community’s voice plays a crucial role in shaping brand decisions and forging stronger, mutually beneficial relationships.</p>



<p>Web3 technology, thanks to its transparent and authentic nature, helps build trust between brands and consumers. Using blockchain, brands can provide proof of where their products come from, their authenticity, and their sustainability, giving consumers the information they need to make informed decisions. In this context, deceptive marketing practices struggle to gain traction, highlighting how important transparency and authenticity are in web3 marketing. This shift represents a significant departure from traditional marketing, fostering a more genuine and accountable connection between brands and their audiences.</p>



 The web3 marketing trends 



<p>Web3 marketing allows for various new trends, which enrich ways of doing marketing:&nbsp;</p>



 
 NFTs 



 Virtual experiences 



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  
 



 NFTs 



<p>A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a one-of-a-kind digital asset, which replicates real-life items in the form of e.g., art or music and can be sold or bought online. NFTs have gained popularity as a means for brands to enter the web3 marketing space, and hold the promise of serving as valuable bridges between brands and their communities.</p>



<p>NFTs serve a dual purpose:</p>



 
 NFTs can expand the current audience of the brand, and reel those in, that show a clear interest in the web3 space.&nbsp; 



 Additionally, they can also be harnessed for branding and communication strategies. Businesses can use NFTs as a means to incentivise their fans and followers. Within the NFT ecosystem, the range of possibilities is vast: this includes providing discounts, delivering rewarding products, or crafting unique digital items exclusively available to members of the NFT community. 
 



<p>To put this into reality, <a href="https://raritysniper.com/news/adidas-tokenproof-partnership-to-reward-loyal-nft-holders/">Adidas</a> has explored web3 marketing through NFTs. They recently collaborated with Tokengate, where an NFT loyalty program grants access to exclusive Adidas sneakers. Furthermore, Adidas has also teamed up with the Doodles collection and had a partnership with Pharrell &amp; Adidas for an exclusive Samba sneaker drop.</p>



 Virtual experiences 



<p>One of the major trends within web3 marketing revolves around creating virtual experiences, primarily through the metaverse or Virtual Reality (VR). The core concept of such, in a marketing sense, is to offer a fluid experience that seamlessly bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. This enables users to engage with both one another and digital elements in real time, soaking up the person into the action. As previously mentioned, consumers are part of a brand experience, giving them a sense of belonging to the particular brand, as well as active participation in the experience. This emotional side of marketing can often be more important than the actual physical product being sold.</p>



<p>In November of 2021, Nike solidified its position in the nascent metaverse with the launch of <a href="https://www.nike.com/kids/nikeland-roblox">Nikeland</a>, a branded virtual interactive space, marking a significant step in blending sales, marketing, and gaming.</p>



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  



<p>Worries regarding privacy and the handling of personal data have surged, and the demand for replacing platforms is growing. Think of web3 as the rebel of the internet world, challenging the status quo. It’s all about giving you, the user, the reins to control your online experience. Unlike those traditional social media giants that hoard your data on their servers, web3 rides on blockchain technology, creating decentralised networks where you are the data owner. Privacy, anonymity, security, and ownership are redefined in web3 (social media) marketing, creating a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion: Embrace the shift  



<p>As we navigate the evolving landscape of marketing, it’s crucial for brands to adapt and embrace the shift towards integrating web3 into their practices. This means staying true to your brand’s core values while modifying your existing products or services to align with the futuristic space. In this context, experimentation is not an option; it’s a necessity. Embracing web3 in your marketing strategies is the path forward to ensure your brand remains relevant and competitive in an ever-changing digital world.</p>

<p>In 2021, the US Department of Defense spent $142 billion on procurement and $106 billion on developing new technologies (RDT&amp;E) — while global defense spending reached over two trillion dollars. Yet the US and its allies are potentially dangerously wrong-footed by having over-spent on legacy hardware systems (eg aircraft carriers etc) while neglecting what could be the defining battlefield of the future: the control of the radio spectrum, otherwise known as electronic warfare. In a world where societies and markets run on electronics and signals — this is the ultimate defense&nbsp;line.</p><p>Much of electronic warfare is out of sight of the public and media, but since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident">Iran captured and then reverse engineered a sophisticated high-end US UAV</a> using its electronic warfare capabilities — it has become evident just how dangerous these capabilities will become. Since this incident and others like it, the US DoD has made significant investments in electronic warfare capabilities. However these have come from legacy providers, grown through M&amp;A with no cross system or modular capabilities — severely holding back the US’ and NATO’s electronic warfare capabilities. The lack of composability has created a frustration among end users and demands for open standards.</p><p>AnySignal is building open-core radio software for satellite communications, UAVs, and other next generation defense capabilities. The company sits at the core of a more compatible, modular and fast scaling electronic warfare approach.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>In the future, control of radio spectrum will be used to project power instead of aircraft carriers or ICBMs. NATO will continue to make massive investments in this field, but existing defense contractors are not well positioned to deliver what their clients need. A vibrant startup ecosystem, built with open source components that will be maintained long after the company producing the product is gone, will replace slow moving defense prime contractors. The team’s past experience building radio systems at SpaceX &amp; Kepler Communications puts them in a unique position to help define industry standards and open source implementations through their usage of GNU Radio, a widely used, 21 year old, open source project. With this, AnySignal has the potential to provide many of the performance defining components in this emergent ecosystem.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the AnySignal team on their mission to master the radiofrequency (RF) domain through end-to-end solutions that cover communications, radar, navigation, and RF sensing for advanced aircraft, satellites, and national security. Read more about their recent seed financing <a href="https://anysignal.medium.com/anysignal-closes-seed-round-to-build-multi-domain-radio-platform-ab8aa6844bc8">here</a>.</p>

While Metamask still maintains the largest market share, a multitude of wallets have emerged, promising additional features and a better UX.</p><p>We were joined by Evgeny Yurtaev, co-founder &amp; CEO of Zerion, to discuss the challenges of building a Web3 wallet and how Zerion aims to improve user experience, while still maintaining security.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Evgeny’s background  The motivation behind building a Web3 wallet  Zerion UX and security  Seed phrase storing  Zerion user profile  Challenges in building a new wallet app  Protecting users and potential attack vectors  Supported blockchains and (seamless) bridging  Account abstraction and MPC  Business models for Web3 wallets  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/evgeth_">Evgeny Yurtaev on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zerion">Zerion on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

 This article gives instructions on how to use the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website and Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile to preconvert ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH. <p>First I recommend to read: <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/bridging-done-right-verus-ethereum-bridge-launches-now-1b2ca42939b2">Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!</a></p><p>✅ We will show&nbsp;you:</p>  How-to bridge ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus  How-to enable vETH, DAI.vETH &amp; MKR.vETH on Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile  How-to preconvert into Bridge.vETH with Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile    Download the latest <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> or Verus Mobile (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/verus-mobile/id6447361908">iOS App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.autonomoussoftwarefoundation.verusmobile.android&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  If on Verus Desktop make sure you are on native mode and fully synced. (And remember to always backup your wallet.dat file!)  Visit the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website here: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>   Bridging ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus <p>First thing we need to do, before we can preconvert, is to bridge over. To bridge ETH, DAI or MKR over you need to visit the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">bridge website&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Then connect your Metamask or WalletConnect wallet. Follow the steps they give&nbsp;you.</p><p>Then fill in the address (R- or i-address) you want the bridged ETH, DAI or MKR to end&nbsp;up.</p><p>Then choose what you want to bridge over (ETH, DAI, MKR or VRSC). And then the destination. After that choose the amount and click&nbsp;send.</p><p>Metamask or WalletConnect will guide you through the next steps. ⚠️ It can take up to 45 minutes before your bridged ETH, DAI or MKR arrives on the Verus blockchain and in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>⛽ Also, the gas fee calculation is quite high, it could be that you pay a lot less, but this is never a guarantee.</p> Getting Verus Desktop to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>Go to the “Multiverse”-tab, click on Verus on the left. You can see that Bridge.vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH &amp; vETH or not “added” yet. Click on one of the currencies.</p><p>When clicking on one of the currencies you can see a button “Add Currency”. Click on it, and do it for all if you&nbsp;want.</p><p>You can now go back to the “Wallet”-tab.</p><p>You can now see the added currencies in the dropdown in your Wallet-tab (when Verus is selected).</p> Getting Verus Mobile to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>For this step we assume you already have the wallet installed and are ready to go. Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Click on the big plus button in the right bottom corner. Then click “Add PBaaS Currency”.</p><p>Then you can type in vETH (or DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH depending on what you want to add). (not capital sensitive). Btw, you can also already add Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Follow the steps and the currency will be added to your main&nbsp;screen.</p> Preconverting to Bridge.vETH  Verus Desktop <p>To actually start preconverting currencies to Bridge.vETH click on “Convert Currencies”.</p><p>Now go to “Advanced”.</p><p>You only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See&nbsp;below:</p>  Amount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH  From Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)  To Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  Destination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct). Can be a R-address, i-address or&nbsp;VerusID.  Send as pre-convert: Check&nbsp;this  Refund Address: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn’t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.  <p>Now click on “Convert Currencies” and confirm the transaction. You have now preconverted funds into Bridge.vETH!</p> Verus Mobile <p>Now we want to preconvert currencies (vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH) into Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Click on the currency you want to preconvert into Bridge.vETH. Go to the correct tab where you have the currency stored. Click “Send”, then “Convert or Cross-chain”, then click “Pre-convert”.</p>  Recipient address: This is the address where you will receive the Bridge.vETH, you can click on “self”, or choose something else.  Amount: choose the amount of the currency you want to convert into Bridge.vETH.  Currency to convert to: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  <p>Then click send and follow the steps. You have now preconverted currencies into Bridge.vETH!</p><p>On Friday 20 Oct you will receive an amount of the 100,000 initial supply of Bridge.vETH in your destination address.</p><p>You can always check <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a> for statistics on Bridge.vETH</p> Join the community.

 Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!  The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is the first non-custodial and trustless bridge in the industry, and where the accounting of funds is proven and verified by consensus. And you can participate in its launch right&nbsp;now!  ⏱️ Verus-Ethereum Bridge launch: block height 2,758,800 (Fri 20 Oct,&nbsp;2023).  ✅ Start preconverting to the bridge currency Bridge.vETH (with an initial supply of 100,000) NOW for a 10 day period. 👉 <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io">Connect to the&nbsp;bridge</a>  👀 The first ever truly non-custodial, trustless and consensus proven cryptocurrency bridge. 👉 More here: <a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/</a>  How it&nbsp;Works <p>You can already start to preconvert VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH.</p>  Bridge ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus network. 👉 <a href="http://eth.verusbridge.io">Go to the bridge website</a> <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-participate-in-the-verus-ethereum-bridge-launch-73aeeae1c76a">How-to guide for bridging &amp; preconversion</a>  Preconvert vETH (ETH), DAI.vETH (DAI), MKR.vETH (MKR) or VRSC into Bridge.vETH.  See Bridge.vETH statistics on <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a>  <p>When the bridge currency launches on 20 Oct the initial supply of 100,000 will be distributed by the protocol among all preconverters.</p><p>If you move ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched your cross-chain fees are subsidized. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.</p> Dynamic Supply <p>The Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of&nbsp;it.</p>After the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.<blockquote>Worth noting: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant. There is no front/back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">More details on docs.verus.io</a></blockquote><p>The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.</p> The Bridge Accrues&nbsp;Fees <p>The bridge currency accrues fees with the cross-chain functions, conversions and&nbsp;.vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable the more it’s&nbsp;used.</p><p>Dai holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. DAI in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.</p> Use the&nbsp;Bridge <p>After Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed you can now use the bridge as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Convert into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion mode.  Export launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Send currencies, tokens and liquidity pools cross-chain.  Send <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721</a> &amp; <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/">ERC-1155</a> NFTs to Verus, and export tokenized ID currencies from Verus to Ethereum as ERC-721 &amp; ERC-1155.   Present Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges <p>Let’s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.</p>  The custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.  The smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security&nbsp;issues.  Smart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.  <p>These problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.</p> Why the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different <p>The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone’s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>Every 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called “notarizations’’, contain, among other things: the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> for Verus, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Merkle Patricia Trie</a> for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.</p><blockquote>👉 <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5">Read more here</a> on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable&nbsp;way.</blockquote> Safeguards Against Bridge&nbsp;Hacks <p>Threats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to&nbsp;happen:</p>  Colluding, malicious witnesses.  Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain.  <p>These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.</p><p>The notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.</p> Bridgekeeper <p>The two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive&nbsp;fees.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper">Bridgekeeper for CLI</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/kyEqBX_erJo?si=UOajk4TnSD0ToRY4">How to become a Bridgekeeper — video</a></p> Verus ➡️&nbsp;Ethereum <p>Let’s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has passed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a ‘CCE’ (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a>, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).</p><p>Meanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. The notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.</p><p>Then when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it’s sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Anyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the notary witnesses paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.</p><p>If there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is minimal&nbsp;cost.</p> Ethereum ➡️&nbsp;Verus <p>The above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the notary witnesses that send the group of transactions over, but any miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Notarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie</a> proof that relates to the new confirmed data.</p> A Giant Leap&nbsp;Forward <p>The delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>This system is decentralized, which means it’s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It’s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of&nbsp;it!</p> Join the community. Learn about the protocol.

A little over a year ago, Danny wrote a blog post titled “The Risk of LSDs”... discussing the various risk vectors that a dominant LSD presents to Ethereum…even naming Lido specifically in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ A lot of people have decided that liquid staking with Lido is the place to do it. At the time of recording Lido has over 30% of all staked Ether. Does this present a systemic risk to Ethereum?</p> <p>We did an episode called, “In Defense of Lido” with researcher Hasu who argued that Lido does not pose a systemic risk to Ethereum. In fact, Lido’s dominance is better than many other alternatives. We left that conversation half-finished when we published it in August 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s episode, we cover part two of that debate with Ethereum researcher and guest Danny Ryan who argues the opposite. Lido is a systemic risk to Ethereum and what to do about it.</p> <p>We believe our role as podcasters for issues like this is to voice both sides of the argument in long-form conversations and healthy debate. It is exactly the kind of thing you don’t get on Twitter. That’s why we’ve given voice to both sides of this issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>We think there are good actors who care about this ecosystem at Lido and in the broader Ethereum community and we’re sure this episode won’t be the last word on this subject.</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 a16z Startup School | Apply Before Oct. 20th <a href="https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school">https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠<a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp; ⁠</a></p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING <a>⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap&nbsp;</a></p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:41 Is Lido a Threat to Ethereum 8:57 &nbsp;Blog Post Thinking Change? 19:30 Uniswap 21:20 Theoretical Main Risks 25:45 God Mode&nbsp; 27:20 Practical Main Risks 34:00 Hasu Counter-Arguments&nbsp; 38:25 Permissionless Validator Set Mitigation 42:30 Veto Power Mitigation Argument 46:55 How Likely is the Lido Risk? 51:26 Client Team Positioning&nbsp; 55:00 How Special is the Lido Case?&nbsp; 57:45 One LST Inevitability &nbsp; 1:02:30 Solutions&nbsp; 1:06:55 Profit Maximization&nbsp; 1:09:00 Action Steps For Ethereum Decentralization&nbsp; 1:11:53 Can Ethereum Devs Do Something?&nbsp; 1:20:10 Hasu Questions Answered by Danny&nbsp; 1:22:45 Magnitude of the Lido Threat 1:24:20 How Can Lido Fix This?&nbsp; 1:25:59 Stick &amp; Carrot for Lido 1:26:27 Silverlining of Lido Threat 1:29:05 Next Conversations&nbsp; 1:32:16 Closing &amp; Disclaimers &nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Danny Ryan <a href="https://twitter.com/dannyryan">https://twitter.com/dannyryan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Danny Ryan Blog Post <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd">https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasu’s Bankless Interview <a href="https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY">https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Back in 2017, there was no DeFi as we know it today, yet MakerDAO were already envisioning and building towards what they thought to be a certainty. The backbone of DeFi is represented by stable coins, and MakerDAO quickly understood this: they set out to build a decentralised stable coin, $DAI (and its precursor $SAI). Being collateral-backed, the smart contract needs to know the value of that collateral, but any off-chain price data is not readily available on-chain. This is where oracles come in and provide data feeds on-chain. MakerDAO’s internal oracle has been active since 2017 on Ethereum and has recently branched out, forming Chronicle. By using aggregated Schnorr signatures, Chronicle solves the problem of oracle cost-efficient scaling.</p><p>We were joined by Niklas Kunkel, founder of Chronicle, to discuss the challenges and tradeoffs that oracles regularly face, and how Chronicle is solving them, continuing the ethos of early MakerDAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Niklas’ background and the early days of MakerDAO  How MakerDAO evolved over time and the adoption of DAI  MakerDAO’s core principles  Why Chronicle branched out from MakerDAO  Oracle challenges &amp; tradeoffs  Oracle validators  Business model for oracles  Providing oracle services to different blockchains  Schnorr signatures  Chronicle’s supported chains and oracle offerings  Real-world assets (RWA) and credit delegation  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nomos_paradox">Niklas Kunkel on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronicleLabs">Chronicle on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO">Maker DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.
