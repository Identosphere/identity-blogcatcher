<p>Prediction markets were one of the first use cases of smart contracts, yet their popularity only recently spiked, following Polymarket’s social media spread. However, while prediction markets are generally zero-sum games, the rise of AI models trained on large datasets led to AI-powered prediction feeds and hedge funds. Crypto offers a unique array of use cases as it allows data scientists to not only share their data sets and models with complete privacy, but also access decentralised computing and model training. While Predictoor employs Ocean’s data infrastructure to run AI-powered prediction bots on lower timeframes, Numerai developed its own AI hedge fund for stocks, that recently also expanded to crypto.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Predictoor &amp; Numerai overview  Prediction markets  Prediction feeds  Prediction markets in TradFi and other use cases  Implementation of Ocean’s tech in Predictoor  Predictions vs. Futures  Market participants  Numerai hedge fund  Numerai’s trust assumptions  The role of AI  The evolution of AI and how it might solve market inefficiencies  Numerai crypto and how it differs from Predictoor  Predictoor x Numerai collaborations  The future of prediction markets  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/trentmc0">Trent McConaghy on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/richardcraib">Richard Craib on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/Predictoor_ai">Predictoor on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/numerai">Numerai on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/OceanProtocol">Ocean Protocol on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/OasisProtocol">Oasis Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

  Privacy-preserving ad measurement should prioritize user control and transparency rather than catering to third-party advertisers.

<p>Brave has worked towards a more private Web for several years. The current third-party-based advertising ecosystem is built on the continual surveillance of users, so we’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the economy of the Web and how it can work while still maximizing user privacy, which is why we offer <a>Brave Ads</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re happy to see other browsers paying more attention to these issues as well. Mozilla, for example, recently announced their <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/privacy-preserving-attribution">Privacy-Preserving Attribution (PPA)</a> feature to track ad interactions in the browser while preserving user privacy. Mozilla’s PPA, co-designed with Meta and default-enabled in the Firefox browser, was met with a lot of criticism on launch, however. While we agree with the overall goal of the Mozilla/Meta system (i.e., privacy-preserving advertising), we disagree with the design of the system itself.</p>
<p>We believe that ad measurement should be transparent, simple, and limited to parties the user trusts—not random third-party advertisers.</p>

 Ad measurement should be transparent 
<p>Mozilla’s ad measurement scheme is default-enabled and — unless you’re hunting around in Settings — undiscoverable by users. This means that if you go to a page which happens to have ads on it, the browser will record that ad impression and eventually send it to the advertising measurement server. This lack of transparency is a problem, as users deserve to be in control of what information is being shared and with whom.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1e43w7v/a_word_about_private_attribution_in_firefox/">Mozilla’s argument</a> is that no personal data is actually being shared in PPA (given their protections), and that a consent dialog prior to enabling PPA would have been user-hostile. We agree that consent dialogs are often bad for user privacy (which is one reason we <a>block cookie consent banners by default</a>), but PPA is a complicated, unproven, and experimental prototype operating over extremely sensitive user browsing data.</p>
<p>Users should not be guinea pigs, especially not for a system that is built for third-party advertisers and does not directly benefit users.</p>

 Ad measurement should be simple 
<p>Ad measurement in the browser is inherently privacy-sensitive because users’ website browsing activity is being tracked and sent. To preserve privacy, Mozilla’s PPA combines novel differential privacy (DP) and multi-party computation (MPC) techniques to provide arbitrary websites with ostensibly only aggregated data. Websites (unbeknownst to the user) ask the browser to generate encrypted reports that are then sent by the browser to an “aggregation service” backend, which is run by another third-party.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this is all experimental, complex, and carries a fair amount of privacy risk. The more complex the system, the higher the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities. Complex systems are not only harder to audit but also increase the chances of mistakes that can compromise user privacy. The more moving parts, the higher the risk of something going wrong — this is software engineering 101.</p>
<p>Complexity is especially dangerous for a system that will be used for online advertising, where there is a lot of economic motivation for bad actors to try to break privacy protections.</p>

 Ad measurement shouldn’t be handed over to third parties 
<p>One of the most glaring flaws with Mozilla’s approach is that it is built to attempt to incrementally improve the traditional third-party advertising economy. In doing so, it allows third parties, who have no known relationship with the user, to measure ad performance while increasing privacy risk for the user.</p>
<p>We at Brave believe third-party advertising is fundamentally broken. It doesn’t need patching or tweaking — it needs to be completely overhauled. No user wants to be tracked by third-party advertisers, and the vast majority of users find third-party ads to be, at best, annoying, and at worst a dangerous vector for malware and spam. This is why ad and tracker blockers such as Brave have become a necessity for so many, and are widely considered <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221221?=8324278624">security best practice</a>.</p>
<p>Mozilla’s response to the controversy is especially worrying. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1e43w7v/a_word_about_private_attribution_in_firefox/">In their Reddit post</a>, they correctly note that Firefox has shipped several useful anti-tracking features over the years, and that there is an arms race happening between privacy-enhancing tools and malicious actors on the Web. But the post then doubles down on the third-party bet, and concludes that the only way to increase privacy on the Web at this point is to collude with third-party advertisers and ad-tech providers, and design systems for their use.</p>
<p>We strongly disagree. Brave offers an alternative to the traditional third-party-based advertising model of the Web. <a>Brave Ads</a> center the user, not the advertiser and definitely not ad-tech third parties, while operating on principles of transparency and simple, proven privacy techniques. The Brave browser offers <a href="https://privacytests.org/">best-in-class</a> privacy and anti-tracking features for all users. We focus on protecting our users by blocking third-party ads and intrusive trackers entirely, and shipping privacy- and Web compatibility-enhancing features in the browser.</p>
<p>This isn’t easy. It requires constant work to ensure websites don’t break while also protecting user privacy by default. But it’s the right thing to do by our users, versus prioritizing third-party advertising and “ad-tech” over user privacy and security.</p>

 Why anonymity is so important, online and&nbsp;off <p>Let’s face it, “anonymity” has become a dirty word. It is too often associated with “hiding” illicit activities and the perpetrators behind them. Not only is this a false association, it also has huge consequences for our privacy whether we’re online or&nbsp;off.</p><p>Nym’s new series Who’s afraid of anonymity? will try to demystify anonymity and explore its fundamental relation to privacy and a safe, democratic life. But nothing is so simple, so we will also need to explore the limits and possible dangers of anonymity.</p><blockquote>“Anonymity is not just a mask; it’s a&nbsp;shield.”</blockquote><blockquote>– Anonymous</blockquote> What is anonymity? <p>For a moment, let’s forget all the scaremongering about anonymous criminals, shadowed faces lurking in the dark looking to hurt us. Yes, the fear of the unknown and unrecognizable is very real. But isn’t anonymity also a central aspect of human life? And when it comes to online surveillance, our many adversaries are even too dark to&nbsp;notice.</p> The meaning of anonymity <p>“Anonymity” comes to English from Ancient Greek, literally meaning the state (-ity) of having no (ano-) name (nym). But why would we want to lose our name? Isn’t this what makes us all individuals and protects our unique identities?</p><p>In some cases, yes. It can assure that private property belongs to us, or allow us to speak authentically and be held responsible for what we say publicly. But having an identifiable name which links us to something personal is also what leaves us vulnerable to attacks and exploitation when all we really want and need is&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Given the widespread surveillance and tracking of the mico-details of our lives online, this linking of our identities with what we expect to be a private activity has, unfortunately, become a commonplace industry for profit and control. But it doesn’t begin and end with the internet.</p><p>But before diving in, let’s consider a more simple example to appreciate the value of anonymity.</p> A game of&nbsp;cards Rounders (1998)<p>Imagine we’re playing a game of cards. Each of us has an individual hand which is private and concealed from others until we decide to play a card. Doing so will then make the card public. In some games, we may even share a collective hand in which teammates don’t even know what cards the others&nbsp;hold.</p><p>And then there is the deck from which cards can be collectively drawn. A key to fair play is that each card in the deck has two sides. First, there is the face value (number and suit) with its respective benefits to individuals when held or played. And then there is the card’s back side, facing the public and anonymous to&nbsp;them.</p><p>The anonymity of the card’s back is essential. If something about a card in the deck could be used to indicate the face-value (different shaped or damaged cards, unique designs or colors), then some players could de-anonymize the card to gain an unfair advantage over others. This would end the collective fun, joy, and gamble of the game&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Of course, human life isn’t just a game. But games do reveal something about the people that invented them: there is always a play of public and private, of anonymity and deanonymization, which have real world consequences for us&nbsp;all.</p><p>Privacy and anonymity are certainly not the same thing, but in the contemporary world they can share a common purpose. So let’s first consider how our expectations of privacy in the real world have evolved politically and struggle to find an equal home on the&nbsp;web.</p> Privacy as a political right <p>Rights to privacy are enshrined in democratic constitutions all over the world, even though billions of people still do not benefit from them. Of course, political rights are contextual and jurisdictional, depending on the country or society. Yet there are particular moments in history that helped advance the growing case for privacy as a universal right.</p> The U.S. constitution <p>In the United States, the “right to privacy” comes from the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-4/">4th Amendment</a> to its constitution of&nbsp;1791:</p><blockquote>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated…”</blockquote><p>This has an important context. Prior to the U.S.’s independence from the colonial rule of England, Americans often had their personal belongings searched and their personal “papers” or correspondences confiscated and read by colonial authorities. These arbitrary searches were often conducted without legal justification (“warrants”) by colonial police, and tended to be politically motivated: searching for untaxed items and anti-colonial political associations, or simply indiscriminate sweeps for blackmail material.</p><p>Note: The large majority of our “papers,” and even “houses” and “effects,” are now digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The US is just one country amongst others. And yet a law now over two centuries old importantly set the foundation for a common struggle in which people all over the world continue find themselves to ensure access to information and free communications. In the end, the US constitution was not simply a fight to stop one authoritarian government, but also to prevent the resurrection of authoritarianism in the&nbsp;future.</p> Privacy as a human&nbsp;right <p>Privacy also became a core part of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2012,against%20such%20interference%20or%20attacks">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> (UDHR) which members of the United Nations have in principle committed to protect “against such interference or attacks”:</p><blockquote>“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence…” (Article&nbsp;17)</blockquote><p>As the UDHR makes clear, these personal privacy protections are inseparable from other fundamental human rights, such as the “freedom of thought” (Article 18) and the “freedom of opinion and expression,” including the right to “seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers” (Article&nbsp;19).</p><p>Privacy, in this context, is much more than a personal right: it is a democratic capacity that enables us to associate and communicate freely with others. No matter who and where we&nbsp;are.</p><p>Moreover, privacy is linked to shared information, but information itself is complicated. And the advent of the internet has accelerated these complications.</p> Online privacy <p>More and more of our lives are taking place online, and as they do there is thus a tremendous amount of personal information that is being made available, vulnerable to surveillance and <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/who-is-tracking-your-internet-activity-and-why">data tracking</a>. Even when the content of what we do or say is <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-encryption">encrypted</a>, our encrypted data leaks a lot of metadata that is being systematically harvested and used under our&nbsp;noses.</p><p>New legal protections for online privacy have thankfully started to emerge worldwide to curb the exploitation of personal data. The biggest so far is the EU’s <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) of 2018. The GDPR pledges to protect the data security and privacy of members of the EU, regardless of the companies that may handle the data globally. This is the beginning and not the end of the&nbsp;story.</p><p>In addition to defending the importance of end-to-end encryption to protect the privacy of the content of what we do and say online, the GDPR also introduces a number of new rights for “data subjects,” that is, we who use the internet. This includes, for example, the right to be informed about how our personal data will be used, and even the right to erasure or “to be forgotten,” that is, to remove our name from the digital public&nbsp;domain.</p><p>What’s largely left untouched by GDPR provisions, however, is what can be done with our metadata. But more on this&nbsp;later.</p> From privacy to anonymity <p>So far, this is a story about the evolution of privacy: from the constitutional rights of a particular country, to universal rights, to (still regional) digital rights. But what does all this have to do with anonymity?</p><p>It is certainly not necessary to be anonymous in order to be private in all aspects of life. For example, we should be able to discuss things privately in the confines of our own homes and social groups while other people in our neighborhood or society know our real&nbsp;names.</p><p>But there are important contexts in which genuine privacy, freedom of speech, and freedom to information require anonymity as a tool to achieve it. So let’s start exploring how.</p> Anonymity for a private, safe&nbsp;life <p>Anonymity is in fact a social necessity for everyone. Our rights and security, both personal and collective, often depend on it. So here is a taste of the topics that the new Nym series Who’s Afraid of Anonymity? will explore in the coming&nbsp;months.</p> Voting <p>When we cast a vote in an election, we not only expect that this vote will be respected and counted, but also that it will be anonymous and not publicly known. The bare facts of a vote must be public, but our name and personal information should be publicly unlinkable to us. Identifying individual voters for a political party or candidate could lead to voter intimidation, social outcasting, or even targeted killings in authoritarian regimes. Anonymity can ensure democratic participation.</p><p>There are many techniques for anonymizing the hard ballots of voters worldwide while also preventing voter fraud. However, voting in person poses serious logistical difficulties for many people (work commitments, long distances to voting stations, or the threats of in-person intimidation) which digital voting can resolve. But data and privacy security is necessary to do this properly. In this new technological era of democratic participation, data anonymity rises to the forefront.</p> Health care <p>If we need to have a medical service, we expect that the hospital or clinic will keep this information private. Publicly accessible medical records can lead insurance companies to raise our rates, employers to consider terminating contracts, or malicious individuals to target us. Medical data is definitely important for charting social trends, but unlinking individuals from their personal data through data anonymization ensures everyone has unimpeded access to health services.</p><p>Perhaps hard records are definitely a thing of the past, but ensuring the privacy and anonymity of digital records are still the problem. With the increasing rise of data leaks and cyber attacks, it’s more important than ever to ensure that our efforts to seek social and medical services are protected. For example, when it comes to women seeking out-of-state abortion services who may face community or legal reprisal, digital anonymity can be a part of ensuring safe&nbsp;passage.</p> Whistleblowing <p>A lot of people work for private, public, and government enterprises, and they are potential witnesses to a lot of wrongdoing. But if these workers need to report abuses, maintaining their anonymity with journalists or regulators can allow them to safely speak freely about the oppression or exploitation of others without fear of reprisal. Anonymity can ensure social&nbsp;justice.</p><p>But even journalists, for example, need assured technological means to preserve the anonymity and security of their communications with sources. It is for this reason that private and end-to-end encrypted messaging apps have been such a revolution: not to allow people to commit crimes, but to finally have the privacy and security in communicating with others through a digital space ridden with malicious adversaries.</p><p>The list goes on. And it is for this reason that we need to stop stigmatizing anonymity when it comes to digital privacy. The threats surrounding us are too many, varied, and omnipresent.</p> The urgency of online anonymity <p>Political “rights” do not rain down to us from the sky as unconditional truths, and the right to privacy is a case in point. Rights are demanded, fought for, enacted, and defended over time in relation to the real needs of human beings. In some contexts it might be needed to fight against oppression and injustice, and in others simply to live better and more safely with&nbsp;others.</p><p>With all the threats posed to our digital lives, online privacy needs to continue its course to becoming a globally recognized right. But in this digital day and age, anonymity is a necessary tool to achieve it in particular contexts where privacy is under threat. In fact, the need for online anonymity is so much more urgent given the sheer amount of personal information that is being made available online, often without our knowledge and genuine&nbsp;consent.</p><p>Anonymity is meaningful particularly in a social context like the public web in which we need to act without compromising our personal identity. Anonymity allows us to be contributing members of society while shielding us from its dangers. The examples above are just some moments when this really&nbsp;matters.</p> Who’s Afraid of Anonymity? <p>Nym is dedicated to exploring all social needs for digital anonymity and what it would take to technologically make it possible. So this is the first installment in a series that will explore the in-and-outs of online anonymity, its real world consequences and use cases, and the way it is being unjustly politically targeted.</p><p>In coming installments we will explore the role of anonymity in voting online and off, the need to shield our identities when seeking health services, and in protecting ourselves while speaking out against social and institutional injustices. So stay&nbsp;tuned!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/whos-afraid-of-anonymity-42abd47ad83f">Who’s afraid of anonymity?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Here’s what the change means for operators and&nbsp;stakers <p>Earlier this year, the Nym node operator community <a href="https://forum.nymtech.net/t/poll-proposal-for-on-chain-minimum-profit-margin-for-all-nym-nodes/253">voted</a> on whether to implement a minimum profit margin and maximum operator&nbsp;cost.</p><p>This came from a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-question-of-minimum-profit-margin-for-nym-nodes-142275840da7">suggestion by a community member</a> as a way to prevent a “race to the bottom” when it comes to operator rewards and to ensure that operators can make a decent earning for providing a good&nbsp;service.</p><p>With the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases">Caramello</a> release last week, this community decision went on-chain. The core team has been monitoring how this has affected the distribution of rewards across Nym node operators and stakers. With this change, average operator rewards have doubled from 1.4 NYM per epoch (about 24 NYM per day) to more than 2.8 NYM per epoch (51.5 NYM per day) for high performing nodes of min. 20% stake saturation. Staker APY has changed roughly from 13% to&nbsp;10%.</p><p>Before going into the details, let’s take a look at the bigger&nbsp;picture.</p> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>The Nym network is starting to see a gradual <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/token">increase in usage</a>. The <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN is in its public Beta stage</a> and now open for testing by anyone in the world. The goal of this new testing phase is to better troubleshoot the app and network ahead of its commercial launch.</p><p>Increasing usage of the Nym network also means the Nym core team is demanding more from the operator community. The <a href="https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/">goalpost of a good quality Nym node</a> is moving regularly as new releases roll out and performance measurements come in (so check <a href="https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/">here</a> to see if you are still a&nbsp;Panda).</p><p>Note: Very soon, any node that falls behind the past 3 releases will no longer be eligible to be in the active set. The <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/changelog.html">Operators Guide changelog</a> is the best place to follow up on new versions, updates, and release&nbsp;notes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rewards going to Nym nodes must reflect the efforts that will be needed in these next few months to get the network up to&nbsp;scratch.</p> Adjustments to Nym token economics <p>The Nym network has been live for nearly two years now. This means that there is now real world data on how NYM token economics is performing. The primary objective of the token economic design is to ensure top quality of service and coverage of what may likely become the world’s most powerful privacy&nbsp;network.</p><p>One of the team’s findings is that staking, which was intended as an economic measure of community confidence in the quality of a given node, hasn’t worked very well. One possible reason is a tendency to “stake and forget,” leaving NYM tokens idle on outdated nodes instead of contributing to ensuring good&nbsp;quality.</p><p>At the same time, the community has been experiencing turbulent crypto markets, leaving some operators struggling and out of pocket. The Nym knows this has been difficult, but is confident that the value of the NYM token is fundamentally linked to the performance of the Nym network which is just now coming to fruition.</p><p>For these reasons, emphasis will be increasingly placed on performance rather than reputation as a proxy for good service. It is good to keep this bigger picture in mind when analyzing the reward data following last week’s&nbsp;change.</p> New minimum and maximum parameters <p>As of last week, the following ranges were set for operator cost and profit&nbsp;margin:</p>  Profit margin (PM):&nbsp;20%–50%  Operator cost (OC): 0–1,000&nbsp;NYM  <p>These ranges were set on-chain and apply to all Nym nodes. This means that operators cannot set their PM and OC outside of these ranges going forward, and values which fell outside of these ranges were clipped to the maximum/minimum.</p><p>Nym nodes are selected to do work for periods of 1 hour called epochs. If they have good performance and high stake, they will have a higher chance of being selected to do work and receive rewards. Here is a simplified overview of OC and PM and how these parameters determine the share of rewards that node operators and stakers&nbsp;receive.</p><p>OC is a monthly value meant to cover the costs of actively operating a Nym node. OC is paid first by the reward algorithm before any other rewards. This means that stakers only start receiving staking rewards after OC has already been awarded to the operator.</p><p>Note: The OC parameter assumes 100% activity. For example, if your node is selected to do work for 50% of the epochs in a month, the OC for that month will be 50% the OC you configured. So if you set OC at 500 NYM and your node is selected to do work for 50% of the epochs throughout the month, then your node’s OC will be 250 NYM for that&nbsp;month.</p><p>PM is the node operator’s share of all the rewards that their node generates (after covering OC). Let’s say your node has a 20% PM and it generates 100 NYM in profit for an epoch. In this case you receive 20 NYM as operator rewards, and the remaining 80 NYM is split among the stakers of your node proportionally to the size of their stake stake. As the operator, you must have some stake on your own&nbsp;node.</p> Impact of minimum profit margin and maximum operator&nbsp;cost <p>Maximum PM and OC are simple safeguards protecting stakers from abusive behavior. Reducing the minimum OC from 40 NYM to 0 NYM was requested by a few old node operators with highly saturated nodes — OC doesn’t matter to them as much anymore, and 0 is a nice round&nbsp;number.</p><p>The most impactful change is the implementation of a minimum PM. Previously the network-wide average PM was around 5% and some nodes had even lower values at 1% or even 0%. As the minimum is now 20% across the board, the share of operator and staker rewards shifted&nbsp;notably.</p><p>Staker APY has changed roughly from 13% to 10%. Meanwhile, average operator rewards have doubled from 1.4 NYM per epoch (about 24 NYM per day) to more than 2.8 NYM per epoch (or 51.5 NYM per day) for high performing nodes with a min. 20% stake saturation.</p><p>These changes are in line with the projections shared and discussed with the Nym community during the vote on <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/incentivizing-privacy-not-surveillance-nym-nodes-approve-min-profit-margin-8bbfa5732128">instituting the minimum profit&nbsp;margin</a>.</p><p>Note: Not all operators will necessarily see an effect of these changes. The actual increase in rewards depends on their individual parameters and performance. For example, not all operators will be in the active set in every epoch, so their rewards will not reach the top&nbsp;level.</p><p>The changes only come into effect when a node actually gets into the active set and gets their first reward since the contract update. Underperforming nodes might therefore still show in the explorer as having a PM or an OC outside of the currently permitted bounds.</p> What next? <p>Nym node rewards will be changing significantly over the next months in line with the Nym roadmap. As announced earlier this year, this includes the completion of “project smoosh,” gateways joining the reward set (with reward ratios also the result of community vote), and credentials kicking in as evidence of work done in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>The Nym team has collated all of these upcoming changes in a Nym node roadmap. The roadmap will be presented at a Nym node town hall that will take place on the 10&nbsp;October.</p><p>All current and potential Nym node operators and stakers are invited. Further details, agenda, and invitations will circulate over the next couple of weeks.

 Ramping up the fight against global censorship <p>Combatting censorship is one of the biggest challenges that <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-a-vpn">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs</a>)&nbsp;face.</p><p>Censorship measures against privacy technologies are becoming more intense worldwide, especially in authoritarian countries. The future of VPN privacy technology will be found only in novel network designs which can circumvent them.</p><p>Recognizing that the stakes for millions of users is the freedom to information and expression, Nym is rising to the challenge by expanding its team of researchers and developers. Yesterday, Nym welcomed Jack Wampler as the newest addition to its censorship resistance team.</p><blockquote>“Censorship resistance is important because information access is leveraged as a weapon to squash dissent and remove accountability,” Jack Wampler reminds us. “Circumvention ensures that those who need it most have the ability to: access reliable news and education materials, communicate with loved ones during times of crisis, and organize without fear of reprisal.”</blockquote> Jack’s path to&nbsp;Nym <p>Jack completed his Ph.D. in Computer Engineering with a focus on Privacy &amp; Security from the ECEE department at the University of Colorado Boulder. His work explores ways to deploy solutions for security, privacy, and anonymity, especially as they involve cryptography, hardware security, and emerging internet protocols.</p><p>He is the core developer of Conjure, the first widely deployed refraction networking proxy, built primarily in Golang for censorship circumvention. Conceptually, <a href="https://refraction.network/">refraction networking</a> works by incorporating the network infrastructure (Internet Service Providers, etc.) into proxy systems to make censorship more difficult.</p><p>Jack is also actively working on rust implementations for pluggable transports and network traffic obfuscation as part of a <a href="https://github.com/jmwample/ptrs">Pluggable Transports in Rust (PTRS)</a> project. The goals are to (1) lower the barrier to entry for writing secure pluggable transports in Rust, and (2) to implement several cutting-edge protocols using that framework.</p> Jack’s work at&nbsp;Nym <p>Jack is joining the Nym team as a Research and Development Specialist to help design the next generation of privacy technologies. Alongside a growing team of censorship resistance researchers and testers on the ground across the world, Jack will help Nym provide secure and safe communications for users in regions where it matters the most. This includes deploying cutting edge protocols, ensuring resistance against future cryptographic threats like quantum computing, and developing measurement techniques to understand the needs of numerous unique user-bases.</p><blockquote>“One of the biggest challenges in community driven censorship resistance is finding ways to support your volunteer community,” Jack notes. “Nym is at this unique intersection of network privacy and web3 technologies. It has more agility than a traditional VPN, supported by the distributed nature of the network which ensures that everyone contributing is backed by the community as a whole. This is a powerful combination with huge potential for positive impact when married with circumvention technologies.”</blockquote> Conclusion <p>Please join us in welcoming Jack to the Nym team! Fighting censorship requires the best minds and technicians, and Nym is thrilled to put Jack’s extensive expertise to work for <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> users worldwide. Check out his <a href="https://jack.wampler.co/">research projects&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>And stay tuned for more news this week and a new series of posts providing a deep dive on the threat of censorship today and what Nym is doing about&nbsp;it.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-welcomes-new-researcher-to-its-censorship-resistance-team-2de65debcfcb">Nym welcomes new researcher to its censorship resistance team</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This post describes <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09676">work</a> by Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Peter Snyder, Ralph Giles, Aurélien Bellet, and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Brave’s Privacy Researcher Ali Shahin Shamsabadi.</p>
<p>We are excited to introduce Nebula, a novel and best-in-class system developed by Brave Research for product usage analytics with differential privacy guarantees. Nebula combines several cutting-edge privacy enhancement technologies (including verifiable user-side thresholding and sample-and-threshold differential privacy) to get useful insights about the product usage/feedback of a population (i.e., many Brave users) without learning anything about the choices of individuals in the population (i.e., each individual Brave user).</p>
<p>Nebula benefits users: it guarantees user privacy without requiring prohibitive trust assumptions. Nebula also enables Brave to achieve better utility and lower server-facing overhead compared to existing solutions based on the local and shuffling models of differential privacy.</p>
<p>Brave Research shares the implementation so that other projects can use it.</p>

 Product analytics&nbsp; 
<p>Developers would need to learn how Brave features are being used by many users to be able to improve user experience on the Web. For example, Brave developers would need to learn how well <a>Brave privacy-preserving Cookie Banner removal</a> works by asking the question “<a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/P3A#q68-if-you-have-viewed-the-cookie-consent-block-prompt-how-did-you-react">If you have viewed the cookie consent block prompt, how did you react?</a>” However, each individual user’s choice needs to be private. As shown in the below chart, Nebula allows Brave to determine how much and where resources need to be allocated to block privacy-harming cookies for users and understand the popularity order of reactions without learning the reaction and cookie banners that each individual user sees. Nebula’s differential privacy guarantees ensure that the same conclusions, for example most users react with blocking cookie notices when seeing cookie banners, can be made independently of whether any individual user opts into or opts out of contributing their answer to the above question.&nbsp;</p>


    
    

    




      
      
    
<p>Nebula enables developers to learn how Brave features are being used and to improve user experience on the Web, without risking users’ privacy.&nbsp;</p>

 Nebula put Brave users first in product analytics 
 
 
<p>Nebula guarantees users’ privacy. Brave cares about safeguarding the privacy of our users. Nebula provides formal <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">differential privacy</a>  guarantees ensuring that the product analytics leak as little as possible about each user’s choice. Brave does not even get to know the presence or absence of a user, let alone learning their data. Differential privacy is a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy.</p>
 
 
<p>Nebula enables better auditability, verifiability, and transparency. Nebula’s usage means that users do not have to blindly trust Brave. Users are always in control of whether they want to contribute any data, know which data they are contributing, and when they are contributing. We open-sourced Nebula as part of the <a>Brave’s STAR</a>. In previous blog posts, we’ve talked about how we originally designed our <a>Privacy-Preserving Analytics</a> system and then improved it with <a>Brave’s STAR</a>. Now we’ve developed a further improvement using differential privacy, giving our users unmatched privacy protection.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Nebula is efficient with very little user-facing cost. Local computation on the user side similarly requires very little effort.</p>
 
 
<p>Nebula’s inherently efficient design ensures that companies of all sizes can affordably protect their users’ privacy in their product analytics while also minimising negative environmental impacts.</p>

 Nebula design 
<p>At a high level, Nebula works as follows:</p>
 
 
<p>Local and verifiable user-side sampling.&nbsp; The user decides to submit their data with a small probability, otherwise they abstain from submitting their real data.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Local user data encryption. Users that do decide to participate  (based on the outcome of their coin flip) locally encrypt their value using <a>Brave’s STAR</a> secret sharing scheme. This secret sharing process has a negligible (compute/memory) overhead for users.</p>
 
 
<p>Dummy data. A small number of users submit additional dummy data to obscure the distribution of uncommon (i.e., unrevealed) values.</p>
 
 
<p>Data aggregation. Brave recovers values and their associated counts using the inverse of the secret-sharing system which ensures that Brave cannot learn user values unless sufficiently many users sent the exact same value.&nbsp;</p>
 
 

 Nebula satisfies differential privacy 
<p>Nebulas enforces formal differential privacy protection for users through three steps: 1) the uncertainty of any particular user contributing any value; 2) blinding Brave to uncommon values through the secret-sharing mechanism (i.e., thresholding); 3) having some users contribute precisely defined amounts of dummy data to obscure the distribution of uncommon values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Panther Protocol will provide private access to DeFi while providing access to compliance tools supporting the new frontier of on-chain finance. Last month, Panther Ventures’ Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, and Chief Architect, Vadim Konstantinov <a href="https://ethcc.io/archive/private-compliant-DeFi-protocols-myth-vs-reality?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">presented the protocol’s latest vision for secure and private decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem</a> at the Ethereum Community Conference 2024 (EthCC). This blog delves into that vision.&nbsp;</p> A New Era for DeFi: Privacy and Compliance <p>Panther Protocol’s mission is to provide on-chain privacy infrastructure for regulated financial services providers, enabling them to operate private trading <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#shielded-pool-zones">Zones</a> with customizable rules that can be aligned with local or regional regulatory requirements. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies, financial service providers who deal in digital assets face increasing challenges in finding solutions that are compliant without compromising the privacy and security of their users. <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/what-is-panther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> is being developed specifically to address this challenge.</p><p>KYC and KYT Attestations: Ensuring Trust and Security</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/compliance-providers?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYT (Know Your Transaction) attestations</a> are critical in today’s regulatory landscape. In its initial releases, Panther Protocol will support the use of first and (for use where permitted) third-party KYC/KYT services, including <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">Panther Protocol partner, PureFi</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Panther’s use of circuit-friendly signatures and Zero-Knowledge Proofs will have the capability to enable verification without exposing sensitive data, thus preserving even more user privacy. Where allowed, Panther’s Zero-Knowledge Proofs could be used to establish that regulatory conditions have been met. In the future, we believe using Zero-Knowledge Proofs will become the preferred way to satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving the user’s privacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther’s client-side proof generation will also be conducted through user’s browsers, as this method best preserves the privacy of the user’s information. Panther will use the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/cryptographic-primitives/zk-snarks/groth16?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Groth16 proving system</a> to meet basic browser requirements while minimizing computational resource demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>zAccount and Zones: A Dual-Layer Approach to Privacy</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/zaccount?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAccounts</a> and Zones are integral components of Panther’s architecture. zAccounts function as private on-chain identifiers that link user transactions without revealing personally identifiable information (PII). Zones, configurable by operators, enforce KYC/KYT rules and transaction limits, helping to align activities within the Zone to compliance standards. This dual-layer approach allows VASPs, and other regulated operators, to tailor privacy and compliance measures to their specific needs.</p><p>Data Escrow: Safeguarding Transactional Privacy</p><p>When transactions occur within Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pools</a>, they will generate encrypted data that is stored in a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/compliance-providers?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#data-escrow">data escrow system</a>. This transaction data will be encrypted using Zero-Knowledge Proofs and zkSNARKs, ensuring that the details remain confidential and can only be accessed under predefined circumstances (rules set by a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Manager</a>). The escrow system will be configurable, where allowed, to be managed by the Forensic Data Escrow Operator (FDEO), which holds the decryption key necessary to access the escrowed data but cannot do so unilaterally. Access to the escrowed data will require the activation of the Zone’s rules, as defined by the respective Zone Manager. Alternatively, the escrow system could be configured to provide unfettered access to the Zone Manager, as required.&nbsp;</p><p>When regulators require information, (for example, for&nbsp; the purpose of submitting reports to regulators, such as a suspicious activity report, or when requested by law enforcement), the protocol will be able to be configured so that the Zone Manager can access it on demand, relaying relevant data to regulators as required. Alternatively, where permissible, this data could bebe decrypted and disclosed in accordance with pre-programmed rules, set by the Zone Manager.</p><p>The system also supports <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/what-is-panther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#selective-disclosures">selective disclosures</a>, allowing specific parts of a transaction history to be revealed (for example, for auditing purposes) and providing mathematical proofs to validate these disclosures without revealing the entire transaction history. Disclosing information in this way ensures that only the minimum information necessary for the check or audit is revealed without including any additional data. This mechanism balances user privacy with compliance needs, leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques and a collaborative access model.</p><p>Smart compliance: the future of compliant privacy</p><p>Smart Compliance includes zAccounts, Data Escrow, and KYT Attestations, which will help to align Panther’s Zones to regulatory standards but also reduce the risk of illicit activities by enforcing rules by allowlisting customized lists of participants and assets, placing limitations on transactions and more.&nbsp; While Panther Protocol will be used in its initial releases by Zone Managers who use first-person KYC/KYT with full access to the FDOE’s transaction data, in the future (and where allowed today), we expect that Zero-Knowledge smart compliance will become the preferred method of providing evidence of compliance. Using a combination of the technologies described above, will preserve the maximum privacy possible for users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since its <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04586">discovery in 2006</a>, programmable DNA nanofabrication with DNA origami has attracted immense interest due to excellent programmability and biocompatibility with many applications including in cell and gene therapies, nanoelectronics and sensors, and delivery technologies in diverse areas such as cancer immunotherapy and even in materials science. However, the deployment and commercialization of the technology has thus far been slow and commercial traction limited due to challenges in scalability and in designing and assembling the DNA structures themselves.</p><p><a href="https://www.cptx.bio/">CPTx</a> founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendrik-dietz/">Hendrik Dietz</a> has been at the forefront of applied DNA nanofabrication research for decades and his work, which has been published in leading scientific journals, has become the centerpiece of the company. The first applications are tackling two complementary areas (a) creating a pathogen agnostic antiviral platform designed for targeted viral interventions and (b) the large-scale production of short and gene-length DNA single strands at massive scales (“GXstrands”). Both the antiviral platform and GXstrands applications are interrelated: the large-scale production of specific oligonucleotide pools is critical in creating more specialized antiviral motifs for a broader range of viral pathogens; while the high-quality gene-length DNA strands produced by GXstrands will be used in the R&amp;D phases of the the new antiviral therapeutics, accelerating the time-to-market for additional iterations of the&nbsp;product.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>There are over 200 known viruses that could infect humans which cause a wide range of diseases, from mild illnesses like the common cold to severe and life-threatening conditions like HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and COVID-19; not to mention the constant threat of novel zoonotic-related viruses (or the risk of viruses as emerging bioweapons). Although successful drugs can generate billions in revenue (such as the hepatitis C drug combo from Gilead which made $10 billion in 2015 alone), there are only limited options for effective antiviral treatments. We believe CPTx has an opportunity to leverage their knowledge and capabilities in DNA nanofabrication to build the first truly programmable antiviral platform, as well as to produce high-quality oligonucleotide pools and gene-length DNA single strands to supply the growing demand for nucleic acids, particularly from emerging cell and gene therapy therapies, with the aim to become a leading supplier for the entire pharma industry.</p><p>We are excited to be backing CPTx on their mission to pioneer next-gen antiviral and biodefense solutions, based on programmable DNA nanofabrication.

<p>Hello, Welcome to Version 3 of the <a href="https://toolbox.pivx.org/">PIVX&nbsp;Toolbox.</a></p><p>First, lets look at some of the more notable&nbsp;changes:</p>  Unified styling on ALL pages (result pages now look similar to form and home&nbsp;pages)  Even more mobile friendly compared to previous&nbsp;version  Simpler user experience throughout the&nbsp;site  Completely re-written front end utilizing the latest Bootstrap 5.3.x  Removed jQuery dependency  True PIVX address detection and verification (previous version was pretty&nbsp;janky)  Exchange addresses now fully supported  Added hover animations and tooltips throughout site  Themed language&nbsp;dropdown  Simpler, faster, more modern looking navigation menu  Webkit (Chrome based browsers) now have purple themed scroll-bars  Reduced codebase contributes to an overall faster performance  More noticeable errors and&nbsp;alerts  Higher contrast button colors for better accessability  <p>It’s crazy but the current iteration of the <a href="https://toolbox.pivx.org/">PIVX Toolbox</a> (I’m calling it version 2) has been around for almost 4 years with almost 100% uptime working tirelessly and reliably helping PIVX users. If memory serves, version 1 was made in collaboration with Zenzo. While it was a start, it under-delivered in almost every way. Here’s an old screenshot comparing V2 to V1 for those that don’t remember:</p> A Few Before and After Pictures For Comparison: <p>V2-V3 performance comparison. A reduced code-base contributes to an overall performance increase.</p><p>My Transactions, simplified and easier to read. All pages (home, form, result) now have a similar theme with rounded and centered icon on top and similar backgrounds. Much less confusing. Also added is a permalink button so users can bookmark their addresses.</p><p>Masternode Status Check has similar improvements. Much easier to decipher results. Like the Transactions page, a permalink button is added so users can bookmark their Masternode status.</p><p>Rewards Estimator is simplified with a single toggle to include Masternodes. Notice the better contrast&nbsp;buttons.</p><p>All help sections boast significantly improved formatting and readability, for example this Snapshots help&nbsp;screen.</p><p>Themed language drop-down navigation with auto drop-down on large&nbsp;screens</p><p>Simpler navigation menu along with more modern looking hamburger and language buttons (removed backgrounds and&nbsp;borders)</p><p>Better errors and alerts, also notice the proper handling of PIVX addresses.</p><p>All modals (pop up boxes) have improved contrast for better visibility</p><p>Unified theme example, home, form, and result pages look&nbsp;similar.</p> Conclusion <p>Almost every file has been modified. Some slightly, others completely replaced. Also note that NO DAO funds have been used to create this Masterpiece (well, maybe not a Masterpiece but definitely better than before).Is there room for improvement? ABSOLUTELY!

Its name comes from the combination of “tupinimquim,” a way of referring to “things made in Brazil” and its indigenous people + Nym. The squad focuses on the decentralized management of the Lusophone community, operating more than 20 nodes, and representing Nym at events. The group is made up of programmers and software engineering students with an interest in hacktivism and the defense of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The following is a guest post authored by two members of TupiNymQuim on what is happening in their country regarding the social effects of big tech and social media platforms, democratic struggles, and the free access to information and communication technologies.</p> X (Twitter), VPNs, and the threshold between privacy, freedom, and&nbsp;crime <p>The issue is simple: if VPNs did what they were supposed to do, governments wouldn’t know which sites you access. But things aren’t so&nbsp;simple.</p> The problem <p>As commentators on the recent escalation surrounding the suspension of X in Brazil, it’s important to refuse two things simultaneously:</p>  A false and empty notion of the freedom of expression to legitimize crimes and extremist political projects  The overthrow of a platform that still remained relevant to the Brazilian public&nbsp;debate  <p>Even if the criticism of the worsening quality of X, formerly known as Twitter, was legitimate, the reality is that the platform was a still relevant vehicle for information and communication in Brazil, especially in the political sphere.</p><p>But the controversy surrounding Minister Alexandre de Moraes’ decision to take down the platform in Brazil is the culmination of a more serious problem. How do we behave towards individuals who have a mega-infrastructure (and fortune) being used to make their extremist political positions echo so&nbsp;loudly?</p><p>The immunity in which big tech companies operate with their supposed political neutrality is just a chimera aimed at protecting their own image and business. When politically relevant, these companies end up supporting political projects out of self-interest, as <a href="https://apublica.org/nota/ia-governo-defende-soberania-enquanto-big-techs-atuam-no-congresso/">recently happened</a> in the Brazilian Congress.</p><p>The truth is that it’s easy to stay out of controversy when the criteria for what can and can’t be viralized are in their custody. Or rather, when it’s hidden in thousands of lines of closed code, ultimately unknown to society as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>If big tech and X present themselves as convenient means of accessing information relevant to public life, why aren’t they auditable? And more importantly, what can we do when a select owner of one of these networks shouts in favor of an extreme right-wing agenda?</p> Why do billionaires see themselves as superhumans? <p>In the end, Elon Musk simply saw another business opportunity with his control of a network that yields such an enormous influence on political debate. Instead of strategic silence, the entrepreneur opted for the targeted use of X’s toxic noise in order to increase his revenue in other businesses.</p><a href="https://www.poder360.com.br/midia/musk-posta-foto-com-xi-jinping-e-fala-em-prosperidade-para-todos/">Source</a><p>Hypocrisy is hardly not enough to describe Musk’s behavior. By rivaling a young democracy like Brazil’s, which recently resisted and defeated an anti-democratic coup, and by silencing himself and posing alongside authoritarian leaders, Musk reveals that his fight for the freedom of expression ends when it is no longer convenient.</p><p>Instead of questioning the absurdities of Musk’s Trumpist stance (and its necessary link to the implosion of democracy), we might as well ask: why do we allow the voice of a single individual, especially a wealthy one, to echo so loudly? Why do we let him dictate the axes of this debate on his network? Why do we listen to his empty rantings instead of putting him in his&nbsp;place?</p><p>We say: he is no more than a parasite who doesn’t care about any agenda other than his own enrichment.</p><p>The truth is that society lets this abyssal discrepancy grow as we fail to combat big tech. This happens when we accept abusive privacy terms, <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/tecnologia/noticia/entenda-o-escandalo-de-uso-politico-de-dados-que-derrubou-valor-do-facebook-e-o-colocou-na-mira-de-autoridades.ghtml">let them interfere in our elections</a>, or allow network infrastructures to be increasingly concentrated in their&nbsp;hands.</p><p>In addition to combating Musk’s extremist messages, we need to regulate the actions of individuals who yield so much influence over the structure of communications, giving them disproportionate influence over ideological views (whether democratic or anti-democratic).</p> The democracy of&nbsp;judges <p>Moraes [who declared the ban on X] was appointed to the Supreme Court by the previous president Michel Temer. Temer took over the presidency after carrying out a coup in coalition with Congress to oust the then-president Dilma Rousseff. Moraes was also Temer’s Justice Minister before being appointed to the Supreme&nbsp;Court.</p><p>Having maintained close ties with the right-wing in São Paulo for more than 20 years, Moraes saw the political niche in which he had built himself collapse. After 2016, the traditional Brazilian right, which had been building itself up over 30 years of democracy, was quickly replaced by Bolsonarism. With the old right now almost extinct, Moraes migrated from conservatism to the opposite political spectrum.</p>In 2016, Moraes, as Minister of Justice, cutting cannabis plants in a campaign to “<a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/noticia/2023/08/03/anos-antes-de-votar-pela-descriminalizacao-alexandre-de-moraes-cortou-pes-de-maconha-no-paraguai-video-viraliza.ghtml">eradicate marijuana in&nbsp;Brazil</a>”<p>Having recently voted in favor of decriminalizing marijuana, Moraes now shows that, in addition to being a judge, he is really a political chameleon adapting himself to the situation he finds himself in. How might he have acted if he had been judging not the anti-democratic acts of Bolsonaro in 2023, but rather the <a href="https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2014/10/psdb-pede-ao-tse-auditoria-para-verificar-lisura-da-eleicao.html">beginning of that coup challenge in 2014</a> made by the candidate Aécio Neves, from his former party, the PSDB? Are the crimes committed by the right-wing political milieu from which Moraes grew up less serious than the opposite spectrum in which he now finds&nbsp;himself?</p><p>These rhetorical questions only serve to challenge the fairness of politically appointed judges. They also serve as a critique of the recent concentration of power in the hands of the judiciary and the possible risks to Brazilian democracy, which often sees the institutional position of <a href="https://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2014/11/cnj-analisa-conduta-de-juiz-que-deu-voz-de-prisao-agente-em-blitz-no-rio.html">judges shielded from the abuses they commit</a> and the <a href="https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/politica/amigos-fazem-vaquinha-para-ajudar-jornalista-a-pagar-r-310-mil-a-gilmar-mendes/">controversies in which they become involved</a>.</p>Sculpture “A justiça” [To justice] vandalized. <a href="https://soupetropolis.com/2023/01/09/voce-sabia-que-a-escultura-a-justica-vandalizada-no-palacio-do-planalto-tem-ligacao-com-petropolis/">Source</a><p>A fundamental principle of democracy is the existence of a balance between the different poles of power (judicial, executive, and parliamentary). However, how can we protect ourselves when this balance is broken? Or when it is theoretically coherent but widely disregarded in practice? What risks do we run when we see a judiciary that increasingly rules by decree and gives extraordinary powers to its&nbsp;leaders?</p> How do governments watch&nbsp;you? <p>In a nutshell: through the exchange of information from Internet Service Providers (ISPs), either voluntarily or through judicial subpoenas. In Brazil, some of the ISPs are Claro, Vivo, and TIM. Even if your content is encrypted, all the metadata of your communication (such as where you talk from, or who you talk to, or the size of your data — whether it’s text, image, video — is&nbsp;exposed.</p><p>We inherited the choice made not to build privacy into the architecture of the Internet, and now we are suffering from a broken network dominated by large conglomerates — including a few companies forming the basis for the network’s hardware — who are symbiotically linked to corporate and state surveillance.</p><p>But all that was solved with VPNs,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Unfortunately, no.</p><p><a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-a-vpn">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</a> as a technology are weak due to an architectural choice: if we don’t trust our ISPs and believe that they will leak our information to third parties, why trust a VPN? In that case, we’re just transferring trust.

<p>The <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42407-proposed-tokenomics-for-horizen-2-0/718">ZenIP 42407 proposal</a> has been published on the Horizen DAO Discourse. The ZenIP 42407 proposal is a comprehensive plan for future ZEN tokenomics as Horizen transitions from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to a more efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model and an ecosystem optimized for ZK. </p>
<p>This shift is part of Horizen’s larger goal to enhance its ecosystem for decentralized applications, particularly those utilizing zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. The proposed tokenomics changes address the distribution of remaining ZEN tokens, vesting schedules, and rewards systems to ensure sustainable growth, network security, and incentivization for ecosystem participants.</p>





 Key Highlights of ZenIP 42407 



<p></p>
 
 ZEN Allocations: 
 
<p>The ZenIP 42407 proposes to make notable changes to the allocation of block rewards:</p>
 
 
 
 Horizen Foundation: The Foundation’s share of block rewards is proposed to increase from 20% to 32.5%. This increase will support long-term initiatives such as ecosystem development, market stability, and infrastructure growth. The additional resources aim to strengthen the Horizen Foundation’s role in driving development across the ecosystem​. 
 DAO Treasury: The DAO Treasury is set to receive 27.5% of the total emissions. This allocation includes specific tracks like the ZEN Sustainability Initiative (17.5%), grants (5%), and growth/marketing efforts (5%) to ensure the ecosystem’s continued expansion. 
 Collator Rewards: The remaining 40% of the emissions is proposed to be used to fund the security budget, which is essential for compensating Collators and their Delegators under the new Proof-of-Stake model​ 
 
 
 
<p>Emission Schedule &amp; Vesting:<br>A gradual vesting schedule is proposed for the remaining $ZEN tokens. Only 25% will be released at the time of migration to Horizen 2.0, with the remaining 75% vesting monthly over 48 months. This schedule helps maintain the sustainability of the network’s resources over time.</p>
 
 
<p>New Way to Earn Staking Rewards :<br>Collators (validators) and Delegators will receive rewards through a smoothly declining emissions schedule, which preserves the max supply of 21 million $ZEN. This change is designed to create predictability and long-term participation incentives for network stakeholders​</p>
 
 
<p>Elimination of the Halving Schedule:<br>The traditional block reward halving schedule will be replaced with a gradual emissions reduction, smoothing out the supply decreases and reducing market volatility. This adjustment is expected to mitigate speculative behavior while promoting healthier long-term participation.</p>
 
 



 Why Propose These Changes? 



<p>The motivation behind ZenIP 42407 is rooted in Horizen’s evolving vision.</p>
<p>As the platform shifts from being a privacy-focused cryptocurrency and a traditional UTXO blockchain to a robust ecosystem for decentralized apps, its tokenomics needs to reflect this new focus. By incentivizing participants through staking and ensuring a stable financial foundation for community and infrastructure growth, these changes aim to support Horizen’s leadership in the competitive ZK application space.</p>



 Impact on the Horizen Ecosystem? 



<p>If passed, ZenIP 42407 will:</p>
 
 Network Security 
 
<p>Collators will take over from PoW miners, securing the Horizen 2.0 network and receiving a significant portion of $ZEN rewards.</p>
 
 Attract More Developers 
 
<p>By allocating more funds toward ecosystem development, the proposal aims to attract top-tier projects to build within Horizen’s ecosystem, ensuring a sustainable pipeline of innovative applications.</p>
 
 Increased Funding for Ecosystem Growth 
 
<p>More <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%24ZEN&amp;src=cashtag_click">$ZEN</a> will be allocated to the Horizen Foundation and DAO Treasury, ensuring we have resources to fund development, developer initiatives, and marketing efforts.</p>
 
 Reduce Market Speculation 
 
<p>A gradual emissions decline mitigates the market disruptions typically associated with halving events​.</p>
 
 Strengthen Governance 
 
<p>The inclusion of a DAO-managed treasury will empower the community to drive initiatives aligned with Horizen’s mission, enhancing decentralized governance.</p>
 Next Steps 
<p>ZenIP 42407 is currently open for administrative review and community feedback. After the administrative review is completed by the Special Council of the Horizen DAO, the proposal will proceed to a community vote.</p>
<p>This is a critical opportunity for the community to weigh in on the future of Horizen’s tokenomics, and members are encouraged to participate in discussions and review the full proposal​.</p>



 FAQ 



<p>1. What is the max supply of $ZEN tokens proposed?<br>The total supply of $ZEN is capped at 21 million tokens, which will remain unchanged despite the proposed adjustments​.</p>
<p>2. How will this proposal impact staking rewards?&nbsp;<br>Staking rewards for Collators and Delegators will be distributed through a gradually declining emissions schedule, ensuring predictable and stable rewards over time​.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Why replace the halving schedule?<br>The proposal replaces halving with a smoother emissions reduction to avoid market volatility and speculative behavior triggered by abrupt changes in rewards​.</p>
<p>4. How can the community participate in the decision-making process?<br>Community members can participate by reviewing the proposal, <a>joining discussions</a>, and voting during the DAO community voting process​.</p>

For new transactions to be verified (for example, to ensure that a coin isn’t being spent twice), this full ledger (contained in blocks) must be constantly updated and checked. Therein lies two unsolved problems for blockchain technology:</p>  How can a blockchain scale without straining the resources of verifiers who must use their own bandwidth and resources to verify transactions for the communal&nbsp;chain?  Do more efficient means of data verification come at the cost of chain security?  <p>Mustafa Al-Bassam, the co-founder of <a href="https://celestia.org/">Celestia</a> and computer security researcher, <a href="https://forum.celestia.org/t/security-levels-for-data-availability-for-light-nodes/919">diagnoses the problem</a> in the following way: as block sizes grow, running “full nodes” for data availability verification becomes increasingly resource intensive. The introduction of committees and light nodes are more efficient alternatives, but they can be vulnerable to a specific network attack known as selective disclosures.</p><p>The Nym team has been working closely with Celestia, researching how the <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet">Nym mixnet</a> might be able to add an anonymization layer to the blockchain verification process in order to protect against this particular attack. As we will see, this would involve a mode of Unlinkable Data Availability Sampling.</p><p>Before sketching Nym’s solution, let’s first look at the technical nature of the problem for blockchains in scaling without relying on full nodes, and how existing solutions leave blockchains open to selective disclosure attacks.</p> Data availability verification <p>Data availability refers to the guarantee that all the data in a blockchain block has been properly published and can be accessed when needed by the network. This ensures that all the necessary information related to a block is available for nodes to download and verify so the network can validate the correctness and completeness of the block’s transactions and&nbsp;state.</p><p>In blockchain systems, verifying data availability is crucial in preventing malicious actors from hiding or withholding parts of a block’s data while still claiming the block as valid. Without data availability, a block could be added to the chain with missing or incomplete data, potentially leading to invalid transactions, security risks, and an inconsistent state across the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Traditional blockchains require users (running full nodes) to verify all data by syncing the entire chain. But ensuring data availability can be challenging, especially as block sizes&nbsp;grow.</p><p>Techniques like data availability sampling allow light nodes to verify the availability of data without downloading the entire block, making data availability verification more efficient overall. Modern blockchains take this approach to verify data availability with fewer resources. <a href="https://celestia.org/">Celestia</a> is the leading example in the use of data availability to power all the modern&nbsp;chains.</p> Mechanisms for scaling, securely and insecurely <p>There are several ways that data availability verification can be achieved with different levels of security:</p> Full Nodes (maximum security) <p>Full nodes verify all data by downloading everything to ensure maximum security by rejecting incomplete blocks. This baseline solution, however, becomes increasingly inefficient as block sizes grow. Afterall, it takes physical and financial resources to perform this verification work.</p> No Data Availability Guarantee (zero security) <p>There is no guarantee that data is available, only a commitment (like IPFS URIs). This may be sufficient for scenarios like NFTs where safety isn’t required, but it is certainly not a solution for most chain transactions with real&nbsp;stakes.</p> Data Availability Committee <p>Through an honest majority, a select committee guarantees that data is available, thus balancing data availability with performance.</p><p>Data Availability Committee with Crypto Economic&nbsp;Security</p><p>This method also faces the same problem of scaling, since committee members face growing data overheads to perform verification work. To ameliorate this, committees can also be “crypto economically incentivized,” that is, provided tokens in proportion to the verification work performed.</p><p>Committees can also be penalized (“slashed” or “halted”) if they are dishonest, thus increasing overall security. This works when the committee is part of the chain’s consensus mechanism.</p><p>Light nodes</p><p>Introducing light nodes into this framework can also allow for data availability checks, thus further reducing resource requirements. There are two ways of doing&nbsp;this:</p>  Data Availability Sampling without an Honest Minority of Light Nodes: Light nodes use sampling techniques to verify data without downloading the entire block, but they can’t guarantee full data recovery if some data is missing. This relies on the data availability committee and sampling interfaces.  Data Availability Sampling with Honest Minority of Light Nodes: If there’s a minority of honest light nodes, they can reconstruct a block if any data is withheld to enhance security. Note that a synchronous network is needed for nodes to share data effectively.   Unlinkable Data Availability Sampling <p>This advanced level prevents targeted attacks (like selective share disclosures, which we will delve into next) by making requests from light nodes unlinkable and uniformly random. This would require further advancements in anonymization technologies, which is where Nym’s solution comes into&nbsp;play.</p><p>But first, what makes these prior solutions inadequate and vulnerable exactly?</p> The problem: Selective disclosure attacks <p>A <a href="https://forum.celestia.org/t/research-analysis-of-the-selective-disclosure-attack/825">selective disclosure attack</a> is a type of data availability attack where a malicious adversary tries to convince a node (or multiple nodes) that a block’s data is fully available when, in reality, part of it is withheld. This effectively makes the block incomplete or unrecoverable.</p><p>The attacker’s goal is to manipulate the verification process by selectively responding to queries for block data in a peer-to-peer network. In the end, it breaks consensus, forks the chain, and compromises real transactions and overall&nbsp;trust.</p><p>So here’s how it works, based on the updated understanding.</p> Overview of the&nbsp;Attack <p>The attack has two simultaneous components:</p>  The adversary withholds enough data shares from the block so that it cannot be reconstructed by the network, making the block unavailable.  Simultaneously, the adversary selectively responds to queries from the target light nodes so that they believe the block is available.   Mechanism of the&nbsp;attack <p>The network relies on data availability sampling (DAS) where light nodes request random samples of block data from other nodes to verify the availability.</p>  In a selective disclosure attack, the adversary identifies a portion of the block’s data to withhold, ensuring the block cannot be reconstructed.  However, the adversary selectively responds to the queries of honest nodes, such as light clients, by providing data from the shares that were not withheld. This creates the false appearance that the block is fully available.   Challenges for Honest&nbsp;Nodes   Since adversarial nodes are indistinguishable from honest ones and respond correctly when queried, they cannot be blacklisted unless they are detected.  Honest nodes make sample requests, and the adversary’s responses appear valid because the withheld data is hidden from the specific queries of the honest&nbsp;nodes.   Two solutions   One suggested countermeasure is adding an anonymization layer where the source of each sample request cannot be linked to the client (light node) and requests are processed in a random order across the network. This prevents the adversary from targeting specific nodes with selective disclosure.  Another approach involves ensuring each node makes a sufficient number of queries (increasing the chances of detecting withheld data), or relying on a large enough number of nodes to cover the missing&nbsp;shares.   Simulation results   If a client makes a small number of queries (e.g., 15), the probability of a successful attack is relatively high (~0.0133) — the adversary could trick the client after about 75 attempts.  As the number of queries per client increases (e.g., to 50 queries), the probability of the attack succeeding drops dramatically (to nearly&nbsp;0).  Similarly, targeting more clients increases the attack’s success rate, but the probability decreases as the number of queries&nbsp;rises.   Summary of the&nbsp;problem <p>The selective disclosure attack manipulates data availability sampling by selectively revealing data to specific nodes, convincing them that the block is fully available. Countermeasures involve using (1) anonymization techniques and (2) ensuring that clients make enough random queries to detect missing&nbsp;data.</p> Possible solutions investigated <p>In an “<a href="https://www.commonprefix.com/static/clients/celestia/celestia_report_private_networks.pdf">Evaluation of private networks for Celestia</a>,” researchers analyzed different possible solutions for adding an anonymity layer to Celestia’s blockchain. Possible private network solutions included:</p>  A Tor network overlay with Snowflake to mask Tor traffic with WebRTC and prevent eavesdropping  Mixnet integration, such as with Nym’s <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity17/sec17-piotrowska.pdf">Loopix</a>, for traffic anonymization  Latency tolerances that implement randomized delays in traffic to desynchronize the queries of&nbsp;clients  Cover traffic or dummy traffic to conceal real query&nbsp;patterns  The use of VPNs for additional protections  <p>These solutions each have advantages and downsides (e.g., in terms of possible latency).</p><p>Setting aside the advantages and many problems posed by a Tor overlay, it’s important to note that many of these core solutions are network techniques (e.g. cover traffic and randomized delays) already in operation with Nym mixnet. So the Nym core team decided to pursue a R&amp;D investigation to see what Nym could do to help Celestia and others make a more private blockchain experience.</p> Nym’s Anonymous Sampling&nbsp;solution <p>Nym Technologies proposes to integrate its infrastructure with modular networks, leveraging the Nym mixnet as an anonymization layer to address selective disclosure attacks through Private Data Availability Sampling&nbsp;(P-DAS).</p><p>P-DAS enables requests via the Nym Mixnet, decoupling the request from the requester, which ensures that the requester cannot be targeted. This method provides a privacy-preserving, secure approach to data availability sampling, allowing nodes to verify data availability without exposure to adversarial attacks.</p><p>A Nym Mixnet integration could offer several key benefits:</p>  An Anonymized Data Availability Sampling module compatible with the Nym mixnet, ensuring privacy-preserving data verification  Prevention of selective disclosure attacks by routing encrypted traffic through the Nym mixnet, obscuring user activity while maintaining data integrity using techniques like cover traffic, mixing, and timing obfuscation  Performance optimization through simulations to determine ideal mixnet parameters for balancing performance and&nbsp;security  <p>The Mixnet integration would strengthen data security for modular networks, making them more resilient to manipulation while protecting user privacy. Nym’s research will continue its work to offer robust protection to a modular&nbsp;future.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates on the&nbsp;project!</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/scaling-blockchains-securely-13d0111743f3">Scaling blockchains securely</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>PIVX Perspectives: Inspiring Conversations.</p> “Can you tell us a little about yourself please?” is what we usually ask but we decided to change it up this time and wrote our own introduction. <p>Fuzzbawls is PIVX’s Lead Core Developer who has been with PIVX since the beginning, over 7 years ago. As an early contributor, his technical expertise and commitment to the PIVX community have been invaluable. Fuzzbawls first got involved in crypto out of necessity, but lucky for all of us he discovered PIVX along the way. Fuzzbawls has been a constant force, driving the project’s growth and development with his collaborative spirit and unwavering dedication.</p> When and why did you get into cryptocurrency? <p>I got into crypto more out of necessity then anything else. Needed a way to secure income whilst not submitting to a corpo office job. My background in programming and build systems in particular gave me the perfect opportunity to offer freelance work.</p> When and why did you choose to get involved with&nbsp;PIVX? <p>I actually first noticed PIVX by chance when viewing the github activity of someone else that I had worked with before. Started out by offering a DNS based seeder service (with code&nbsp;PR)</p> What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;market? <p>Cliché as it sounds, but the multitude of community members that devote their time to a vast array of different areas of focus. We really are a global “team”. And, the best part? unlike the swarm of NFT scamcoins and ICOs before them, there is no central authority that can “rug&nbsp;pull”.</p> Being with PIVX since the beginning, what moment over the course of the past 7 years stood out to you the&nbsp;most? <p>The first thing that comes to mind is the zerocoin exploit. I was out working the local voting booths when my phone started going off. One very long break later we had determined that PIVX was **not** exploited and had neutralized the threat by way of a network&nbsp;SPORK.</p> As a developer, what are some of the technical aspects or challenges you encountered while working on PIVX core wallet and how did you overcome&nbsp;them? <p>One of the more involved challenges for me personally is maintaining concurrency across a multitude of build targets. Linux, Windows, MacOS for release binaries. Also CI/Launchpad for multiple CPU architectures. To help ease this, I’ve invested in hardware to have locally that covers a broad range of these scenarios.</p> Finally, what advice or encouragement would you give to aspiring developers and entrepreneurs who are looking to make an impact in the cryptocurrency industry? <p>My advice to aspiring developers would be to shed off the archaic notion of corporate structure. We are literally living in a time where personal demonstrations and perseverance outweigh the olden times. If you see something you can contribute, just do it! Continued opportunities will likely&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Many thanks to Fuzzbawls for taking the time to answer my questions.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

It was the result of a concerted political and legal campaign in Brazil since 2022 to neutralize the spread of socially damaging “misinformation” online. Despite these efforts, <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2023)739354">“digital militias”</a> attacked the capital of one of the world’s largest and youngest democracies in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>For months, the X platform has been in the crosshairs. And Elon Musk, X’s CEO, has gone out of his way to make a spectacle of pushing back against Brazil’s&nbsp;effort.</p><p>Lurking behind Brazil’s banning of X, however, is another legal decision which prohibits the use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). VPNs are estimated to be used by <a href="https://exame.com/tecnologia/stf-e-x-milhoes-de-brasileiros-usam-vpn-e-estariam-sujeitos-a-multa/">37% of the Brazilian population</a> (almost 3x the amount of X users in the country). Now, they face a fine of almost $9,000 a day (half the average <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/02/elon-musk-brazil-alexandre-de-moraes-ban/">annual salary</a> for Brazilians) for any Brazilian citizen caught using a VPN to access&nbsp;X.</p><p>In this installment of the Nym Dispatch, we will first delve into how this conflict between X and Brazilian authorities originated and recently escalated. But we will also try to complicate the prevailing narrative behind the conflict. How does a ban on VPNs work exactly, and how can this affect the privacy of and access to information for VPN users in&nbsp;Brazil?</p><p>This threat against VPN users may have been nothing more than a scare tactic which was quickly <a href="https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/blogs/luisa-martins/politica/moraes-recua-em-decisao-sobre-uso-de-vpn/">backtracked on</a>, and may ultimately be completely rescinded. However, it does raise awareness about how VPN service providers might be coerced to cooperate with state authorities, democratic or&nbsp;not.</p> Brazil v. X&nbsp;(2024) <p>So far the media focus has largely pitted X’s CEO, Elon Musk, as a “defender of free speech” against “authoritarian” censorship measures being taken by Brazil’s highest court. There is some truth to both of these takes, but the situation is much messier than this narrative lets on. In the end, the focus on the conflict between two ideological egos obscures too many real questions.</p><p>Can large tech companies claim immunity from jurisdictional laws? How should these companies navigate between democratic laws vs. authoritarian ones across the world? Should protections of freedom of speech online also include hate speech, incitements to violence, state propaganda justifying military invasions of sovereign countries, or deliberate misinformation campaigns to sway democratic voters? If not, who should decide what kinds of content gets to circulate on digital platforms? What is the line between “moderation” and censorship?</p><p>These are questions that so far remain unanswered: neither by Musk’s sensationalist and largely self-serving antics, nor the wholesale censorship of a platform as widely used as X. They are problems we need to think deeply about and discuss democratically as members of a digital society that is increasingly polarized into extremes.</p><p>The addition of VPNs to the equation, however, is a clear case of unnecessary governmental overreach. It ultimately undermines Brazil’s potentially legitimate case for some content “moderation,” giving fodder to its critics’ accusations of being authoritarian.</p><p>Brazil is not wrong about the threat of political misinformation. But to be at the forefront of combating it, it need not resort to draconian measures against the privacy tools of its own citizens. Targeting ordinary people for the use of VPNs, which have many legitimate and wide use-cases, is doing nothing to help the cause of digital democracy.</p><p>But first things first: how did this whole thing get&nbsp;started?</p> A row long in the&nbsp;making <p>Alexandre de Moraes (image wikipedia)</p><p>At the center of this story is, perhaps disconcertingly, one man: <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2023/04/05/alexandre-de-moraes-the-brazilian-judge-on-jair-bolsonaro-s-trail_6021749_4.html">Alexandre de Moraes</a>, a Justice for Brazil’s Supreme Court and the nation’s elections chief. Moraes’ appointment and rise to power in Brazil is a complicated one, with close ties to the political right prior to the rise of Jair Bolonsaro.</p><p>As the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/world/americas/brazil-online-content-misinformation.html">reported</a> in October 2022, Brazil’s Supreme Court made an unparalleled decision granting Moraes “unilateral power to order tech companies to remove many online posts and videos — one of the most aggressive actions taken by any country to combat false information.” While unusual for a democracy, it was seen as an urgent effort to curb the flood of misinformation on social media platforms in the middle of a pivotal election.</p><p>At the time, the right-wing populist Bolsonaro was seeking reelection against the returning candidacy of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (“Lula”). But as early as before the first round of voting, unfounded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/25/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-misinformation.html">accusations of voter fraud</a> began circulating from Bolsonaro’s camp through social media, priming supporters to reject the outcome whether it was democratic or not. As later criminal charges against Bolsonaro alleged, this was a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/bolsonaro-military-chiefs-testimonies-arrest-fb03d16461fab0d31846d630fb93acc1#">concerted effort</a> to contest the democratic results of what would become his demise and ultimate <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america">banning</a> from seeking political office until&nbsp;2030.</p><p>Despite Bolsonaro’s clear defeat, the trouble continued. In an reiteration of the violent reaction of Trump supporters to the 2020 election in the U.S., these disinformation bubbles online also led to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/world/americas/brazil-election-protests-bolsonaro.html">storming of the capitol</a> by Bolsonaro supporters in 2023 in an effort to reverse Lula’s inauguration.</p><p>Since then, Moraes has been given a nearly unilateral mission: to save the democratic institutions of Brazil by ridding the Brazilian web of posts and whole accounts that spread political misinformation. In addition to removing particular contents deemed to be politically harmful, it has also targeted the accounts of social media influencers, politicians, and business&nbsp;people.</p><p>And now access to X has gone down following an extended battle between Moraes and X regarding the latter’s refusal to comply with these requests. As Moraes’ legal decision charges X, the social media&nbsp;platform</p><blockquote>“allow[s] the massive spread of disinformation, hate speech and attacks on the democratic rule of law, violating the free choice of the electorate, by keeping voters away from real and accurate information.”</blockquote> The bigger&nbsp;picture <p>This weekend’s escalation is the result of a months-long spat between Moraes and X’s chief executive Elon Musk. While certain media are portraying Musk as a victim of free speech infringements, the series of events in Brazil’s legal jurisdiction complicates his public self-victimization.</p><p>First, X refused to comply with orders from Brazilian authorities to take down content and accounts, ultimately threatening to jail X employees in response. Musk then closed X offices in Brazil. In reaction, Moraes summoned X to produce legal counsel in Brazil, as per Brazilian law for foreign companies. X failed to do so despite the ultimatum. Moraes then unilaterally announced the banning of X and began coordination with Brazilian ISPs to roll out the blackout.</p><p>Update: Four additional Supreme Court Justices have today <a href="https://time.com/7016848/brazil-supreme-court-blocks-x-nationwide/">upheld Moraes’ decision</a>.</p><p>This is certainly not a cut and dry case for Musk and X, and it’s certainly not just about free speech. More than that, it’s a serious dispute over jurisdictional authority for foreign companies and the effects of information on a country, let alone one coming out of the authoritarian politics of Bolsonaro.</p><p>And yet Moraes’ program is by far from democratic, as many commentators are noting. He has so far maintained unilateral power to decide what content, accounts, and perspectives are permissible. While this may be politically justifiable today for one democratic society in turmoil, what does it mean for tomorrow, or elsewhere? Ultimately what is more important than a legal decision is the precedent it&nbsp;sets.</p><p>And with the targeting of civilians with interdictions on the use of privacy technologies like VPNs, the issue gets messier for a country struggling to defend democratic institutions against authoritarian threats.</p><p>So let’s assume that Moreas’ threat against VPN users in Brazil is a serious one, even if it will soon be, if not already, fully rescinded. How does VPN censoring work in the first place, not just in Brazil but everywhere?</p> How will Brazil censor&nbsp;VPNs? <p>When you <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-a-vpn">use a VPN</a>, all of your internet traffic is encrypted and routed directly from your device to the VPN’s servers via your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Keep in mind that an ISP is what provides you access to the internet in the first place, so it is always a first point of&nbsp;contact.</p><p>Whether you’re in Brazil or elsewhere, your ISP will see with whom you are immediately connecting, whether it’s a web service like X or an intermediary proxy like a VPN. But while using a VPN with encryption, the ISP cannot see the content of what you do, nor will they see who you are connecting with on the web. They will only see that you are connecting with the&nbsp;VPN.</p><p>So how can a country like Brazil enforce a law that regulates who accesses a web service like X with the use of a VPN if they can’t see the destination after the VPN&nbsp;proxy?</p><p>There are two possibilities:</p>  Rather than blocking access to X via a VPN, Brazil is actually ordering all ISPs in the territory to block known VPN access wholesale.  The only other way is for VPN services to report a user’s X connection to the Brazilian government. In most cases, this would require the government to subpoena the VPN provider to hand over account and traffic records, if they have them, for users behind the specific connection. Or they do it of their own accord through government pressure.  <p>Both of these possibilities underscore an infrastructural problem of traditional VPNs when it comes to protecting users’&nbsp;privacy.</p> The VPN data&nbsp;problem <p>Most Virtual Private Networks, despite their name, are not really private. They are predominately centralized infrastructures fully capable of maintaining records not only of clients’ payment information, but also the metadata of all their traffic (encrypted content exempted).</p><p>While many commercial VPNs claim to keep “no logs” or “zero logs” of user traffic, this is ultimately a matter of faith for clients. And metadata records are likely kept in any case for “operational” network purposes.</p><p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/vpn/over-25-billion-free-android-vpn-users-at-risk-of-data-leaks">VPN data leaks</a> have exposed the extent to which client data is kept by many VPNs, and especially <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/botnets-and-backdoors-the-free-vpn-trojan-horse-f00df366badc">free ones</a>. Government interventions like what is happening in Brazil further show the possible cooperation between legal surveillance orders, ISPs, and complying VPN companies.</p><p>One way around this privacy dilemma is to choose a VPN that is structurally incapable of keeping records because of its decentralized design.</p><p>But this may not solve a big problem for the censorship of information and access to via VPNs worldwide.</p> VPN censoring <p>This is certainly not the first time that VPNs have been the target of legal interventions and censorship at the state&nbsp;level.</p><p>One important function of VPNs is the ability to circumvent unjust censorship laws in certain countries. Their prohibitions, it shouldn’t be forgotten, are being used to block people’s access to any information which deviates from state propaganda. Privacy messaging apps like Signal have also become targets in an effort to interfere with people’s ability to maintain private contacts with dissident communities.</p><p>And even in democratic countries, Web3 services are increasingly becoming the targets of new legal and policing strategies in the name of combating social problems like the dissemination of child pornography, narcotics, and “terrorist” recruitment. The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-dispatch-the-arrest-of-durov-reconsidered-12793a608226">arrest of Pavel Durov</a>, CEO of Telegram, in France is one case in point, but there are and will be&nbsp;others.</p> The digital information problem <p>There is definitely something rotten in the state of social media. Information bubbles generated by algorithmic surveillance, foreign bot farms inundating markets with targeted propaganda, and increasingly hostile ways of relating to one another: this is less free speech than it is information hijacking.</p><p>What these new battles surrounding access to expression and information on social media show is how powerful, and dangerous, information can be. In one context it may provide people the means to speak out against their own social oppressions. In another, it might just add foreign fuel to fascistic and authoritarian sentiments in sovereign countries so people don’t even understand what’s at stake where they&nbsp;live.</p><p>But to say there is one global problem of digital “misinformation” is a dramatic oversimplification. First, states and government-sponsored media laid the groundwork for mass propaganda campaigns long before the internet. US intelligence services used to have to drop propaganda leaflets over foreign cities to try to convince people to support a government favored by the West. Now similar things are happening with lightning speed through digital technologies.</p><p>And targeting VPNs in a round-up sweep against the refusal of some false “free speech” messiah is not going anywhere. Let’s have a real conversation about what it means to be citizens of the web, with our feet planted in diverse soils across the world. But doing so requires online privacy as a&nbsp;default.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-dispatch-x-blackout-in-brazil-15959cc0792c">The Nym Dispatch: X blackout in Brazil</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Results of the first co-creation workshop to improve community experience <p>Believe it or not, the Nym community has been operating Nym nodes since even before the mainnet launch in 2022. Since then, our operators and stakers have become experts in Nym tooling like the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/wallet">wallet</a> and <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net">explorer</a>.</p><p>This is why Nym recently got together with our core community to <a href="https://www.figma.com/board/nyob41DIQF7DQ3tYoSOJc4/Community-co-create?node-id=75-1224&amp;t=M21vxrQoQz6GQkWE-0">harvest</a> our collective wisdom. The goal was to figure out what works and what doesn’t to improve running Nym nodes and contributing as Nymjas under the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Nym Squad League</a> framework.</p><p>Below is an overview of our first community co-creation session. It presents the common themes and patterns of the feedback you shared with us, and the actions we are going to take to address&nbsp;them.</p> The community process <p>What makes Nym different from other privacy technologies, like traditional VPNs or proxy servers, is its reliance on a network of independent service providers. But who are the Nym node operators? Maybe it’s hard to believe, but they are just ordinary people all over the world dedicated to enabling privacy for everyone by contributing their time and expertise with the goal of maintaining high quality mixnet infrastructure.</p><p>User centricity is one of Nym’s core values. This is why it’s vitally important to develop our network and tooling in collaboration with these very people who make it possible. And so Nym has just completed one of the first co-creation workshops with long term experts in the Nym community of operators.</p><p>The workshop focused on two topics to improve collectively:</p>  The Nym Squad League onboarding, communication, and reward processes  Improving new operator onboarding and discussing Nym Explorer &amp; Harbourmaster functionalities and&nbsp;ideas  <p>Nym still believes that only together with our network operators can we create the tools that enable the highest quality of decentralized network operations. So here are the results of our first co-creation.</p> Goal 1: Simplify documentation, resources, and&nbsp;guides <p>The first clear message Nym received was a collective need for improved and clearer documentation: simpler guides, checklists, regular highlights of best practices, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>So here’s what we are going to&nbsp;do:</p>  Nym’s DevRel team has already been working on a major simplification of Nym Docs. The results of this will be available soon.  Starting next season, simplifying and updating Nym docs will become a new NSL mission. Got a simpler way of expressing something? Are there examples or additional context which are missing? Caught an outdated piece of information somewhere? <a href="https://github.com/nymtech">Submit a PR</a> and let’s fix&nbsp;it!  Starting next season, NSL will also receive a guides and resources mission. Propose and create simplified guides and contribute to community-created resources like the <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/isp-list.html">VPS provider list</a> and the <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/jurisdictions.html">legal forum</a> with support from the Squad Wealth&nbsp;Fund.  Also starting next season, each Squad League mission will be supported with templates &amp; examples. Proposals (requests for grants) and submissions (proofs of work) will receive templates to help applicants develop better submissions.   Goal 2: Improve first joiner experience and onboarding <p>The Nym learning curve can definitely be steep. This applies both to running Nym nodes and contributing via the Nym Squad League. Besides the improvements to documentation, our community also suggested helping new joiners in two key ways: improving the onboarding flow and providing mentorship.</p><p>Here’s what Nym is going to&nbsp;do:</p>  Simplify the Nym onboarding journey: This effort is being led by Hux who is already working with expert community members. Have an idea on how to improve the experience of Nym’s future operators? Just message Hux on Element, he is always open for new suggestions.  Shinobi and squad NSL mentorship: Starting next season, Nymsters can get mentorship from Shinobis to start contributing via the NSL framework and earn their first promotion. Those who are looking to form Squads can receive mentorship from existing&nbsp;squads.  New node operator mentorship: There were multiple suggestions, such as a few standard sessions to guide new node operators, or dedicating a part of the bi-weekly Nym node operator AMA to supporting new joiners. If you want to contribute to such an initiative, please reach out to Sudo on Matrix, or propose your ideas on the node operator chat or the Nym&nbsp;forum!   Improving the way we communicate <p>You shared a lot of great ideas about how information should be shared with the community, which platforms we should use, and what role each platform could play in the Nym information ecosystem. We hear you loud and clear: effective communication is crucial in order to work well together.</p><p>Based on your suggestions, here’s what we are going to&nbsp;do:</p>  Community members John Smith and Kaled are working on a self-hosted, Nym community calendar, compatible with all common digital calendars. All events such as AMAs, Friday hangouts, and community calls will be available here so you never miss&nbsp;them.  A read-only announcement channel has been created on the Nym Matrix server for the Squad League so important information about deadlines, missions, seasons, and more will never get&nbsp;lost.  All announcements and updates related to node operation and the Nym Squad League will also be shared on the Nym Forum as&nbsp;well.  Status updates with new community proposals, ongoing work, and more will be posted on a weekly basis to keep Squad League participants informed.  Discord handles are no longer needed to join NSL! The onboarding process will be simplified. Members only need to share their information *as required* for specific missions. If someone wishes to participate This makes onboarding as simple as just signing up on the Nym&nbsp;Forum.   Let’s keep this conversation going! <p>We invite all of our community members, operators, Nymjas, and followers to keep this conversation going. Keep an eye on the Nym Matrix server for details about the next Friday hangout, and if you have any suggestions or proposals, please share them there or on the Nym&nbsp;Forum.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://t.me/nymtech">Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/operators-nymjas-are-creating-the-future-of-nym-together-01eb2ce3040d">Operators &amp; Nymjas are creating the future of Nym together</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today we’re excited to announce native bridging support in Brave Wallet. This allows users to transfer assets from one blockchain to another with the familiar user experience of swaps.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 The rise of multi-chain ecosystems 
<p>The blockchain landscape has evolved dramatically, with hundreds of active, public blockchains and L2 solutions with an aggregate TVL exceeding $80b. This highlights the need for seamless interoperability.</p>
<p>Bridges act as connectors, allowing users to move assets across chains, and to access DeFi opportunities across multiple ecosystems. Without bridges, users would be limited to the functionalities and liquidity of a single network, limiting interoperability and broader use cases of blockchains. Beyond merely moving funds across different blockchain networks, bridges are particularly important when considering the privacy implications of using centralized exchanges for onboarding to L2 networks. By utilizing bridges, users can avoid exposing their transaction data to centralized entities, maintaining a higher degree of anonymity and control over their financial activities across multiple chains.</p>

 LI.FI: powering Brave Wallet’s bridging functionality 
<p>Bridging functionality in Brave Wallet is powered by <a href="https://li.fi">LI.FI</a>, an API solution that allows us to find the best execution price for any swap/bridge intent across all major DEX aggregators and bridges.</p>
<p>Brave Wallet currently supports all major EVM chains including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, Optimism, and zkSync Era. We also allow bridging between EVM chains and Solana for supported pairs. Brave Wallet facilitates cross-chain, any-to-any swaps in a single transaction, which reduces the number of steps it takes to move funds across chains. Brave does not add fees to swaps or bridges performed within Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>As we design Brave Wallet, we aim to find a balance between offering sensible defaults and giving users as much control and choice as possible, without sacrificing the user experience. We’ve therefore designed the Brave Wallet bridging feature to let users pick the route of their choice, to focus on various parameters like output amount, execution speed, and more. Route selection is currently available in version 1.70 in the Beta channel.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>An example of bridge route selection in Brave Wallet.</p>

 Enhanced security with Safe Sign 
<p>Brave Wallet users may already be familiar with the <a>Safe Sign</a> feature, which allows them to verify the actual intent of a swap transaction before approving. Safe Sign leverages our improved <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/23730">EVM ABI decoder</a> in Brave Core to bring safety and transparency to the transaction approval process. We are happy to share that all bridge transactions powered by LI.FI come with the same transparent signing experience in Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>

 Bridging as the next step in Brave Wallet utility 
<p>With the growing adoption of L2s and the increasing complexity of the multi-chain ecosystem, bridging has become an essential component of the Web3 user experience. Brave Wallet’s native bridging support represents a significant step forward in making cross-chain interactions more accessible, secure, and user-friendly for Brave Wallet users.</p>
<p>We encourage Brave Wallet users to explore these new bridging capabilities, and to provide feedback as we continue to refine and expand our offerings to other bridge providers and networks.</p>

<p>Even when using open and permissionless blockchains, some things are best left private</p> Polarizing views <p>Surveys like the <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust/2024/trust-barometer?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Edelman Trust Barometer</a> reveal increasing polarization, particularly on social and political issues, with many participants expressing reluctance to collaborate with those who hold opposing views. At the same time, as crypto donations gain popularity, so does donor traceability.</p><p>Whether donating to a social cause, charity, or other non-profit, donors may fear backlash or unwanted attention for supporting certain causes. Real-life examples underscore the risks associated with traceable donations. Chainalysis has tracked donations back to donors' wallets linked to events like the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/capitol-riot-bitcoin-donation-alt-right-domestic-extremism/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">January 6th Capitol Riot</a>, the Canadian "<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/freedom-convoy-cryptocurrency-asset-seizure-1.6389601?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Freedom Convoy</a>" and <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/19/french-man-sent-far-right-groups-bitcoin-before-suicide/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">high-profile alt-right organizations</a>. While these cases involve highly controversial donations made using cryptocurrency, they also highlight the potential for donor identities to be exposed, potentially leading to serious repercussions.&nbsp;</p> The problems with “private” donations today <p>Many high-profile charities have adopted technology that enables donors to contribute using cryptocurrencies. Organizations such as <a href="https://www.habitat.org/support/cryptocurrency-donations?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Habitat for Humanity</a>, <a href="https://www.unitedway.org/get-involved/ways-to-give/donate-bitcoin?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#">United Way</a>, <a href="https://www.oxfamamerica.org/donate/donate-crypto/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Oxfam</a>, and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.ca/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Doctors Without Borders</a> now accept crypto donations; however, these solutions often rely on centralized third parties, such as <a href="http://bitpay.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bitpay</a> or <a href="https://www.silentdonor.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Silentdonor</a>. This reliance introduces not only the risks associated with <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/centralization-risk-in-crypto?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">centralization</a> but also the potential disconnect between the donation and the donor, which can pose <a href="https://www.nonprofits.freewill.com/resources/blog/how-to-accept-crypto-donations?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">challenges for donor stewardship</a> and require charities to find alternative methods to capture donor information for relationship-building. Additionally, inefficiencies can arise when crypto is <a href="https://learn.thegivingblock.com/knowledge/auto-conversion-of-cryptocurrency-to-fiat-automatic?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">automatically converted to fiat currency</a> before the donation is processed. It's also important to note that donors who wish to claim tax benefits for their charitable contributions must maintain accurate records of their donations.&nbsp;</p><p>This blog article explores whether Panther Protocol could solve this problem.</p> Could Panther Protocol preserve the privacy of donors? <p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> is being developed to enable privacy-enhanced on-chain transactions, without compromising <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/compliance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">compliance enablement</a>. Panther Protocol is set to accomplish this by supporting licensed <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">digital asset service providers to operate trading zones</a> (Zones) where rules can be established to help Zone Managers align their Zones with the regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate.</p><p>In its initial releases, Panther Protocol will support use cases tailored to financial service providers, such as <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/interoperability/defi-adaptors/zswap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">swaps</a>. However, the same technology will also address the privacy concerns surrounding charitable donations, allowing donors to support causes without fear of exposure or backlash while safeguarding their identities and financial information. Below, we explore how this innovative approach offers a solution to the challenges of donation privacy.</p><p>How Panther preserves user privacy for financial transactions</p><p>Users will be able to create <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/zaccount?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAccounts</a> to access Panther's <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>. Supported crypto-assets will be secured in a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/start-here/what-is-panther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vault smart contract</a>, and an equivalent <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/overview?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAsset</a> will be issued. These zAssets will be 1:1 collateralized "shielded" versions of the original tokens, usable within the Panther dApp.&nbsp;</p><p>These features preserve user privacy through the use of <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/cryptographic-primitives/zk-snarks?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zk-SNARK</a>s and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/cryptographic-primitives/zero-knowledge-proofs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, which allow transactions to be validated without revealing any details. Users will deposit cryptoassets into Shielded Pools and receive zAssets, privacy-enhanced versions of the original tokens. These assets will be useable across multiple blockchains while maintaining confidentiality. For more in-depth information about how Panther Protocol works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol for Charities? <p>Panther Protocol has the potential to integrate into non-profits’ tech stacks. Each <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone</a> within the Protocol can be customized with specific rules that adhere to the regulatory requirements of the jurisdiction in which it operates. For example, in the case of a charity, a Zone could be configured to disclose information only to law enforcement while preserving donor privacy. By doing so, charities can establish rules and compliance measures that satisfy regulatory requirements and ensure transparency.</p><p>Applying Zones to donations</p><p>An entity operating as a Zone Manager in Panther Protocol can facilitate private donations by setting up a Zone within Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP or Shielded Pool). Donors would deposit cryptoassets into the Zone, where the recipient receives donations. In return, donors would receive zAssets—collateralized, privacy-enhanced versions of the original assets—that preserve the privacy of the donor’s identity and transaction details. The donor would then transfer the zAssets to the charity, which could convert them back to their original form (non-zAsset) and withdraw to a digital wallet, if desired. We explain how, below.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol could be a viable solution to charities looking to accept privacy-enhanced donations. The charity and donor would each register for a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/zaccount?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAccount</a>, using PureFi, Panther Protocol’s KYC partner’s process.&nbsp;</p><p>Having connected their respective wallets, the donor would deposit the asset(s) intended for donation into the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/overview?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Vault</a>, receiving, in exchange, a fully-collateralized <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/overview?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAsset</a> that represents the digital asset being donated (e.g. zEth). At this point, the zAssets will reside within Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>, which enables the transfer of digital assets to other zAccount holders (i.e. the charity recipient of the donation). Within the Shielded Pool, a set of smart contracts, safeguarded by cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, will preserve the privacy of pool users.&nbsp;</p><p>The donor can then initiate a transfer of ownership of the donated assets, with the transaction taking place within a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#shielded-pool-zones">Zone</a>, managed by a VASP or other licensed entity operator. Once transferred, the charity recipient can choose to either keep the assets in the Shielded Pool, or withdraw the zAssets back to their original digital asset form using a similar process to the donor’s deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>When transacting using Panther Protocol, parties will&nbsp; receive <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/fees-and-rewards?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">rewards for depositing and sending assets. Rewards are received in Panther Rewards Points</a>. The charity recipient, upon withdrawal, would pay fees to the Protocol. Similar to how some charities encourage donors to cover PayPal or Credit Card transaction fees, charities using Panther Protocol to accept privacy-enhanced donations may also encourage donors to contribute a small amount to offset any costs incurred by the platform.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br></p><p>For future iterations of the protocol, it is worth noting that Panther Protocol’s Zones are scalable and modular. A charity could, in theory, utilize different Zones to receive donations across various jurisdictions, each with its own set of rules tailored to meet the specific regulatory requirements of that region.</p><p>Privacy requirements for charities</p><p>Beyond addressing the lack of privacy on open blockchains, Panther Protocol’s Zones could, in the future, help uphold privacy obligations that charities have towards their donors’ information. Privacy legislation in many countries, including the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=5%20GDPR%20Principles%20relating%20to,lawfulness%2C%20fairness%20and%20transparency')%3B">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Australia</a>, <a href="https://www.lerners.ca/lernx/a-privacy-caution-for-charities-and-non-profit-organizations-does-pipeda-apply-to-you/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Canada</a>, the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">UK </a>and more, requires that donor information should not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the donor’s consent or as required by law. Panther Protocol’s advanced cryptography will help to keep this information safe.&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Panther Protocol offers a promising solution to the challenges of private crypto donations in a polarized world. By leveraging Panther’s privacy-preserving features, charities will be able to ensure that donor identities and transaction details remain confidential, protecting them from potential backlash or unwanted attention.&nbsp;</p>

  Partnering with Bridge: A Better Way to Move Money  <p>Zach, Sean and their team are building critical infrastructure to support stablecoin payments.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>	 



Published August 29, 2024
  



Bridge co-founders Zach Abrams and Sean Yu.



 
<p>If you own a U.S.-based business serving primarily U.S.-based customers, you may not think much about stablecoins—yet. But in many parts of the world—in unstable economies, and where inflation is unchecked—moving money is more difficult, and the transformative power of this technology is already becoming clear. Where traditional payment rails are too difficult, slow, and expensive, some 30 million active users are now moving $3.2 trillion in stablecoins <a href="https://visaonchainanalytics.com/">every month</a>. And with industry giants including Stripe <a href="https://x.com/collision/status/1783559623511011535">rolling out</a> new payment options for these assets, those numbers are growing fast.</p>



<p>But from cryptocurrencies to credit cards, each new medium for moving money requires new infrastructure to support it. At Sequoia, we’ve been fortunate to partner with leaders in fintech including PayPal, Block, Stripe, Nubank and Klarna, and we’ve been looking intently for the founders who will usher in the next wave of payment innovation.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.bridge.xyz/">Bridge</a> co-founders Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, that’s exactly what we found.</p>



<p>Zach, Sean and their team are making it possible for developers to seamlessly and instantly convert between any two dollar formats, with a single API. A company in Brazil can use Bridge to send USDC payments to their supplier in China, a consumer in Nigeria can pay for YouTube or ChatGPT, and a small business in the U.S. can take payments in PYUSD from customers around the world. Because Bridge is built on blockchains, it works 24/7, in virtually every country—and for as little as 10% of the cost of traditional foreign exchange rails.</p>



<p>We loved the idea—and we loved the team. Zach and Sean are longtime co-founders, and longtime members of the Sequoia family, as well; their first company together, Evenly, was acquired by Block (then Square) in 2013. Zach went on to lead consumer products at Coinbase and Brex, while Sean became an early engineer and culture-bearer at DoorDash before joining Airbnb. As you might imagine, we had plenty of references on these two, and they described Zach and Sean as visionary, beloved and deeply knowledgeable on what it takes to move money at scale.</p>



<p>In addition to their insight into the stablecoin landscape and their passion for the problem they’re solving, we are impressed by Bridge’s maturity around regulation. While many companies in their space have adversarial relationships with government, Bridge not only complies with all U.S. and European regulations but lists the U.S. State Department and U.S. Treasury among their customers!</p>



<p>Since partnering, we’ve also been impressed by the sheer diversity of Bridge’s client list, which ranges from rocket companies to aid organizations to global fintechs. The applications of this platform seem to be endless—and the growth has been exponential, with payment volume crossing $5 billion annualized.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet even those rapid gains only scratch the surface of what we believe Zach, Sean and their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bridge-apis/people/">team</a> can accomplish, and we are grateful for the opportunity to partner with Bridge and lead their Series A. As adoption of stablecoins continues to grow, Bridge is building the foundation of this new core payment rail and making sure financial transactions will be faster, easier, more affordable and more accessible for people around the world.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.9.0">Zebra 1.9.0</a>. This release includes the necessary changes to activate NU6 on Testnet as well as a number of additional NU6 updates and other improvements.</p>



<p>To support NU6 activation on Testnet, this release of Zebra adds the NU6 network upgrade variant, minimum protocol versions for NU6, current protocol version, and Testnet activation height. It also supports configuring an NU6 activation height and configurable funding streams on Regtest and custom Testnets as well as the implementation of all of the ZIPs relating to future funding streams after the current devfund expires at the next halving. Finally, it updates Zebra’s EoS (End of Support) to ensure that it will not run ahead of the expected activation height of NU6 on Mainnet. This means that there will be at least one other Zebra release before NU6 activates on Mainnet.</p>



<p>This release also includes changes to add a new zebra-scanner binary and functionality to support access to Zebra’s best chain state from another process, and notify clients when Zebra’s best tip changes. All of this work is in support of a replacement to the zcashd built-in wallet and gets us closer to enabling zcashd deprecation.</p>



<p>You can see a full copy of all of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.9.0">v1.9.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

Are privacy technologies under new legal threats? Should tech developers and company executives be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/technology/durov-telegram-liability-platforms.html">held responsible</a> for what users do or say on their platforms?</p><p>And then there are other questions, increasingly less considered, behind these new police targets: what should be done to truly address the underlying causes of child exploitation, for example, or the growing epidemic of drug addiction, narcotic impurities, and overdoses? Is compromising the digital privacy of millions of people really the&nbsp;answer?</p><p>The arrest of Durov contains an immediate lesson that defenders of privacy and private technologies should pay attention to: data = vulnerability, no matter what the data is, for ordinary people as well as companies.</p><p>Contrary to what many people have been led to believe by the current media buzz around Durov’s arrest, Telegram is not a private messaging app. It is not end-to-end encrypted by default, which is the gold standard for secure communications today. Telegram is a lot of things, but private it is&nbsp;not.</p><p>Nonetheless, what the arrests of Durov and others are maliciously reinforcing is the idea that using cryptology online is about crime rather than security. It’s against this association that we need to collectively organize to ensure a private internet for the&nbsp;future.</p> Understanding the charges against&nbsp;Durov <p>To be clear, Durov is not being charged with distributing child pornography or narcotics, but rather with “complicity” in these activities carried out by Telegram users. As the CEO of a popular telecommunications app, what does this mean&nbsp;exactly?</p><p>Under French law, as in many countries, a party can be charged with complicity in a crime if it can be demonstrated that they had “knowledge” of the criminal activity but did nothing — or not enough — to stop, mitigate, or “moderate” it (a term which, as the Nym Dispatch has <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/ai-surveillance-wont-save-your-kids-chat-control-rearing-its-head-again-9e1dc9c1b303">reported previously</a>, is really euphemism for backdoor surveillance).</p><p>At the core of this case is “knowledge,” or what data Telegram was meaningfully aware of. Keep in mind that a communication platform does not need, beyond operational purposes, to have access to any user data. This is ultimately a company decision.</p> The Telegram&nbsp;problem <p>No social media or communication platform is simple. In addition to being a messaging and chat app used by 900M users, Telegram’s “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/357355e7-73a7-4bdc-9e0a-ee718cb66e37">relaxed moderation policies</a>” regarding all content on the platform has been criticized. This inevitably includes not simply private chats between individuals, but also conversations on topics ranging from drug dealing to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/europe/telegram-iran-russia.html">terrorism</a>.</p><p>Yet Telegram’s appeal has never been about real privacy. Users turn to it for something else: a seemingly open sphere for communicating with others on any topic, perhaps under the illusion of anonymity and security, and all the messy social dynamics that come with it. Unfortunately, this happens on Telegram largely without the privacy standards that should be expected to ensure genuine free&nbsp;speech.</p><blockquote>“Telegram works more as a messy social media platform via group chats than a messaging app,” Jaya Klara Brekke, Nym’s Chief Strategy Officer, notes. “This makes it ripe for exploitation by malicious actors, scammers, and bots. This is a problem across many platforms today. True privacy requires not just end-to-end encryption, but also network noise protection to enable actual free speech and not just a sewage pipe of provocative content designed to push up engagement numbers.”</blockquote> The fate of&nbsp;Durov <p>It will ultimately be the job of prosecutors to demonstrate that Durov not only had knowledge of these illegal activities, but that the company failed to meaningfully intervene. The case hinges on a combination of known criminal activity, a laissez-faire attitude towards it, and a “refusal to communicate” with authorities in “carrying out and operating interceptions.” This will amount to enabling criminal activity in a relatively new juridical sense.</p><p>It’s unclear whether the French prosecution will succeed in demonstrating this. If they do, it may well contribute to sedimenting a new precedent when it comes to policing privacy technologies and other Web3 platforms (but more on this later). And the mystery remains whether Durov’s decision to land in Paris is part of a deeper geopolitical and legal game to which we’re not yet&nbsp;privy.</p><p>But there is one thing that needs to be made clear for the privacy community: Telegram is far from being a private communications app. Moreover, Durov’s current trials and tribulations are a direct consequence of failing or refusing to make Telegram a platform in which users have real privacy by default. If Telegram were, Durov would likely not be in&nbsp;custody.</p> Privacy is not Telegram’s game <p>As a messaging and chat application, Telegram has its own strengths: an extremely user-friendly interface, and “channels” in which people can communicate “freely” across the globe and share live information. Maybe it helps people on the ground communicate information about a war constantly inundated with misinformation, or maybe it is a <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240827-durov-s-telegram-weapon-of-war-under-increased-scrutiny">pro-war propaganda machine</a>, or both at the same time. Tools are by nature ambivalent, ultimately shaped by how they are&nbsp;used.</p><p>But despite its long-standing claims to be a “secure messenger,” Telegram is not really a genuinely private messaging app. This is for a simple reason: it does not use end-to-end (e2e) encryption as a&nbsp;default.</p> If it’s not e2e encrypted, it’s not&nbsp;private <p>Most apps and web services use some form of <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-encryption">encryption</a> or another, but unless a connection between two clients is e2e encrypted, it is not genuinely private.</p><p>e2e encryption ensures that only you and your intended recipient have the keys to decrypt the content of what you say, do, or share together. Anything else can potentially allow third parties, like the app operators themselves, to gain access to your communications or share them with others, including requesting authorities for many political or legal&nbsp;motives.</p><p>It should not be forgotten that compliance with certain digital surveillance requests, in the case of authoritarian regimes or government overreach, can very well amount to an unjustified <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/social-media-surveillance-us-government">violation of individuals’ civil rights</a>. It is for this reason that e2e encryption should be defended as the default requirement for all secure and private communications.</p><p>In their defense, Telegram does offer an e2e encryption mode, which they cryptically call a “secret chat.” However, this is not a default feature of all communications through the platform. It must be manually toggled on for each chat, meaning that all other communications use an independent and “unusual” form of encryption that is <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/08/25/telegram-is-not-really-an-encrypted-messaging-app/">hard to dissect</a> in terms of its security.</p><p>A key contrast to Telegram is Signal which ensures e2e encryption for all communications on their platform. Even more commercial apps like WhatsApp (which uses the Signal protocol) and Facebook Messenger have followed suit with e2e encryption, helping to set a new standard in private digital communications.</p><p>But Telegram is not yet on this list, and we should be asking why this is before elevating Durov to the pedestal of a defender of private communications.</p> e2e is already the regulatory norm <p>Cryptography is not a crime. To the contrary, e2e encryption is now the bedrock of private online communications.</p><p>Using strong e2e encryption is fully inline with the General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>), of which France is a complying member. In Europe, the GDPR has rightfully defended the social importance of encryption as “the best way to protect data during transfer and one way to secure stored personal data.” The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-directive-measures-high-common-level-cybers">NIS 2 Directive</a> also further reinforces the need for e2e encryption:</p><blockquote>“In order to safeguard the security of electronic communications networks and services, the use of encryption, and in particular end-to-end encryption, should be promoted and, where necessary, should be mandatory for providers.”</blockquote><p>In addition to making sure that users’ personal conversations are secure from external interference and surveillance, e2e encryption guarantees that app developers have zero-knowledge of or access to the communication content of their&nbsp;users.</p><p>e2e encryption thus offers a necessary neutrality for app developers and operators. This is a win-win for privacy tech and users. As the Durov arrest demonstrates, knowing about and holding user data makes a company vulnerable to prosecution at the same time as it makes all users less&nbsp;private.</p><p>This is not about shielding billionaires from criminal prosecution. What this does is normalize our digital interactions so that when ordinary people are speaking to each other over a messaging app, they can do so knowing that hundreds of companies, agencies, and governments are not listening in on&nbsp;them.</p> Durov in the crosshairs? <p>Telegram has not only failed to follow the industry standard for e2e encryption: it has also opened Durov himself, as the company’s head, to a possible prosecution. This is now following suit with similar prosecutions in the Web3 space, with Tornado Cash and others. In pragmatic terms, any knowledge of the content of communications on platforms means possible complicity, whether it will be legally justified or&nbsp;not.</p><p>e2e encryption for privacy technologies is an easy and fully regulation-compliant solution for protecting data. As is <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/what-is-a-mixnet-and-how-does-it-power-the-most-private-vpn">mixnet technology</a> for protecting metadata. These technologies enable data minimization in practice. The more data that a company insists on collecting for commercial and political purposes, the more it makes itself vulnerable, and the worse it makes the privacy of its&nbsp;users.</p><p>Durov is now a case in point: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/technology/pavel-durov-telegram-detained-france.html">freedom of speech defender</a> maybe, but not a digital privacy champion. Let’s stop looking for martyrs and knights in shining armor and invest in zero-knowledge and data-minimizing tech that makes privacy a technological default, not a promise or marketing gimmick.</p> Metadata is the real&nbsp;target <p>Strong e2e encryption should be a given for all communications online, protecting vulnerable people from profiling and targeting. Telegram failed to protect their users, and indeed themselves as a digital service provider, on this basic point. But as Nym has highlighted elsewhere, even e2e encryption is not enough to secure people’s communications today.</p><p>Metadata continues to be the <a href="https://www.pogo.org/analysis/the-history-and-future-of-mass-metadata-surveillance">primary target of data surveillance</a>. In the hands of systems of mass data collection and AI-analytics, this can reveal a lot more about us than the content of any set of messages could. And unlike encrypted content, there are little to no legal protections and regulations of metadata.</p><p>Even private communication apps like Signal or WhatsApp are vulnerable to metadata tracking.</p><blockquote>“The problem,” Harry Halpin, CEO of Nym Technologies, noted, “is that all these chat apps leak metadata, who is talking to whom, on the network level, which is the precise issue the Nym mixnet is trying to&nbsp;solve.”</blockquote><p>In short, unprotected data and metadata = vulnerability, for ordinary app users and developers alike.</p><p>But Telegram perhaps leaves its hundreds of millions of users worldwide in an even more precarious situation. Unlike Signal which has no commercial revenue, Telegram earns significant <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8d6ceb0d-4cdb-4165-bdfa-4b95b3e07b2a">revenue from commercial advertising</a>. As we know, the collection, analysis, and sharing of the metadata of clients is a primary means for targeted advertising. The extent to which Telegram collects, centralizes, and uses client metadata should be a question we’re asking ourselves and&nbsp;them.</p> Targeting privacy: What’s to&nbsp;come <p>We will have to wait to see how the Durov case plays out. It very likely might be that it does set a dangerous precedent when it comes to policing real privacy technologies under the auspices of combating crime. The 2024 conviction in the Netherlands of Alexey Pertsev, the cofounder of Tornado Cash, the crypto anonymizing tool, is one vector in this trend. And we should expect others to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>As this new legal and policing strategy develops in relation to Web3 tech, as citizens of the web we should be alert in questioning and refusing this false choice: privacy or a world of crime. Privacy can and should be defended against coercion and scaremongering in the name of growing the surveillance state.</p><p>But Telegram’s woes cannot be boiled down to their privacy provisions, which are woefully lacking. The real fronts for the battle in defending privacy lie elsewhere.</p><p>Private communications apps like Signal and VPNs, and even Telegram, are increasingly blocked in countries like Russia, China, and Venezuela. Building censorship-resistant technology will be crucial in making sure people across the world can access the information and comrades they need to fight oppressive regimes, or simply to&nbsp;live.</p><p>So rather than pitting regulators against developers, while the actual criminals roam free, the aim should be to prevent digital vulnerability in the first place. This requires a shift in focus by both regulators and tech CEOs to start prioritizing privacy and security by design and by&nbsp;default.</p><p>Telegram, unfortunately, is a day too&nbsp;late.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-dispatch-the-arrest-of-durov-reconsidered-12793a608226">The Nym Dispatch: The arrest of Durov reconsidered</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Summary 
<p>This post presents <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07495">research on the privacy harms and risks</a> of Google’s recent <a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/related-website-sets">Related Website Sets</a> feature, to be presented at the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2024/">2024 Internet Measurement Conference</a>. The research finds both that the Related Website Sets feature would reverse some of the privacy benefits of deprecating third-party cookies, and that Google’s justification for reintroducing this privacy harm (i.e., that Web users can tell when two different sites are run by the same organization) is untrue for many, potentially most, Web users. The study supports other browsers’ decision to reject the feature because of its privacy risks, and highlights the risk Related Website Sets poses to Chrome users.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers at University of St Andrews, Imperial College London, Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology (GZ), and Brave Software. This post was written by Principal Privacy Researcher Peter Snyder.</p>

 Background: Related Website Sets and Third-Party Cookies 
<p>Related Website Sets (RWS) is a recent Chrome feature, proposed by Google in anticipation of the end of third-party cookies. The privacy and security harms caused by third-party cookies are well documented, and have led every major Web browser to either block third-party cookies, or announce plans to do so (even if Google has, again, pushed its planned deprecation date back).</p>
<p>According to Google, Related Website Sets reenables third-party-cookie-like-behavior where it benefits users, without reintroducing the broader privacy harms of third-party cookies. In reality, RWS aims to allow (for example) Google to link the videos you watch on YouTube to your Google profile, even when you’re not logged into YouTube, and even after third-party cookies have been deprecated in Chrome. While the research described in this post presents and evaluates Google’s stated motivations with RWS, the core truth is that RWS exists for advertiser-serving situations like the above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The broad idea behind RWS is that if two different sites are run by the same organization (for example, instagram.com and facebook.com are both run by Meta), then there is no need for the browser to block third-party cookies between the two sites, since the user already expects that both sites will share information with each other.</p>
<p>More casually, the motivation behind RWS is something like this: there’s no point in telling your mom a secret, and then trying to keep that secret from your dad; you should assume your parents are going to share everything with each other.</p>
<p>RWS is a user-hostile weakening of the Web’s privacy model, plainly designed to benefit websites and advertisers, to the detriment of user privacy. Google argues that RWS actually benefits users, either because the privacy exceptions help fix “<a href="https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets?tab=readme-ov-file#providing-capabilities-beyond-the-storage-access-api">site compatibility issues</a>” or to keep users “<a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/related-website-sets">signed in</a>” across related domains. But a quick look at the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/related-website-sets/blob/main/related_website_sets.JSON">actual Related Website Sets exceptions list</a> reveals many examples unrelated to even these (even hypothetically) user-benefiting use cases, and these sites work correctly in browsers that do not implement RWS (i.e., almost all other browsers).</p>
<p>In reality, the primary motivation behind Related Website Sets is as frustrating as it is unsurprising: to benefit advertisers to the detriment of users (or, as Google euphemistically says, to “<a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/cookies/related-website-sets">show you personalized content</a>”). As with so many other user-harmful and needlessly-complex choices in Chrome’s overarching “<a href="https://www.privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox</a>” proposal, RWS exists to make sure Chrome continues to serve advertisers’ needs first, even once Google has been shamed into (finally) deprecating third-party cookies.</p>

 Study Description: Users (Understandably) Do Not Anticipate Site Relations 
<p>The study considered RWS impact on Web privacy by testing whether the underlying assumption in RWS is correct: can Web users accurately determine if two different sites are related to each other? More specifically, if a Web user is presented with two different websites, how accurately are they able to decide whether the two sites are related to each other, given the existing site-relationships defined by Chrome’s RWS list.</p>
<p>In general, we found that Web users cannot accurately determine if two sites are related to each other (as determined by the Related Sites Set feature). We conducted a user study with 30 Web users, recruited over social media, and presented them each with 20 pairs of websites. Website pairs were randomly selected from both the Related Website Sets list (i.e., sites Google designates as “related”, and so warranting reduced privacy protections), and the Tranco list of popular websites. Each user was presented with different pairs of websites, asked to view the sites, and then decide if they thought the two sites were operated by the same organization. This resulted in 430 determinations of whether unique pairs of websites were related (some of the 30 users did not provide an answer to all of the 20 website pairs they were presented).</p>
<p>We found that users’ expectations for which sites were related often didn’t match the Related Website Sets list, and as a result, the RWS feature re-enables third-party cookie-like behavior in many cases users could not anticipate. In our study, the large majority of users (~73%) made at least one incorrect determination of whether two sites were related to each other, and almost half (~42%) of the determinations made during the study (i.e., all determinations from all users) were incorrect. Most concerning, of the cases where both sites were related (according to the RWS feature), users guessed that the sites were unrelated ~37% of the time, meaning that users would have thought Chrome was protecting them when it was not.</p>
<p>We conclude from this that the premise underlying RWS is fundamentally incorrect; Web users are (understandably, predictably) not able to accurately determine whether two sites are owned by the same organization. And as a result, RWS is reintroducing exactly the kinds of privacy harms that third-party cookies cause.</p>
<p>Lest anyone judge the study participants for being uninformed, or not taking the study seriously, consider for yourself: which of the following pairs of sites are related?</p>
 
 
<p>hindustantimes.com and healthshots.com</p>
 
 
<p>vwo.com and wingify.com</p>
 
 
<p>economictimes.com and cricbuzz.com</p>
 
 
<p>indiatoday.in and timesofindia.com</p>
 
 
<p>Keep in mind, a user needs to determine whether two domains are related before clicking on a link; once a site has been loaded, any information sharing and tracking has already occurred.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we find that RWS will be harmful to user privacy, and reintroduce the kinds of privacy harms the Web has been moving away from by removing third-party cookies. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07495">full paper</a> will be presented at the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2024/">2024 Internet Measurement Conference</a>.</p>
<p>(For the above quiz, if you chose “4”, then, unfortunately that is incorrect. That is in fact the only pair of the four that isn’t considered “related” to each other.)</p>

 Beyond the Study: Additional Privacy Harms from Related Website Sets 
<p>However, beyond the findings from the user study, we note a more fundamental privacy harm with RWS. RWS rests on the idea that if two sites are related to each other, then it’s harmless (or, at least “acceptable”) for the browser to reduce privacy protections between those two sites. Or, to go back to the previous analogy, if mom already knows something, then there’s no harm in telling dad; dad is going to find out regardless.</p>
<p>This assumption is wrong; modern Web browsers are perfectly capable of preventing (say) Meta from knowing that your Facebook account and your Instagram account are owned by the same person if you register them with different email addresses and information. In fact, this is the default behavior of most Web browsers today, both browsers focused at a popular audience (e.g., Brave, Firefox, Safari) and browsers targeting specialized audiences (e.g., Tor Browsers, Icefox). Unless you use the same credentials to register an account on two different sites, modern browsers can absolutely prevent two sites operated by the same organization from linking your behaviors across those sites. Or, in other words, modern Web browsers can absolutely prevent Mom from telling Dad your secrets.</p>
<p>Finally, we acknowledge that some companies do try to circumvent the privacy protections in Web browsers, to try and allow two sites run by the same organization to link your accounts across sites. Some sites use techniques like link decoration or bounce tracking to try and continue tracking you. But the difference here between privacy respecting browsers (which include <a>link decoration</a> and <a>bounce tracking</a> protections) and Chrome (which is explicitly designed to allow cross-site linkage) is damning: some browsers are experimenting with techniques to prevent organizations from tracking you across sites, and some browsers are designing features with the explicit intent of allowing such tracking.</p>

 Conclusions 
<p>In conclusion, our study finds that RWS is harmful for Web privacy, and in three ways:</p>
<p>First, RWS assumes users can anticipate which sites are related to each other, but in practice users cannot.</p>
<p>Second, RWS introduces privacy harm even before users have the the opportunity to decide if two sites are operated by the same organization; by the time users can view a webpage to try and decide if two sites are related to each other, the privacy harm has already occurred, and sites have had the opportunity to track the user across site boundaries.</p>
<p>And third, RWS entrenches a privacy-harmful assumption in the Web platform, instead of working to excise it. RWS assumes that if two sites are owned by the same organization, then the organization should be allowed to track you across those two sites. In contrast, privacy respecting browsers have gone in the opposite direction, and <a>tried to prevent all sites from tracking you</a>, regardless of what organization owns them.</p>

 Additional Concerns with Related Website Sets 

 The Web has Rejected Related Website Sets 
<p>Although Related Website Sets is being presented as a general Web proposal, the truth is that most of the Web has already considered and rejected it. Most browsers, including <a>Brave</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/350">Firefox</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/93#issuecomment-1357694422">Safari</a>, have publicly stated that they believe Related Website Sets (previously called First-Party Sets) is bad for users, and bad for the Web. The proposal has been removed from the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacycg/2022Jun/0003.html">W3C Privacy Community Group</a> and is no longer being considered by any privacy-focused group in the W3C.</p>

 When Websites Change of Hands 
<p>What happens if / when the domains in the list change hands? This is a common concern with all sorts of “pin trust to a domain” proposals across this history of the Web. Just because domains A, B, and C are operated by the same organization today does not (at all) guarantee that they’ll be owned by the same organization tomorrow.</p>
<p>Security and privacy attacks from exactly these kinds of assumptions have happened with browser extensions that have been sold from “trustworthy” parties to malicious parties, or when popular software libraries / dependencies have been taken over by a malicious actor.</p>
<p>The broader concern is that, even if these sites are meaningfully related at the time they’re included in the list, there is no mechanism that will remove them when they (often silently) change hands.</p>

 Language / Perception Concerns 
<p>As mentioned above, the underlying justification (as flimsy as it is) for RWS is that users can perceive that they’re operated by the same organization. Our study finds that, even for English speaking users evaluating English sites, users can’t anticipate what sites Google judges to be related. This problem will (of course) get much worse when people are visiting sites in languages they do not speak.</p>

 Timing 
<p>The intuition behind RWS is that users will be able to determine if site B is related to site A, and then only visit site B if that arrangement is acceptable. However, this is a catch 22. In order to determine if site B is related to site A, I need to visit site B and see the “<a href="https://github.com/WICG/first-party-sets?tab=readme-ov-file#defining-a-set-through-use-case-based-subsets">shared branding or logo</a>” (or similar), indicating the relationship between these sites. However, once I’ve loaded the site to view it, it’s already too late, and my information has been shared between the two sites.</p>

<p>A recent article by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-home-invasion-crime-ring/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Wired</a> underscores the alarming rise in physical threats and violence used to coerce individuals into transferring their valuable digital assets to criminal accounts. When malicious actors can link a digital wallet to its owner, high-net-worth individuals become prime targets for theft, market manipulation, and identity fraud. In the most severe cases, this can lead to blackmail, extortion, home invasions, or worse.</p><p>The visibility inherent in public blockchain ledgers is a significant risk factor, as it exposes users to such dangers by making it easy to trace and associate financial activity with specific individuals. Privacy is crucial not only for security but also for individual safety.&nbsp;</p><p>This article delves into how bad actors can use open blockchains to identify and target victims and how on-chain privacy solutions like Panther Protocol can mitigate risk.</p> How can bad actors identify potential victims?&nbsp; <p>In most cases, bad actors require access to the <a href="https://www.immunebytes.com/blog/compromised-private-keys-threats-and-remedies/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">password or keys to the digital assets</a> to achieve their goals. Typically, these criminal activities involve identifying a target or target wallet, gaining access to its credentials, and then transferring the assets to their own wallet or account. According to <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-hacking-stolen-funds-2024/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Chainalysis</a>, One third of hacks in DeFi involve off-chain activities, using off-chain data to access this sensitive information.&nbsp;</p><p>Blockchain cybersecurity firm, <a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/top-7-ways-your-private-keys-get-hacked?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Halborn</a>, identifies the most common methods of compromising private keys as phishing, malware, weak passwords, insecure key storage, weak key generation, social engineering and cloud storage breaches. While some compromised keys have come from mass attacks (“spray and pray”), where a large number of potential victims are hacked indiscriminately with a low probability of success, targeted attacks (such as spear phishing) have a much higher probability of success. Open transactions may leave users more vulnerable to these types of attacks, allowing hackers target a particular wallet or set of wallets in an attempt to obtain the keys.&nbsp;</p><p>When you make a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/07/30/blackbird-the-hot-new-restaurant-app-now-lets-diners-settle-the-check-with-crypto/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">cryptocurrency payment at a café</a> or any public venue, your transaction details, including the send addresses, can potentially be observed and linked to your other digital wallets. Panther Protocol's <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a> will mitigate this risk by enabling you to transact using <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/overview?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAssets</a>—private, mirror tokens that conceal the true origin of the underlying assets.</p><p>By using zAssets for your transactions, the public visibility of your send address will be obfuscated, making it difficult for anyone to link the transaction back to your other wallets. This will effectively shield your wallet addresses from observers, preventing them from tracing back to your broader collection of wallets and other sensitive financial information.</p> Decoupling identity from wallet addresses <p>Unique identifiers like .Eth domains or <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-nft-profile-pictures?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">NFT profile pictures</a> can inadvertently expose your on-chain identity, linking your social presence to your financial activities and making you vulnerable to unwanted tracking and privacy invasion.</p><p>Panther Protocol is designed to allow you to interact with DeFi platforms using <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/overview?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAssets</a>, ensuring that your on-chain transactions will be conducted privately. Even if you use a public-facing identity, such as a .Eth domain, transactions made in Panther’s Shielded Pool will not reveal your wallet’s holdings or activities. Additionally, Panther <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#shielded-pool-zones">Zones</a> are intended to ensure that any identity-related actions you take remain private and secure.</p> Preventing blockchain analysis and clustering <p>Blockchain analysis can reveal patterns in your transaction history, potentially exposing your identity or linking multiple wallets under your control. This information could be exploited by bad actors to target your assets through various phishing or hacking methods.</p><p>Transactions conducted through Panther Protocol’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/ztrade-otc-trading?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zTrade</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/interoperability/defi-adaptors/zswap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zSwap</a> functionalities are designed to be private and unlinkable. By leveraging ZKPs, these transactions will be shielded from <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">blockchain analysis tools</a>. The unique architecture of the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>, which utilizes append-only Merkle trees, is designed to ensure that each transaction is recorded privately, without disclosing its details or history. This will make it difficult for attackers to use clustering algorithms to trace multiple addresses back to a single entity. Additionally, as more users transact via Panther Protocol, the anonymity set will grow. The increasing number of unique deposit wallets and UTXOs will exponentially complicate the efforts of clustering algorithms to identify the source of each transaction.</p><p>When a bad actor connects you to any of the wallets you frequently engage with, they can potentially discover other wallets you own by analyzing transaction patterns in your data trail. If a wallet regularly interacts with known exchange addresses, an attacker may link these transactions to external data, such as exchange account information, which could reveal the wallet owner’s identity​</p><p>To uncover wallet owners' identities, malicious actors could combine blockchain data with other information sources. For example, if a wallet regularly interacts with exchange addresses acquired through data leaks or breaches, an attacker could use exchange records, which often contain personal identification details to identify the owner.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/node?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Transaction patterns, such as recurring payments or transfers to specific addressel personal or business relationships.</a> This information can be cross-referenced with publicly available data or information obtained through the various methods described above.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14440?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Clustering algorithms</a> can be used by law enforcement to identify bad actors. Still, they can equally be used by bad actors to group related addresses that a single entity may control. By integrating blockchain data with metadata (such as IP addresses) and off-chain information, attackers can more accurately identify high-value targets, matching them with identities that are collected offline.&nbsp;</p> Defending Against Dusting Attacks <p><a href="https://support.ledger.com/article/4410970438929-zd?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Dusting attacks</a> involve sending small amounts of cryptocurrency to a wallet in order to analyze its transaction patterns and potentially uncover the identity behind it. By tracking how this dust is moved, attackers can gain insights into the wallet owner’s activities.</p><p>With Panther Protocol, even if your wallet is targeted by a dusting attack, any subsequent transactions using <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/overview?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zAssets</a> will occur within its <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>, which is designed to prevent the dust from revealing any meaningful information. Panther’s privacy-enhancing technology will ensure that the dust cannot be traced through the Panther system, as transactions within the Shielded Pool are shielded and do not disclose the movement of underlying assets or include deposits of unwanted assets.</p> Securing Against Social Engineering and Off-Chain Attacks <p>Bad actors may also use more traditional scams like <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-phishing-attack-in-crypto-and-how-to-prevent-it?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">phishing</a>, <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/what-is-smishing-and-how-to-defend-against-it?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">smishing</a>, and <a href="https://www.gate.io/learn/articles/what-is-social-engineering-in-the-crypto-space/2463?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20favorite%20moves,wide%2C%20trying%20to%20catch%20anyone.">social engineering</a> to link wallets to their owners. Other scams involve real-world interactions, such as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/13/crypto-investor-awarded-over-75-million-in-sim-swapping-hack-case/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">SIM swapping attacks</a>; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-home-invasion-crime-ring/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">hacking into your email or using dark-web obtained email addresses and passwords</a> or <a href="https://hackread.com/crypto-exchange-fiatusdt-leaked-kyc-data/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">KYC data</a> to access personal information.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the most effective attacks on digital assets occur off-chain and these methods typically rely on gathering sufficient information about a target to gain access to their wallets and keys.</p><p>Although Panther Protocol is primarily designed to enhance on-chain privacy, the protection it will offer is intended to extend indirectly to off-chain attacks. By keeping your on-chain activities private and untraceable, Panther aims to significantly reduce the data available for attackers to exploit in off-chain schemes. After all, how can attackers attempt to socially engineer their way into your crypto assets if they don't even know you possess them?</p>

 Abstract <p>This article examines Panther Protocol, an upcoming decentralized application on the Polygon network that leverages zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology within a Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) to facilitate private asset transactions. Inspired by Muhammad Yusuf's "Diving Into Dark Pools," this article explores Panther Protocol's privacy mechanisms, regulatory considerations involving Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and the innovative concept of Panther Zones. Additionally, it examines the protocol's compliance strategies in the context of the SEC's regulatory framework and highlights the benefits for licensed entities.</p> Introduction <p>In the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), Panther Protocol is positioned to preserve privacy and enhance security. Drawing parallels to the traditional dark pools discussed in a recent report on Delphi Digital,&nbsp; "Diving Into Dark Pools," Panther Protocol is set to offer a sophisticated solution for private asset transactions. By integrating cutting-edge privacy-enhancing technologies and robust regulatory compliance enabling mechanisms around KYC/KYB and data management, Panther Protocol ensures that users, particularly licensed entities, can transact with confidence and confidentiality.</p> Traditional Market Comparison <p>The traditional market for dark pools in equities and equity options is substantial, with billions of dollars in daily trading volume. These dark pools allow institutional investors to execute large orders without causing significant market impact. However, this structure still relies on centralized operators who may potentially misbehave or leak confidential information outside of the tape print times. In contrast, Panther Protocol's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) and its zTrade functionality will elevate this concept by incorporating zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized smart contracts. This approach not only maintains the anonymity of participants but also eliminates the need for trust in a central operator. In comparison, the market for on-chain dark pools in crypto is still nascent but holds tremendous potential.</p>  Traditional dark pools in equities handle billions in daily trading volume, providing a significant liquidity pool for institutional investors.  Crypto dark pools are emerging, with protocols like Panther Protocol paving the way for secure, private, and compliant trading environments.  The potential growth of on-chain dark pools can mirror the success of traditional markets, offering a new value play for institutional and retail investors alike.   Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP / Shielded Pool) <p>At the heart of Panther Protocol's envisioned privacy capabilities lies the MASP. This innovative pool will allow users to deposit various underlying assets, including WETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC, and other ERC-20 tokens. Upon depositing, users will receive private tokens known as zAssets (e.g., zWETH, zUSDC, zUSDT, zWBTC), offering an additional layer of privacy.</p><p>The MASP is more accurately described as a collection of “append-only” Merkle trees, where each leaf represents a commitment to a UTXO, serving as an IOU of the asset deposited. This architecture ensures that the state of the blockchain remains confidential, enhancing both privacy and security. The growing number of deposits within this anonymity set further ensures that individual transactions remain indistinguishable within the pool, akin to the privacy provided by traditional dark pools.</p><p>Merkle trees, a key component in blockchain privacy architecture, play a significant role in Panther Protocol's functionality. Within the MASP, Merkle trees are used to store and manage zAsset transactions. Each leaf of the Merkle tree represents a commitment to a specific UTXO transaction, and these commitments are updated as transactions occur. This structure not only enhances privacy but also ensures the integrity and security of the transaction data.</p> zTrade <p>The zTrade feature within Panther Protocol will enable private, on-chain, over-the-counter (OTC) transactions within the MASP. This functionality is designed to ensure both confidentiality and security while mitigating the risk of MEV exploitation as swap occurs outside of DEXs.&nbsp;</p><p>The process begins when a user, referred to as the maker, locks a specified amount of zAsset (Token A) in a zTrade smart contract. The taker, or counterparty, accepts the order after the protocol verifies the balance of Token B. Once the balance is confirmed, the trade is executed via an atomic swap, ensuring a simultaneous and secure exchange of assets.</p><p>Avoidance of MEV is a critical component of zTrade. By utilizing zero-knowledge proofs and executing trades directly between makers and takers, zTrade mitigates the risk of MEV exploitation, ensuring that trades are conducted fairly and privately. This approach will mirror the confidentiality of traditional dark pools, where large financial moves are shielded from public view to prevent market manipulation.&nbsp;</p> zSwap <p>For transactions that extend beyond the MASP, Panther Protocol will employ zSwap. This feature will use DeFi adaptors to extend private asset velocity through on-chain decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap, Quickswap, and Curve. The process begins when the user selects the swap action and chooses the currencies for conversion. The DeFi aggregator smart contract would then generates a quote, valid for a short duration, reflecting the exchange value and transaction details. Upon user approval, the transaction would be initiated through the DeFi aggregator, which utilizes stealth addresses to maintain privacy. Once the transaction is approved and finalized, the new balance would be updated in the user's wallet.</p><p>Panther Protocol is designed to offer more than just dark pool functionality; it will enable a wide range of DeFi activities to be performed privately. By depositing assets into the MASP, users will be able to engage in various DeFi activities through plugins called DeFi Adaptors, which will connect the MASP with existing DeFi protocols in a private manner. This approach will ensure that transaction details remain confidential throughout the process, preserving user privacy even when interacting with external DeFi protocols.</p> <br>SEC's Regulatory Framework and Compliance <p>Muhammad Yusuf's discussion in "Diving Into Dark Pools" highlights the importance of regulatory compliance, particularly in the context of the SEC's oversight. Panther Protocol addresses these concerns through the integration of compliance providers for KYB procedures and Zone management. By allowing regulated entities to manage Zones and enforce compliance, users can maintain compliance at their discretion, with zero-knowledge proofs validating KYC statements without revealing user data.</p> Regulatory Compliance and Panther Zones <p>In alignment with regulatory frameworks, Panther Protocol aims to integrate VASP-regulated entities to create an environment that enables and supports internal compliance and policies. Users can utilize an Ethereum wallet, but must verify their personal identification to obtain a credential for interacting with the protocol. Business entities undergo KYB verification, sharing their business details with a registered compliance provider via Panther Protocol integration. This verification process is conducted off-chain, and credentials must be periodically renewed through re-verification on the KYB/KYC provider side.</p><p>Panther Zones are designed to introduce a novel approach to regulatory compliance within the space of decentralised protocols solving on-chain privacy. These specialized trading areas will be managed by regulated entities known as Zone Managers, who will be responsible for whitelisting traders and assets to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. Each Zone is intended to operate under its own regulatory framework, providing a flexible and compliant trading environment.</p> Benefits for Licensed Entities <p>Licensed entities such as institutional investors, hedge funds, and family offices can benefit from Panther Protocol's compliance infrastructure. For instance, an institutional investor aiming to execute substantial trades without disclosing their strategies will be able to leverage Panther Protocol to conduct these transactions privately. The use of zAssets as a mechanism of private transactions ensures that their trades do not affect market prices, safeguarding their strategies from being front-run by competitors.</p><p>Similarly, hedge funds can leverage the MASP and Panther Zones to conduct large-scale transactions while adhering to regulatory requirements. By utilizing VASP-regulated entities, these funds can ensure that all transactions are KYC/AML compliant, reducing the risk of regulatory scrutiny and enhancing the security of their trades.</p><p>Family offices, managing substantial private wealth, can use Panther Protocol to diversify their investments in a secure and private manner. The ability to operate within Panther Zones ensures that these entities can maintain compliance with varying regulatory requirements while benefiting from the privacy and security offered by the protocol.</p> Conclusion <p>Panther Protocol's innovative use of zero-knowledge proofs and Multi-Asset Shielded Pool technology positions it as a leader in private asset transactions within decentralized finance. By incorporating regulatory compliance through VASP-regulated entities, Panther Zones, and protection against MEV, Panther Protocol ensures that privacy, security, and legality coexist harmoniously. </p>

<p>This is the twenty-ninth post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by iOS Privacy Engineer Jacob Sikorski and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib, Lead for Privacy Engineering.</p>
<p>Starting with version 1.68, Brave will become the first iOS Web browser to try to upgrade all sites to HTTPS by default. When you click or enter an insecure link like <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>, Brave will automatically redirect to its secure version, <a href="https://example.com">https://example.com</a>. Using HTTPS is crucial to prevent Internet service providers (ISPs) and attackers from snooping on your browsing activity.</p>
<p>This update brings our <a>existing “HTTPS by Default”</a> feature to iOS, and represents a significant advancement beyond the earlier list-based approach that Brave used (and other iOS browsers still use). Previously, a site was only upgraded to HTTPS if its URL was included on specific lists, such as the once-useful but now-deprecated <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/https-actually-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> list. With this change, Brave will now do the opposite: all sites will be upgraded to be secure by default, and the only scenarios in which a site would not be upgraded are if the site appears on a much smaller <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-lists/blob/master/brave-lists/https-upgrade-exceptions-list.txt">exception list</a>, or if the upgrade fails. This change guarantees that even new websites not yet on upgrade lists will receive a secure connection by default, a significant win for Web privacy.</p>
<p>As always, Brave prioritizes privacy-first defaults, advocating for a secure Web for all users. Just like on desktop and Android, users will also be able to select an optional Strict mode for an additional warning before the connection falls back to HTTP. You can read more about how “HTTPS by Default” works and why it’s important for your privacy in our <a>previous blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The “HTTPS by Default” feature will soon roll out to iOS users through the App Store. Once you have the latest version, you can try out “HTTPS by Default” by visiting a site (such as <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>) on your iOS device and watching it be auto-upgraded to HTTPS.</p>

<p>As the crypto industry matures, more sophisticated market participants become involved. As a result, risk management and hedging will evolve to levels seen in TradFi. However, regardless of the preferred market activity, when interacting with a blockchain, every actor competes for the same limited blockspace. Based on demand levels, the cost for securing that blockspace can fluctuate (in the form of miner fees for Bitcoin transactions, or gas fees for PoS blockchains). Therefore, a particular niche of power users could lower these costs by reserving blockspace in advance of elevated demand levels.

<p>This post describes work done by Kleomenis Katevas, Stefanos Laskaridis, Aravindh Raman, Mihai Plesa, and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Senior Machine Learning Researcher Kleomenis Katevas.</p>
<p>In today’s fast-paced market, continuous evaluation of product releases is essential. Companies must regularly assess their products to stay competitive and meet evolving customer expectations. This process also provides crucial insights when comparing a product with competitors. However, there are significant challenges.</p>
<p>Automating cross-device mobile app activities—including shipping new features, simulating Web browsing user activity across different browsers and evaluating on-device machine learning models—is challenging, primarily due to inherent operating system (OS) restrictions. Moreover, accurately profiling the power consumption of these activities is difficult because of unreliable OS estimates and often lower sampling rates (number of samples per second).</p>
<p>To address the above challenges, we introduced BLaDE (BatteryLab Device Evaluations) as a successor to BatteryLab <a>1</a> <a>2</a> (originally released in 2019), which serves as Brave’s open-source solution for automated performance evaluations on mobile devices. Supporting both Android and iOS, BLaDE is capable of recording power consumption, CPU utilization, device temperature, and network traffic (bandwidth) in a highly precise and configurable frequency, while simulating user actions using different types of automation methods. By open sourcing the system design and code base, any developer or researcher can replicate this setup to conduct comprehensive performance evaluations on their own mobile devices.</p>

 BLaDE System Design 
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Our system is designed with the following key hardware components:</p>
 
 
<p>Main controller (Raspberry Pi 4, 8GB): The central device coordinator (internally known as BLaDE Runner) that’s responsible for managing and orchestrating all system activities.</p>
 
 
<p>Mac controller (Mac Mini, M2, 8-core): A Mac-based machine to support iOS-based automation through <a href="https://github.com/appium/appium">Appium</a>, and to build iOS apps through Xcode.</p>
 
 
<p>Power monitor (Monsoon HV): A critical component for measuring the power consumption of the connected devices at a maximum frequency of 5KHz.</p>
 
 
<p>Programmable AC switch (Keene KPS1): Utilized to control the power supply to the power monitor, enabling automated power cycling to the device.</p>
 
 
<p>Programmable relay board (Yizhet 5V, 8 Ch.): Utilized for controlling the power distribution from the power monitor to the devices. This is to programmatically select which device is powered on.</p>
 
 
<p>Programmable USB hub (YKUSH 3): These hubs allow selective powering on/off of USB connections, providing isolated power control for each port.</p>
 
 
<p>IR-thermometer (MLX90614): Deployed for continuous monitoring of device temperature.</p>
 
 
<p>LCD display (Waveshare LCD1602): A notification unit that reports the system state (device being monitored, real-time power consumption, etc).</p>
 
 
<p>Mobile devices: A variety of iOS (iPhone 14 Pro, SE 2022) and Android (Galaxy S23, Pixel 6a) devices, configured to be compatible with our BLaDE infrastructure.</p>
 
 
<p>Surveillance camera (Anker PowerConf C200): Employed to remotely monitor the status of evaluations. Although remote screencasting options are available via the OS, they are avoided as they could interfere with performance metrics.</p>
 
 
<p>Router (UniFi Dream Router): Connected to a 70MBit dedicated VLAN network, it provides Ethernet network access to the controller and Mac Mini, and WiFi 6 network access to all mobile devices. Additionally, it is capable of forwarding Internet traffic through a VPN service, if required, allowing simulation of Internet access from different geolocations.</p>
 
 

 Device configuration 
<p>To facilitate accurate power measurements, we stepped away from the available software-based options and utilized a battery bypass technique. This involves disassembling each device to remove its battery, extracting the internal battery controller, and exposing the power terminals via cables. This method allows us to monitor the devices’ power consumption directly from their power terminals, achieving precise measurements at a maximum frequency of 5 kHz using the power monitor.</p>
<p>Further configurations are made in the device’s OS to minimize the influence of extraneous factors. These include disabling automated OS and app updates, turning off adaptive brightness/charging/battery features, enabling dark mode, and standardizing the brightness level to 25% across devices.</p>

 Device testing automation 
<p>Automating testing on mobile devices, especially in this custom setup, can be a complex task. BLaDE provides a comprehensive set of APIs that facilitate various aspects of device management, such as reading device status, controlling power states, and managing measurement processes.</p>
<p>Consider the following example of the “switch on” API call for switching a mobile device:</p>
 
 
<p>Initialize and connect: Begin by switching on the power monitor. BLaDE waits until the monitor is available and establishes a connection.</p>
 
 
<p>Enable USB power: BLaDE then enables the USB power to the device, ensuring it is ready for further operations.</p>
 
 
<p>Relay activation: The appropriate relay on the relay board is activated to manage the power flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Voltage setting: Set the required voltage for the device to switch on.</p>
 
 
<p>Device synchronization: BLaDE waits for the device to become available and synchronizes its clock with the controller’s clock. This ensures time measurements are accurate.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlocking the device: For iOS devices, BLaDE connects using the Bluetooth HID service and enters the PIN to unlock the device. This step is required to allow the device to communicate via USB after boot.</p>
 
 
<p>When measuring the power performance of a phone, it is crucial to disable the USB power lanes. This step ensures that the USB current does not interfere with the power monitor readings. All communication with the device must be wireless, using either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, before or after the measurement has happened.</p>
<p>Currently, BLaDE supports automation via Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Bluetooth HID, and Appium-based frameworks:</p>

 Android Debug Bridge (ADB) automations (Android only) 
<p>The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a versatile command-line tool that allows developers to communicate with an Android device. It supports a wide range of device operations, such as installing and debugging applications, transferring files, and interacting with the device’s screen and keyboard. ADB commands can be executed via USB, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth. BLaDE builds on top of this tool to support actions that are required for device automations, such as “type text”, “tap”, “scroll down”, “close foreground app”, etc.</p>

 Bluetooth HID automations (iOS, Android) 
<p>Automating third-party apps on iOS presents challenges due to the absence of a publicly available ADB-like API that operates over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. To address this, we have virtualized a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard by creating a virtual Human Interface Device (HID) service at the controller. We also created an automation library that translates keyboard keystrokes, mouse clicks, and gestures into HID actions, effectively simulating user interactions with the controlled device. This approach allows for the automation of tasks—such as locating and launching apps and interacting with them—by mimicking user actions.&nbsp;</p>

 Appium-based automations (iOS, Android) 
<p>As an alternative approach, we experimentally support an Appium-based framework to automate actions, minimizing the overhead of the above automation methods when aiming multiple platforms. Appium uses ADB for Android and Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest">XCTest</a> for iOS automations. Although Appium is generally used for testing features of custom application builds, we currently experiment with the framework to predominantly measure the performance of Android and iOS apps.</p>

 BLaDE for product evaluations 
<p>The use of BLaDE is crucial to our product pipeline, ensuring the performance, robustness and reliability of various features, including on-device performance of LLMs, cost efficiency of modules, and browsing capabilities. When a new development build is ready and a specific feature needs to be tested, it is dispatched on-demand to BLaDE for an in-depth performance assessment across devices. This process helps identify new regressions and bottlenecks, enabling us to address issues swiftly and maintain the high standards our users expect. With BLaDE’s continuous monitoring, we can confidently release updates, assured that any potential performance issues have been proactively managed.</p>

  The AI Supply Chain Tug of War  <p>Big Tech is absorbing demand risk from the AI supply chain. How long can it last?</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published August 12, 2024
  



 
<p>Here’s the question now being asked all across the AI ecosystem: Is there a way for someone else to take on the demand risk from AI, while I capture the profits?</p>



<p>Today, Big Tech companies have stepped up to alleviate some of this tension. They are acting as risk-absorbers within the system, taking on as much demand risk as they possibly can, and driving the supply chain toward greater and greater CapEx escalation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In part one of this piece, we’ll walk through the tug of war between supply chain players over risk and profit. In part two, we’ll unpack the instability of today’s equilibrium.</p>



 



 Who Should Bear the Demand Risk from AI? Who Should Capture the Profits? 



<p>In the supply chain, risks are transferred from suppliers, who need to build CapEx to manufacture products, upstream up to their customers, who pay a margin that compensates for this capital expenditure over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each player wants to maximize profit while minimizing risk. This creates supply chain conflict, which lurks behind the scenes, and exposes itself in pairwise game theoretic interactions between suppliers and their customers. Below, we’ll give one example of how this tension manifests for each layer of the supply chain.</p>







 
 Foundry Layer: TSMC is Nvidia’s manufacturing partner. The more manufacturing capacity TSMC builds for Nvidia, the more it is exposed to future demand fluctuations. The fewer fabs it builds, however, the more problems Nvidia will have with its supply shortage. Thus arises the core tension in this relationship: TSMC’s incentive is to have just enough availability to serve Nvidia, and nothing more. Nvidia’s incentive is for TSMC to build as much CapEx as possible, to maximize availability. In this relationship, TSMC has all the leverage—it is the dominant pure play foundry globally and serves many customers, including Nvidia’s competitors. Thus, as we try to forecast the future of AI, we should expect the stable equilibrium to be that TSMC underbuilds capacity relative to peak demand. An example where this will manifest: TSMC is currently planning out future CapEx for its <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21413/tsmc-performance-and-yields-of-2nm-on-track-mass-production-to-start-in-2025">2nm node</a>. We might expect that however much capacity TSMC chooses to build, it will be less than the amount that Nvidia and other AI chip companies will have requested. 
 



 
 Semiconductor Layer: One of the great ironies of AI is that while the big cloud companies and Nvidia are all members of the “Magnificent 7”—and their fates tend to be correlated as investors wax and wane on AI’s potential—these companies are actually diametrically opposed on many dimensions. For example, the cloud companies are extremely resistant to Nvidia’s profit capture in AI, and they are all working on their own competitive chips. At the same time, Nvidia has been trying to compete with its biggest customers by directing chip supply to new entrants like Coreweave and by building its own cloud business with DGX cloud. The semiconductor tug of war is primarily about profit margins. 
 



 
 Industrial Supply Layer: The industrial supply chain is another realm where we can see the ripples of risk transfer at work. When we talk to Big Tech companies, one consistent refrain we hear is that they are trying to buy out all the manufacturing capacity they can get for industrial components like diesel generators and cooling systems, and also for commodities like steel and electrical transformers. Their suppliers find these orders volumes almost hard to believe and are actually resistant to serving this demand; they are concerned that if they double their manufacturing capacity, they will be left with excess capacity in the future. To resolve this conflict, the cloud companies are making big commitments—promising to buy many years of supply ahead of time—to incentivize industrial CapEx. 
 



 
 Cloud Layer: The cloud layer is the lynchpin holding everything together. We will discuss this in depth in part two of this post. 
 



 
 Model Layer: If you are OpenAI, Anthropic or Gemini, you want to get as much compute as possible for your frontier model, because more compute means a more intelligent model. If you are Azure, AWS or GCP, however, you want to direct GPU or CPU compute to Enterprise customers—this is your main business. Thus, the main conflict at the model layer is over data center capacity allocation. Since the model layer today is not profitable, these allocations are negotiated between cloud executives and research lab leaders. These negotiations are made more complicated by ownership structures, where the research labs are either partially or wholly owned by the clouds. As model sizes grow by 10x, these power struggles will only be exacerbated.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Customer Layer: Hooray for the customer! At the end of this long and complex chain, there is an application layer AI startup or an Enterprise buyer calling an API and querying a foundation model. What is “demand risk” to everyone else is “the luxury of choice” to the customer. Customers can use AI models on-demand, and they can easily switch between vendors at their discretion. If customers ever decide the AI is not useful enough, they can turn it off. The entire supply chain is in service of this customer, who benefits from competition and supply chain efficiency.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The entire supply chain hinges on the last link—the customer. The supply chain is to some degree positive sum: Everyone benefits as the total profit dollars in AI increases. However, as the prior examples highlight, it can also be zero sum: My revenue is your cost, in the case of Nvidia and the clouds. My CapEx is my risk and your benefit, in the case of TSMC and Nvidia.</p>



<p>The tug of war dynamic also helps to explain some of the supply shortages we continue to see in AI, such as shortages in the industrial supply chain. No matter how much pressure they get, there’s only so much demand risk suppliers are willing to take on.</p>



 



 A Fragile Equilibrium: Big Tech is Propping up the Supply Chain 



<p>Today, the big cloud giants are acting as risk-absorbers in this system. They absorb risk from their downstream partners Nvidia and TSMC through large orders that generate huge short-term profits for these companies. They also absorb risk from upstream partners: The cloud companies are the largest source of funding for frontier model companies and they subsidize end customers in the form of low API prices and bundled credits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are four concrete examples of this risk-absorption mechanism at work:</p>



 
 GPUs—Now or Later? It’s in Nvidia’s best interest to sell as many H100 GPUs as possible now, and then sell more B100s and next-gen chips in the future. It’s in hyperscalers best interest to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4708295-microsoft-corporation-msft-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript">fill their data centers</a> with GPUs on as-needed basis (this means building data center “shells” and then only installing GPUs once demand materializes). What is actually happening in the market? Hyperscalers seem to be competing with one another for GPU supply and placing big orders with Nvidia to make sure they don’t fall behind. Rather than waiting, they are stockpiling GPUs now and paying twice: First, a hefty upfront expense, and second, higher expected future depreciation. 
 



 
 Data Center Construction: The real estate developers who build and assemble data centers are getting a pretty sweet deal. These companies take on almost no demand risk. Developers like CyrusOne, QTS, and Vantage build data centers for big tech companies, but they will only start construction after they’ve signed a 15 or 20-year lease. And they structure these deals so that they can pay back their investment during the lease period alone—they limit their “residual risk” around the long-term value of the data center asset (e.g., even if prices collapse after the lease period, they can still make money). The long-term demand risk squarely sits with the cloud providers. 
 



 
 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements: We’ve all seen headlines of late about GPU financing deals and the debt that’s being issued to finance GPU purchases. What many people don’t realize is that most of this debt is actually backed up by rental guarantees from Big Tech. These agreements seem so robust that many debt investors see themselves as investing in Big Tech corporate debt, not in GPUs. The incentive for Big Tech in these deals is to turn an upfront capital expense into a recurring operating expense. This is a very clear example of how Big Tech companies—even when they are not directly doing the financing—are actually backstopping much of the investment activity happening in AI today. 
 



 
 Research Lab Funding and Exits: The Big Tech companies are the largest source of funding today for AI research labs. The biggest labs—OpenAI and Anthropic—are each backed by one of the large clouds. The recent exits of Inflection, Adept and Character demonstrate that it may be increasingly difficult to operate without such a backstop.&nbsp; 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Supply chain players understand <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B question</a>, and they are working to navigate it—maximizing their profit margins and minimizing their demand risk. The result is a dynamic tug of war between some of the most sophisticated companies in the world.</p>



<p>Today, the tug of war has resulted in a temporary equilibrium. Supply chain players are offloading their demand risk to Big Tech, to the maximum degree possible. Big Tech companies—either due to AI optimism or <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">oligopolistic competition</a>—are stepping in to absorb this risk and <a href="https://x.com/DavidCahn6/status/1816146922060890542">keep CapEx cranking</a>.</p>



<p>This equilibrium is fragile: If at any point the tech giants blink, demand all along the supply chain will decline precipitously. Further, the longer the Big Tech companies continue to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">double down on CapEx</a>, the more they are at risk of finding themselves deeply in the hole should AI progress encounter any stumbles.</p>

<p>Chelsea Komlo joined the Zcash Foundation (ZF) in <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-a-core-engineer-and-researcher/">August 2019</a>, as a core engineer and researcher, and was later appointed to the role of Chief Scientist, leading ZF’s research efforts. Prior to joining ZF, Chelsea worked as an engineer on open source security and privacy projects, most notably Tor and the Off-The-Record (OTR) messaging protocol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During her time with ZF, Chelsea’s primary research focus has been threshold signature schemes. She collaborated with Ian Goldberg at the University of Waterloo to create <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">FROST</a>, a Schnorr threshold signature protocol that is compatible with Zcash shielded transactions. Chelsea then worked with others across the industry to standardize the FROST signing protocol, which was recently published as an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9591.html">RFC</a>. Most&nbsp;recently she has been participating in the NIST standardization effort for threshold signature schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chelsea is leaving ZF to take up another research role, focusing on post-quantum cryptography. However, she remains an avid supporter of the Zcash mission, and will remain involved as a member of the ZF’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the Zcash Foundation, and Zcash ecosystem as a whole, we want to thank Chelsea for her contributions to Zcash and the broader mission of financial privacy. While we are sad to see her leave, we are thrilled that she has found an opportunity to advance her already-distinguished career.&nbsp;</p>

  Steel, Servers and Power: What it Takes to Win the Next Phase of AI  <p>The qualifying round is over—in the new era construction is king. </p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published August 5, 2024
  



 
<p>The race to model parity has been the defining project of the last 12 months in AI. This phase was characterized by the search for new research techniques, better training data and larger cluster sizes.</p>



<p>The next phase in the AI race is going to look different: It will be defined more by physical construction than by scientific discovery.</p>



<p>Up until now, you could fit your training cluster into an existing data center via colocation or retrofit. If you needed to increase cluster size from 15k GPUs to 25k GPUs, you found a way to plug-in more GPUs. This is changing: The “<a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html?ref=blog.heim.xyz">Bitter Lesson</a>”—which most market participants in AI have internalized—says that model size is the number one driver of performance. As a result, the next generation of models are aiming for a 10x increase in model scale to 300k GPUs. To house one of these models, you need to build an entire new data center.</p>



<p>This changes AI in two fundamental ways: First, it changes the lead time between models. If before you could train your model in 6 to 12 months, now you need to add 18 to 24 months of construction time before you can actually start training. Second, it changes the source of maximum competitive advantage. In the new era, construction efficiency may matter more than research breakthroughs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This sea change in how AI works was a major theme of big tech earnings last week. Annualized CapEx for big tech increased from $138B to $229B year-over-year. This incremental $91B in run-rate spending is a good proxy for new AI data center construction—an enormous investment.</p>



<p>Today’s CapEx will likely yield fruit somewhere between late 2025 and early 2026, at which point we’ll find out if these larger models are intelligent enough to unlock new revenue streams and generate a return on investment.&nbsp;</p>



Source: Earnings transcripts, public filings. “Incremental CapEx” is a proxy for run-rate spend on new AI data centers.



<p>So what exactly is going to happen over the next 1 to 2 years, and how does one “win” in this new phase of AI?</p>



<p>Building data centers is a messy and complex business. We think day-to-day operational execution is going to have the biggest impact on who is most successful. Here’s how it works behind the scenes:1</p>



 
 A real estate developer—QTS, Vantage and CyrusOne are three popular ones—goes and buys land and power that they believe a data center can be built on. 



 The developer approaches the big tech companies and offers them a 15-year or 20-year lease on the data center, for a total cost of $2-10B. 



 Once the developer has a signed deal, they go to the capital markets, and they raise debt against the deal, usually from banks or real estate investors. 



 The debt investors are not underwriting the future AI demand in the data center—they are underwriting the credit of the customer, say Microsoft or Amazon, and expect a yield that is a slight premium to corporate debt. 



 The developer goes and hires a general contractor—for example, <a href="https://www.dpr.com/">DPR</a>, one of the most popular data center builders. 



 The general contractor goes and hires subcontractors. The subcontractors then go and recruit labor. Labor is a huge component of the cost of data center construction. 



 Labor moves to the location where the data center is getting built—for example, a small town or city—and they are put up in hotels or other accommodations in the area. 



 Over a two year period, a massive construction project takes place, starting with steel and concrete for the overall structure, and ending with industrial parts and GPUs being installed. 



 During this whole process, the end-user of the data center (e.g., Microsoft or Amazon) is negotiating with their own supply chain for diesel generators, liquid cooling systems, and other necessary equipment. 
 



<p>Today, five companies have arrived at the starting line in this new race toward data center scale-up: Microsoft/OpenAI, Amazon/Anthropic, Google, Meta and xAI. Each has a model that has held up against serious benchmarks, and the necessary capital to proceed.</p>



<p>With the market structure now crystallized, we can begin to see how each player will take a unique approach—derived from their own business fundamentals—in order to win:</p>



 
 Meta and xAI are consumer companies, and they will both vertically integrate, hoping to benefit from each having a single founder decision maker who can streamline and tightly couple model building efforts with data center design and construction. Both companies will seek to launch killer consumer applications on the back of more intelligent models. 



 Microsoft and Amazon have grizzled data center teams and deep pockets, and they’ve leveraged these assets to forge partnerships with the top tier research labs. They hope to monetize through 1) Selling training to other companies, and 2) Selling model inference. They will need to manage resource allocation between their frontier models (GPT 5 and Claude 4) and other data centers being built for Enterprise customer use. 



 Google has both a consumer business and a cloud business, and also has its own in-house research team. On Friday, the company announced it was bringing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/02/character-ai-ceo-noam-shazeer-returns-to-google/">Noam Shazeer</a> back into the fold. Google also has vertically integrated all the way down to the chip layer with TPUs. These factors should provide long-term structural advantages. 
 



<p>With CapEx plans now firmly in place and the competitive landscape set, the new AI era begins. In this new phase of AI, steel, servers and power will replace models, compute and data as the “must-wins” for anyone hoping to pull ahead.</p>



 
 In this example, we assume a lease structure. In the case of an internal build, the hyperscaler acts both as the customer and as the real estate developer.

<p>TL;DR: In July, we launched Empe Blockchain’s open Empe Testnet, drawing 100+ validators in 48 hours. Key updates include monitoring tools, wallet support, CosmWasm integration for smart contracts, enhanced vesting accounts, and a linear inflation model for stable token release. These steps are vital for a secure and efficient blockchain platform.</p><p>Our journey to create the highest value End-to-End verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) on the market is marked by continuous improvement and a deep commitment to our users. As we continue to pour precious hours into research and development, always listening closely to your feedback, we’re excited to share our progress in&nbsp;July.</p> Empe Blockchain Infrastructure Development <p>In anticipation of the upcoming <a href="https://empe.io/technology/">Empe Blockchain</a> mainnet launch, we have built and configured our core network infrastructure. At its heart are the main validator nodes, which form the backbone of the system. To safeguard these critical components, we’ve established sentry nodes as a protective shield. These nodes act as the primary interface between the validators and the external network, mitigating potential threats. This robust infrastructure is essential to ensure the network’s stability and security as we approach the highly anticipated mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Open Empe Testnet&nbsp;Launch <p>July marked the successful launch of our open <a href="https://explorer-testnet.empe.io/">Empe Testnet</a>, attracting over 100 external validators within the first 48 hours of operation. To facilitate this successful launch, we integrated essential tools like <a href="https://testnet.ping.pub/">testnet.ping.pub</a> for comprehensive monitoring and <a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr wallet</a> support for EMPE tokens, and published comprehensive <a href="https://docs.empe.io/">technical documentation</a>, to ensure a smooth onboarding experience.</p><p>The current validator count exceeds 150 and is steadily climbing. This surge in validator participation brings forth a multitude of advantages. Enhanced network security safeguards the system against potential attacks. Decentralization fosters trust and transparency within the Empeiria ecosystem. Moreover, the robust foundation laid by the Testnet paves the way for future scalability. This achievement wouldn’t be possible without the incredible support of our community, highlighting the growing excitement surrounding Empeiria’s innovations.</p> Integration of CosmWasm for Smart Contract Functionality <p>Empe Blockchain now supports <a href="https://cosmwasm.com/">CosmWasm</a>, enabling smart contract functionality from day one. This integration allows developers to create and deploy smart contracts seamlessly, enhancing the versatility and utility of our platform. The addition of CosmWasm support marks a significant milestone in our journey towards creating a more versatile blockchain ecosystem.</p> Vesting Accounts Module Enhancements <p>To provide greater control and security for vested assets, we’ve enhanced the vesting accounts module. Users can now create new vesting accounts based on existing ones. These new accounts adhere to the same or more stringent lock-up periods and parameters as the original accounts. This functionality ensures that funds remain securely locked and transparent for all stakeholders, providing a robust framework for managing vested assets and fostering trust and confidence among all stakeholders.</p> Linear Inflation Model&nbsp;Adoption <p>To address the limitations of the dynamic inflation model traditionally used in Cosmos-based blockchains, we have adopted a linear inflation model for Empe Blockchain’s minting module. This new approach releases a fixed number of tokens over specified periods, as defined during the genesis stage. Additionally, the inflation rate will gradually decrease over subsequent periods. This predictable and transparent model aims to provide a more stable economic environment for our blockchain ecosystem.</p> Proof of Attendance with Passwordless Authentication based on the Proof of&nbsp;Purchase <p>We have successfully integrated a passwordless authentication system, allowing users to securely access their Proof of Attendance (PoAP) using Proof of Purchase (PoP) credentials. This system leverages unique PoP tokens to authenticate users without the need for traditional passwords. The backend services have been enhanced to generate and manage unique PoP tokens for each purchase, ensuring secure and verifiable access to related PoA records. The user interface has been updated to streamline the passwordless login process, providing a simple and intuitive flow for users to authenticate using their PoP credentials.</p> Schema Update for Proof of Attendance &amp; Proof of&nbsp;Purchase <p>The new data schemas for Proof of Attendance (PoAP) and Proof of Purchase (PoP) have been finalized and approved, ensuring compatibility with industry standards. Backend services have been updated to support the new schemas, including adjustments to the data storage architecture and API endpoints to handle the additional data fields and&nbsp;types.</p><p>These advancements are crucial steps toward a more secure, efficient, and developer-friendly verifiable data infrastructure. Your ongoing support and insightful feedback play a vital role in this journey, and we sincerely appreciate both.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="https://twitter.com/empe_io">X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

<p>Decentralization, the cornerstone of blockchain technology, has long been a formidable challenge. Building a robust, secure, and scalable network requires significant time, resources, and technical expertise. Yet, in just 48 hours, Empeiria defied expectations by establishing a decentralized network with over 100 validators. How did we accomplish such a rapid decentralization?</p> 1. Foundation of Innovation: Prototype Development and&nbsp;Research <p>The journey began with a deep dive into the market’s needs. Last year, we embarked on a critical phase of our project by developing an initial prototype. This prototype served as a key tool for gathering feedback from over 70 prospective customers. Their insights were essential in refining our approach and aligning our solution with market&nbsp;needs.</p><p>To transform these insights into a viable and effective product, we dedicated over 15,000 hours to research and development. This extensive effort was focused on addressing the specific needs and challenges identified through customer feedback. The result was a solution designed to meet market demands effectively and demonstrate a clear product-market fit.</p> 2. Testnet Phase 1: Launch and Testing Frameworks <p>To validate the prototype’s capabilities and identify potential issues, Empe Testnet launched Testnet Phase 1. A comprehensive testing framework was implemented, encompassing end-to-end testing, simulation testing, and continuous monitoring. This rigorous approach allowed the team to fine-tune the platform and prepare it for the next&nbsp;phase:</p>  End-to-End (E2E) Testing Framework:<br>This framework allowed us to assess the complete functionality of the system from start to finish, ensuring that all components and processes were integrated smoothly and performed as expected.  Simulation Testing:<br>We utilized simulation testing to create various scenarios and stress-test the network under different conditions. This approach helped us identify potential issues and optimize the system for real-world use.  Monitoring Mechanisms:<br>Comprehensive monitoring tools were established to continuously track system performance and stability. These mechanisms provided real-time insights, enabling us to promptly detect and address any&nbsp;issues.  <p>The rigorous testing during Testnet Phase 1 was crucial for refining our solution and preparing it for the next stage, setting the stage for successful external validation.</p> 3. Intensive Testing and Optimization <p>Building on the insights gained from Testnet Phase 1, Empe Testnet embarked on 12 weeks of intensive testing and optimization. Every aspect of the platform was scrutinized, and necessary adjustments were made to enhance performance and reliability. This meticulous process was crucial in ensuring the platform’s readiness for the next stage and allowed us&nbsp;to:</p>  Identify and Fix Issues: We systematically pinpointed problems and implemented solutions to address them. Each issue was carefully resolved to enhance the system’s stability and functionality.  Optimize Performance: Beyond troubleshooting, we optimized the system to improve efficiency and responsiveness. This involved fine-tuning various components and processes to ensure they operated at peak performance.  <p>The comprehensive testing and optimization during these 12 weeks were critical in refining our system, paving the way for a robust and reliable solution in subsequent phases.</p> 4. Building Community Through Education <p>Recognizing the importance of community engagement, our strategic approach included reaching out to <a href="https://x.com/empe_io">our community on X</a> to release a series of educational content. By sharing valuable insights and fostering open dialogue, we not only increased awareness but also created a foundation for future growth. This initiative played a crucial role&nbsp;in:</p>  Educating the Community: We provided valuable insights into the benefits and implications of verifiable data, helping our audience understand its importance and&nbsp;impact.  Fostering a Supportive Network: By engaging with users through informative content, we cultivated a dedicated community that supports and values our technology.  Strengthening the Ecosystem: This educational outreach not only informed, but also built a network of advocates who contribute to and enhance the overall strength of our ecosystem.  <p>Through these efforts, we successfully created a knowledgeable and engaged community that reinforces the foundation of our&nbsp;project.</p> 5. Testnet Phase 2: Opening to External Validators <p>The culmination of the project was the launch of Testnet Phase 2, which invited external validators to join the network. The response was overwhelming, with over 100 validators joining within 48 hours. This rapid expansion demonstrated the platform’s appeal and the strength of the community built through education and engagement. This phase marked a pivotal&nbsp;moment:</p>  Onboarding External Validators: We began by integrating our first external validators into the network. Their involvement was crucial for expanding and testing the system’s capabilities in a real-world environment.  Viral Engagement: The news of our open Testnet quickly spread, generating significant interest. The momentum was remarkable, with additional validators joining the network within hours of the initial&nbsp;launch.   Conclusion <p>In just 48 hours, Empeiria successfully decentralized its network with over 100 validators. This achievement highlights the effectiveness of our approach, which combined thorough research, extensive testing, and proactive community engagement.</p><p>The key takeaway from this success is the importance of aligning product development with market needs and maintaining a rigorous testing and optimization process. This approach, coupled with a well-informed and engaged community, proved instrumental in reaching our decentralization goals&nbsp;swiftly.</p><p>Our focus remains on continuing to refine and advance our technology, leveraging the lessons learned to drive further innovation in decentralized networks.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="https://twitter.com/empe_io">X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

Technical Setup &amp; Troubleshooting</p><p>2. Rewards &amp;&nbsp;Staking</p><p>3. Project Overview &amp;&nbsp;Updates</p> 1. Technical Setup &amp; Troubleshooting <p>Q: How many tokens do I need to register as a validator? <br>A: You need 1 EMPE token, equivalent to 1,000,000 uEMPE&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Q: Why can’t I register as a validator? <br>A: Ensure your node is synchronized and you have enough tokens. Refer to the technical documentation for more details: [Technical Documentation.](<a href="https://docs.empe.io/validators/overview">https://docs.empe.io/validators/overview</a>)</p><p>Q: How do I use the EMPE faucet? <br>A: Check the Telegram group for Validators for the faucet link: [Empeiria Validators](<a href="https://t.me/EmpeValidators">https://t.me/EmpeValidators</a>) <br>1. Use the tokens to register your validator. <br>2. Opening a validator does not guarantee a position in the active set. <br>3. Tokens can be claimed only&nbsp;once.</p><p>Q: I ran a script and got an RPC error. What happened? <br>A: Your RPC might not be synchronized, or you may not have enough funds in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Q: How can I access the binary code? <br>A: Binary code access will be available on the&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Q: What is a moniker? <br>A: A moniker is the name you give your validator to help identify it&nbsp;easily.</p><p>Q: Can I edit my moniker after registering? <br>A:&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>Q: What should I do if I have a technical issue? <br>A: You can always ask other validators for support: [Empeiria Validators](<a href="https://t.me/EmpeValidators">https://t.me/EmpeValidators</a>). If it’s a major problem, contact the Empe&nbsp;team.</p><p>Q: How do I get my validator unjailed?<br>A: Use the command:<br>emped tx slashing unjail --from &lt;&lt;KEY_NAME&gt;&gt; --fees&nbsp;40uempe</p><p>Q: Once my validator is jailed and I used the above command to unjail it, how many EMPE tokens do I need to return to the active set?<br>A: You need to have more tokens than the last validator in the active&nbsp;set.</p><p>Q: How do I set up EMPE GAS FEE?<br>A: If you are getting a gas error, increase the fee and make sure you have enough tokens to cover the gas&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Q: Can I park my validator, close it, and return later? Can I use any VPS for running the Empe testnet validator? <br>A: Yes, you can park your validator and use any VPS. However, be aware that shutting down a node with bonded tokens might result in jailing. To prevent this, avoid keeping your validator offline for extended periods. You can delegate your tokens to another validator while your node is offline. When restarting, make sure only one instance of your validator is running to avoid issues with trapping your validator and tokens. Always keep your private keys secure, and do not run a second instance with the same private keys, as this will lead to permanent jailing.</p><p>Q: Can I use the Empe wallet to register my validator on the Empe network? <br>A: No, the Empe wallet is designed for managing decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials, not for crypto tokens. Please use the Keplr wallet for claiming tokens and validator registration.</p><p>Q: Do I have to create a DID (Decentralized Identifier) using the EMPE wallet to join the Empe testnet as a validator? <br>A: No, use the Keplr wallet&nbsp;only.</p><p>Q: When I create a fee, which values should I use for Empe tokens? <br>A: Use uEMPE, where 1 EMPE = 1,000,000 uEMPE, similar to how Satoshi is used for&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>Q: How can I provide feedback on the testnet? <br>A: You can share your thoughts and experiences through our official communication channels. Contact moderators from the Empeiria Validators Telegram group for any feedback you may&nbsp;have.</p> 2. Rewards &amp;&nbsp;Staking <p>Q: Is the Empe testnet incentivized? Will I get rewards or more delegation for creating validator services? <br>A: Yes, active testnet participants who maintain their nodes until the mainnet launch and for at least 60 days will receive a bonus in the form of foundation delegation on the mainnet. Additional incentives to increase the delegation allocation will be announced later.</p><p>Q: Is it possible to receive delegation from the team? <br>A: Team delegations are currently not available.

<p>How many days have passed since the last major data leak or security breach? Most likely, zero. From the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197052/att-data-breach-call-text-records-hack">phone records of AT&amp;T110 million customers exposed in a recent leak</a> to the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/aadhar-data-leak-personal-data-of-81-5-crore-indians-on-sale-on-dark-web-report/articleshow/104856898.cms?from=mdr">815 million passport details, names, phone numbers, and addresses stolen by hackers in India</a>, one thing is clear — our private data is anything but&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The repercussions of these breaches are profound. Beyond financial implications — the average global cost of a data breach exceeds 4.45 million U.S. dollars per incident — trust is the main casualty, eroding confidence in digital interactions and services.</p><p>Given this ever-present vulnerability, the question becomes: how can we reclaim control of our data and navigate the digital world with confidence? At Empeiria, we understand these challenges and have developed a technological toolbox to help you achieve just&nbsp;that.</p> Why is Our Data So Vulnerable? <p>In today’s digital world, our private data forms the cornerstone of countless online interactions. We entrust companies with a vast amount of information, from financial details to browsing habits. However, a critical issue persists: the vulnerability of this data to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p><p>But why is that? Why is our data so vulnerable? The answer lies in the inherent weaknesses of the current data frameworks, which leave your information exposed in several&nbsp;ways:</p>  Centralized Storage: Currently, user data is usually stored on centralized company servers. This creates a single point of failure — if hackers breach these servers, a massive amount of data can be compromised all at&nbsp;once.  Data Silos: Our information is often scattered across numerous platforms and services. This fragmentation makes it difficult to track and control how our data is used and protected.  Weak Encryption: While some companies encrypt data, encryption practices can vary. Weak encryption algorithms can leave information vulnerable to attackers.  Human Error: Accidental data leaks by employees can occur due to mistakes or social engineering attacks. Traditional access controls might not be granular enough, granting access to more data than necessary.  The Evolving Regulatory Landscape: The legal landscape surrounding data security is constantly evolving. Regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aim to give individuals more control over their data. However, these regulations can be complex and challenging for companies to navigate, creating additional hurdles in securing user information.  <p>In the end, the current state of data security leaves much to be desired. Our information resides in silos, on centralized servers, vulnerable to breaches and misuse. Traditional frameworks leave us at the mercy of companies, hoping they’ll act responsibly with our data — a trust that’s often&nbsp;broken.</p><p>But there’s a solution, and it lies in technological innovation. By leveraging cutting-edge tech advancements, we can build a future where users reclaim control of their data and change how we ensure the security of our data&nbsp;forever.</p> The Solution: End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) <p>Here at Empeiria, we believe data ownership is the key to the future of digital interactions. This is why we built our <a href="https://empe.io/technology/">End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI)</a> on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). This framework empowers users with unprecedented control over their information. Within it, it’s the users themselves and not third parties who own and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>By expanding upon the concepts of SSI, EVDI offers a new approach to data security by addressing the fundamental weaknesses of traditional data frameworks:</p><p>Data Ownership: In EVDI, instead of centralized data silos, data is securely stored in users’ verifiable data wallets. These wallets act as personal vaults where individuals manage their information securely. EVDI gives users full control over their data. No third party, or even Empeiria itself, has access to users’ data. By storing data in users’ wallets, EVDI fixes one of the main vulnerabilities of the current system: a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>Built-in trust: EVDI operates on a trustless architecture of Empe Blockchain, where trust is not assumed, or delegated to a third party, but built into the technology itself. Traditional systems typically rely on centralized authorities to manage, protect, and verify data. In contrast, EVDI leverages decentralized networks and cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity without the need for intermediaries. No sensitive data is stored on Empe Blockchain, which serves as an immutable record of data ownership and a tool for data verification, without compromising data security.</p><p>Streamlined Compliance with Regulations: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding data security can be challenging. EVDI lets companies forget the compliance headache. It keeps data in the user’s control, automatically adhering to regulations. This simplifies compliance for businesses, saving them time, effort, and&nbsp;money.</p><p>In a world where data breaches are increasingly commonplace and traditional security measures fall short, Empeiria’s End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) offers a practical solution. By empowering individuals with control over their data and leveraging advanced decentralized technologies, it paves the way for a more secure digital experience.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="http://www.x.com/empe_io">Twitter/X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

Your diligent testing and valuable feedback are critical to our mission.</p><p>We are pleased to share that testing for Stage 6 is now complete, providing valuable insights and resulting in updates to our codebase.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce that Stage 7 of our testnet is live. This stage includes simulated Swap functionality, Data Escrow, and major upgrades to the user history interface.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: Panther’s test network is now on Amoy, Polygon’s test network and can be accessed <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Swap functionality <p>Swap functionality is now simulated in the testnet. Users can “swap” their shielded assets (zAssets) within Panther Protocol’s Shielded Pool while interacting with test versions of external decentralized Swap protocols like Uniswap V3 and QuickSwap, both of which are on Amoy, Polygon’s test network. These transactions occur inside Panther Protocol’s shielded Zones, ensuring the privacy of the transactions is preserved.</p> How to test the swap feature <p>To prepare the transaction, a user (1) selects the token types (Target Pairing) for the swap and (2) set the amount to send (swap from). The user can see the estimated amount to receive (swap to). Then select which token is being sent and which is being received.&nbsp;</p><p>The following features are included with the release, and must be specified by the user prior to making the swap.&nbsp;</p>  Routing: By default, the protocol selects the most efficient route. The user can override this option based on preference.  Slippage: Panther Protocol will allow users to prevent transactions where slippage exceeds their preferences.  Transaction Deadline: Automatically sets the time frame after which a pending transaction will autoif not completed. The current setting is fixed at 5 minutes.&nbsp;  <p>Prior to submitting the swap request, users can review details such as any impact that the resulting swap will have on price, using information such as liquidity, order book depth and order size; the fees from using the external swap protocols, guaranteed minimums received and exchange rate/conversion ratios.</p> Data Escrow <p>Data Escrow is an important Product Feature that supports Compliance Data requirements. Panther Protocols has implemented different types of Data Safe mechanism based on the roles that the DAO, Institutions (also referred as the Zone Manager) and Compliance provider perform to support this.</p><p>In the next stage, we will continue to build the decryption mechanism for those roles to access the data. The whole process will be tested when those roles participate in the testing process - essentially we see this as a process to Zone Manager testing the protocol along with other participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> History page <p>The History page UI has been updated with more of the details you will want to track, enabling you to keep records of your testnet transactions (including transaction types,amounts, asset types, value and date and time), mimicking how it will work once the protocol is live.&nbsp;</p> Disclaimer <p>For the avoidance of doubt, tZKP, tzZKP, tPRP, test MATIC, and any other tokens mentioned in this announcement or within the product are for testing purposes only and have no economic value, nor can they be exchanged for value.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation on our incentivized Testnet versions may result in you earning rewards, but such credits are not represented on any blockchain as tokens.</p>

<p>In 2017, Vitalik Buterin defined the ‘Scalability Trilemma’ which consisted of 3 attributes that every blockchain had to balance depending on its intended use cases: decentralisation, scalability and security. While Ethereum sacrificed scalability in favour of security and decentralisation, others prioritised throughput over the other two. However, a solution was proposed, inspired from Web2 computer science - sharding. Despite the fact that Ethereum’s ossification and significant progress in zero knowledge research led to a shift in Ethereum’s roadmap away from execution sharding towards L2 rollups, there were other L1s that were designed from the get-go as sharded blockchains. One such example was Elrond, who implemented the beacon chain PoS consensus alongside a sharded execution layer. Their recent rebranding to MultiversX alludes to a multi-chain, interoperable ecosystem, in which sovereign chains can communicate in a similar manner to cross-shard transaction routing.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Lucian’s background and founding Elrond (MultiversX)  Elrond’s validator &amp; shard architecture  Cross-shard composability  VMs, smart contracts and transaction routing  Self sovereignty and modularity  MultiversX vision  Roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/lucianmincu">Lucian Mincu on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/MultiversX">MultiversX on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/xPortalApp">xPortal on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

 Imagine a DeFi world without front-running, back-running, or sandwich attacks. A world where every user gets a fair price, and transaction fees don’t suddenly skyrocket. This isn’t a distant dream — it’s the reality with Verus. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is rampant on VM-based blockchains like Ethereum, causing users to lose money and suffer unfair trading practices. But Verus has changed the game with its innovative protocol design, making MEV attacks a thing of the past. Let’s explore how Verus is redefining DeFi with its MEV-resistance at the protocol&nbsp;layer.  MEV and its Consequences <p>Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in cryptocurrency networks, beyond the standard block&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>A block producer, whether a miner or staker, can make a profit by their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce. There are also bots that continuously search the pool of pending transactions (the mempool) for profitable opportunities. This behavior by block producers and bots leads to users being front-run, back-run or sandwich attacked on their transactions.</p><p>Front-running involves placing a transaction before a target transaction, while back-running places one immediately after. Sandwich attacks combine both, surrounding a target transaction. This behavior takes advantage of the time between when a transaction is announced (it’s in the mempool) and when it’s processed, allowing manipulators to benefit from price movements caused by the target transaction.</p><p>This malicious behavior leads to worse-than-expected execution prices and high transaction fees for regular users doing swaps or trades on AMMs (automated market makers) or DEXs (decentralized exchanges). A sudden high transaction fee can also lead to failing transactions, costing users gas fees without completing the intended trade. At worst, it can even lead to protocol instability.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is the possible problematic merger of traditional finance and decentralized finance. Front-running, and back-running are illegal practices in traditional finance but common in DeFi. Regulators are likely to view these tactics as unacceptable market manipulation, especially when applied to RWAs (real-world assets). VM-based blockchains have to balance the open, permissionless nature of the blockchain with the expectations of fairness and protection that come with mainstream financial adoption. The giant elephant in the room asks… Can blockchain protocols where MEV is endemic be used for mainstream adoption?</p> MEV Resistance in&nbsp;Verus <p>How Verus is MEV-resistant is actually really simple and doesn’t need complicated ways that try to mitigate it. It is inherently not in the protocol by forward-looking protocol&nbsp;design.</p><p>You can find Verus DeFi within the consensus layer of the protocol. All currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity pools) are accounted for by the miners and stakers. This is very different from Ethereum, for example, where only ETH is accounted for by the stakers, and where ERC-20s are not. On VM-based blockchains DeFi is programmed at the smart contract layer, which has many vulnerability surfaces, and what is happening in those smart contracts is not verified by the block producers.</p> No Transaction Ordering <p>All VM-based blockchains solve transactions sequentially. This is their fundamental design flaw. Because of this, transactions can be ordered, by either block producers or bots paying higher gas fees to “skip the line.” This is what makes MEV possible.</p><p>Unlike VM-based blockchains that solve transactions sequentially, Verus, a UTXO-based blockchain, solves transactions simultaneously. Front-running, back-running and sandwich attacks are impossible since there is no “front” or “back”. Transactions (and thus conversions) are not&nbsp;ordered.</p><p>Conversions are solved simultaneously within 1 to 10 blocks, depending on how many conversions are made. The conversions are triggered when there are 10 transactions made, or 10 blocks have passed if it’s not busy. If it’s busy all the time, then conversions are solved every 2 blocks. This leads to a MEV-resistant protocol, but also to fair pricing and enhanced liquidity through offsetting.</p> Fair Pricing and Enhanced Liquidity <p>Because all transactions (conversions) are solved simultaneously (1 to 10 blocks), all conversions on the same “trading pair” get the same fair price. Keep in mind that there can be many “trading pairs” that are the same, but when they are in different basket currencies, they are treated as separate.</p><p>Important to note is that orders are offset against each other. For example, if one user wants to sell 100 currency X (for Y) and another wants to buy 80 currency X with Y, 80 of that currency is directly matched, leaving only 20 to affect the overall market price. This also means there is reduced price impact, and thus less slippage.</p><p>Another benefit is enhanced liquidity. Instead of each conversion drawing from or adding to the liquidity pool sequentially, the net effect is applied, making more efficient use of the available liquidity. The actual liquidity in the pool might not change, but the offsetting effect makes it behave as if there was more liquidity available because offsetting orders are matched directly, reducing the need to draw from or add to the&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Then you also have the market arbitrageurs, who now not only make a profit for themselves, they also stabilize the market overall, giving all participants a fair price. With a very low fee of 0.025% or 0.05% of the conversion (without gas fees), it is a great system for all kinds of market participants.</p><blockquote>Verus DeFi protocol wide volume in July 2024 was close to $14M. Source: on-chain&nbsp;metrics.</blockquote> Real Fair&nbsp;DeFi <p>Whatever market participant you are, you are best served with the Verus Protocol. Verus DeFi is fully functional on mainnet for everyone to&nbsp;use.</p>  No MEV (no front-running, back-running or sandwich&nbsp;attacks)  Truly decentralized (it’s a credibly neutral protocol — not a business, company or otherwise rent-seeking)  The same fair price for all market participants within 1–10&nbsp;block(s)  Secured at the protocol&nbsp;level  Low conversion fees of max.&nbsp;0.05%  Permissionless launching of liquidity pools  Bridged to Ethereum (all ERC-20s can be bridged to the Verus Protocol, in a non-custodial and trustless manner, and vice&nbsp;versa)  Decentralized crowdfund mechanisms for your currency (e.g. token, liquidity pool, native PBaaS coin), such as pre-launch discounts, pre-launch carveouts and pre-allocations   💡 Bridge Your Community to&nbsp;Verus <p>If you are in a community that has an ERC-20 as a token consider moving over to Verus. Not only do you get fair, MEV-resistant DeFi, you can also tap into the self-sovereign identity protocol (VerusID) and experience unlimited scale (no more high gas fees). <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">You can do it permissionlessly!</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Join the Discord</a>, the worldwide community is happy to answer any questions and help you&nbsp;assist.</p><p>In the meantime you can try Verus DeFi on your mobile and <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">desktop</a> now.

  Partnering with XBOW: The Gold Standard in Offensive Security  <p>Oege and his team are using AI to stay ahead of cyber attackers and deliver security that scales.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published July 30, 2024
  



XBOW founder Oege de Moor.



 
<p>Great offensive security requires getting creative—to safeguard against risks, you must imagine what bad actors might do. For decades, human experts have been the gold standard in this critically important work. Penetration testers (or pentesters), bug hunters and security researchers simulate attacks and find the gaps, so developers can close them.</p>



<p>But with the rise of AI, we have seen an exponential increase both in the amount of code that must be protected and in the volume of exploits, which now cost businesses more than <a href="https://www.esentire.com/resources/library/2023-official-cybercrime-report">three times</a> what they did less than a decade ago. Human experts simply can’t keep up; last year, nearly two-thirds of organizations <a href="https://www.coresecurity.com/blog/how-manage-pen-testing-skills-shortage">reported</a> their biggest challenge in maintaining a pentesting program was finding enough skilled personnel to do the work.</p>



<p>Companies must modernize—and thankfully, <a href="https://xbow.com/">XBOW</a> founder Oege de Moor and his team are establishing the new state of the art, leveraging large language models to automate pentesting that scales. XBOW <a href="https://xbow.com/blog/introducing-xbow/">solves</a> an impressive 75% of web app security benchmarks, and it does so with zero human intervention. Customers don’t have to choose between keeping their software secure and sacrificing speed and growth.</p>



<p>XBOW is designed to think like a hacker. It simulates real-world attacks and identifies novel exploits other tools might miss. When it spots a vulnerability, it automatically pinpoints the cause, runs tests to demonstrate how the issue could be exploited, and provides actionable guidance on how to fix it.</p>



<p>This is a transformative innovation for offensive security, and as a world expert in code analysis, Oege is uniquely suited to lead the way. A former Oxford professor turned founder, he sold his first company, Semmle, to GitHub and went on to create the company’s Copilot and Advanced Security products. Along the way, he built a reputation as a brilliant but pragmatic and clear-thinking leader—and a talent magnet, as the highly skilled, deeply committed team at XBOW now attests. We at Sequoia were grateful for the chance to lead their seed round and to welcome Oege to <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company-building immersion for pre-seed and seed-stage founders. It has been a privilege to support him and the team as they grow.</p>



Oege takes the mic at the Arc story slam.



<p>No doubt XBOW’s mission is an ambitious one. But Oege and the team understand that the stakes are high not just for businesses but for national security, as well, and they are moving quickly to stay ahead of attackers and develop the best offering in AI offensive security. Their work is helping security professionals and everyone they protect—and setting a new gold standard for the industry in the process.</p>

   The results of the ZCAP Dev Fund runoff poll are in. The community has voted to support the "Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund" proposal, which allocates 20% of the block rewards to a Dev Fund for one year, with 8% earmarked for the Zcash Community Grants program, and 12% to be stored in a protocol lockbox.

<p>On July 21st, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a7ece604-47a7-11ef-baa0-7eadb9c373c3/view">runoff poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (ZCAP), to determine which of two Dev Fund proposals should be implemented when the current Dev Fund ends in November. The poll closed this morning, and the results are as follows: </p>



 
 <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-2-hybrid-deferred-dev-fund-transitioning-to-a-non-direct-funding-model">Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund: Transitioning to a Non-Direct Funding Model</a> – 91 votes (67%) 



 <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-3-lockbox-for-decentralized-grants-allocation-20-option">Lockbox For Decentralized Grants Allocation (20% option)</a> – 40 votes (30%) 
 



<p></p>



<p>Four voters (3%) abstained by choosing neither option, and 135 votes were cast in total. </p>


 
 


<p></p>



<p>We can therefore conclude that the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-2-hybrid-deferred-dev-fund-transitioning-to-a-non-direct-funding-model">Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund</a> option enjoys majority support across the Zcash community. This conclusion is reinforced by the results of <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/alternative-dev-fund-sentiment-polls/47848/67">alternative polls</a> of the ZecHub DAO, Zcash Brazil community, and the Zcash Spanish-speaking community. </p>



<p>This result bodes well for the future of Zcash. It ensures that the Zcash Community Grants program will continue to receive funding over the coming year, supporting its ongoing mission to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, and ensuring that the Zcash ecosystem can continue to become more decentralized. </p>



<p>This result is also an important step in the geographic decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, as it lays the path for the Zcash Community Grants program to migrate from the Zcash Foundation (based on the United States) to the <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/">Financial Privacy Foundation</a> (based in the Cayman Islands). </p>



<p>We’d like to thank everyone who participated in this process, including those who drafted proposals; the many community members who took part in the discussions and debate on the Zcash community forum, on other social media, and in community calls; those who conducted alternative community polls; and everyone who voted in those polls. </p>



<p>Onward! </p>

<p>In our hyper-connected world, consumer data is the new gold, highly sought after by companies eager to gather, analyze, and utilize it for various purposes. But with great power comes great responsibility, and companies that fail to safeguard this valuable asset face a double whammy: an exodus of privacy-conscious customers and potentially crippling regulatory fines running into the billions.</p><p>Just consider this: according to a recent <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/data-privacy-benchmark-study.html#~about-the-study">study by CISCO</a>, a staggering 94% of customers refuse to do business with companies they don’t trust with their information. That’s right, nearly all customers gone, simply because they don’t trust the vendor with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>And the pain doesn’t end there, with the consequences of data breaches extending far beyond lost trust. Regulatory bodies are wielding data privacy violations like a financial hammer. Take, for example, the record-breaking <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en">€1.2 billion fine imposed on Meta (formerly Facebook)</a> in May 2023 by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for unlawful data transfers. This wasn’t an anomaly. In fact, the GDPR in Europe alone saw <a href="https://dataprivacymanager.net/5-biggest-gdpr-fines-so-far-2020/">fines surpassing €4 billion in 2023</a>, a significant jump from previous&nbsp;years.</p><p>But it’s not all doom and gloom. As consumer attitudes are beginning to shift, companies are starting to see data privacy not as an inconvenient obligation, but as a strategic investment, with massive value waiting to be unlocked. According to the CISCO study, privacy programs have shown an average of 160% ROI, with some respondents declaring even 500% ROI in privacy. This means that by prioritizing data privacy, companies can not only avoid the hefty fines and reputational damage associated with breaches but also unlock significant financial benefits.</p><p>This brings us to Empeiria and its groundbreaking privacy-preserving End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI). By leveraging advanced Web3 technology, Empeiria offers innovative solutions that simplify the deployment of decentralized data ecosystems, ensuring robust privacy and compliance while driving efficiency and trust. Read on to learn how Empeiria is revolutionizing data privacy and benefiting users and companies alike.</p> Data Privacy Today: A Breach of&nbsp;Trust <p>We’ve established that while private data is a highly valuable asset, companies either fail to handle it with the care and responsibility it requires, or, worse yet, actively misuse it for&nbsp;profit.</p><p>Let’s delve deeper into the shortcomings of the current data privacy systems that allow this to&nbsp;happen:</p>  Centralized Storage: Imagine a single, monolithic vault overflowing with every detail of your online activity — purchases, searches, clicks. This vulnerability-laden approach is how many companies store data. These centralized repositories become prime targets for hackers. A single breach can expose millions of users, leading to financial ruin and a collapse of&nbsp;trust.  Transparency Deficit: Companies often operate with a shroud of secrecy regarding data practices. Data privacy is often not more than a footnote in user agreement and vague terms and conditions offer little insight into how our information is collected, stored, and used. This lack of transparency fosters a deep sense of distrust.  Complex Regulations: The global data privacy landscape is a complex and fragmented maze. A patchwork of regulations across different jurisdictions creates a compliance nightmare for businesses. They’re forced to navigate a minefield, risking either overreaction with stifling regulations that hinder innovation, or under-reaction that exposes them to hefty fines and reputational damage.  Inadequate encryption: Technology advances at an unrelenting pace, constantly introducing new security threats and vulnerabilities. Keeping systems secure and data properly encrypted is a never-ending battle. Emerging technologies like AI and the Internet of Things raise additional privacy concerns, as they often involve vast amounts of highly sensitive personal data. Companies struggle to keep pace with securing these new frontiers.  Resource Strain: Building solid data privacy walls requires significant resources. Regular monitoring, audits, and security updates are essential, but they can strain the budgets and manpower of companies. This resource disparity leaves them vulnerable to breaches and non-compliance issues, further eroding trust within the digital ecosystem.  <p>These are just some cracks in the foundation of our current data privacy system. This lack of robust safeguards incentivizes some companies to prioritize short-term profits over long-term trust.</p><p>Having established the reasons behind the current data privacy failures, it’s time to pose the most pressing question: what can we do about it? The answer lies in leveraging advanced and innovative technology to rebuild the foundation of data privacy. This is where Empeiria’s End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI) comes into&nbsp;play.</p> EVDI: A Technological Solution to Data&nbsp;Privacy <p>EVDI represents a paradigm shift in our approach to data privacy, offering a comprehensive solution that addresses the core issues plaguing the current system. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology and Web3 innovations, Empeiria has developed a robust framework designed to enhance data privacy, transparency, and user&nbsp;control.</p><p>Data privacy is built into the very fabric of EVDI, ensuring that data protection is not an afterthought but a fundamental feature. Our solution is compliant with data privacy regulations and provides users with privacy-enhancing features that add a new layer of trust to digital interactions:</p>  Data Ownership: EVDI builds on and expands the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a data framework designed to prioritize data ownership privacy. SSI uses technologies like blockchain and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to allow users to privately store their information in verifiable data wallets and prove their identity without revealing unnecessary personal information. Only users have access and control over the data they hold in their&nbsp;wallets.  Independent Data Verification: EVDI allows verifiers to check data without informing the issuer of what is being verified. Verifiers can confirm the accuracy, integrity, and validity of credentials stored in users’ data wallets without disclosing the specifics to the issuer. This ensures robust privacy while maintaining full verification capabilities.  Consent &amp; Selective Disclosure: Consent is a cornerstone of Empeiria’s approach. EVDI empowers users to give explicit consent for data sharing and usage, ensuring transparency and trust in every interaction. Furthermore, EVDI enables selective disclosure, allowing users to share only the necessary aspects of their data while keeping other information private. This means that users can prove their identity or other credentials without exposing unnecessary personal information.  Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP): Empeiria employs ZKPs, a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information. This technique ensures that sensitive information remains private while still verifying its authenticity.  Inherent Compliance: By placing data ownership in users’ hands, EVDI meets and exceeds global data privacy regulations. This means that companies using our infrastructure can be confident that they are compliant with laws such as GDPR and CCPA. This built-in compliance simplifies the regulatory landscape for businesses, reducing the risk of fines and enhancing their reputation.   Examples of EVDI Implementation <p>Healthcare Sector: Secure Patient Data Management</p><p>Imagine a major hospital struggling to keep patient records safe and secure. This puts them at risk of fines and, more importantly, breaks patients’ trust.</p><p>Empeiria offers a new way to handle healthcare data. Instead of a centralized database, patients store their health records privately, in their verifiable data wallets. This keeps patient information secure and makes it easier for the hospital to follow strict privacy rules, like HIPAA in the&nbsp;US.</p><p>Doctors can still request the information they need to treat patients, who have more control over their data and feel confident knowing their privacy is protected. This leads to fewer data breaches, better, personalized treatment, happier patients, and a more trusted healthcare system for everyone.</p><p>Financial Services: Enhanced Security and Compliance</p><p>Financial institutions today face a significant challenge: safeguarding vast amounts of sensitive customer data across multiple jurisdictions, all while adhering to increasingly complex privacy regulations like GDPR and&nbsp;CCPA.</p><p>Empeiria’s EVDI offers a solution to this challenge, by empowering customers to store their private data in verifiable data wallets. These wallets act as personal vaults for your financial information, providing enhanced privacy and granular&nbsp;control.</p><p>Through zero-knowledge proofs, banks can verify the existence of specific financial information within those wallets, without ever actually seeing the details themselves and only with user consent. This innovative approach fosters trust by ensuring the highest levels of data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Ultimately, by prioritizing customer privacy, financial institutions can build stronger client relationships and unlock new business opportunities.</p><p>E-commerce Platform: Customer Trust and Data Transparency</p><p>Imagine an e-commerce platform facing a crisis of confidence. Customers are wary of how their data is stored and used, leading to regulatory scrutiny. Empeiria’s EVDI offers a transformative solution that prioritizes user data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>EVDI empowers customers to take control of their personal information through secure, verifiable data wallets. The platform benefits from increased transparency in data handling practices, with EVDI’s built-in compliance with data privacy regulations ensuring peace of&nbsp;mind.</p><p>This proactive approach attracts privacy-conscious customers seeking a secure and transparent shopping experience, ultimately fostering trust, satisfaction, and reduced regulatory risk.</p><p>These are just three examples of numerous potential use cases for EVDI. As privacy becomes paramount in an increasing number of our digital interactions, the potential for more practical use cases will only&nbsp;grow.</p> Conclusion <p>Empeiria’s easily deployable, cost-effective End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure paves the way for a future where data privacy is no longer an afterthought but a foundational element of digital interactions. This user-centric approach benefits everyone. Users gain complete control over their digital identities, while companies build trust and streamline compliance. It’s a win-win situation.</p><p>Looking ahead, EVDI has the potential to create a more resilient digital ecosystem, where trust is earned through technological innovation, not empty promises. By championing data ownership, selective disclosure, and robust security measures, EVDI paves the way for a future of empowered online interactions, with data privacy never compromised.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="https://twitter.com/empe_io">Twitter/X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

<p>Web3’s decentralisation is currently limited to smart contracts as they can be verified on-chain. However, until scalability and UX become on par with that of Web2, the only realistic way for crypto to reach mass adoption is threw off-chain dApps. This creates the premise for a security bottleneck in the form of centralised APIs used for on-chain querying. Mel Project aims to expand on-chain security and decentralisation (consensus) to off-chain apps, basically achieving off-chain composability through trustless light clients. Earendil, the backbone of their ecosystem, designed to resist ISP-level censorship, is a decentralized anonymous communication and payment network that enables autonomous applications and true P2P protocols.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Eric’s background and founding Mel Project  Why Ethereum came short  Is Infura a security bottleneck?

The limitations of this are that there is not a full transaction history, just the most recent state that the state-sync RPC has stored.

<p>This post describes work done by Stefanos Laskaridis, Kleomenis Katevas, Lorenzo Minto and Hamed Haddadi. This post was written by Machine Learning Researcher Stefanos Laskaridis.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  As we are entering the new era of hyper-scale models, it is indispensable to maintain the ability to host AI locally, for maintaining privacy and sustainability. This is the first study that measures the deployability of Large Language Models (LLMs) at the consumer edge, exploring the potential of running differently-sized models on smartphones and edge devices <a>1</a> instead of the cloud.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Large Language Models, such as Llama-3, Mixtral, or ChatGPT, have recently revolutionized the machine learning landscape, enabling use-cases that were previously unfathomable, including intelligent assistants (including our own <a>Brave Leo</a>), creative writing, as well as agent-based automations (<a>Brave Search Integration</a> in Leo, for instance). At the same time, devices in our pockets have been getting increasingly capable <a>2</a>, integrating evermore powerful System-on-Chips (SoCs). Based on this trend, and maintaining our true commitment to preserving users’ privacy, we explore the feasibility of deploying LLMs on device, a model in which user prompts and LLM outputs never leave the device premises.</p>
<p>To do this, the Brave Research team has built their very own LLM benchmarking infrastructure, named BLaDE, for measuring the latency, accuracy, memory, and energy impact of running LLMs on-device. At the same time, acknowledging that these models are oftentimes too large, we leverage edge devices to accelerate execution locally, which can be co-located with smart devices at the consumer side <a>3</a>. This can also be deployed with our most recent <a>BYOM</a> (Bring Your Own Model) self-hosting option.</p>
<p>Our experience has shown that while the GenAI ecosystem is growing increasingly large, local on-device deployment is still in its infancy and remains very heterogeneous across devices. Deploying LLMs on device is possible, but with noticeable impact latency, comfort and accuracy, especially on mid-tier devices. However, hardware and algorithmic breakthroughs can significantly change the cost of execution and user Quality of Experience (QoE). At the same time, SLMs (Small Language Models) <a>4</a> are gradually making their appearance, tailored for specific downstream tasks.</p>

<p>BLaDE (BatteryLab Device Evaluation) is a state-of-the-art benchmarking infrastructure that is capable of automating the interaction with mobile devices for performance and energy measurements. It can be used for neural or more generic browser tasks. MELT is the component responsible for the benchmarking of neural workloads on various devices.</p>
<p>MELT adopts a server-client architecture, with the central coordinating process being responsible for the following:</p>
 
 
<p>Organizing the execution of the benchmarking suite;</p>
 
 
<p>Scheduling and dispatching jobs to connected devices;</p>
 
 
<p>Controlling the downstream interaction with the application;</p>
 
 
<p>Monitoring their runtime, temperature and energy consumption;</p>
 
 
<p>Tracing the events of interest in the downstream task and capturing the associated device behavior.</p>
 
 
<p>To this end, it integrates the following components:</p>
 
 
<p>a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB, which adopts the role of the coordinator;</p>
 
 
<p>a Mac Mini, for building packages;</p>
 
 
<p>a Monsoon power monitor connected over a Raspberry Pi GPIO addressable relay to control power to individual mobile devices;</p>
 
 
<p>a programmable YKUSH USB Switchable Hub for communicating and selectively disabling USB power to devices;</p>
 
 
<p>a Flir One edge wireless camera along with an custom-built IR thermometer (based on MLX90614) for monitoring temperature of the device; and last,</p>
 
 
<p>a set of mobile devices, shown on Table 1, which have undergone a battery bypass procedure.</p>
 
 
<p>In parallel, the coordinator is connected over Ethernet to the same network as our Nvidia Jetson boards with SSH access to them. Jetsons are able to provide power and temperature metrics through SysFS probes available.</p>

 MELT Workflow

        </a>
     
 
<p>The measurement workflow we follow is depicted in Figure 1b. MELT’s infrastructure consists of the following components:</p>
 
 
<p>Model Zoo, responsible for the download and compilation/quantization of models. We used the models of Table 2.</p>
 
 
<p>Evaluator, responsible for the evaluation of the accuracy degradation of models due to their conversion/quantization. We used the datasets of Table 4.</p>
 
 
<p>Builder, responsible for the compilation of the respective benchmarking suite backend, shown in Table 3, namely llama.cpp and MLC-LLM.</p>
 
 
<p>Runner, responsible for the deployment, automation and runtime of the LLM on the respective device. Integrated devices are shown on Table 1.</p>
 
 
<p>Monitor, responsible for the fine-grained monitoring of resource and energy consumption of the execution</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Result Highlights 
<p>Below, we provide the most interesting results of our analysis and their consequences for on-device deployment and future product research.</p>

 Throughput and Energy per Device

<p>Figure 3 illustrates the prefill and generation throughput of various models on different devices when used in a conversational setting. Prefill refers to the preparation and processing of input tokens before actual generation begins (e.g., tokenization, embedding, KV cache population), while generation refers to the autoregressive generation (i.e., decoding) of output tokens. Throughput expresses the rate of token ingestion/production, measured in tokens/sec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4 depicts the discharge rate per token generated, for different model, device and framework combinations. This is expressed in mAh/token.</p>
<p>Insights: We witnessed a quite heterogeneous landscape in terms of device performance across models. Prefill operations, typically compute bound, are much higher than generation rates, which are typically memory bound. MLC-LLM generally offered higher performance, compared to llama.cpp, but at the cost of model portability. Surprisingly, 4-bit models ran faster than their 3-bit counterparts, but at the expense of higher memory consumption, which caused certain models to run out of memory during runtime. Last, the Metal-accelerated iPhones showed higher throughput rates compared to the OpenCL-accelerated Android phones, for the case of MLC-LLM.</p>
<p>Energy-wise, larger networks offer larger discharge rates, as traffic between on-chip and off-chip memory consumes a significant amount of energy. Indicatively, if we deployed Zephyr-3B (4-bit quantized) on S23 on MLC-LLM, iPhone Pro on MLC-LLM and iPhone 14 Pro on llama.cpp, it would take 542.78, 490.05 and 590.93 prompts on average until their battery was depleted. Last, the CPU execution offered lower energy efficiency, attributed to the latency of running inference compared to accelerated execution.&nbsp;</p>

 Quality Of Experience 
<p>In real-world settings, running a large model on device can adversely affect the user experience and render the device unstable or unusable. There are largely three dimensions to consider:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Device responsiveness refers to the general stability and reliability of the device during runtime of LLM inference. Factors that affected the device responsiveness included long model loading times, out-of-memory errors which killed the application and device restarts, causing effectively a DoS by rebooting the device.</p>
 
 
<p>Sustained performance refers to the device’s ability to offer the same performance throughout the runtime of multiple inference requests. We noticed in our experiments that performance under sustained load was not stable, but fluctuated. Reasons for this behavior include DVFS, thermal throttling and different power profiles, along with potential simultaneous workloads.</p>
 
 
<p>Device temperature does not only affect device performance, but also user comfort. Devices nowadays come in various forms, but mostly remain passively cooled. Therefore, heat dissipation is mainly facilitated by the use of specific materials and heat management is governed by the OS. The power draw did cause temperatures to rise to uncomfortable levels, reaching 47.9°C after one full conversation with Zephyr-3B (4-bit) model on the iPhone 14 Pro.</p>
 
 
<p>Insights: Tractability of the LLM inference workload does not imply deployability.</p>

 Accuracy Impact of Quantization 
<p><a>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    </a></p>
<p>Today’s LLMs are quite large in size. At the same time, the memory that most devices come equipped with is in the region of 6 - 12 GB. This means that deploying such models on device is usually only possible through compression. Quantization is a compression technique which lowers the precision with which weights and activations are represented. However, this happens at the expense of accuracy. We measured the impact of using different model architectures and sizes, quantization schemes and precision to the accuracy of four natural language tasks (HellaSwag, Winogrande, TruthfulQA, ARC-{E,C}).</p>
<p>Insights: The most evident performance difference comes from the model architecture and parameter size, and this performance difference persists across datasets. In terms of quantization schemes, it is obvious that bit width is correlated to model size, but also to accuracy, i.e., lower bit width means higher error rate.On the other hand, there was no single quantization scheme that performed uniformly better across the board. For larger models (≥7B</p>
<p>parameters), AWQ <a>5</a> and GPTQ <a>6</a> performed slightly better, at the expense of elevated model sizes.</p>

 Offloading to Edge Devices 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Since QoE and accuracy of LLMs is impacted by running on device, as evidenced earlier, we visit an alternative model of offloading computation to nearby devices at the consumer edge. Such devices may be a dedicated accelerator (e.g., an Edge-AI Hub) or another edge device (e.g., a Smart TV or a high-end router). For this reason, we employ two Jetson devices, namely Nano (mid-tier) and AGX (high-tier) to check the viability of this paradigm.</p>
<p>Insights: Overall, generation throughput is significantly higher than the equivalent mobile runtime, and this runtime can also be sustained for longer periods. Indicatively, for Zephyr-7B (4-bit), the average throughput is 3.3× and 1.78× higher, for prefill and generation respectively. At the same time, we witnessed that the energy efficiency is moving the same direction as the device’s TDP.</p>

 Key Takeaways 
<p>This work highlights the potential and challenges of deploying Large Language Models on consumer mobile devices for both iOS and Android ecosystems. While advancements in hardware and algorithmic breakthroughs such as quantization show promise, on-device deployment currently impacts latency, device stability, and energy consumption. Offloading computation to local edge devices offers a viable alternative, providing improved performance and energy efficiency. Continued innovation in both hardware and software will be crucial for making local AI deployment practical, preserving user privacy, and enhancing sustainability.</p>

  Partnering with rift: Sales, simplified.  <p>If you’re tired of manually stitching together multiple tools, this is the platform for you.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published July 24, 2024
  



rift co-founders Fil Twarowski and Eddie Eriksson.



 
<p>The Greatest Salesman in the World, Og Mandino’s bestseller on the philosophy of success, tells the story of a young entrepreneur who rises from tending camels to running a massive trade empire after studying ten scrolls about the importance of persistence, love and other virtues. It’s one of our favorite books here at Sequoia, in part because&nbsp;persistence and love are foundational in sales.</p>



<p>But today, persistence and love alone aren’t enough—sales is hard and probably <a href="https://diginomica.com/selling-stuff-getting-harder-salesforces-state-sales-report-reflects-changed-buyer-behaviors">getting harder</a>. Modern B2B sales teams juggle research, prospecting and thousands of Zoom calls. They pull off heroics at the finish line. There are all kinds of distractions in the way, from updating the CRM to cleaning contact data. And making things more frustrating, the average sales team works across <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/resources/research-reports/state-of-sales/">10 different tools</a>, with no single home base where they can focus on doing their jobs.</p>



<p>Fil Twarowski and Eddie Eriksson became obsessed with this problem when they ran sales and growth at the equity-management company Pulley. In the process of integrating the dozens of tools they used to make Pulley the new default for thousands of companies, Fil and Eddie recognized that running exceptional campaigns required exceptional amounts of manual work. It’s one thing to dump generic copy into mass emails. It’s another to craft personalized outbound to exactly the right audience—and to deal with the endless technical details involved in getting those messages seen, such as caps on how many emails you can send per day.</p>



<p>Now, as co-founders of <a href="https://www.rift.com/">rift</a>, Fil and Eddie are freeing up salespeople to shift their focus back to the core of their work. The platform combines the tools modern sales teams need, in one place. It’s an email solution for perfect sequencing to prospects. It’s a dialer to make calling leads more efficient, and a scheduler for automatically routing them and booking meetings. It’s the infrastructure for managing mechanics like email deliverability. It’s applying LLMs not to replace salespeople, but to lighten their load with features such as custom copy. And it’s all in one—no more passing data back and forth between multiple tools.</p>



<p>In short, rift does more than just give sales teams new capabilities. It creates a delightful, focused home base where they can do their best work.</p>



<p>Since Fil and Eddie started rift in late 2022, leading companies including Gusto, Capchase and Rhombus have come to rely on what the team has built—and they’re getting results. One customer, for example, replaced an outbound email program paralyzed by spam issues with a more personalized approach, and generated $300,000 in pipeline in just one sequence.</p>



<p>And this is just the beginning. We at Sequoia are beyond excited to lead rift’s seed round and partner with Fil, Eddie and their team as they scale their vision to empower exceptional sellers.</p>

  Better Agents Need Better Documentation  <p>Using AI effectively requires a new kind of structured data that AI itself cannot yet produce.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published July 23, 2024
  



 
<p>In February, Klarna boldly announced that its new OpenAI-powered assistant handled two thirds of the Swedish fintech’s customer service chats in its first month. All kinds of customer satisfaction metrics were better, but what got everyone’s attention was the $40M boost to its bottom line from replacing 700 full-time contract agents.</p>



<p>Since then, every company we talk to wants to know, “how do we get the Klarna customer support thing?” Against the backdrop of flashy demoware and eye-popping pre-revenue valuations, Klarna’s practical application of GPT-4 was a welcome relief. But as Klarna founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski explains in this week’s <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/sebastian-siemiatkowski-klarna/">Training Data podcast</a>, the reality of this accomplishment is both more prosaic and more profound than it first appears.</p>



<p>To explain the insight that fueled this breakthrough, Siemiatkowski invokes the classic computer science concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">garbage in, garbage out</a>” (GIGO). All the way back to Babbage, scientists have understood that “if you put into the machine wrong figures,” the right answers will not come out. For Klarna, this meant that the team needed to pay special attention to the language they gave the model as context for specific customer service tasks—in other words the documentation and training manuals they made for the agents themselves. “That helped us a lot to think about it that way, that we just needed to make sure that the documentation and the manuals were clear enough and of quality enough, and then it can actually execute,” says Siemiatkowski.</p>



<p>Klarna has not disclosed “the secret sauce” for how they built their assistant beyond using a form of RAG (retrieval augmented generation), so it’s not clear how much of its successful performance is due to data quality alone or to “custom cognitive architectures”1 adapted to specific tasks. Either way, this is a prime example of what we call “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/goldilocks-agents/">Goldiocks agents</a>” that benefit both from guardrails (in this case, the specific ways that Klarna handles customer service requests) as well as the ability of LLMs to fluidly merge information in a coherent manner.</p>



<p>The needs of large language models bring what has been a niche concern front and center. Since it was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401">formalized in 2020</a>, RAG has become the industry standard to wrap the expressive elasticity of LLMs around the key facts needed to reliably execute a task, particularly in mission-critical business settings. Curating the quality of examples to retrieve from is key to success.</p>



<p>There are people in the world who love writing documentation, but not many. For most of us, we bemoan the bad but don’t contribute to making it better. However, high-performance companies like Stripe have pioneered “<a href="https://slab.com/blog/stripe-writing-culture/">writing culture</a>” where social norms encourage participation. Gitlab, one of the first remote-only companies, has developed a <a href="https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first/">handbook-first approach to communication</a> as a pillar of their operational excellence2.</p>



<p>More generally, in the case of Klarna, the company has built an elaborate knowledge graph3 to power not only their external-facing customer service reps (human and agentic) but also their internal chatbot, Kiki. This focus on the quality of documentation has dual benefits, Siemiatkowski explains: “So actually our agents have better tools today to be successful in helping the customers as does the AI. So both experiences are improving as a consequence of that.”</p>



<p>Siemiatkowski believes that Klarna has derived a lot of value through experimentation and building internally with AI. But in both cases he discussed—LLM-powered internal knowledge management systems and external-facing customer services agents—buying rather than building is now a very viable option with solutions like <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a> and <a href="https://sierra.ai/">Sierra</a>. However, buyer beware, GIGO still applies.</p>



<p>This focus on high-quality data is a large theme in contemporary AI. Microsoft released a paper last year, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11644">Textbooks Are All You Need</a>, that showed how a significantly smaller model trained on better data could outperform far larger models on coding exercises. On the large model side, Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott told us in <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/training-data-kevin-scott/">Episode 4</a> that it’s “a good thing that quality of data matters more than quantity of data, because it gives you an economic framework to go do the do the partnerships that you need to go do to make sure that you are feeding your AI training algorithm a curriculum that is going to result in smarter models. And, honestly, not wasting a whole bunch of compute feeding it a bunch of things that are not.” When it comes to enterprise use cases, particularly consumer-facing ones like Klarna’s, the quality bar is high because customers are comparing against human agents.</p>



<p>What Klarna’s experience suggests is that AI will work best when paired with human effort to understand other humans (something that LLMs seem a long way from achieving). This is actually the same customer-centric approach that is at the heart of all great businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>June 17th, 2024 ushered in the successful Alexandria upgrade of Shade Protocol — bringing advanced protocol &amp; SILK analytics, the prices page, liquid $SHD staking, Spartan NFTs, and&nbsp;more.</p><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics</a><p>Now that this upgrade was complete, the time has now come for Shade Protocol to prepare its next upgrade on September 24th:</p> Argos. <p>Argos was an ancient Greek city spanning from 1600 BC — 146 BC, a natural cultural hub during its time. Argos produced notable poets, sculptors, and architects. Poets such as Telesilla + Ario and sculptors Polykleitos and Ageladas left their mark with a focus on proper proportions of their sculptures, emphasizing symmetry and balance. The Canon (from the Greek “Kanōn,” meaning “measure” or “rule”) was a theoretical work by Polykleitos that outlined his mathematical approach to achieving perfect proportions in sculpture. Polykleitos sought to create a formula that could be applied to sculpt the ideal human&nbsp;figure.</p><p>Principles of the&nbsp;Kanōn</p>  Symmetria (Proportion): Polykleitos emphasized the harmonious relationship between different parts of the body. This concept is akin to symmetry, where each part of the body is in balanced proportion to the&nbsp;others.  Mathematical Ratios: He believed that beauty in the human form could be achieved through specific numerical ratios. For instance, the head was considered one-eighth of the total height, and the length of the foot was one-sixth of the&nbsp;height.  Contrapposto: This stance, where the weight is shifted onto one leg, creating an asymmetry in the hips and shoulders, was crucial for achieving a naturalistic and dynamic pose. It demonstrated a balance of tension and relaxation in the body, reflecting Polykleitos’ focus on&nbsp;harmony.  <p>Polykleitos’ Canon was a significant contribution to the field of art, emphasizing a scientific and mathematical approach to beauty and aesthetics that resonated throughout the history of Western&nbsp;art.</p><p>In many ways, Shade has long carried an unnatural contrapposto where privacy has placed undue tension on certain parts of user interactions, creating an unnatural disharmony.</p><p>The Argos update aims to bring symmetry, balance, and harmony to the Shade UX as we continue on the quest to refine user stories &amp; the ease of traversing the Shade Protocol application.</p><p>Streamlined Permit Implementation: We’re reducing the token balance viewing and storing process from 60+ paid transactions to handle all of the encrypted tokens on the Shade app to instead just 3–4 clicks, all of which will be free txs. This will significantly enhance the Shade Protocol user experience and cross multi-device management.</p><p>Balance Stores V2: Say goodbye to latency issues. We’re revolutionizing how balances are stored on local devices. Real-time updates mean you’ll always see accurate balances as you navigate the&nbsp;app.</p><p>Eliminate wrap UX / improve to Automatic Wrap Functionality: We’re eliminating the need for manual wrapping in most cases. Don’t worry, power users can still access this feature on the utility page. And of course, we’re keeping everything private and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Portfolio V2: Get ready for a visual treat! We’re beautifying the historical view of your assets and their performance. Expect cleaner, more intuitive charting that makes tracking your investments a&nbsp;breeze.</p><p>Money Market Sneak Peek: We’re working on a comprehensive whitepaper for our upcoming Money Market feature. Keep an eye out for a sleek mockups &amp; a potential testnet.</p><p>We believe Shade Protocol through its relentless drive towards ease of use can help unlock &amp; reveal the power of private DeFi for the whole world to&nbsp;use.</p> Argos: Classical Ideals and Heroic&nbsp;Legacy <p>As we prepare for the upcoming Argos upgrade on September 24th, we are inspired by the historical and mythological significance of Argos. In Greek mythology, Argos was not only a cultural hub but also the realm of Diomedes, a legendary hero renowned for his strength and valor. Diomedes played a pivotal role in the Trojan War, leading 80 ships into battle and famously participating in the strategic deception of the Trojan Horse, which led to the fall of Troy. His contributions and heroic feats are emblematic of the balance and precision we aim to bring to the Shade Protocol through&nbsp;Argos.</p><p>Just as Diomedes’ leadership and prowess shaped the course of the Trojan War, the Argos upgrade represents a transformative moment for Shade Protocol. We are dedicated to bringing a new level of harmony and efficiency to our platform, inspired by the principles of symmetry and balance embodied by Diomedes’ legacy. The upgrade will enhance user experience with a powerful transaction engine, refined portfolio management, and streamlined interactions, mirroring the ideals of precision and coordination that Diomedes exemplified. Join us as we honor this rich legacy and strive to advance private DeFi with the elegance and effectiveness of classical ideals.</p> Conclusion <p>As we move forward, inspired by the historical significance and the enduring principles of Argos, Diomede, and Polykleitos’ Canon, Shade Protocol remains committed to evolving and enhancing our platform. By fostering an environment where balance and symmetry guide our development, we aim to create a seamless and harmonious user experience. The Argos upgrade represents not just a step forward in technology, but a stride towards a more refined, accessible, and powerful DeFi ecosystem. Join us on this journey to bring the elegance of classical ideals into the future of private decentralized finance.</p><p>Twitter → <a href="https://x.com/Shade_Protocol">https://x.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>App → <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/analytics</a></p><p>Telegram → <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Zcash Foundation (ZF), Electric Coin Company (ECC) and various other members and groups across the Zcash community conducted a series of polls to determine whether the was clear consensus in favour of introducing a new Dev Fund when the current one ends later this year. </p>



<p>The results of the polls varied. While there is clearly strong support for a new Dev Fund, there was no clear consensus regarding which proposal should be adopted.  However, two proposals garnered strong support across all the polls (and were the top two proposals in the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap-dev-fund-poll-results-july-2024/">ZCAP poll</a>). </p>



<p>The <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-2-hybrid-deferred-dev-fund-transitioning-to-a-non-direct-funding-model">Hybrid Deferred Dev Fund: Transitioning to a Non-Direct Funding Model</a>&nbsp;proposal would last for one year, and would allocate</p>



 
 8% to the Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF) for the Zcash Community Grants program, and 



 12% to a protocol lockbox. 
 



<p></p>



<p>The <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-3-lockbox-for-decentralized-grants-allocation-20-option">Lockbox For Decentralized Grants Allocation (20% option)</a> proposal would allocate 20% of the block rewards to a protocol lockbox for two years (with no funding for Zcash Community Grants).</p>



<p>Under both proposals, the remaining 80% of the block rewards would be allocated to the miners. Funds that are directed into the protocol lockbox will remain there until a distribution mechanism is introduced in a future network upgrade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ZF (along with ECC and and others across the community) are conducting a runoff poll to determine which of these proposals should be adopted. Today, we opened <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a7ece604-47a7-11ef-baa0-7eadb9c373c3/view">a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (ZCAP), which will close at 09:00 UTC on 29th July 2024.</p>



<p>As always, we welcome the community’s feedback. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash community forum</a>.</p>

         TL;DR   Horizen 2.0 Upgrade is Full Steam Ahead: Community voted in favor of the upgrade to a more advanced blockchain architecture.  Binance Monitoring Tag Removed: $ZEN demonstrates stability and meets Binance’s listing criteria.  ZenIPs: Six ZenIPs were voted on, including the removal of shielded pools and the technical roadmap for Horizen 2.0.  Technical Upgrades: Significant upgrades include new node software, EON 1.4, and EON Forger Nodes.  New Ecosystem Partnerships: New integration with partners such as Magic Link, Rabby Wallet, and Math Wallet.  Media &amp; Events: Highlights include the Horizen Buidler House at ETHDenver and appearances at major Web3 conferences.  <p>2024 has been quite the year so far for the Horizen Ecosystem and for $ZEN. Completing the transition away from being a privacy coin and currently undergoing the Horizen 2.0 upgrade to become the next-gen EVM optimized for ZK apps. From ZenIPs to new partners, product upgrades, Horizen turning 7, and more, let’s dive in and see what happened for the first half of 2024.</p><p></p> Horizen 2.0 Upgrade is Full Steam Ahead <p></p><p>In June of 2024, the community voted overwhelmingly in favor for&nbsp; transitioning $ZEN from the legacy Horizen mainchain and Horizen EON EVM to a more advanced blockchain architecture, we call this upgrade Horizen 2.0.&nbsp;</p><p>At a high level, Horizen ($ZEN) and EON are currently built on older technology stacks. The Horizen Mainchain is a fork of the Bitcoin C++ codebase with a block time of 2.5 minutes, while EON is written in Scala based on the Scorex SDK with an 18-second block time. To address the limitations of these legacy systems and align with the vision of Horizen as a home for ZK and an enduring utility for $ZEN, a ZenIP was proposed to upgrade to Horizen 2.0, which introduces more advanced features and optimizations to enhance the network performance, security, and utility of $ZEN.</p><p>To learn more about ZenIP 42406 and Horizen 2.0, check out <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42406-eon-and-zen-migration-high-level-overview/">this high-level overview</a> that breaks everything down.&nbsp;</p> Binance Removes the Monitoring Tag for $ZEN <p>On July 1st, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-extend-the-monitoring-tag-to-include-bal-ctxc-cvp-cvx-dock-hard-iris-mbl-pols-snt-sun-and-remove-the-monitoring-tag-for-mln-zen-on-2024-07-01-782b121c462b499487dc8f20e0edc6b2">Binance announced</a> the removal of the monitoring tag for $ZEN recognizing its stability and performance.&nbsp;</p><p>The monitoring tag was placed in Jan 2024 along with several other privacy-featured coins. In the same month, the Horizen community<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/"> voted in favor of removing the privacy feature</a> from the Horizen mainchain, removing regulatory and delisting risks for $ZEN, allowing the Horizen network to maintain its versatility and compliance in the competitive landscape of web3. The shielded pool was removed from the Horizen mainchain on February 2024.&nbsp;</p> What else does this mean for $ZEN?&nbsp;   Consistent Stability and Confidence: Indicates that $ZEN has demonstrated consistent stability and security, reducing concerns over volatility and risk.    Improved Listing Criteria: Indicates that $ZEN meets Binance’s stringent listing criteria, including regulatory-compliance, strong development activity, team commitment, and a secure network.    Positive Market Perception: Reflects a positive outlook on $ZEN, increasing user confidence and encouraging more participation in the Horizen ecosystem.  <p>In the same month of July, <a href="https://x.com/horizenglobal/status/1811121186757312572">$ZEN is ranked a top 10 ZK Project by Market Cap on Coingecko</a></p><p></p> ZenIPs&nbsp; <p>The Horizen community voted on 6 ZenIPs in the first half of this year:&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a>: Removal of the Shielded Pools from the Horizen Mainchain – 99.97% in Favor  <p>This ZenIP represents a necessary evolution of the Horizen network to maintain its competitiveness, versatility, and compliance in the changing landscape of blockchain regulation and technology. The passing of this proposal speaks to the community’s desire to strategically pivot away from privacy-focused features towards a more scalable and regulatory-compliant framework.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/">ZenIP 42400</a>: Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer – 100% in Favor  <p>This ZenIP details a comprehensive understanding of the new modular system proposed by Horizen Labs. It outlines the strategic approach and delves into the technical aspects of a modular proof verification layer. Horizen Labs later announced that it will independently undertake the buildout of the proof verification chain in order to bring it to market more quickly.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/">ZenIP 42401</a>: Updating Proposal and Quorum Thresholds – 77.34% in Favor  <p>The purpose of this ZenIP is to seek the community’s decision on lowering the thresholds for formally submitting improvement proposals and achieving a quorum of votes for them. The goal of this ZenIP is to make the governance of Horizen DAO more accessible for community members, increase the likelihood of successful votes (valid due to reaching a quorum), and bring quorum requirements in line with industry standards.</p>  <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42404-delegated-staking-reward-mechanism-on-eon/552">ZenIP 42404</a>: Delegated Staking Reward Mechanism on EON – 99.87% in Favor  <p>This ZenIP proposed to improve the usability of the EON staking system at the protocol level by automating the reward distribution among the forger hosting provider and the $ZEN holders who stake their ZEN to the forger node.

<p>We are sad to announce that Teor is leaving the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teor joined ZF in <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-zcash-foundation-welcomes-jane-and-teor/">June 2020</a>, having previously worked with the Tor Project. They quickly became a key member of the engineering team, acting as engineering lead for extended periods of time, and helping onboard and mentor new engineering hires as the organisation grew. They were a leading contributor to the successful development and launch of Zebra, and played an important role in responding to the Halborn security disclosure. They contributed to several ZIPs, regularly attended ZIP editors meetings, and formally became a ZIP editor in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teor went on sabbatical in early 2024, and has now decided to explore new challenges in non-Proof of Work Web3 technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teor remains a firm supporter of the Zcash mission, and will continue to support ZF as a member of our Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of their colleagues, both with ZF and across the broader Zcash ecosystem, I want to thank Teor for their contributions and service to the Zcash community, and wish them the very best as they embark on the next phase of their career!</p>

 BlueYard Crypto 3: backing the ultimate capital x compute coordination machine with our latest $75m early-stage crypto&nbsp;fund <p>As we began to deploy our 3rd dedicated crypto fund, BlueYard Crypto 3* (raised last year), we took a step back to reflect on our thesis and approach behind crypto investing. What are the core belief pillars underpinning our strategy?</p><p>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem#:~:text=A%20collective%20action%20problem%20or,individuals%20that%20discourage%20joint%20action.">collective action</a> problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</p><p>Societies and economies will highly value censorship-resistant money and information flows enabled by decentralization, the ability to cut out intermediaries in many large-scale markets — thereby unlocking higher degrees of innovation and efficiency. The creation of portable internet-native assets with the ability to create mass- &amp; user-centric ownership of traditionally centralized businesses will enable a new economic paradigm.</p><p>If large networks of coordinated machines and capital can be transformative to many industries and markets relying on computation, data and economic flows in the future — one might reasonably conclude that crypto networks, with their unique properties, have the potential to form a key backbone of such future markets — ranging from software / data / compute markets to physical infrastructure. If crypto can be the future of many markets and financial systems, today’s crypto infrastructure and applications are a call option on that future. This is what BlueYard has always believed — and is reflected in our investment hypothesis and applied strategy of investing at the earliest stages&nbsp;in:</p>  the core functionality of the capital x compute coordination machine, such as the creation of consensus and the economic and technological enhancement of chains (e.g. <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs / IPFS</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>)  the augmentation of core chains to make their consensus and compute useful &amp; usable for developers and users (e.g. <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>, <a href="https://cryptio.co/">Cryptio</a>)  an emerging application layer that leverages crypto’s unfair advantages (e.g. <a href="https://www.3num.co/">3NUM</a>, <a href="https://nudge.xyz/">Nudge</a>, <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle / Drips)</a> in web services and financial products (e.g. <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a>)  <p>We further augment this by selectively investing in liquid tokens that are a match for our thesis (e.g. <a href="https://rendernetwork.com/">Render</a>, <a href="https://www.helium.com/">Helium</a>, <a href="https://dimo.zone/">Dimo</a>) and some large-cap L1s for purposes of working capital (e.g. Solana, ETH, Cosmos), with a view to re-deploy the asset base into their native ecosystems.</p><p>So if you are building along our thesis or want to open our minds to something completely new — we would like to hear from you. Or if you are looking to work on some open-ended research without committing to scaling a startup, take a look at our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/announcing-the-blueyard-dyor-do-your-own-research-funding-program-9be5f2f23d37">DYOR program</a>. BlueYard is a firm that invests in foundational technologies across compute, engineering, software and biology, offering founders a community of like-minded, ambitious and long-term oriented builders that can help each other beyond the boundaries of their respective domains.</p><p>Disclaimer: This post is for general information purposes only.

We are just aligning our naming policy to be less confusing. Right now we are investing BlueYard 3 ($175m) and BlueYard Crypto 3&nbsp;($75m).</p>

  The Game Theory of AI CapEx  <p>“Will AI change the world” and “Are CapEx levels too high” are different questions.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published July 16, 2024
  



 
<p>Imagine you knew for certain that AI was going to be as transformational as the internet, and that you control the only AI company in the world. How fast would you build CapEx?</p>



<p>I believe the answer is: You would take your time. “AI CapEx” is a euphemism for building physical <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-data-center-buildout/">data centers</a> with land, power, steel and industrial capacity. If you were the only company in AI, you’d wait to digest some AI revenues. You’d see how liquid cooling systems perform, and alter your data center designs as needed. You’d build new power generation assets in the right locations, and then build your data centers in proximity to fiber optic cables. What you would not do is immediately lock in multiple years worth of CapEx, because you’d know that as models and architectures shift, so too will your data centers need to evolve.</p>



<p>Many market participants today would have you believe that there is a choice between being an “AI bull,” who believes that infrastructure building is justified by AI’s enormous potential or an “AI bear,” who believes that overbuilding sets future expectations too high. The thought experiment above illustrates that this is a false dichotomy. The CapEx debate is a debate about speed, not about magnitude.</p>



<p>In fact, the more you believe in AI, the more you might be concerned that AI model progress will outpace physical infrastructure, leaving the latter outdated. For example, once everyone has 100k clusters, big tech companies will need to figure out what to do with their 50k and 25k clusters. We’ve heard a few industry experts make comments along the lines of: No one will ever train a frontier model on the same data center twice—by the time the model has been trained, the GPUs will have become outdated, and frontier cluster sizes will have grown. There is also the issue of how much power you need for a given real estate footprint and how dense to pack your GPU racks, decisions that are dependent on GPU power efficiency—a moving target.</p>



<p>The key to understanding the pace of today’s infrastructure buildout is to recognize that while AI optimism is certainly a driver of AI CapEx, it is not the only one. The cloud players exist in a ruthless oligopoly with intense competition. This is no small prize to defend—the cloud business today is a $250B market, roughly the same size as the entire SaaS sector, combined. The cloud giants see AI as both a threat and an opportunity and do not have the luxury to wait and see how the technology evolves. They must act now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The arms race between Microsoft, Amazon and Google is thus game theoretic. Every time Microsoft escalates, Amazon is motivated to escalate to keep up. And vice versa. We are now in a cycle of competitive escalation between three of the biggest companies in the history of the world, collectively worth more than $7T. At each cycle of the escalation, there is an easy justification—we have plenty of money to afford this. With more commitment comes more confidence, and this loop becomes self-reinforcing. Supply constraints turbocharge this dynamic: If you don’t acquire land, power and labor now, someone else will.</p>







<p>For smaller players, the urgency is even higher. If Microsoft and Amazon buy up all the land and power, buy up all the diesel generators and buy up all the liquid cooling systems, then how will you compete? When you look one notch below the scale of Amazon, Google and Microsoft, there is a sense of desperation. If you do not move now, you will never get another chance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This helps explain another potential motive for the aggressive behavior we’re seeing from the cloud providers: Defense. There is a real-sense in which only companies that have the balance sheets to withstand big write-offs can now afford to play in the AI infrastructure race. From this perspective, overbuilding may be perfectly rational.</p>



<p>Whether for reasons of optimism or reasons of competition, today’s rapid construction of new AI data centers should have a big positive effect on startups going forward. Much of the risk in AI today is being borne by infrastructure providers. This is effectively a subsidy for the startups who are building on top of them. Competition between Microsoft, Amazon and Google should assure lower API pricing in the future. It’s also good for the AI ecosystem—these CapEx investments will enable us to test scaling laws and learn more about AI’s future potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like governments did in the past, big tech companies are making high upfront infrastructure investments that will spur innovation. Whether or not these investments end up being profitable before they depreciate, they are on the critical path to AI’s long-term impact.</p>

<p></p><p>Dear community members.</p>



<p>Our transformative upgrade to Horizen 2.0 is full steam ahead since the community voted in favor of the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42406-proposed-technical-roadmap-for-the-migration-of-zen-and-eon/648">ZenIP 42406, which proposes a roadmap for the upgrade of $ZEN and EON</a>! </p>



 Security Best Practices  



<p>Please follow the steps below to ensure a smooth and safe experience during the 2.0 upgrade and keep your ZEN safe from scammers:</p>



 
 Do NOT send funds to anyone claiming to be from Horizen. 
 
 We would never ask the community to send us ZEN or any other type of funds. 
 
 



 Do NOT share your private keys with anyone. 
 
 We would never ask for private keys. If your private keys are not safe and secure, neither are your crypto assets. 
 
 



 Do NOT install anything on your device that is not from the official sources.  



 Do NOT give anybody remote access to your device. 
 
 We’d never ask you to install any software for remote access.   
 
 



 Do NOT trust any DMs that give instructions for any type of Horizen airdrop. 
 
 Official team members would never DM you. We only communicate the procedure on our official public channels. 
 
 



 The best way to get support is to open a ticket on the “open-a-ticket” channel on the <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Horizen Discord</a>. 



 Always double-check the social media handle and URL to make sure you are visiting the official channels. 
 



<p></p>

<p></p>



 Example of a scam attempt 







<p>As you can see in this scam attempt, users are being misled. They may think they’re on the official channel, but they’re not.</p>



<p>The only Horizen domain you should trust is horizen.io and blog.horizen.io.</p>



<p>Any additional words are domains bought by scammers. In this example: migrate-horizen.io.</p>



<p>The name of the scam Telegram group here is https://t.me/horizencommunitty Can you spot the scam?</p>



<p>In this scam example, there are two “t’s” in the word “community”.</p>



<p>You can also check when the group/user providing the information was created. Usually, scammers are very new accounts with little or no message history.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fced56fc-3eab-11ef-8a1f-f21b2a043e20/view">Zcash Dev Fund poll</a> has now closed and the results are in!</p>



<p>The purpose of this poll was to determine whether there is clear consensus amongst the Zcash community that a new Dev Fund should be established when the current Dev Fund expires in November, and, if so, which Dev Fund proposal should be adopted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Members of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) were asked to indicate their approval for each of the six proposals for a new Dev Fund, and for allowing the current Dev Fund to end without establishing a new Dev Fund. </p>



<p>Here are the results: </p>







<p>Under the Majority Choice Approval (MCA-M or Modified Bucklin) voting method, the winning proposal is the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/draft-nuttycom-funding-allocation#alternative-3-lockbox-for-decentralized-grants-allocation-20-option">Lockbox for Decentralized Grants Allocation (20% option)</a>, which directs 20% of the block rewards to a lockbox, for future disbursement in a manner that is consistent with results of community polling.</p>



<p>Note that cumulative percentages may not total to 100% due to abstentions.</p>



<p>The poll also asked voters to express their approval of direct and non-direct funding models, with an additional option of “I wish to reserve judgment until more information about a Non-Direct Funding Model is available”. </p>



<p>Here are the results: </p>







<p>Thank you to everyone who voted! </p>

  Fireworks: Production Deployments for the Compound AI Future  <p>The advent of intelligence as an API ushered in an explosion in AI—and Fireworks is emerging as a leader in the market.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/romie-boyd/">Romie Boyd</a>	 



Published July 11, 2024
  



Team Fireworks



 
<p>It is a similar arc at every company: developers begin their AI journey using a “Cadillac”—a very large, closed-source model to bootstrap a demo. But as they prototype to product-market fit and start to move their AI prototypes into production, they quickly start stumbling over a common set of hurdles:</p>



 
 Latency: Customers expect applications close to real time, and milliseconds can degrade their experience—and their conversion.&nbsp; 



 Cost: At production volume and scale, closed-source model bills rack up quickly. 



 Quality: For some tests, a larger model may underperform relative to a smaller, finely tuned model with specific examples.&nbsp; 



 Model and data ownership: Many enterprises are wary of sharing their secret sauce with an external provider, and prefer to host inference within their own virtual private cloud. 



 External dependencies: Companies want multiple models from a reliable cloud service provider, with no single source of failure for critical applications.&nbsp; 
 



<p>In short, once companies hone in on a specific AI use case, the “Cadillac” often becomes overkill: too heavy, too slow and too expensive to best serve production workloads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, teams are also increasingly shifting to compound AI systems, which combine multiple model calls, retrievers or external tools, offer better performance, reliability and control, versus relying on a single model.</p>



 A growing need 



<p>Thus enterprises are balancing a constellation of needs as they enter production: they crave the ease of a closed-source model provider; the latency, cost, quality and security that open-source models offer; and the versatility of compound systems. We at Sequoia have noticed a sharp inflection point over the last 6-9 months as more open-source alternatives have become viable.</p>



<p>It is a massive opportunity. The AI compute market alone is measured in tens of billions of dollars annually, and we expect a shift from majority training to majority production over the next several years. We also believe that the tailwinds behind the AI inference market are as durable as they are large. Silicon Valley has a long history of infrastructure providers making ever-more-ambitious applications possible by pushing the price-performance curve. By meeting the pragmatic needs of enterprises and pushing the boundaries of that curve, <a href="https://fireworks.ai/">Fireworks</a> has a chance to become a defining infrastructure provider for the age of AI.</p>



 An emerging leader 



<p>This market is not only large, but brutally competitive, with every startup claiming to have the best latency, throughput and cost. But as we talked with AI companies in our portfolio, a crowded market started to become crystal clear: Fireworks was the emerging market leader, with the best technology and the best team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Co-founders Benny Chen, Chenyu Zhao, Dmytro Dzhulgakov, Dmytro Ivchenko, James Reed, Lin Qiao and Pawel Garbacki bring together deep expertise from Google and Meta, including leadership of Meta’s PyTorch, which became the dominant framework for training neural nets including all modern large language models and diffusion models. Now, the Fireworks team is using those learnings to build a proprietary inference stack. And just as PyTorch was known for, among other things, its performance, which required multiple layers of optimization between hardware and framework, Fireworks’ custom CUDA kernel <a href="https://blog.fireworks.ai/fireattention-serving-open-source-models-4x-faster-than-vllm-by-quantizing-with-no-tradeoffs-a29a85ad28d0">FireAttention</a> has exceptional performance compared to other providers’ open source inference and serving frameworks. In particular, FireAttention v2 is the leading low-latency inference engine for real-time applications, with speed <a href="https://fireworks.ai/blog/fireattention-v2-long-context-inference">improvements</a> up to 8x and beyond.</p>



<p>What’s more, their latest offering is purpose-built to address the growing shift toward compound AI systems. FireFunction V2, an open-weight function-calling model, can orchestrate across multiple models, as well as their external data and knowledge sources and other APIs. It also seamlessly integrates with a range of tools and frameworks, allowing developers to quickly and easily build scalable multi-inference workflows.</p>



<p>Fireworks is also approaching this market holistically; rather than simply providing a suite of tools (e.g., inference and fine-tuning), they are building a full solution that delivers the optimal mixture of models and functions based on customers’ specific requirements. And by choosing to partner, rather than compete, with cloud providers and enabling deployment into existing virtual private clouds, they have created a win-win for customers. Cloud vendors can focus on hardware purchasing, data center capex and service availability, while Fireworks can focus on delivering the most performant inference engine and the best developer experience for Generative AI. They’ve made running popular open-source models inside your cloud provider not only faster and cheaper, but more ergonomic, as well.</p>



 Grand ambitions 



<p>Already, the customers Fireworks has signed reflect its stellar reputation. Following competitive bake-offs, enterprises (Uber, DoorDash, Upwork, Quora) and AI-native startups (Cursor, Superhuman, Sourcegraph Cody, Cresta) alike have chosen to build their stack around Fireworks. The platform is making it easier for these to achieve large model performance from small model cost and latency—and to build agentic workflows that utilize specific underlying models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Fireworks’ vision is not simply to provide the fastest inference engine. In addition to FireFunction V2, recent product announcements such as FireOptimus, an LLM inference optimizer that learns your traffic to provide better latency (2x) and quality (&gt;= GPT-4), offer a glimpse of the innovations ahead.</p>



<p>In the months and years to come, the grand ambition is to build the single best platform enterprises can rely on as they deploy AI into production. We are excited to double-down on our partnership with Lin and the rest of the team as we lead Fireworks’ Series B, and to continue supporting the growth of both the platform and <a href="https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/fireworks.ai">the team</a>. As more companies make the choice that latency, cost, quality, ownership and developer experience matter for production AI—and as compound systems expand access to the sophisticated solutions once available to only a select few—the underlying technology this team is building will keep getting better, enabling an ever-expanding set of delightful customer experiences.</p>

<p>In 2020, the Zcash community decided to <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">establish a Dev Fund</a>, consisting of 20% of block rewards, allocated between the Electric Coin Company, the Zcash Foundation, and a major grants program, now known as Zcash Community Grants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the Dev Fund was established, the Zcash ecosystem has evolved and changed significantly, becoming more decentralized as new teams have joined the ecosystem. However, that Dev Fund will end later this year, and the question we now face is how best to support this continued evolution, growth and progress towards greater decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, the community began discussing whether there should be a new Dev Fund, and, if so, what it should look like. After months of discussion, debate, community calls, Twitter spaces, and exploratory polls, we now have a slate of six proposals for the community to consider: </p>

<p></p>



<p>If the community does not reach clear consensus in favour of adopting a particular proposal, the Dev Fund will expire in November as planned.</p>



<p></p>



 A Note on Impartiality 



<p>One of proposals was drafted by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), based on the results of exploratory polling. However, ZF is not endorsing or advocating for any specific Dev Fund proposal. This is a decision for the community to make, and our primary objective is to help the community reach consensus, even if the end result is no funding for ZF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at ZF believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community, and we hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Polling ZCAP&nbsp; 



<p>Today, we opened a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will close at 09:00 UTC on 15th July 2024.</p>



<p>The purpose of this poll is to determine whether there is clear consensus amongst the Zcash community that a new Dev Fund should be established when the current Dev Fund expires in November, and, if so, which Dev Fund proposal should be adopted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first question asks respondents to indicate their approval for allowing the current Dev Fund to end without establishing a new Dev Fund, and sending 100% of the block rewards to miners.</p>



<p>The next six questions ask respondents to indicate their approval for each of the six proposals for a new Dev Fund. A summary of the various Dev Fund proposals can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/important-deadline-for-zips-likely-dev-fund-related-that-want-to-be-activated-next-halvening/48004/17">here</a>, and the poll includes links to the relevant ZIPs, which we strongly encourage you to review in detail.</p>



<p>The poll asks respondents to indicate their approval for each proposal on a five-point scale:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Strongly Approve 



 Approve 



 Neutral 



 Disapprove 



 Strongly Disapprove 
 



<p></p>



<p>The outcome of the poll will be determined using a Majority Choice Approval (MCA-M or Modified Bucklin) voting method, which works as follows:&nbsp; Respondents rate each proposal on the 5-point scale. First, only the “Strongly Approve” ratings are counted. If one or more proposals is rated “Strongly Approve” by more than 50% of respondents, the proposal with the highest number is selected for implementation in NU6. If not, the number of “Approve” ratings is added to the “Strongly Approve” counts. If a proposal now is approved of by more than 50% of respondents, it is regarded as the preferred proposal. If there is still no clear consensus, “Neutral” ratings are added, and so on. The proposal with the highest combined total in each step is regarded as the preferred proposal if it reaches more than 50%.</p>



<p>In the event that two or more proposals garner majority support, but there is no clear community consensus, there will be a runoff poll.</p>



<p></p>



 Future Evolution of Development Funding Models 



<p>The final two poll questions solicit respondents’ input regarding the future evolution of the Dev Fund, specifically regarding direct versus non-direct funding models. Electric Coin Company CEO Josh Swihart has proposed that the current Direct Funding Model (which allocates block reward directly to specific entities or organizations by embedding their wallet addresses into the protocol) be replaced by a Non-Direct Funding Model, which instead allocates a portion of the block rewards to a multi-sig wallet. Those who seek funding to contribute to Zcash would then be required to submit proposals and compete for funding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the design, governance and implementation details have not yet been fleshed out, several community polls have indicated strong community support for a Non-Direct Funding Model, and several of the current Dev Fund proposals direct a slice of the Dev Fund to a “lockbox”, in anticipation that a Non-Direct Funding Model may be established in the future. Therefore, we want to ensure that ZCAP members have the opportunity to express their views on this topic.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>The Helios poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 15th July 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we welcome the community’s feedback. If you have comments or suggestions, please join the conversation on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash community forum</a>.</p>

  Partnering with Skild: The Future of Embodied Intelligence  <p>Most people think robotics is a hardware problem—but Deepak and Abhinav know it’s a software problem.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a>	 



Published July 9, 2024
  



Deepak, Stephanie and Abhinav at Sequoia.



 
<p>Robots performing extreme parkour. Robots manipulating objects, including doors and drawers, with their hands. Robots scaling stairs as high as themselves—forwards, backwards, indoors and outdoors. Robots moving with the fluidity of nature. These advancements have broken the internet over the last few years, and nearly all of them can be traced back to two elite researchers: Deepak Pathak and Abhinav Gupta.&nbsp;</p>



 Different Perspectives 



<p>Unlike most in the world of robotics, Deepak and Abhinav come from computer vision and deep learning backgrounds. While traditional robotics focused on gathering specific data to train robots for specific tasks in specific environments, Deepak and Abhinav leveraged large-scale data to build a foundation model using their adaptive architecture, based on transformers. What they got by doing this was totally unique: a way to unlock intelligence in the embodied, physical world, and create a model for robotics that is generalized, robust, and leads to emergent behavior.&nbsp;</p>



 Outlier Founders 



<p>Deepak comes from a small town in India. While most promising students moved to bigger cities to prepare for national exams, he opted not to leave—and still got into the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. His accomplishment made local headlines. Deepak learned how to program by manually writing code on paper at home, which he vigorously double-checked before using his limited minutes at the local cafe to run programs he built. He excelled at IIT, winning a gold medal in computer science (and later, was the youngest winner of the school’s Young Alumnus Award). He went on to pursue a Ph.D. in AI at Berkeley while joining Facebook AI Research (FAIR), co-founded a startup that was later acqui-hired, and then became an assistant professor at the Robotics Institute at CMU, where he has since published cutting-edge research. It goes without saying: Deepak is a force of nature.</p>



<p>Abhinav, too, is a legend in the field: a tenured professor at the Robotics Institute at CMU, and a former founding member and research leader at FAIR Robotics. He and Deepak discussed starting a company for a decade. In early 2023, they saw the acceleration of technical advancements in their field—so many of which they had contributed to—and knew the time was now to scale their work to the next level.</p>



 The Opportunity 



<p>What exactly was the monumental shift Deepak and Abhinav saw coming? In the years they’d spent pursuing the goal of building general intelligence for robots, the key challenge had been how to build a large-scale model to train a robot when no data at that scale exists. Unlike for large language models, there was no internet of data readily available. So they explored different strategies to learn from what was available: online videos, tele-operation, real world data, simulations and more.&nbsp; In 2015, they reached their first unlock, scaling robotics data by 1,000x, and in the next few years, they were among the first to experiment with human teleoperation and low-cost robotic teleoperation platforms. In 2017, they proposed the famous curiosity-driven learning algorithm for building agents that can continuously explore and learn on their own. In 2021 and 2022, they broke through again with a promising strategy that used large-scale adaptive SIM2REAL, or virtual-to-real-world training, winning the Best Robotic System Award at the Conference on Robotic Learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These were the building blocks that led to the vision for <a href="https://www.skild.ai/">Skild</a>: a general-purpose model capable of tackling any task, in any environment, without specific training. If Deepak and Abhinav could accomplish that, they would achieve a breakthrough on the scale of GPT-3—with results that could apply to nearly every field.&nbsp;</p>



 Robotics’ GPT-3 Moment 



<p>Today, Skild has the potential to build in the real world what OpenAI has built in the digital world. In fact, Deepak and Abhinav’s approach challenges our current notion of AGI—that it can be built by learning from digital knowledge alone. In their vision of AGI, we learn by doing. We build an understanding of how things work by attempting novel tasks in novel environments, and combining the near-instant feedback of what happens with everything we already know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine that world: where a foundation model for AI robotics exists that is capable of performing any task, in any environment, on any robot hardware. It would mean a massive expansion of the types of robots we could then build, and at orders of magnitude lower cost to what we see today.&nbsp;</p>



 Potential Scale 



<p>I’ve now been at Sequoia for nine years, and once in a blue moon, I’m lucky enough to hear the vision of a founder where the ambition and potential scale of impact stops me in my tracks. I first met Deepak and Abhinav on a Thursday afternoon, as they were raising their initial seed round, and we were partners by Tuesday. I remember the awe, wonder, and almost daunting curiosity I felt as I imagined how the world would change if they succeeded. And as we’ve partnered together over the past nine months, those feelings have only grown. This <a href="https://www.skild.ai/">team</a> is onto something that could change the world we live in forever.</p>



<p>I’m excited to finally announce our partnership together, join the board, and share the team’s latest fundraising milestone: a $300M round valuing the company at $1.5B.&nbsp;</p>

  AI is Now Shovel Ready  <p>Five predictions for the upcoming data center construction boom, and its implications for energy and the economy.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 



Published July 8, 2024
  



 
<p>We have written here extensively about the revenue side of the AI infrastructure buildout. My last piece, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B question</a>, focused on the implied revenue expectations for AI, and questioned the time horizon in which we’ll be able to meet those lofty goals.</p>



<p>This piece turns to the cost side of the equation. In particular, we will focus on the data center buildout, the rise of the “AI factory,” and its implications for energy, construction and the industrial supply chain. We believe that 2025 will be the “Year of the Data Center” and that we are on the cusp of transitioning from a hype cycle into an industrial-driven build cycle.</p>



<p>A few predictions, and then let’s get into the details:</p>



 
 AI will catalyze an energy transformation. New solar construction, battery innovation, a resurgence in nuclear energy—these will be long-term effects of the AI wave 



 Some hyperscalers will find that they are not nimble enough to address rapidly changing data center requirements—new industrial AI players will emerge to fill this gap 



 Starting in the next 6 months, there will be a lot of headlines about delays in data center builds due to issues with liquid cooling, cluster size and power access 



 The industrial capacity needed to build new AI data centers will serve as an economic stimulus and create jobs in the real economy: Steel, energy, trucking and construction 



 When new data center capacity comes online, the cost of training and inference delivered by AWS, Azure and GCP will go down, to the benefit of startups 
 



<p>In contrast to the big technical unknowns about the future of AI, there is a glimmer of clarity here: we can begin to plan for a 2-3 year period of industrial scaling. We are ready to move beyond abstract commitments (see below) to shovels hitting the ground.</p>



<p>Here is a summary of the new data center projects that have been announced in the last year— which we believe construction is now set to accelerate:</p>



 
 Amazon: In the first half of 2024, AWS announced $50B in new data center projects, including <a href="https://www.bisnow.com/national/news/data-center/amazon-will-spend-100b-on-ai-data-center-development-124938">216 new buildings</a>. Overall, Amazon has committed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-28/amazon-bets-150-billion-on-data-centers-required-for-ai-boom">$100-150B</a> over the next 15 years. Recent commitments include: An $11B campus in <a href="https://iedc.in.gov/events/news/details/2024/04/25/gov.-holcomb-announces-amazon-web-services-plans-to-invest-11b-to-create-a-new-data-center-campus-in-northern-indiana">Indiana</a>, $10B across two campuses in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-10-billion-investment-mississippi">Mississippi</a>, $5.3B in new data centers across <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/1311730/aws-to-invest-5-3-to-build-data-centers-in-saudi-arabia-to-bolster-tech-in-the-region.html">Saudi Arabia,</a> a new nuclear-powered data center near <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-acquires-talens-nuclear-data-center-campus-in-pennsylvania/">Salem, Pennsylvania</a>, a new planned data center near <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-plans-data-center-in-round-rock-texas/">Round Rock, Texas</a> and a $15B commitment in <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2024/01/19/aws-will-invest-15b-japan-expand-local-data-center-footprint/">Japan</a>. Germany, Taiwan and Singapore are also being considered for new projects.&nbsp; 



 Microsoft: Microsoft now has 5GW of energy capacity and is reportedly <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-to-double-new-data-center-capacity-this-year-report/">doubling</a> new data center construction in 2024. Recent announcements include: $3.3B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2024/05/08/microsoft-announces-3-3-billion-investment-in-wisconsin-to-spur-artificial-intelligence-innovation-and-economic-growth/">Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin</a>, $1B in <a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/microsoft-cloud-azure-data-center-investments-generative-ai/717897/">Northwest Indiana</a>, $1B in <a href="https://developromefloyd.com/2023/10/updated-microsoft-to-invest-1-billion-in-data-center-in-floyd-county/">Floyd County, Georgia</a>, $4.3B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/fr-fr/2024/05/13/microsoft-announces-the-largest-investment-to-date-in-france-to-accelerate-the-adoption-of-ai-skilling-and-innovation/">France</a>, $3.5B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/de-de/fit-fuer-das-ki-zeitalter-microsoft-investiert-32-milliarden-euro-um-ki-infrastruktur-und-cloud-kapazitaeten-in-deutschland-mehr-als-zu-verdoppeln-sowie-fachkraefte-zu-qualifizieren/">Germany</a>, $3.2B in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/30/uk-ai-skilling-security-datacenters-investment/">UK</a>, $3.2B in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-03/microsoft-makes-3-2-billion-ai-bet-on-swedish-data-centers?sref=Hhue1scO">Sweden</a>, $2.1B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/es-es/2024/02/20/microsoft-quadruples-its-investment-in-ai-and-cloud-infrastructure-in-spain-to-promote-the-deployment-of-responsible-and-secure-artificial-intelligence-in-companies-and-public-administration/">Spain</a>, $2.2B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2024/05/02/microsoft-announces-us2-2-billion-investment-to-fuel-malaysias-cloud-and-ai-transformation/">Malaysia</a>, $1.7B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2024/04/30/microsoft-announces-us1-7-billion-investment-to-advance-indonesias-cloud-and-ai-ambitions/">Indonesia</a>, $1B in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2024/05/22/microsoft-and-g42-announce-1-billion-comprehensive-digital-ecosystem-initiative-for-kenya/">Kenya</a> and a new data center in <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/es-xl/microsoft-launches-its-first-hyper-scale-cloud-datacenter-region-in-mexico/">Mexico</a>. There have been reports of a $100B <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-openai-planning-100-billion-data-center-project-information-reports-2024-03-29/">Stargate</a> data center, although this is not confirmed. 



 Google: Google is the smallest of the three cloud providers by a wide margin. The GCP pitch has long been that it’s better for AI companies. Now, that is being put to the test. Google is building a new $2B data center in <a href="https://www.iedc.in.gov/events/news/details/2024/04/26/gov.-holcomb-announces-google-is-building-a-2b-data-center-in-northeast-indiana">Indiana</a>, a $1B data center in <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/google-to-build-1bn-data-center-in-kansas-city-missouri/">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, a $1.1B data center in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-invests-1-billion-euros-finnish-data-centre-drive-ai-growth-2024-05-20/">Finland</a> and a $576M data center in <a href="https://www.thegazette.com/local-government/google-named-as-company-behind-proposed-576-million-cedar-rapids-data-center/">Cedar Rapids, Iowa.</a> Google has the added challenge of scaling its own TPU clusters at some sites.&nbsp; 



 Meta: Meta does not operate a cloud business, but has nonetheless been scaling its data center capacity to support Llama and other internal AI initiatives. Meta recently announced that it has accumulated <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/">350k H100 GPUs</a>, as part of a total fleet of 600k H100 equivalents. The company also announced two 24k GPU clusters dedicated for <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/12/data-center-engineering/building-metas-genai-infrastructure/">Llama 3 training</a>. Meta has four new data centers in the works, including in <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-resumes-construction-of-texas-and-idaho-data-centers-with-new-ai-design/">Kuna, Idaho</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-resumes-construction-of-texas-and-idaho-data-centers-with-new-ai-design/">Temple, Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-named-as-company-behind-328-acre-data-center-in-davenport-iowa/">Davenport, Iowa</a> and <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/meta-officially-announces-data-center-in-cheyenne-wyoming/">Cheyenne, Wyoming</a>.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The sheer industrial scale of what’s happening is tremendous. These announcements represent an industrial scale-up that happens once or twice in each generation.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand how unique the upcoming challenges will be, and how pressing. There is a <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/grid-interconnection-queue-berkeley-lab-lbnl/712926/">long backlog</a> of energy projects that need to be connected to the grid. Even with faster interconnection, we will need more <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/why-the-ai-industrys-thirst-for-new-data-centers-cant-be-satisfied-93c7eff5">power</a> to support all these new data centers. Generation capacity will need to be added, largely in the form of solar and wind power, and we will need to be creative in leveraging existing energy resources. These power constraints are especially profound in “prime” data center markets like Virginia, Nevada and California. As a result, a lot of the newer developments are happening in “secondary” markets like Wyoming, Indiana, Iowa and Illinois. The need for more power and a better functioning grid was clear before AI. Now, it is becoming urgent.</p>



<p>Other technology issues abound: Next-gen Nvidia chips will require <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nvidias-ceo-confirms-next-dgx-will-be-liquid-cooled/">liquid cooling</a>, and there is now a shortage in the liquid cooling supply chain. There is a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/why-the-ai-industrys-thirst-for-new-data-centers-cant-be-satisfied-93c7eff5">two-year wait</a> for diesel generators. Cluster sizes are reaching unprecedented territory: Elon Musk has announced a <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/elon-musk-claims-300000-b200-gpu-supercomputer-for-xai-by-next-summer-the-usual-caveats-apply/">300k GPU cluster</a>. Models are getting so big, they may eventually need to be trained on distributed clusters across multiple data centers. <a href="https://www.coresite.com/blog/lithium-ion-in-the-data-center">Lithium-ion batteries</a> have become a staple of new data center buildouts; new approaches are being contemplated to further lower cost and increase capacity.</p>



<p>Hyperscalers are known for their operational rigor in building data centers, but this new wave of construction will test even their best teams. Expect to see some distribution in outcomes across the hyperscalers—there will be winners and losers here. New industrial AI players will have an opportunity to fill any operational gaps. Existing market participants like Equinix, Digital Realty and CyrusOne are experiencing a “demand shock”—either they will step up and benefit from this, or they will lose share to new entrants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Expect to see a lot of headlines in 2025 about data center construction delays. Also expect to see some big, unexpected successes. When we exit the realm of bits and enter the realm of atoms, a new skillset takes hold and operational rigor becomes paramount. As we’ve seen with SpaceX and Tesla, the types of companies that thrive in these messy, fast-moving environments are not always the existing incumbents. Strong leadership and agility pay their biggest dividends during moments of complex change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI industrial phase should have a real economic stimulus effect, especially in areas of the economy that badly need it. Beneficiaries will include component makers in the industrial supply chain, energy companies building new generation assets like solar and wind, nuclear reactor operators and many others. For example, we are visiting a battery factory this week in West Virginia, which is being built on the site of an old coal plant. In the near-term, more job gains are likely to accrue to construction and industrial labor than to the small group of researchers architecting models in Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>How is all of this growth being financed? For the most part, Big Tech companies are deploying capital off their balance sheets. With the Magnificent 7 now representing approximately 30% of the S&amp;P 500, the scale and speed at which they can deploy capital is awesome. Financial firms are participating as well, generating additional leverage. Many private equity firms are happy to provide <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/coreweave-secures-7-5-billion-debt-financing-facility-led-by-blackstone-and-magnetar/">upfront capital</a> for construction and GPU purchases, in return for an IOU from Microsoft and a reasonable yield.</p>



<p>When all is said and done, we’re going to have a lot of AI factories. Whether there will be enough demand to fill them, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">we still don’t know yet</a>. At the very least, training and inference costs should continue their decline, a boon to startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are building in this space, we’d love to hear from you. Please reach out at <a href="mailto:dcahn@sequoiacap.com">dcahn@sequoiacap.com</a>. We’re especially interested to hear from founders building at the intersection of energy, industrials and AI.</p>

<p>We know that technology has changed art, and that artists have evolved with every new technology — it’s a tale as old as humanity, moving from cave paintings to computers. Underlying these movements are endless debates around inventing versus remixing; between commercialism and art; between mainstream canon and fringe art; whether we’re living in an artistic monoculture now (the answer may surprise you); and much much more.&nbsp;</p><p>So in this new episode featuring Berlin-based contemporary artist Simon Denny -- in conversation with a16z crypto editor in chief Sonal Chokshi -- we discuss all of the above debates. We also cover how artists experimented with the emergence of new technology platforms like the web browser, the iPhone, Instagram and social media; to how generative art found its “native” medium on blockchains, why NFTs; and other art movements.&nbsp;</p><p>Denny also thinks of entrepreneurial ideas -- from Peter Thiel's to Chris Dixon's Read Write Own -- as an "aesthetic"; and thinks of technology artifacts (like NSA sketches!) as art -- reflecting all of these in his works across various mediums and contexts. How has technology changed art, and more importantly, how have artists changed with technology? How does art change our place in the world, or span beyond space? It's about optimism, and seeing things anew... all this and more in this episode.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Find Denny on Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/dennnnnnnnny">https://x.com/dennnnnnnnny</a></p><p>Find Sonal on Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/smc90">https://x.com/smc90</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

        <p>On June 26th, 2024, Bryan Nowlan, Marketing Project Manager from Horizen Labs, participated in a text AMA with the StealthEX community to discuss all things Horizen Ecosystem, Horizen Labs, zkVerify, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>In case you didn’t get a chance to catch it live, we put together this recap blog of the questions and answers.&nbsp;</p><p>Question: What technical support and resources are available for developers and users of the ZKVProtocol? How does HorizenLabs ensure the long-term sustainability and maintenance of the protocol?</p><p>Answer: zkVerify has in-depth technical documentation available for developers and builders that are looking to interact with the project. The documentation can be reached here: <a href="https://docs.zkverify.io/">https://docs.zkverify.io/</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Ranging from an overview of zkVerify, to the zkVerify Hub with important links and recommendations, to a tutorials section, users can find all they need to get started with the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Our tech teams are also very responsive on the zkVerify Discord, if any users run into any issues or have any questions, members of the team can jump in there to provide support: <a href="http://discord.gg/zkverify">discord.gg/zkverify</a></p><p>Horizen Labs is the builder of zkVerify, so we are deeply invested in the long-term sustainability and maintenance of the protocol. We have extensive experience with zero-knowledge technologies and an entire team dedicated to ensuring zkVerify’s success!</p> <p>Question: How does the ZKVProtocol integrate with other Horizen technologies, such as the Horizen EON blockchain and the Horizen Wallet? What are the benefits of this integration?</p><p>Answer: The Horizen Community recently voted to pass ZenIP 42406, the technical proposal for the migration of EON and $ZEN, included in that proposal is an overview of how zkVerify will integrate with other Horizen technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Horizen 2.0 will be a fully-compatible EVM, which means that existing smart contracts on EON will be transitioned over, including $ZEN in current liquidity pools. Horizen 2.0 will also be built using the Substrate framework (written in Rust), which will allow for a tight integration with the zkVerify protocol (which is also built on Substrate) for fast and cost-effective verification of zk proofs. Specifically, EON 2.0 will be a parachain connected to the zkVerify Relay Chain.</p><p>The benefits to this integration allow Horizen to become optimized for ZK-based Apps, the seamless integration with zkVerify ensures the most efficient process for all ZK projects. This sets the groundwork for innovative ZK apps that will make Horizen the home for ZK and also provide more utility for $ZEN.</p> <p>Question: Given Spencer’s remarks on the necessity of evolving with blockchain technologies in the previous StealthEX AMA, how is the marketing department planning educational initiatives or community outreach programs to address the complexities of ZKVerify?</p><p>Answer: Great question, this is something that the Horizen Labs Marketing Team is extensively focused on and planning for. We have established a developer relations team, whose responsibility will be to ensure sufficient educational and community outreach programs will be created for zkVerify, some of which have already kicked off or will be starting soon.&nbsp;</p><p>The zkVerify documentation hub has tutorials already available to developers and builders: <a href="https://docs.zkverify.io/tutorials/tutorials/">https://docs.zkverify.io/tutorials/tutorials/</a></p><p>This includes which wallets to use to get started, how to connect the wallets to zkVerify, how to request test tokens ($ACME), and many guides on how to submit proofs with various verifiers such as Groth16, Fflonk, Risc0, and more! I’d encourage anyone who is interested to explore this to check out our documentation linked above. The team is always available on Discord for any questions or any support needed.&nbsp;</p><p>We will also be launching an educational program with Metaschool soon for zkVerify. This will be an interactive course in which users can learn more about zero knowledge technology, the modular blockchain stack, and how zkVerify fits into all of it. There will be some user actions to take as part of the course, like following some of the tutorials above, additional information to come soon on that!&nbsp;</p><p>The zkVerify Twitter &amp; Youtube is a great source of educational content for users as well, to make sure that zkVerify is as builder friendly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>zkVerify Twitter: <a href="https://x.com/ZKVProtocol">https://x.com/ZKVProtocol</a></p><p>zkVerify Youtube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zkVerify">https://www.youtube.com/@zkVerify</a></p> <p>Question: How does HorizenLabs approach governance and decision-making within the project? Are there any specific mechanisms or processes in place to ensure community involvement and transparency?</p><p>Answer: The Horizen Ecosystem follows a DAO structure and is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem, including miners, developers, node operators, and $ZEN holders.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO, governed by the Horizen Foundation follows various processes regarding community proposals, called ZenIPs (ZEN Improvement Proposals) – starting with a proposal idea and research, idea modification, community feedback, draft creation, voting period, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO Discourse is the community hub, this is where many of the ZenIPs are discussed among the community members, as the proposals go from the idea phase to the draft phase and on to the formal voting phase. Community members are encouraged to express their thoughts and provide feedback on each proposal or discussion topic that comes in.&nbsp;</p><p>Voting on these ZenIP proposals is done via Snapshot, the Horizen Foundation Snapshot is a great way to check out previous community votes, what the participation levels were like, what was being voted on, and what was the community sentiment for each of the votes: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth</a></p><p>I’ll add a few resources that might be of value to learn more about this:&nbsp;</p>  Introducing Horizen DAO Blog: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/</a>  Horizen DAO Discourse: <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">https://horizen.discourse.group/</a>  Horizen Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a>  Horizen Governance Documentation: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about</a>   <p>Question: As horizenglobal expands its network of partners and collaborations, how do you plan to maintain a cohesive and unified ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders, and what challenges do you foresee in managing such a diverse portfolio of projects?</p><p>Answer: Horizen Labs prides itself on being one of the major collaborators in the crypto space. This means that our Business Development, Marketing, and Tech teams have extensive experience working with many different partners on many different initiatives, ensuring that the ecosystem is functioning efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the primary ways that we ensure alignment across many different partners within the ecosystem is through our communication. When it comes time for a network upgrade, update, new integration, new tool available, etc, we are always sure to communicate that both our community, as well as all of our ecosystem partners. This helps to ensure that all of our partners are aligned.&nbsp;</p><p>At Horizen Labs we have worked with the teams at Offchain Labs, Yuga Labs, Animoca Brands, Darewise, ApeCoin DAO, and more on various projects and initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, with the Horizen ecosystem running as a DAO structure, there is extensive community involvement in all that goes on within the ecosystem. From Discourse, to Discord, to Twitter and Telegram, the Horizen community is constantly in discussion and this is where we share updates, to ensure that everyone is aligned!</p> <p>Question: How does HorizenLabs leverage its expertise in zero-knowledge cryptography and modular blockchain to address the scalability and efficiency challenges faced by the Web3 ecosystem?</p><p>Answer: Horizen Labs has built zkVerify, the Modular Blockchain for ZK Proof Verification. zkVerify is dedicated to verifying ZK proofs across diverse blockchains efficiently, reducing proof verification costs by 90%+, which would have saved ZK Rollups $42.8 Million in 2023 alone.&nbsp;</p><p>By drastically reducing cost, zkVerify is empowering organizations and dApps to achieve economies of scale, bringing in the next generation of use cases that achieve blockchain’s ultimate potential.</p><p>zkVerify Enhances network performance by decoupling the computationally heavy proof verification process, allowing for faster and more precise operations free from the constraints of multi-purpose chains and seamlessly integrates with existing blockchain ecosystems and multiple zero-knowledge proving schemes, minimizing technical overhead with a developer-friendly environment.</p><p>I’d encourage anyone who is looking to learn more about zkVerify to check out their website: <a href="https://zkverify.io/">https://zkverify.io/</a></p> <p>Question: How could the successful implementation of ZenIP 42406 impact the value and adoption of the ZEN token? What are the potential economic benefits for ZEN holders and the broader Horizen ecosystem as a result of the migration and the new EON 2.0 parachain?</p><p>Answer: I won’t go into details on any price predictions with this answer, but I will say that there is a lot to unpack with the passing of ZenIP 42406.&nbsp;</p><p>At a high level, Horizen ($ZEN) and EON are currently built on older technology stacks. The Horizen Mainchain is a fork of the Bitcoin C++ codebase with a block time of 2.5 minutes, while EON is written in Scala based on the Scorex SDK with an 18-second block time. To address the limitations of these legacy systems and align with the vision of Horizen as a home for ZK and an enduring utility for $ZEN, Horizen Labs proposed to migrate to Horizen EON 2.0 with ZenIP 42406.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially Horizen/EON 2.0 will have a new target block time of ~6 seconds, be built on the Substrate framework written in rust, ZK-Optimized, and have backward compatibility.&nbsp;</p><p>On ZK-Optimization:&nbsp;</p>  Leverage fast, native zk proof verification from zkVerify Protocol  Modular and upgradable architecture for future zk advancements, such as new proving systems.&nbsp;  <p>On Backward Compatibility:&nbsp;</p>  Preserve max $ZEN supply  Full Solidity and EVM support  $ZEN, EON snapshots  Prolonged Claim Window  Enable Incentives for Ecosystem Partners  <p>In Addition:&nbsp;</p><p>-Enhanced Performance: Incorporating the latest advancements in zero-knowledge proof systems, improving transaction speeds, and increasing security</p><p>-Expanded Ecosystem with Full EVM Compatibility: Enhances interoperability with other blockchains, opening up a world of possibilities for cross-chain collaborations and integrations.

<p>Privacy is critical for institutional crypto traders. Trades on public blockchains expose institutions to risks, including strategy theft, front-running, and MEV bots. Dark pools offer institutions a promising way to execute large trades privately. However, their adoption has been slow. One major issue is the association between Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET) and illegal activities like money laundering and terrorist financing, as seen with Tornado Cash. Other problems include concerns about compliance with regulations, inefficiencies in handling large transactions, poor integration with existing financial systems, limited scalability, and the risk of censorship.</p><p>This blog will discuss the reasons behind the slow adoption of dark pools by institutional users such as asset managers, market makers, and broker-dealers, their benefits, and how Panther Protocol will help resolve these issues. Panther is building modular, compliance-supportive DeFi access infrastructure for regulated financial market operators. The protocol will include customizable private trading Zones, strong compliance support, direct access to major decentralized exchanges, and privacy-preserving transaction methods to improve digital asset management security, efficiency, and regulatory compliance.</p><p>*For brevity, organizations with users such as asset managers, market makers, and broker-dealers are all referred to as institutions throughout this blog.&nbsp;</p> Reasons behind the slow adoption of dark pools by institutions  Lack of regulatory compliance <p>Inadvertently facilitating illegal activities can result in severe penalties, loss of reputation, and operational disruptions for institutions. AML and KYC regulations are of utmost importance, ensuring that bad actors, such as sanctioned individuals and entities are off their platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many dark pools in DeFi, such as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/08/crypto-mixing-service-tornado-cash-blacklisted-by-us-treasury/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a>, do not align with regulatory standards. This non-compliance poses significant risks, as seen with Tornado Cash being sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and other regulators around the world due to its use by malicious actors like the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lazarus Group</a>. This has led to many institutions being cautious about using dark pools due to potential legal repercussions and the risk of funds being associated with illicit activities.</p> Need for liquidity and handling of large transactions <p>Institutions need solutions that ensure privacy without compromising transaction efficiency. Large trades can see significant slippage or delay if a Dark Pool faces liquidity issues. Any perceived transaction inefficiency naturally leads to challenges with adoption.&nbsp;</p> Poor integration with existing financial systems <p>Institutions prefer solutions that easily integrate with their existing systems, allowing for seamless interoperability and efficient workflows. Poor integration capabilities hinder adoption and can lead to operational bottlenecks. Currently, most of the dark pools available in the market lack integration with existing financial systems and tools. This creates a barrier for institutions that need to incorporate these solutions into their broader financial operations.</p> Vulnerability to censorship&nbsp; <p>For institutions, the risk of transaction censorship is unacceptable. Robust mechanisms are needed by these types of investors to ensure their transactions are processed fairly and securely without being subject to censorship.&nbsp; A number of high-profile regulators, including the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/news-releases/fincen-proposes-new-regulation-enhance-transparency-convertible-virtual-currency?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">U.S. Treasury, have proposed rules that identify virtual currency mixing as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern</a>. <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/174977/flashbots-product-lead-addresses-concerns-over-tornado-cash-censorship?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a> is a prime example of how transactions can be excluded by OFAC-compliant block builders.&nbsp;</p> Why institutions should care about dark pools  Privacy and confidentiality <p>One reason why the adoption of Web3 dark pools is slow is as a result of misconceptions related to the use of CEXs. While CEXs can provide partial privacy by breaking transaction links, CEXs also custody their user’s assets, introducing exposure to risks ranging from fraud to security issues. Crypto exchanges have a history of high-profile custody issues, such as FTX, whose litany of deceptive practices, including the lending its customers’ assets to Alameda research led to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/darreonnadavis/2023/06/02/what-happened-to-ftx-the-crypto-exchange-funds-collapse-explained/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">one of the worst crises in crypto’s history</a>. Other high profile examples include Mt. Gox, which <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mt-gox-begin-repaying-defunct-062550904.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">lost approximately 850,000 BTC to hacking incidents</a>; Bitfinex’s infamous security breach resulting the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60310783?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">theft of 120,000 BTC</a> and <a href="https://www.osc.ca/quadrigacxreport/quadriga-launch.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">QuidrigaCX</a>, where the sudden death of the CEO, who was the sole person with access to the exchange’s private keys, led to the loss of $190M in customer funds, among others.</p><p>Many institutional users find the risks associated with centralized custody unacceptable, particularly given CEXs only offer partial privacy. Dark pools provide essential confidentiality for institutions. In both traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi), large trades can significantly impact market prices and reveal trading strategies if executed publicly. Dark pools prevent market manipulation and front-running by hiding the details of your trades. This protection is essential for institutional investors to execute large transactions without other market participants exploiting this information. The ability to trade anonymously ensures that institutions can protect their trading strategies and investment returns from manipulative practices.</p> MEV Protection <p>MEV bots exploit the transparency and structure of blockchain transactions to extract additional value, often at the expense of other users. Their activities can lead to higher transaction costs, market manipulation, network congestion, and financial losses for other users of the platform. Dark pools such as Panther are using multiple approaches that can significantly reduce MEV risks. While no solution is entirely foolproof, the following strategies, currently under consideration for Panther Protocol’s designs will help create a more secure trading environment:</p>  Approach 1: Offchain Order Book with P2P Library  <p>Using this design choice, users communicate and negotiate trade details offchain using a peer-to-peer (P2P) library. For example, User A submits an offer, and User B handles the matching. They generate cryptographic proofs of the transaction offchain, and only one user submits a single transaction onchain for settlement via a smart contract. This approach minimizes onchain data exposure, reducing the information available to MEV bots and thereby lowering the chances of exploitation.</p>  Approach 2: Onchain Order Book with Onchain Interaction  <p>This design choice involves maintaining the order book and interactions entirely onchain. Users generate proofs and submit transactions onchain with a smart contract performing the settlement. Although this approach benefits from transparency and simpler implementation, it exposes trade details on the blockchain, making it more susceptible to MEV exploits.</p>  Approach 3: Hybrid Model  <p>A hybrid approach combines the strengths of both offchain and onchain methods. Sensitive data like user identities and trade amounts are exchanged offchain, while only cryptographic proofs are submitted onchain. This limits the onchain exposure to essential verification elements, enhancing privacy and reducing the likelihood of MEV attacks.</p><p>Dark pools inherently offer resistance to MEV bots because they typically involve peer-to-peer transactions and minimize onchain exposure, making it difficult for MEV bots to gather the information they need to exploit trades. In summary, by leveraging offchain communication, cryptographic proofs, and strategic onchain interactions, dark pools provide a robust framework for reducing MEV risks and enhancing transaction privacy.</p> Market efficiency and liquidity management <p>TradFi dark pools face significant reputational issues due to their history of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35456219?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Barclays%20and%20Credit%20Suisse%20have,but%20keep%20the%20prices%20private.">exploiting information advantages</a> to the detriment of their clients. Unlike traditional dark pools, on-chain dark pools such as Panther are working to contribute to market efficiency by allowing large trades to be executed without causing significant price movements. This stability benefits institutions that need to manage liquidity effectively without impacting market conditions. By enabling large, discrete trades, dark pools help institutions maintain optimal portfolio balances and manage risk efficiently. Efficient liquidity management is critical for institutions, and dark pools provide a platform where large orders can be matched without slippage or adverse market impacts. Mechanisms such as peer-to-peer order matching and liquidity aggregation from various sources ensure that institutions can access necessary liquidity while maintaining trade secrecy. This capability is vital for managing large transactions seamlessly.</p> Enhanced security and trust <p>Security is paramount for institutional investors, and dark pools offer a secure environment for executing trades. Privacy-enhancing technologies like zero-knowledge proofs ensure that trade data remains confidential and secure from external threats. Robust security protocols in dark pools build trust among institutional investors. Features like remote attestation and secure multi-party computation enhance the security of dark pool transactions, ensuring that the system remains trustworthy and reliable for institutional use. This trust is essential for institutions to engage in large-scale trading activities confidently.</p> How Panther will enable private, compliant DeFi access for institutions <p>Panther Protocol is set to enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in digital asset management. Panther is building compliance-enabling DeFi access infrastructure, complete with dark pool functionality for regulated financial entities. Panther Zones will enable institutions to create private trading Zones with customized asset lists, user lists, transaction limits, and access to DeFi applications. This modular approach will allow institutions to tailor their trading environments according to specific regulatory and operational needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Want to learn more about Panther Zones?

<p>AI assistants have become a common part of modern Web browsers. Brave has Leo, Edge has Copilot, Opera has Aria, Arc has Max… This new wave of AI integration has raised many questions among developers and users alike. What’s the best way to interact with an AI assistant within the browser? What unique opportunities arise when AI is brought directly into the browsing experience? And, perhaps most importantly: How can we effectively safeguard a user’s data, and allow them to configure their own AI models?</p>
<p><a>In our Leo roadmap</a>–where we outlined how Brave is thinking about Leo and the future of AI integrations within the browser (aka Browser AI)—we pointed out the need to allow users to run models locally, and to configure their own models. Running models locally (i.e. directly on device) ensures that data like conversations, webpages, and writing prompts exchanged with the AI assistant never leave the user’s device. This approach will also open more opportunities for assisting users with their local data while safeguarding end user privacy. Additionally, by allowing users to configure their own AI models, whether running locally or hosted remotely, Brave empowers users to tailor the AI’s behavior, output, and capabilities to their specific needs and preferences.</p>

 Your model, your rules 
<p>Our first step towards that promise is called “bring your own model” (or “BYOM” for short). This optional new way of using Leo, Brave’s native browser AI, allows users to link it directly with their own AI models. BYOM allows users to run Leo with local models running safely and privately on their own machines. Users will be able to chat or ask questions on webpages (<a>and docs and PDFs</a>) to Leo without their content ever having to leave the device.</p>
<p>BYOM isn’t limited to just local models, either–BYOM users will also have the flexibility to connect Leo to remote models running on their own servers, or that are run by third-parties (e.g. ChatGPT). This opens new possibilities for users and organizations to leverage proprietary or custom models while still benefiting from the convenience of querying the AI directly within the browser.</p>
<p>With BYOM, the requests are made directly from the user’s device to the specified model endpoint, bypassing Brave entirely. Brave does not act as an intermediary and has absolutely no access to—or visibility into—the traffic between the user and the model. This direct connection ensures end-to-end control for the user.</p>
<p>BYOM is currently available on the <a>Brave Nightly channel</a> for developers and testers, and is targeted to launch in full release later this summer. Note that BYOM is initially for Desktop users only.</p>

 Getting started Using Local Models with BYOM in Leo 
<p>No special technical knowledge or hardware is required to try BYOM. The local LLMs landscape has evolved so fast that it is now possible to run performant local models on-device in just a few simple steps.</p>
<p>For example, consider a hobbyist-favorite framework for running local LLMs: <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>. The Ollama framework supports an extensive <a href="https://ollama.com/library">list of local models</a> that range from 829MB to 40GB in size.</p>
<p>You can get started using a local LLM in Brave Leo in two easy steps:</p>

 Step 1: Download and install Ollama 
<p>First, visit <a href="https://ollama.com/download">https://ollama.com/download</a> to download Ollama. Select your platform and continue with the download. Once you download and unzip the file, make sure to move the application somewhere you can easily access, such as your computer’s desktop or Application folder. You will have to start the serving framework whenever you want to use the local model.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Next, click the application and wait for it to open, and complete the install steps.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>After you complete these steps and click Finish, you’ll be able to run Meta’s Llama 3 model on your machine just by opening your terminal and typing:</p>
 <code>ollama pull llama3
</code> <p>You should see that the model manifest and the model are being downloaded (note this step may take a while to complete, depending on the file size and your connection speed). Once the model has been pulled successfully, you can close your terminal.</p>
<p>Llama 3, at 4.7GB for an 8B parameter model, strikes a good balance between quality and performance, and can be easily run on a laptop with at least 8GB of RAM. Other models we found suitable to be run locally are Mistral 7B (by Mistral AI) and Phi 3 Mini (by Microsoft). <a href="https://ollama.com/library">See the full list of models supported by Ollama</a>.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Now that the model is running locally on your device, no data is being transmitted to any third party. Your data remains yours.&nbsp;</p>

 Step 2: Plug your model into Leo 
<p>To add your own local model to Leo, open the Brave browser and visit Settings, and then Leo. Scroll to the Bring your own model section and click Add new model.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>You’ll then be brought to a new interface where you can add the details of your model. The required fields are the following:</p>
 
 
<p>Label: The name of the model as it will appear in the model selection menu.</p>
 
 
<p>Model request name: The name of the model as it should appear in the request to the serving framework, e.g. llama-3 (note that if this name doesn’t match exactly what is expected by the serving framework, the integration will not work).</p>
 
 
<p>Server  endpoint: The url where your serving framework is “listening” for requests. If you’re not sure, check the serving framework documentation (For Ollama, this is always <code>http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>API Key: third party frameworks may require authentication credentials, such as an API key or an access token. These will be added to the request header.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Click Add model; your local model should now appear in the Leo model menu. Simply select it to use it to power your browser AI.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Note that while we’ve used Ollama in this section, as we think it’s one of the most user-friendly frameworks to set up and run local models, the BYOM feature can be used with any local serving framework with an exposed endpoint and that conforms to the OpenAI chat protocol.</p>

 Using Remote Models (ChatGPT) with BYOM in Leo 
<p>To connect Leo to a remote model or a third party API, such as <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction">OpenAI API</a>, follow these steps:</p>
 
 
<p>Enter <code>https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions</code> as the endpoint, and add the name of your desired model (e.g. <code>gpt-4o</code> see <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">model list</a>) in the <code>Model request name</code> field.</p>
 
 
<p>Enter your private API key in the <code>Authentication Credentials</code> field to authenticate your requests to the API. The key is then stored safely in your browser.</p>
 
 
<p>Note that—at the time of writing—Brave Leo only supports textual input and outputs; outputs of any other modality will not be processed. You can now use Brave Leo with ChatGPT through your OpenAI API account.</p>
<p>If you’re a Brave Nightly user, please give BYOM a try, and let us know what you think on X <a href="https://x.com/bravenightly/">@BraveNightly</a> or at <a href="https://community.brave.com/">https://community.brave.com/</a>!</p>
 
    Note: As of August 22, 2024, BYOM is now in general release and available to all desktop users (with browser update version 1.69 or higher).

 <a href='https://brave.com/blog/brave-shields-manifest-v3/'>What Manifest V3 means for Brave Shields and the use of extensions in the Brave browser</a>

</h3>

<div class='item-snippet'>

  Brave is committed to maintaining Manifest V2 support, allowing users to keep their favorite extensions functioning beyond the industry-wide deprecation.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In late 2021, Google first announced plans to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate/mv2-deprecation-timeline">deprecate Manifest V2</a> (MV2), the longstanding Chrome extension manifest file format, and force extensions to be built using Manifest V3 (MV3) going forward. What does this mean for Brave users? In short:</p>
 
 
<p>Manifest V3 will not weaken Brave Shields in any way</p>
 
 
<p>For as long as we’re able (and assuming the cooperation of the extension authors), Brave will continue to support some privacy-relevant MV2 extensions—specifically AdGuard, NoScript, uBlock Origin, and uMatrix</p>
 
 
<p><a>Brave Shields</a> block ads and trackers by default, and they’re built natively in the Brave browser—no extensions required. Since Shields are patched directly onto the open-source Chromium codebase, they don’t rely on MV2 or MV3.</p>
<p>Thanks to this independence, Google’s forced removal of MV2 will not weaken Brave Shields. The filter lists (such as EasyList and EasyPrivacy) we rely on to protect users from invasive ads and trackers are open for community contribution, and we expect the privacy community at large to continue maintaining these lists. Brave’s privacy research and engineering teams will do so as well.</p>
<p>No matter what happens with the deprecation of MV2 and the shift to MV3, Shields will continue to offer better, more stable protection than extensions.</p>

 Will MV2 extensions still work in Brave? 
<p>Yes, for now. We recognize the importance of supporting existing Manifest V2 extensions. We <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/blob/master/chromium_src/extensions/common/extension_features.cc">have force-enabled Manifest V2</a> support in the Brave browser, ensuring that you can continue to use your favorite extensions without interruption. In June 2025, Google plans to remove all remaining Manifest V2 items from the Chrome Web Store. While Brave has no extension store, we have a robust process for customizing (or “patching”) atop the open-source Chromium engine. This will allow us to offer limited MV2 support even after it’s fully removed from the upstream Chromium codebase.</p>

 Which MV2 extensions will work in Brave? 
<p>As of now, the MV2 extensions we plan to explicitly support are <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-adblocker/bgnkhhnnamicmpeenaelnjfhikgbkllg?hl=en&amp;pli=1">AdGuard AdBlocker</a>, <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm?hl=en">NoScript</a>, <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">uBlock Origin</a>, and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf">uMatrix</a>. This feature will be best-effort: we might have to modify support based on either Google’s plans or what extension authors ultimately decide to do. If extensions become stale or obsolete, we may remove support for them rather than offer our users an out-of-date (potentially even unsafe) experience.</p>
<p>We’re gradually rolling out a new page in Settings that lists these extensions. Once you have the update, you will see it in brave://settings/extensions.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 What’s the issue with Manifest V3? 
<p>As a recap, Manifest V3 restricts the blocking capabilities of Web extensions, <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-%28FAQ%29#filtering-capabilities-which-cant-be-ported-to-mv3">making it harder</a> for privacy-enhancing extensions such as uBlock Origin to protect users. The privacy community has already begun releasing experimental versions of ad block extensions that are rebuilt from the ground up to meet the new constraints of MV3: <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adguard-adblocker-mv3-exp/apjcbfpjihpedihablmalmbbhjpklbdf">AdGuard AdBlocker MV3 Experimental</a> and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh">uBlock Origin Lite</a> are just two examples. And we’ve seen that these experimental versions do block ads and other unwanted Web content. However, MV3 imposes new limitations, such as a cap on blocking rules, the removal of background scripts, and changes around cosmetic filtering. Overall, these new MV3 extensions lean on workarounds to solve problems MV3 itself introduces.</p>

 The increased importance of user-first browsers such as Brave 
<p>Brave provides best-in-class privacy, no extensions required. We’re also actively working on new features such as procedural filtering, which will give us more flexibility in blocking invasive ads and trackers, ensuring a cleaner and safer browsing experience for our users. If you’re not able to use Brave, browser extensions can be helpful to achieve some (though not all) of Brave’s protections in other, less private browsers. Most ad block developers put a lot of thought and care into the performance and safety of their extensions, and they can provide some additional privacy.</p>
<p>Brave also builds a host of other privacy protections adjacent to ad blocking, such as <a>fingerprint randomization</a>, <a>ephemeral storage partitions</a>, and more; such protections would be impossible in an extension-based solution. By building natively in the Brave browser, we’re saying these features are table stakes, not something that should be offered as an optional add-on.</p>
<p>While Brave will continue to offer limited support for MV2 extensions, the real solution is to use Brave’s industry-leading, native features. All are available by simply downloading the Brave browser.</p>

<p>In a world constantly torn by social division amplified by polarizing scissor statements throughout social media, Taiwan conducted a social experiment aimed at strengthening social unity while also embracing diversity. Plurality details how Taiwan’s Digital Minister Audrey Tang and her collaborators achieved inclusive, technology-fueled growth that harnessed digital tools to provide an antidote to information chaos and warfare.

<p>Proprietary investment strategies have always been among the most closely guarded secrets in finance. Traditionally, these strategies were protected by the nature of how trades are transacted, giving brokers and financial institutions the ability to leverage their proprietary strategies to their advantage. The rise of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new level of transparency. This openness, while fostering trust, poses significant risks as it exposes sensitive trading patterns and strategies to public scrutiny.</p> Exposure of investment strategies <p>In traditional finance, investment strategies are often the real value of what is being provided to the client or fund. Hedge funds, asset managers, and brokers invest significant resources into developing proprietary trading strategies that provide them a competitive edge. However, in the realm of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), the inherent transparency of public ledgers poses a significant threat to these proprietary strategies.</p><p>Every transaction on public blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin is recorded in a publicly accessible ledger. While this transparency promotes trust and verification, it also means that anyone can analyze transaction data to uncover trading patterns and strategies. This exposure can be detrimental to asset managers,&nbsp; brokers and financial institutions that rely on the confidentiality of their trading methods.</p><p>Blockchain analytics tools such as Nansen have made it increasingly easy to scrutinize and interpret blockchain data. Nansen, for instance, labels and analyzes millions of wallet addresses, providing insights into the activities of various market participants. These tools can track large transactions, identify trends, and even link transactions to specific entities. For asset managers, this means that their trades can be monitored, virtually in real-time. It’s possible that their strategies could be reverse-engineered by competitors or malicious actors.</p><p>When proprietary trading strategies are exposed, the risk of financial loss increases substantially. Competitors can replicate successful strategies, diluting competitive advantage. Worse still, malicious actors can engage in counteracting strategies such as front-running, where they anticipate trades and execute their own trades in advance to profit from the price movements triggered by the asset manager’s transactions.</p><p>For example, if an asset manager plans to purchase a large amount of a specific cryptocurrency, front-runners can detect the initial buying activity and buy the cryptocurrency themselves, driving up the price. By the time the purchase is complete, the price has increased, causing the asset manager to pay more than intended. Once the asset manager’s purchase is complete, the front-runners can sell their holdings at a profit, leaving the asset manager at a disadvantage.</p><p>In addition to financial losses, the exposure of investment strategies undermines the trust and credibility of asset managers and other financial professionals. Clients expect their asset managers, brokers and other advisors to maintain the confidentiality of their strategies and transactions. If asset managers cannot guarantee this privacy, they risk losing clients to non-crypto or private alternative investments.&nbsp;</p> Front-running <p>One of the most significant issues that comes with transparent blockchain ledgers is front-running. Front-running occurs when malicious actors observe patterns that suggest an impending transaction is coming and execute their trades ahead of it to capitalize on the expected price movement. For example, if an asset manager intends to buy a large amount of a particular token, front-runners might detect the client’s typical pre-cursory activity and purchase the cryptocurrency first. This buying activity drives up the price, and by the time the transaction is completed, they end up paying a higher price than anticipated. The front-runners then sell their holdings at the increased price, profiting from the transaction while the portfolio suffers from the inflated costs.</p><p>This lack of privacy not only results in financial losses but also erodes your ability to execute effective trading strategies. With open blockchains, competitors can analyze trading patterns, replicate successful strategies, or even devise counter-strategies that exploit your clients’ positions. This constant surveillance can lead to a loss of competitive edge, as asset managers, brokers and others are unable to maintain the secrecy of their clients’ strategies.&nbsp;</p> MEV Bots <p>MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bots underscore the importance of privacy in the trading strategies used by asset managers. These bots are sophisticated algorithms that monitor blockchain networks for pending transactions and exploit opportunities to extract additional value. By analyzing transaction data in real-time, MEV bots can execute trades such as arbitrage, front-running, and sandwich attacks, allowing them to profit from price discrepancies and transaction sequencing. The transparency of blockchain networks, while beneficial for trust and verification, makes it easier for these bots to operate, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining transaction confidentiality for all users, but asset managers who engage in high volume or high frequency trades on behalf of clients may be at higher risk. According to Flashbots, MEV bots <a href="https://www.tastycrypto.com/defi/mev-bots/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">extract around 500M USD off Ethereum</a> alone per year.&nbsp;</p> Options are limited <p>As of this writing, your options as an asset manager are limited if you wish to preserve your privacy and that of your clients. Many of today’s best-known privacy-enhancing technologies can create regulatory issues. For example, the virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash was infamously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury and faced investigations and actions from other regulators around the world, due to its involvement in illicit activities. Regulators <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">recognize</a> that there is an opportunity for privacy-enhancement for DeFi trading, and are calling for <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">innovations that can simultaneously preserve the privacy of users while also enabling AML/CFT obligations</a>. It is worth noting that Panther Protocol is being built to address this challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol <p>Panther’s cutting-edge decentralized privacy protocol will empower enterprises with customizable, private operating environments to manage portfolios and assets. Leveraging Zero-Knowledge proofs and a proprietary Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) design, Panther Protocol will deliver a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p> Benefits For Asset Managers (In development)   Private Portfolio Management Supports confidential client portfolio management, ensuring transaction details and holdings remain private, maintaining investor confidentiality.  Custom Investment Strategies Tailored investment access with specific DeFi applications and asset lists, optimizing returns while adhering to client risk profiles.  Compliance and Reporting Encrypted data storage for transactional details, simplifying compliance and reporting processes with secure transaction detail exports.   Conclusion <p>The transparency of blockchain technology presents both opportunities and challenges for asset managers and financial institutions. While it promotes trust and accountability, it also exposes proprietary strategies to potential competitors and malicious actors. This exposure necessitates that asset managers take steps to enhance their privacy measures and stay vigilant against threats like front-running. Navigating this landscape requires balancing the benefits of blockchain transparency with the need to protect confidential trading strategies.</p>

        <p><a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42406-draft-technical-roadmap-for-the-migration-of-zen-and-eon/648/18">On June 6th, the official ZenIP for the technical roadmap of the migration of $ZEN and EON went live on Discourse</a>, there’s a lot to cover on it, so we wanted to provide a high level overview of the proposal and what it means for the Horizen Ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a high level, Horizen ($ZEN) and EON are currently built on older technology stacks. The Horizen Mainchain is a fork of the Bitcoin C++ codebase with a block time of 2.5 minutes, while EON is written in Scala based on the Scorex SDK with an 18-second block time. To address the limitations of these legacy systems and align with the vision of Horizen as a home for ZK and an enduring utility for $ZEN, Horizen Labs is proposing to migrate to EON 2.0.</p>
 Key Points 
 
 EON 2.0 will be a fully-compatible EVM. This includes backward compatibility to provide a smooth transition for existing $ZEN holders and EON developers, including incentives, emissions, staking, partner integrations, exchange continuity, and EVM compatibility. This means that existing smart contracts on EON will be transitioned over, including $ZEN in current liquidity pools. 
 This is a technical ZenIP, laying out the technical roadmap for the migration mechanics for $ZEN and EON. Tokenomics are not in scope for this ZenIP. Topics such as allocations and emissions are explicitly excluded since they will be covered in greater detail in a separate proposal. 
 It will be a snapshot-based migration, where comprehensive state snapshots of both EON 1.0 and Horizen will be taken to ensure a seamless transition to EON 2.0. We will provide the ability for anyone to independently verify the integrity of both snapshots. 
 For Mainchain $ZEN, there will be a claim process overtime, where eligible users can claim their old Mainchain $ZEN by proving the ownership of their address. As for $ZEN on EON, it will not require any claim, since balances will be migrated with the state snapshot. 
 EON 2.0 will be built using the Substrate framework (written in Rust) with tight integration with the zkVerify protocol (which is also built on Substrate) for fast and cost-efficient verification of zk proofs. Specifically, EON 2.0 will be a parachain connected to the zkVerify Relay Chain. It is not associated with the Polkadot ecosystem.

<p>Leo—Brave’s in-browser AI assistant—is now even more useful, thanks to its integration with Brave Search. With today’s release, Leo can incorporate search-augmented responses into its answers, powered by the <a>Brave Search API</a>. This new integration allows Leo to provide more accurate and up-to-date answers, especially for queries related to current events or topics where the initial language model training may be outdated or lack full context.</p>
<p>Brave Leo with Brave Search results is now available to desktop users with today’s 1.67 browser update, and will be coming to mobile platforms very soon.&nbsp;</p>

 The benefits of real-time Web data in your AI assistant, and how to get started 
<p>There are countless instances where you might need real-time information incorporated into your conversation with Leo. For example, if you ask Leo about upcoming events like concerts or sporting events, it can now reference Brave Search results to supplement its response with the timeliest news and information. Or, if you’re researching a complex topic like financial markets, Leo can weave in current data and insights from credible sources to give you a well-rounded perspective.</p>
<p>Importantly, any Leo response that incorporates search results includes links to Brave Search to explore more results, and in an upcoming release will also include links to the sources used to inform the answer. This helps you understand the source of the answers you receive, and fact check before you proceed.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “What are the latest reviews for Inside Out 2?”</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “When is Game 4 of the NBA Finals?”</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Asking Leo “What’s happening with the stock market today?”</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on-page chat experience, desktop users can click  in the sidebar, while mobile users can tap “…” (iOS) or “⋮” (Android) and then tap Leo to get started.</p>
<p>While Leo’s search integration provides valuable context, it’s still important to verify information from third-party sources, especially for critical topics. Brave encourages users to think critically and fact-check key claims against authoritative sources. For this reason, answers that incorporate information from Brave Search are clearly labeled, and include a link to a search results page (SERP) where you can investigate further.</p>

 AI assistance that’s both smart and privacy-protecting 
<p>By seamlessly blending contextual search results into natural conversations, Leo offers a uniquely powerful yet privacy-preserving AI experience. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo never uses your chats for model training and no account or login is required to use Leo. Additionally, Leo includes some specific privacy protections, including:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as IP address). Responses generated with Brave-hosted models are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training; no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>For an added layer of privacy, you can clear all local Leo data stored on your device through the Settings menu.</p>
<p><a>Learn more about Leo and data privacy in our Privacy Policy.</a></p>

 Using Brave Search to build your own AI applications 
<p>Want to connect your AI to the Web? The Brave Search API allows any developer to integrate Brave Search results into their applications. The Brave Search API provides access to an index of billions of pages via Brave’s privacy-preserving Web index, for building everything from search engines to AI apps. <a>Learn more</a>.</p>

   Over the past decade, usage-based pricing has soared in popularity. Why? Because it aligns cost with value, letting customers pay only for what they use. But, that flexibility is not without issues - especially when it comes to predicting revenue. Fortunately, with the right process and infrastructure, your usage-based revenue can become more predictable than the traditional seat-based SaaS model.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>First and foremost, thank you to the community of over 3000 testnet users who have been testing and sharing valuable feedback. Your continued support and patience are critically important to our mission.</p><p>Testnet Stage 5 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to our codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 6 of our testnet is live. Stage 6 includes simulated fee management, AMM refilling mechanisms, simulated limited subsidy rewards, onboarding enhancements using a bundler service, and several technical improvements to our testing environment.</p><p>Note: Panther’s test network is now live on Amoy, Polygon’s test network, and can be accessed <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>. Due to this network change, users will need to complete the onboarding process again and activate their test zAccount. Users who are using their old accounts, however, will not have to go through PureFi credential process again and will be moved directly to the account activation. This is a one-time activity required to access Panther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Getting started with Stage 6 <p>To start testing Stage 6, visit <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps. Here are some of the features you can look forward to testing in Stage 6:</p><p>Fees<br>This release introduces the mechanism for charging different types of fees within the simulated testnet, including Protocol Fees, Network Gas Fees, KYT fees and KYC Fees. All simulated fees are paid from the Panther Gas account in tZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>AMM Refilling with Protocol Fees<br>Simulated protocol fees collected during the testing will be deposited into the AMM’s pool of tZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Limited Subsidy Rewards<br>The production (mainnet) version of Panther Protocol will include a feature that will allow to introduce additional rewards to partially or fully compensate costs like Network Gas Cost, KYC, KYT and Miner fees, in service of encouraging use of the platform. Stage 6 of our testnet simulates this feature for testing purposes. </p><p>Note: This feature is designed to cover only tZKP-nominated fees, and will not involved test MATIC or other native test network tokens unless using the relayer service.</p><p>Note: As the protocol developer, Panther Ventures Limited is resuming the testnet after re-deployment on Amoy. Panther Protocol Foundation is finalizing the details of the reward mechanism and will ensure that testers are rewarded proportionally to their efforts and we expect all incentives will be distributed via airdrop. This blog will be updated with more specifics in the coming days.</p> <p>Disclaimer</p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, tZKP, tzZKP, tPRP, test MATIC, and any other tokens mentioned in this announcement or within the product are for testing purposes only and have no economic value, nor can they be exchanged for value.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation on our incentivized Testnet versions may result in you earning rewards, but such credits are not represented on any blockchain as tokens.</p>

         Overview 
<p>This document will outline the various changes that were introduced with the 1.4 update. It will provide a list of areas you should be aware of and also instructions on how to update your forger with new capabilities.</p>
<p>In version 1.4, we’ve improved the usability of the staking system at the protocol level by automating the reward distribution among the forger hosting provider and the ZEN holders who stake their ZEN to the forger node. Forgers are now able to designate a smart contract that will allow delegators to claim rewards. The percentage of the forger’s incomes redirected to the smart contract will be declared by each forger when first registering.</p>
<p>Horizen will provide a factory contract that can be used to distribute rewards to forgers, although any contract can be used. The smart contract provided will distribute rewards proportionally to delegators according to the amount they stake. </p>
<p>Version 1.4 also introduces a minimum staking requirement (10 ZEN)&nbsp; to forgers for security best practices.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that no changes need to be made by existing forger nodes, 100% of the forger incomes will continue being sent to the reward address specified by the forger as it does currently. Otherwise, you can designate a smart contract for reward distribution (instructions provided within this document).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EON 1.4 hardfork will happen on Thursday, June 27th at Epoch 1593 (16:55pm UTC)</p>

 Changes in Stakes Management 
<p>Please review the following information to understand the changes that occurred with this update. This is important for those of you running forger nodes as some functionality has changed.</p>
<p>A new native smart contract will be available to manage stake-related operations. It will be available at the address 0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222333. Full documentation <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/nativesc/contracts/ForgerStakesV2.md">of its interface can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The old smart contract exposed at address 0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222222 will be deprecated and all its methods will error if called after the 1.4 hardfork.</p>

 Deploying the Factory Contract to EON for Distribution 
<p>Horizen provides a default implementation of a smart contract handling the redistribution of rewards between forger’s delegators.</p>
<p>If you want to deploy one for your forger:</p>
 
 
 
 Go to the factory contract available on the explorer: <a href="https://eon-explorer.horizenlabs.io/address/0x8604Bb903B7D54F666bA1e75f98045345C63132a">https://eon-explorer.horizenlabs.io/address/0x8604Bb903B7D54F666bA1e75f98045345C63132a</a> 
 Select the Contract tab. 
 Select the Write Contract tab. 
 Connect your wallet. 
 Use the method deployDelegatedStakingReferenceImplementation of the factory:
 
 The required parameters that identify your forger are:
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfKey 
 
 Note that this is split in between two parameters: one for the first 32 bytes and another for the last btye. This is because the vrfkey is 33 bytes of data.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Once the parameters are entered click the Write button. The method execution will trigger the deployment of the smart contract instance.&nbsp; 
 Take note of its address: you will need it in the forger registration step. 
 
 
 
 
 &nbsp; 
 
<p>For further info, you can read the full tutorial on how to setup a forger node here: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/tutorials/forger_node_setup_guide">https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/tutorials/forger_node_setup_guide</a></p>
<p>If you want to look at the code of the delegated staking contract, it is available at this address: <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon-delegated-staking">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon-delegated-staking<br></a></p>
<p>This factory contract was audited by Halborn for security best practices. </p>
 Forger Registration and Setting Smart Contract for Distribution of Rewards 
<p>The instructions below are all steps required when setting up a new forger node. If you already have a node, you only need to (optionally) follow Step 2 to assign an EON smart contract for reward distribution.</p>
 Step 1: Registration of&nbsp; Forgers 
<p>Each forger must now register before being able to participate in the lottery and receive stake delegations. This is an additional step compared to the actual flow (so far, was enough to create an initial stake).</p>
<p>The registration can be performed by calling&nbsp; a new http endpoint on the forger node:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/api/transaction/registerForger.md">/transaction/registerForger</a></p>
<p>The method will accept the following parameters:</p>
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfPubKey 
 rewardShare 
 smartContractAddress 
 stakedAmount 
 
<p>(see above link for further info)</p>
<p>Please note that rewardShare and smartContractAddress once set are considered immutable and can’t be changed later&nbsp; (to use different values a forger would have to register new keys, and ask the delegators to unstake+stake to the new key).</p>
 Step 2: Update of a Forger Already Present Before EON 1.4 
<p>Forgers already present before EON 1.4 will not require an explicit registration described in Step 1: they will be automatically migrated and registered.</p>
<p>But please note that if they own a total stake (own + delegated)&nbsp; &lt; 10 ZEN&nbsp; they will no longer be able to forge any block after the 1.4 hardfork activation, and you will need to increase the stake to 10 ZEN or more.</p>
<p>All migrated forgers will have the fields rewardShare = 0 and smartContractAddress&nbsp; = none, meaning they will not redirect any percentage of the reward to an additional smart contract (the same behavior happens in old EON versions).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A method to update these fields is available in the http endpoints:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/api/transaction/updateForger.md">/transaction/updateForger</a></p>
<p>The method will accept the following parameters:</p>
 
 signPubKey 
 vrfPubKey 
 rewardShare 
 rewardAddress 
 
<p>(see above link for further info)</p>
<p>Please note this method can be called only once and only if their value is equal to: (rewardShare=0, smartContractAddress=null). In other words,&nbsp; rewardShare and smartContractAddress once set are considered immutable and&nbsp; can’t be changed (to use different values a forger would have to register new keys, and ask the delegators to unstake+stake to the new key).</p>
<p>Important: for security reasons the updateForger operation will be doable only starting from two consensus epochs after the hard fork activation (25 hours).</p>
 Step 3: Collect Stakes 
<p>Similar to the actual smart contract, the new native smart contract will expose methods to delegate stake to a forger and withdraw them.</p>
<p>delegate(bytes32 signPubKey, bytes32 vrf1, bytes1 vrf2)</p>
<p>The method will fail if the forger was not previously registered (remember forgers existing before the hard fork activation will be considered registered by default).</p>
<p>withdraw(bytes32 signPubKey, bytes32 vrf1, bytes1 vrf2, uint256 amount)</p>
<p>The owner of the stake must be the one sending the tx.</p>
<p>Enough stake must exist, but now will be possible also to partially withdraw the stake.</p>
<p>Amount unstaked will be sent back to the sender balance.</p>
<p>Please note that with the new system the stake handling is simplified, since:</p>
 
 There is no more the concept of “stakeId”. A stake is now just an amount associated with a specific forger and delegator address, that can be incremented or decremented over-time with multiple delegate and withdrawal operations.&nbsp; 
 No additional signatures other than the standard Ethereum-like transaction signature will be required to call delegate and withdraw methods: this allows them to be called easily also from hardware wallets like Ledger. 
 
 Step 4: Reward Calculation&nbsp; 
<p>The same algorithm&nbsp; will be applied at the end of each withdrawal epoch to reward forgers, but the amount previously sent to the forger address will be split in two parts if the rewardShare specified by the forger is &gt; 0.</p>
<p>An additional change has been also implemented in the:</p>
 
 Endpoints /block/getFeePayments&nbsp; 
 RPC endpoint zen_getFeePayments 
 
<p>Their result will keep the same format as now, but will also include the reward paid to the address of the smart contracts (if defined).</p>
<p>We will also detail the amount coming from the mainchain redistribution: to be retrocompatible they will be into additional fields valueFromMainchain and valueFromFees:</p>
<p></p>
 Step 5: Claim of Delegators Rewards 
<p>The amounts directed to the smart contract will have to be redistributed among delegators through the contract. Distribution is the responsibility of the contract implementation. Horizen’s contract provides a fair distribution based on the amount staked and epoch of staking. The default smart contract implementation provided by Horizen exposes a claim method to do it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>claimReward(address owner)</p>
<p>Note that anyone could call the claim method on behalf of the owner (no restrictions on the sender of the transaction).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Documentation on the factory contract is located here: <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0/doc/howto/delegatedstakingcontract.md">https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/development/doc/howto/delegatedstakingcontract.md</a></p>
<p>Any forger is free to deploy its own smart contract. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/eon/blob/1.4.0-RC1/doc/nativesc/contracts/ForgerStakesV2.md">native smart contract documentation</a> for useful methods that could be used inside the smart contract logic.</p>
 Reward from Mainchain – New Rules 
<p>The maximum ZEN amount redistributed to forgers from the special address 0x000000000000000000003333333333333333333 in a single withdrawal epoch is now limited to a maximum value expressed by the following formula:</p>
 
 
<p>MAX_VALUE_REDISTRIBUTED = sum [10% of Mainchain’s block-reward Coinbase of each mainchain block reference included in the withdrawal epoch]</p>
 
 
<p>Funds over the limit will stay in the address balance and will be redistributed in the following epochs.</p>
 
 
<p>For example:<br>Current Mainchain block reward: 6.25 ZEN<br>Number of mainchain block-reference in a withdrawal epoch: 100<br>MAX_VALUE_REDISTRIBUTED = 10%(6.25) * 100 = 62.5 ZEN</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>In this blog post, we’re excited to present a comprehensive list of updates made in May that didn’t make it into the Alexandria update. While these changes may seem minor, we believe in transparency and the importance of highlighting even the smallest tweaks to our application to enhance user experience.</p><p>First on the list is a fix to the bridge button, addressing instances where it would mysteriously “gray out” without warning. Additionally, we’ve streamlined the process by adding sSCRT support on the Shade Bridge page, simplifying the management of SCRT and sSCRT balances. Another significant change includes filtering the swap dropdown by user balances, eliminating the need for manual scrolling.</p><p>Furthermore, we’ve introduced toast notifications on the Shade bridge page to alert users when they lack sufficient gas for bridging operations. Excitingly, we’ve updated the SILK/SHD circulating supply in anticipation of the June 18th upgrade, alongside migrating the Shade API infrastructure to the latest version of Secret Network post successful mainnet&nbsp;upgrade!</p><p>Other improvements include fixing bugs on the portfolio page and updating data feeds for Quicksilver, Stride, and Persistence oracles in light of the Secret Network&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>While this technical rundown may seem brief, we aim to foster trust within the community by providing insight into the ongoing enhancements of the Syracuse upgrade (v0.1) on its journey towards the Shade Protocol private DeFi&nbsp;suite.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/alexandria-unveiled-shade-v2-1-607297bac97b">Alexandria Unveiled — Shade v2.1</a></p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the Syracuse v0.1 gets us one step closer to the launch of Alexandria — a significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Inspired by the legacy of ancient Alexandria and the valor of the Spartans, Shade Protocol stands as a beacon of innovation and financial autonomy in the decentralized landscape.</p><p>With its commitment to privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through Syracuse upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data. As the community eagerly anticipates the release of Alexandria and beyond, Shade Protocol remains dedicated to its mission of building an unstoppable, decentralized financial ecosystem for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io/">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p>

<p>Featured image: <a href="https://r2-collectibles.com/">R2-Rewards.com</a></p>



<p>So you’ve got a nice collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). After a few months, you have managed to amass a respectable amount of those little digital wonders. You might have been able to sell one or two, earning you enough for a couple of cups of coffee in your nearest franchised outlet. But as you take sips off that hard-earned coffee and browse through your NFT portfolio, you can’t help but wonder about the value hidden there, just waiting to be uncovered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question is, how to unlock the value in those NFTs?&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 NFT staking: definition 



<p>When they hear the word staking, most people think back to the old Hammer films, when the nefarious Dracula would meet his demise with a wooden stake through the heart. And yes, that is one traditional understanding of the word staking.&nbsp;But it’s 2022 now, and though Count Dracula still roams somewhere down the darkest halls of our dreams, staking now means something altogether more profitable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s digital context of NFTs, staking is sort of a game of investment/rewards. You commit (‘lock’) your NFTs into a platform or protocol for a set period, and you receive rewards (or other benefits) in exchange for such a commitment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Staking addresses one NFT’s inherent issue: liquidity. Remember, NFTs are tokenized assets that you can sell, trade, or, as we see in this article, stake for a yield. Staking enables earning passive income off your NFT portfolio while retaining ownership.</p>



<p></p>



 Fungible vs non-fungible: an explanation 



<p>For a long time, the concepts of fungibility and non-fungibility had been well outside the layman’s lexicon. But once NFTs entered public discourse, people began to learn more about what these concepts mean.</p>



<p>In short, fungibility means the possibility of using goods, items, or commodities interchangeably because they have the same value. Banknotes or coins, pieces of the same fruit, or a liter of petrol are good examples of fungibility.</p>



<p>Non-fungibility denotes uniqueness. Collectible items, including original oil paintings, baseball cards, art pieces, diamonds, and vintage cars can be considered non-fungible.</p>



<p>It is the latter concept that emerges as most interesting, as non-fungibility carries value, and it is a value that NFT staking unlocks.</p>

 NFT staking: how it works 



<p>Unlocking the value of your NFTs through staking is easier than you think. All you need is a crypto wallet and, well, NFTs. The more the better. Then, choose a protocol or a platform to stake your NFTs in, and wait for the rewards, which might be distributed daily, weekly, or in any other fashion. It really is that simple.</p>



<p>NFT staking is akin to yield farming, insofar as you lock a certain amount of wealth (NFTs in this case) and receive a certain percentage of rewards based on the amount staked, the period of time that the NFTS will be locked, and other parameters.</p>



<p></p>



 All about staking rewards 



<p>When you invest in traditional financial products (bonds, stocks, mutual funds, etc.), you expect your investment to produce a certain yield. Equally, the ultimate purpose of staking your NFTs is to get a return – a reward.</p>



<p>But this raises several questions: what kind of rewards do you get? And who issues those rewards?</p>



<p>If you purchase an investment bond, your reward at the end of the investment term will usually be money, a certain percentage based on the bond’s performance, length of investment, etc. The staking rewards system works similarly. You lock your stake in for a certain amount of time and you get rewards. Some platforms might offer a fixed amount, while others might give users different amounts, depending on how many people are participating, and the total size of the rewards pool.</p>



<p>And who pays these rewards? Well, the platform or protocol where you stake your NFTs. Normally, an algorithm would calculate the due rewards based on specified parameters, and the rewards would be deposited into your account at the agreed intervals. Now, what these rewards are, depends on the protocol or platform. Sometimes, you get the platform’s native tokens, other times you get tokens that you can exchange for fiat, and certain protocols issue tokens that can only be used within their own environment (a gaming platform, for example). Always check the terms and conditions when you sign up so you know exactly what rewards you will get, and how often.</p>



<p></p>



 Risk versus Reward 



<p>As with most financial endeavors, returns are never guaranteed and are not entirely without risk. If you put up collateral it means you risk losing that. In the case of a staking system, there are often 2 things to keep in mind. First of all, in most staking systems you will need to purchase a staking key to get started. Buying the key can be seen as an entrance fee to the platform and there are often a variety of keys, ranging from cheap and small ones to big and expensive keys. Of course, you hope to earn your investment into the key back but this is never guaranteed.</p>



<p>Another risk is that the staking platform can be hacked and you may lose your NFTs since they’re not in your custody anymore. While the right permissions setup (along with responsible project owners) can drastically reduce this risk, hacks are and will always be a risk for platforms holding considerable amounts of value.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>NFT staking is a subset of the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It is a relatively new practice in the space, but there already are several NFT management companies that offer staking services, including Zaisan, which launched a <a href="https://r2-rewards.com/">staking platform in collaboration with R2</a>. While there is an inherent risk to using and creating a staking platform, this risk can be minimised by choosing the right partners and using secure setups.</p>



<p>All in all, staking is just another cool utility of NFTs, which are proving to be rather versatile assets that break new ground almost every day.</p>

One of the greatest hurdles in modern science is access to research funding, and DeSci aims to provide a solution through decentralised crowdfunding. In addition, IP rights are incontestably attributed with the help of blockchain technology, as they cannot be altered at a later date.

Drawing parallels between the early public oversight of television and the current state of the internet, Frank highlights the commodification of our data and identities online. He advocates for new protocols and a movement inspired by historical fights against oppression to secure genuine data rights and agency online. As we look to the future, Project Liberty's endeavors may play a crucial role.

<p>NFT Community management can help ensure the smooth operation of non-fungible token (NFT) communities and their future development in <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">Web3</a>. The idea is to keep track of community events and developments while keeping the community organised and cohesive toward the project goal. Community management can help to resolve disputes and to show empathy to digital asset owners. Nevertheless, NFT holders are, in essence, shareholders of the project. NFT community management is becoming increasingly more important as Web3 communities grow, and with a strong community, anything is possible.</p>



<p></p>



 Quick refresh: what is an NFT (community)? 



<p>The management of NFT communities is a critical but often overlooked aspect of developing and deploying these digital assets. NFTs are unique tokens on a blockchain that can represent ownership of digital or physical assets. In contrast to fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller units, NFTs are non-divisible. Due to their rarity or uniqueness, they are ideal for representing items like art, collectibles, or in-game items with monetary value.</p>



<p>NFT communities are flourishing online spaces where people with a shared interest in NFTs can connect with one another. As the popularity of NFTs continue to grow, as does the number of people flocking to these communities in search of information, advice, and support.</p>







<p></p>



 Why NFT community management is essential 



<p>With a wide range of people with different levels of knowledge and expertise, NFT community management can be a challenge. It is important to strike a balance between providing content that is both informative and accessible to all while avoiding overwhelming newcomers with too much information.</p>



<p>While the technical aspects of creating and deploying NFTs are essential, it is equally important to have a well-managed community around the project. This is because NFTs are often bought and sold in online communities. The success of an NFT project depends on the strength of these communities. For example, an NFT gaming organisation needs players to enjoy the game enough<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> to transact in-game assets</a> with one another.</p>



<p>A good NFT community will contain a variety of content that covers the basics of what NFTs are and how they work. Additionally, it includes more in-depth articles and discussions for those with a more advanced understanding. It is also essential to have a protocol for moderating content and managing users to keep the community respectful and welcoming to all. One way is by establishing rules and best practices written on communication channels or creating a tutorial page for newcomers.</p>



<p>With the right mix of content and community management, NFT communities can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in this exciting technology. It can be a fun entry point to the Web3 world!</p>



<p></p>



 3 Tips to create a strong foundation for your NFT Community 



<p>There are a few things that project owners should keep in mind when managing their NFT communities.</p>



 1. Constantly remind people of your vision 



<p>Have a clear vision and communicate constantly with your members. This way, you can keep everyone on the same page and working towards the same goals. Let’s take, for example, an NFT online chess game that allows users to interact with in-game assets and transact them. This creates a <a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-Earn (P2E) model</a>. The NFT game envisions creating a community where chess players can enjoy the game while earning rewards in the form of digital assets, NFTs and cryptocurrency. It is therefore necessary for a weekly content plan to include benefits and positive facts about NFT online chess, to create rapport and build trust in the project as more players join.</p>



 2. Active moderation is key 



<p>The project ambassadors should be active in the community and should engage with community members regularly. This is essentially getting more experienced people in the community to become a moderator. They should be the ones who are zealously advocating for the project. However, a community manager is needed to push content forward and stay attentive to the market needs.</p>



 3. Get people involved in decision-making 



<p>Finally, it is vital to have a community-centred approach to decision-making. This means that the community should be involved in decisions about the project, such as what features to add or what direction to take the project in. This will lead the project to a democratic system. The funds spent on NFTs are being directed to the project development from a shared decision-making perspective. In practice, this can be done through a voting system or members’ livestream meetings with the project owner.</p>

The Spartan&nbsp;Creed<blockquote>In the digital realm, where Spartans&nbsp;roam,</blockquote><blockquote>We rise, united, to defend our&nbsp;own.</blockquote><blockquote>With shields of privacy, and spears of autonomy,</blockquote><blockquote>We march forth, in steadfast sovereignty.</blockquote><blockquote>Guardians of data, warriors of&nbsp;finance,</blockquote><blockquote>In every byte, we take a&nbsp;stance.</blockquote><blockquote>Our information is not for&nbsp;sale,</blockquote><blockquote>Our sovereignty is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our dignity is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our autonomy is not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our property rights are not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>Our souls are not for&nbsp;sale</blockquote><blockquote>For we are Spartans, hearts&nbsp;aflame,</blockquote><blockquote>In the digital realm, we stake our&nbsp;claim.</blockquote><p>Greetings Spartans,</p><p>The origin of the Shade Spartans is a simple tale — to be a staunch advocate of privacy and freedom inevitably puts you in the crosshairs of those who see our claims to digital sovereignty as a threat to their power. There are those who believe people must be protected at every turn. That security should be prioritized above the human experiment of individualism and experimentation. The powers at be are leaving an entire generation chained to the burden of malicious (not all) regulation. Disdainful pen &amp; paper, stale and unromantic. Uninspired dead documents that stifle human ingenuity, and at worse, diminish&nbsp;it.</p><p>We Spartans.</p><p>We few, we chose&nbsp;few.</p><p>Pushed to the brink, night near&nbsp;extinct.</p><p>In the arena of the digital and physical world we lay it all on the line. We deeply value our dignity. We stake our future on the truth that there is no greater love than this: that a Shade Spartan would lay his security and freedom on the line to protect the future rights of his&nbsp;enemies.</p><p>You see, Spartans fight for the rights of those who oppress us. We fight to remove the chains from those that seek to place us in&nbsp;chains.</p><p>This is what it takes to be a city on a hill — a light in the darkness.</p><p>This is what it takes to have the moral high&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Your rights are our responsibility, no matter who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>We reject the notion that security should come at the expense of freedom, and we pledge to uphold the rights of all, regardless of creed or circumstance.</p><p>The Shade Spartans are inspired by three different sets of cultural icons. The first is Master Chief from the Halo video game series. We are aligned with the never surrender attitude, and embrace the story parallels of humanity versus the dark unknown. We stand against the forces at large that wish to seize and destroy all that makes us&nbsp;human.</p><p>A scene that particular resonates with Shade Spartans:</p><p>In this scene, Master Chief is given the choice: abandon his mission of protecting humanity, or disobey a direct order. He responds with a simple line: “No,&nbsp;sir.”</p><p>Shade Spartans are polite, but firm. Spartans have a backbone, and refuse to give an inch when it comes to commands to surrender our morals and principles.</p><p>Another Master Chief line that resonates with Shade Spartans is: “…asking is not my strong suite…” We are unapologetic about our rights, and we believe that we do not need to ask permission to build technology that protects and empowers our freedoms that are not granted by governments, but rather are inalienable rights that exist within all of humanity.</p><p>The second piece of culture we are inspired by is the ancient Greek civilization Sparta. The ancient Spartans were renowned for their distinctive values and way of life, which were deeply ingrained in their society and culture. Here’s a rundown of some of their key&nbsp;values:</p>  Military Excellence: Spartans placed paramount importance on military prowess and discipline. From a young age, Spartan boys underwent rigorous training in combat skills, endurance, and discipline, preparing them for a life dedicated to military&nbsp;service.  Discipline and Self-Control: Discipline was instilled in every aspect of Spartan life. Spartans were expected to exercise self-control and endure hardships without complaint. This discipline extended beyond the battlefield to everyday life, fostering a sense of self-mastery and resilience.  Courage and Bravery: Spartans revered courage and bravery above all else. Fearlessness in the face of danger, whether in battle or in daily life, was highly valued. Spartans were taught to confront challenges head-on and never back down from a&nbsp;fight.  Equality (among citizens): While Spartan society was hierarchical, with a clear distinction between citizens (Spartiates) and non-citizens (helots and perioikoi), within the citizen class, there was a degree of equality. All Spartiates, regardless of wealth or status, were expected to contribute to the defence of the state and adhere to the same rigorous standards.  Spartan Unity: Solidarity and unity were central to Spartan society. Spartans were taught to prioritize the needs of the community over individual desires, fostering a strong sense of camaraderie and loyalty among citizens.  Simplicity and Frugality: Spartans valued simplicity and frugality in their way of life. Material wealth and luxury were viewed with suspicion, and excess was discouraged. Spartans lived austere lives focused on the essentials, believing that hardship bred strength.  Education and Intellectual Development: While Spartan education primarily focused on physical training and military skills, intellectual development was also valued. Spartan youths were taught to read, write, and engage in philosophical discourse, albeit to a lesser extent than in other Greek city-states.  <p>We believe real change comes from a commitment to individual excellence combined with teamwork around winning battles at large. Your voice matters. Your action matters. How you conduct yourself matters. In isolation, you can achieve a little. Combined in a phalanx of fellow privacy advocates, we become unstoppable. Shade Spartans believe that actions speak louder than words in an era where words are cheap, ideas are manufactured, and where discourse is often controlled.</p><p>The third piece of culture we are inspired by is the modern cypherpunk movement. The modern cypherpunk movement is a decentralized community of individuals who advocate for the use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies to promote individual freedoms and protect against surveillance and censorship. Emerging in the late 20th century, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, the cypherpunk movement was heavily influenced by the rapid advancement of digital technologies and the growing concerns over government surveillance and control in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>At its core, the cypherpunk movement emphasizes the importance of privacy, anonymity, and encryption as fundamental human rights in the digital era. Cypherpunks believe that individuals should have the ability to communicate, transact, and interact online without fear of eavesdropping, censorship, or manipulation by governments, corporations, or other third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Key principles of the modern cypherpunk movement&nbsp;include:</p>  Privacy: Cypherpunks assert that privacy is essential for maintaining personal autonomy and freedom of expression. They advocate for the widespread adoption of encryption tools and privacy-enhancing technologies to protect individuals’ digital privacy from intrusive surveillance.  Cryptography: Cryptography is seen as a powerful tool for securing communications, transactions, and digital identities. Cypherpunks promote the development and use of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of online interactions.  Decentralization: Centralized systems are viewed as vulnerable to censorship, surveillance, and control. Cypherpunks advocate for decentralized technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks, which distribute power and control among a network of participants, reducing the influence of centralized authorities.  Anonymity: Anonymity allows individuals to communicate and transact online without revealing their identities or personal information. Cypherpunks support the use of anonymous communication tools, such as Tor and anonymous cryptocurrencies, to protect against surveillance and maintain privacy&nbsp;online.  Freedom of Information: Cypherpunks believe in the free flow of information and oppose censorship and restrictions on access to knowledge and expression. They advocate for the use of encryption to bypass censorship and promote the dissemination of information without interference from authorities.  Open Source: Open-source software is considered essential for transparency, security, and trust in digital systems. Cypherpunks support the development and use of open-source encryption tools and privacy-enhancing technologies to empower individuals and communities to protect their digital&nbsp;rights.  <p>The modern cypherpunk movement continues to evolve and adapt to new technological challenges and societal issues. With the rise of surveillance capitalism, government surveillance programs, and online censorship, cypherpunks remain committed to defending individual privacy and promoting digital freedom in an increasingly interconnected world.</p> Mint Details — May 30th,&nbsp;2024 <p>The launch of the legendary 300 Spartans is set for May 30th, 2024 on Stashh in advance of the June 18th, Alexandria Shade Protocol&nbsp;upgrade.</p><blockquote>WL sale: 50 $SILK<br>Public sale: 65&nbsp;$SILK</blockquote><p>The proceeds will be&nbsp;split:</p><blockquote>50% buying back $SHD from the market<br>50% will be used to provide liquidity for the $SHD &lt;&gt; $SILK&nbsp;pool.</blockquote><p>These proceeds will increase trading liquidity and support $SHD token’s utility within the Cosmos ecosystem.</p><p>Curious on how to join the whitelist?

<p>The massive success of the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETF showed tremendous interest from large institutional players. Even despite negative takes in public appearances, behind the curtain, more and more ‘smart money’ accumulate $BTC, either directly or through ETF shares. The same is to be expected for Ethereum, yet uncertainty still looms due to its proof-of-stake consensus model and, ultimately, staking yield.

<p>Imagine a group of small islands dotted around an area of an ocean. Each island has a small settlement of people, going about their business and living as best they know how. But there’s a problem. One island has wood but little food. They can build rudimentary huts but can scarcely eat. Their closest island has plenty of food but no wood, so they lack shelter. A third island has wood and food but no hay for their animals. Another island is brimming with hay but little coal to light fires. However, the island with the wood does have coal reserves. Then, one day, someone has an idea. Why not build bridges connecting all the islands so all the islanders can share resources? Soon, wood, food, coal, and hay are moving across the islands, and islanders’ business grows tenfold.</p>



<p>Now, imagine each of those islands is a blockchain. Each blockchain hosts a set of tokenised assets, which had remained confined to their blockchain. Why not build bridges across the blockchains so that assets can be easily shared and traded, similar to what the islanders did?</p>



<p></p>



 Cross-chain bridges: a simple solution to a big problem 







<p>In computing environments, some terms can be obscure and non-descript. That is not the case here. A cross-chain bridge does exactly what it says. It is a mechanism that enables the transfer of assets back and forth between two or more chains. Those assets can be tokens, cryptocurrencies, or any other tokenised assets hosted on the chains.</p>



<p>You might be wondering what sort of wizardry this is. Furthermore, you might question how it is possible to move assets between two chains whose protocols, rules, etc. might be completely different. These are valid questions, and here’s the answer. The bridge acts as a neutral zone (a no man’s land of sorts) where the switch occurs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example: two blockchain games, one hosted on an Ethereum chain, the second hosted on WAX. Ethereum uses a proof-of-work consensus protocol, while WAX uses a proof-of-stake one, each with its own set of rules. And each of these games has some cool in-game assets, maps, etc. Each game world features a thriving game economy and has something that the other gaming environment lacks (remember the islanders?) Why not connect the two chains with a bridge and enable asset swapping, so that both gaming worlds (and their in-game economies) expand and grow?</p>



<p></p>



 Exponential growth for GameFi and DeFi environments 



<p>Blockchain has yielded much disruption and innovation throughout its relatively short lifespan, and the <a href="https://zaisan.io/alien-worlds-cross-chain-bridge/">future</a> looks just as innovative and bright.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For some time, this technology has been associated with decentralised finance (DeFi). That is the provision of financial instruments without reliance on centralised intermediaries, such as banks, credit unions, or brokerages. The marriage between blockchain and DeFi has been a successful one,  fostering a new era of financial inclusivity and autonomy.<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/"> </a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">According to Statista</a><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1237821/defi-market-size-value-crypto-locked-usd/">,</a> there are currently billions held in DeFi environments, showcasing its widespread acceptance and potential for further growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But in more recent times, blockchain has spread its area of influence to gaming in the form of game finance (GameFi), combining cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other tokenised assets to create a gaming environment where players can play, trade, and earn.  This development provides players with true ownership of their in-game items and the ability to earn real-world value through gameplay.</p>



<p>The mechanics underlying GameFi are relatively simple. <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/">In-game assets are distributed in NFT form</a>, which guarantees ownership. This is key, as it enables the players to trade these assets as they see fit, sell them to other players, etc. And this is where cross-chain bridges come in. These two-way paths enable these assets to be moved from one chain to another, thus not only safeguarding the liquidity but also enhancing it by facilitating a wider marketplace. By doing this, the player pool grows exponentially, as players can participate in multiple gaming environments without being restricted by the boundaries of a single blockchain.</p>



<p>The same applies to DeFi environments, albeit without the gaming part. Users of different blockchains can have their assets exchanged on the bridge so they can be used on another blockchain. This is sometimes called ‘cross-chain swap.’ It is crucial for building a more interconnected and fluid blockchain ecosystem, where assets can freely move across different platforms, enhancing the user experience and broadening the scope of possibilities.</p>



<p></p>



 Cross-chain bridging with Zaisan 



<p>The benefits of multi-chain bridging are clear. The islanders knew it, and now you know too. Scalability, portability, and a massively expanded user or player pool are just the tip of the iceberg. These advancements signify a shift towards a more integrated, versatile, and user-centric blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it promises to unlock even more innovative applications and opportunities, potentially transforming industries beyond finance and gaming, such as supply chain management, healthcare, and beyond. The journey of blockchain from a novel digital ledger to a bedrock of digital innovation illustrates its immense potential and the myriad of possibilities it holds for the future.</p>



<p>Zaisan is a multi-discipline blockchain services provider, including<a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/bridge"> cross-chain bridging hosting</a>. Among many other features, Zaisan offers the possibility of swapping tokens between Binance Smart Chain (BSC), WAX, and Ethereum.</p>

<p>This article explores the critical role of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and other advanced privacy tools in safeguarding user privacy within the burgeoning Web3 landscape, addressing the inherent transparency of blockchain technology and introducing next-generation solutions for scalable, privacy-focused blockchain applications.&nbsp;</p><p>Although blockchain’s benefits are undeniable, the decentralized and immutable nature of open blockchain’s record-keeping creates unique privacy challenges. Blockchain's transparency means that transactions are permanently recorded and viewable by anyone. While this promotes trust and accountability, it also poses significant risks to personal privacy if identities can be linked to public addresses and can expose trading strategies for professional investors and other successful traders. Additionally, integrating decentralized applications (dApps) with these technologies further complicates the privacy landscape, as user interactions on one platform can be traced across multiple platforms and transactions.</p><p>To address these privacy challenges, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) emerge as a potent solution, allowing transaction validation without compromising private data. ZKPs, such as<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/"> zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs</a>, are cryptographic methods that allow the validation of transactions without revealing any underlying data, playing a crucial role in maintaining privacy on the blockchain.</p><p>Beyond enhancing privacy, ZKP technology can be instrumental in DeFi contexts, where it ensures that financial transactions remain confidential yet verifiable, believed to be the key to fostering trust and participation in open financial ecosystems. The technology can make transactions more private, ensuring that while the integrity and rules of the transaction are publicly verifiable, the specifics of the amounts and the parties involved in the transaction remain private.</p><p>Relative to non-succinct privacy-preserving proofs, zk-SNARKs can make for more scalable projects compared with, for example, non-succint alternatives such as zk-STARKs. By enabling transaction validation without disclosing or processing extensive data on the blockchain, zk-SNARK technology can be implemented in ways that lessen the network burden. Ultimately the result is a more efficient blockchain, potentially increasing transaction throughput and enhancing overall performance.</p> Other privacy-preserving technologies <p>While ZKPs are pivotal, a broad array of privacy-preserving technologies, including Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multi-Party Computation that are available for Web3 developers:</p>  ​​Homomorphic encryption: Enables computations on encrypted data, ensuring data privacy even during processing.  Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC): Allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their inputs private.  Decentralized identifiers (DIDs): DIDs allow individuals to control and verify their identity independently of a central authority, enhancing privacy and control over personal identity data.  Blockchain sharding: Although its primary function is to help scale networks, by dividing the entire blockchain into smaller partitions known as shards, privacy is enhanced by limiting the data each node can access.  Differential privacy: Integrating differential privacy techniques into blockchain applications can add noise to aggregated data, making it difficult to identify individual users while maintaining the utility of the data.  Confidential smart contracts: Leveraging cryptographic techniques to execute smart contracts confidentially ensures that the data within these contracts is not exposed to other network participants.   Tools for enhancing privacy in Web3 <p>The development of these foundational technologies paves the way for practical, user-facing privacy tools in Web3, ranging from enhanced wallets to comprehensive on-chain and off-chain solutions. Some of these tools include:</p>  Privacy-enhancing wallets: These wallets integrate features like stealth addresses and ring signatures to conceal user identities.  On-chain privacy protocols: On-chain privacy protocols like the one Panther Protocol is developing will use zk-SNARK and other privacy technologies to conduct private transactions on public blockchains while preserving privacy.  Off-chain privacy solutions: Off-chain solutions like the Lightning Network for Bitcoin or Raiden Network for Ethereum help scale transactions off the main chain while improving privacy by reducing the on-chain footprint.  Data protection tools: Tools like NuCypher use proxy re-encryption and SMPC to secure shared data among multiple participants without exposing the raw data to external parties.   Conclusion <p>Web3 aims to revolutionize online interactions by emphasizing privacy and control over personal data, while still maintaining the inherent benefits that transparent blockchain technology brings.

 Alexandria Unveiled — Shade&nbsp;v2.1 <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/</a><p>Greetings community,</p><p>At Shade Protocol we build Unstoppable Finance — a world of DeFi that is globally accessible, censorship resistant, privacy-preserving, and easy to use. We believe that privacy is the key to unlocking the full value of a decentralized future. Without privacy, we fail to achieve what DeFi is fully capable&nbsp;of.</p><blockquote>Your Money.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Data.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Decisions.</blockquote><p>Shade Protocol has existed for 2+ years — collectively achieving over $350M+ of trading volume on ShadeSwap, 40M+ TVL (at peak), with thousand of daily smart contract interactions.</p><p>As referenced in <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/the-preamble-road-to-easy-private-defi-b5852fd4e3a2">The Preamble — Road to Easy Private DeFi</a> we have set our eyes on making Shade Protocol the easiest to use private DeFi in all of Web3. Additionally, after much user feedback we have decided to begin bundling multiple features and utilities into single upgrades, empowering upgrade packages to be more meaningful and easier to explain to&nbsp;users.</p> The Upgrade <blockquote>ALEXANDRIA Upgrade will be released June 18th, 2024 at 8:00 pm. GMT&nbsp;+0</blockquote> 1. Analytics Tab - (TVL, Volume, # of trades, fees accrued, PoL, etc.)<br>2. Prices Tab - (historical candlestick charts / line charts / etc.)<br>3. dSHD - (private liquid staking for SHD)<br>4. Silk Analytics V2 - (SILK peg performance, basket performance, etc.)<br>5. New pools - (dSHD/USDC, dSHD/SHD, etc.)<br>6. New SILK collaterals <br>7. Shade Spartan NFTs <p>The next upgrade after Alexandria will be released September 18th, 2024. The name of the next upgrade bundle has yet to be revealed, nor has its features.</p> Analytics Overhaul Early stages of Silk Analytics V2<p>Across the Shade Protocol suite there are countless pieces of protocol data forming a story that has been previously untold. Information such as Silk collateral backing, peg performance data, protocol wide TVL, volume, # of trades, historical staking APY, etc. The Alexandria Upgrade represents a massive leap forward in visual storytelling — representing half a year of infrastructure overhaul empowering in app story telling that will provide the information and data users need to make informed decisions.</p><p>One of the key principles that drive Shade Protocol design decisions is a simple modicum: “…don’t make the user leave the&nbsp;app…”</p><p>As we investigated where users are spending their time to make decisions, we realized that block explorers and Coingecko are the two destinations where many users camp out. With the release of the Shade Protocol transaction history, one of these problem was solved (block explorer).</p><p>This left us with the need to create an in-app Coingecko esque experience:</p>Early stage implementation…imagine mainnet / June&nbsp;18th<p>You can expect with the release of Alexandria to have the ability to seamlessly scroll through price charts &amp; price tables similar to Coingecko — empowering you to make decisions on the fly without needing to open another&nbsp;tab.</p><p>One could even imagine what an overhauled ShadeSwap experience could like in the future with these new features intertwined.</p> dSHD — Private $SHD Liquid&nbsp;Staking <p>One of the key decisions users have had to choose while interacting with Shade Protocol is between the choice to stake or become a liquidity provider with their SHD tokens. With the launch of dSHD, users will be able to enjoy yield from both liquidity providing &amp; from staking — unlocking new DeFi strategies and flexibility previously impossible.</p><p>dSHD represents the first ever LST for a natively private token; yet another first for Shade Protocol. You can expect major pools to be spun up such&nbsp;as:</p>  dSHD /&nbsp;SHD  dSHD/ USDC.noble  <p>Additionally, Shade Protocol is looking to integrate dSHD into a variety of other DeFi protocols throughout the Cosmos — setting up SHD to become the apex private omnichain asset.</p> Ancient Greek&nbsp;Theme <p>The parallels between Greek society, the historical city of Alexandria, and the ethos of Shade Protocol are intriguing and rich with significance. Just as ancient Greece was a hub for innovation, philosophy, and intellectual exchange, Alexandria stood as a beacon of knowledge, blending cultures and fostering groundbreaking advancements in various fields.

<p>In today’s episode, Matt Prewitt engages in a thought-provoking dialogue with Tahir Amin, the Co-Founder and CEO of the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge (I-MAK). Together, they delve into the history of the patent and trademark systems – flaws and all, especially within the pharmaceutical realm. Tahir, drawing from his experience as a former intellectual property lawyer turned reform advocate, sheds light on how these systems have been manipulated by large corporations to prolong monopolies rather than foster invention. He proposes substantial reforms to address these systemic issues, advocating for a fundamental restructuring of the patent system. This insightful conversation highlights the complexities and challenges within the patent system and the quest for a more just and equitable approach to intellectual property.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://www.i-mak.org/">I-MAK</a>  <a href="https://www.wto.org/">World Trade Organization (WTO)</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Seattle_WTO_protests">"Battle of Seattle" | 1999 Seattle WTO protests</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_patent_law">History of patent law - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://lawliberty.org/forum/why-intellectual-property-rights-a-lockean-justification/">Why Intellectual Property Rights?

        <p>This quick guide is meant to help you go over the simple steps to vote on ZenIPs.</p> FAQ <p>1. How much voting power do I have?</p><p>Your voting power is a sum of the following criteria:</p>  $ZEN in your EON wallet.  $ZEN in your linked mainchain wallet.  The total amount of $ZEN that was delegated to forger nodes from your EON Wallet.  <p>Please note that Horizen uses Snapshot for voting. This means that your voting power will be a total of the items above at a specific block height on EON. If token values change after that specified block height it will not be included in your voting power.&nbsp;</p><p>2. How do I link my mainchain wallet to my EON address?&nbsp;</p><p>Being that many users prefer to keep their $ZEN on Horizen’s mainchain we’ve made it possible to vote on proposals while keeping $ZEN on the mainchain. Please use the following guide to link your mainchain and EON addresses: <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Do I have to do anything if I stake $ZEN to a forger node to vote on proposals?</p><p>No. As long as you are using the same wallet which was used to delegate stake, your voting power will include all $ZEN that is staked to forger nodes.</p> How do I vote on ZenIPs using my staked $ZEN? <p>Voting is done on Snapshot using Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p>    Go to the Horizen Foundation Snapshot page: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth</a>  Make sure to join the Horizen Foundation as a member on Snapshot.&nbsp;    Connect your wallet.  Choose a proposal you would like to vote on.  Read through the proposal and look at the possible voting options.&nbsp;  Select a choice, you will be asked to sign a message with your wallet to vote on the proposal (this does not incur any gas fees).    <p>We look forward to the continuous participation of our community and stay tuned as many exciting things are on the Horizen!</p>

<p>As businesses and organisations continue growing and expanding, prioritising environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important. One way to do this is by implementing blockchain technology into your business. Let’s dive deeper!</p>



<p></p>



 Why Your Business Should Adopt Blockchain for Environmental Sustainability 



<p>Blockchain is a decentralised digital ledger. Blockchain technology allows for the secure recording and verification of transactions without a central authority. This technology can potentially revolutionise how businesses operate, namely by making them more environmentally friendly. By using blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your business can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future. Outside of the obvious benefits for the environment, it can also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/02/10/why-corporate-strategies-should-be-focused-on-sustainability/?sh=604551947e9f">help propel your business forward in different ways.</a></p>



<p></p>



 How Blockchain Can Help Your Business Go Green 



<p>Multiple ways exist in which blockchain technology can help your <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">business go green</a>. Summarised below are some of the main ways in which blockchain technology can make an impact:</p>



 
 Tracking and verifying environmentally responsible practices 



 Facilitating the exchange of renewable energy 



 Blockchain-powered waste management systems 



 Creating and managing carbon credits 
 



 Using Blockchain To Track and Verify Environmentally Responsible Practices 



<p>One way that blockchain can help is by enabling the tracking and verification of environmentally responsible practices. For example, by using blockchain technology, a supply chain can track the origin and journey of products, ensuring that they are produced using sustainable methods.</p>



<p>This level of transparency can help consumers make more informed choices about the products they purchase. Moreover, it encourages businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices to maintain their reputation. Additionally, the use of blockchain can help businesses detect and prevent fraud, such as the sale of counterfeit or environmentally damaging products.</p>



<p>In this way, blockchain can help promote environmental responsibility and sustainability within the business community. By enabling more transparent and accountable business practices, blockchain technology can support the development of a more sustainable and environmentally friendly economy.</p>



 Facilitating the Exchange of Renewable Energy Using Blockchain 



<p>Blockchain can also be used to facilitate the exchange of renewable energy. It ensures renewable energy can be tracked, traded, and sold securely and transparently. This can help create a more efficient and reliable renewable energy market, as well as enable individuals and businesses easy access and use renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the use of smart contracts on the blockchain can automate the process of buying and selling renewable energy. This makes it even more convenient and efficient. Overall, the use of blockchain in the renewable energy industry can greatly accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy system that is less reliant on fossil fuels.</p>



 Using Blockchain To Create and Manage Carbon Credits 



<p>Another way in which blockchain technology can help businesses become more environmentally friendly is by enabling the creation and management of carbon credits. Carbon credits are a way for businesses to offset their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects or other initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



Source:<a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/trading-and-supply/trading/shell-energy-europe/clean-energy-solutions/voluntary-carbon-credits.html"> Shell </a>



<p>Through blockchain, businesses can create and trade carbon credits transparently and securely. This allows for the efficient and cost-effective management of carbon emissions. It provides businesses with a way to offset their environmental impact. Furthermore, blockchain can help ensure the integrity and verifiability of carbon credits, making it easier for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.</p>



<p>Overall, the use of blockchain for carbon credit management can support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Therefore, it can help businesses reduce/offset their environmental impact.</p>



 Blockchain-Powered Waste Management Systems 



<p>In addition to the previous benefits, blockchain technology can also help improve supply chain efficiency, reducing waste and enabling more transparent and accountable business practices through creating decentralised waste management systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a decentralised waste management system, blockchain can be implemented to track and verify the disposal of waste materials. This can help to ensure that waste is disposed of sustainably and responsibly, reducing the environmental impact of waste. Additionally, one can use blockchain technology to incentivise sustainable waste disposal practices, such as recycling and composting. For example, businesses and individuals could be rewarded with tokens or other digital assets for properly disposing of waste.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of blockchain can help to improve the efficiency of waste management systems. By securely and transparently tracking waste materials, blockchain can help to reduce waste and prevent fraud, such as the illegal dumping of waste materials. Thus, aiding in making waste management systems more cost-effective and sustainable.</p>







<p></p>



 Blockchains Do Not Have To Consume Tons of Energy 



<p>But what about the energy consumption of blockchains in general? It is true that many blockchain protocols, such as the one used by the Bitcoin network, rely on energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanisms. This means that validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain requires a large amount of computing power. However, it is important to note that not all blockchain protocols operate this way.</p>



<p>There are also blockchain protocols that use different kinds of consensus mechanisms, such as the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is much more energy efficient. In a delegated proof-of-stake system, the token holders are constantly voting on “delegates”. The delegates who have the most votes at any certain point in time run the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>As a result, delegated proof-of-stake systems are much more energy-efficient and scalable than proof-of-work systems. They do not require a large amount of computing power to validate transactions. This makes them a more <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">environmentally friendly and viable option for businesses and organisations</a> that want to use public or private blockchains and require high scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Implementing blockchain technology into your enterprise may require significant investment and resources. However, the long-term benefits of environmental sustainability and improved efficiency are well worth the effort. By utilising blockchain to support eco-friendly practices and renewable energy, your enterprise can play a key role in creating a more sustainable future.</p>

<p></p><p>Improvement proposals are made to enhance an existing process, address a challenge, or create a new product or service. Their only goal is improvement. At Horizen we call them ZenIPs or EONIPs, depending on the blockchain to which they pertain. Since September 2023, they are voted on by the community</p>



 From improvement proposals to DAOs 



<p>Improvement proposals can be submitted by anyone in the community: team members, users, or community participants.</p>



<p>Improvement proposals have been part of Horizen’s governance since the project’s inception, but with the launch of Horizen DAO in 2023, public voting on ZenIPs afforded greater community participation in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ZenIP process embodies to the spirit of decentralized governance – anyone in the community can submit a proposal, and proposals require sufficient support from the community to be adopted.</p>



<p>However, it is incumbent upon community members to ensure that they have understand the improvement proposal process to wield this power responsibly. This article aims to help everyone understand that process.</p>



 Take part in Horizen 



<p>You have many ways to be included in the Horizen ecosystem. By deploying on <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">EON</a>, deploying on <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo/">Zendoo</a>, marking PRs on <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial">Github</a>, hosting a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/supernodes/">Super Node</a>, hosting or delegating a <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/staking/run_a_forger_node/">Forger Node</a>, etc.</p>



<p>You can also submit proposals, and vote on proposals already submitted. First, let’s see what you need to do to make a proposal.</p>



<p>The whole process is exhaustively published on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance">Horizen’s docs website</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2 kinds of proposals can be made:</p>



 
 Technical ZenIP/EONIP 



 Non-techinal ZenIP/EONIP 
 



<p>Technical proposals cover changes involving core technology or the governance of the Horizen DAO, and as such have higher thresholds for submitting proposals and achieving a vote quorum. Non-technical proposals cover everything else, such as grants or making agreements with third-party service providers.</p>



<p>The Horizen Foundation and its partners, such as Horizen Labs, can help build and scope the proposals but don’t need to develop the ideas themselves. If you are proposing a technical ZenIP, make sure you can develop the idea or have it developed after scoping the work.<br>Since <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440?u=manon">ZenIP 42401</a> passed in March 2024, the threshold and quorum are determined as the following:</p>



TypeThreshold (to post)Quorum (vote to pass)ExamplesTechnical100,000 ZEN&nbsp;<br>(previously 200,000)5%<br>(previously 10%)Removal of privacy, mainchain and sidechains improvementsNon-technical25,000 ZEN<br>(previously 100,000)3%<br>(previously 5%)Website branding, next meetups location, grant program



<p></p>



 What are the different phases from the idea to its implementation? 



<p></p>







<p>Phase 1: Proposal Idea and Research</p>



<p>Broadly speaking, the idea stage is intended to introduce an idea for a potential improvement proposal and gauge community sentiment. The idea stage is made of the first three phases of the ZenIP process.</p>



<p>In the first phase, a community member who has an idea for an improvement proposal should research it and verify whether the concept or similar proposals have previously been explored or suggested.</p>



<p>This phase places the onus entirely on the proposer(s). It is strongly advised to support the proposal with relevant sources whenever possible thoroughly.</p>



<p>Phase 2: Idea Modification</p>



<p>Once a proposer has confirmed that the idea has not been proposed and has completed sufficient research, they publish an idea on <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/zenip-discussion/6">Discourse</a>. We recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">ZenIP/EONIP template</a> for this phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phase 3: Community Feedback</p>



<p>Once an idea is posted on Discourse, the community provides feedback.&nbsp; This phase lasts a minimum of 7 days to ensure sufficient input from other community members. It is important to note that a ZenIP idea is just that – an idea – until put forth as a formal ZenIP.</p>



<p>Phase 4: Proposal Draft Creation</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_template.md">template</a>, the idea must be posted on Github or under the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/c/governance/8">“governance” section on Discourse</a>. In this phase the use of the template is mandatory. The proposal is on the DRAFT status.</p>



<p>Phase 5: Draft Review and Moderator Feedback</p>



<p>The person or people making the proposal have 30 days to answer any moderator’s questions, if any. This delay can be shortened by the moderators.</p>



<p>Phase 6: Administrative Review</p>



<p>The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-dao-voting-is-open-and-announces-inaugural-special-council-members/">Special Council</a> reviews the proposal, with a maximum of 3 revisions. The DAO Special Council can ask for more clarifications or additional information.</p>



<p>Phase 7: Voting</p>



<p>The vote takes place on <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a>, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting platform. You’ll need to follow up on the <a href="https://01470710.evm-documentation.pages.dev/governance/overview/constitution">threshold requirements</a> to post the proposal. The status is moved to PROPOSED.</p>



<p>Phase 8: Cooldown Period</p>



<p>A final 30 days phase commences. The proposal undergoes another review to confirm compliance with the Foundation’s Governing Documents and relevant laws.</p>



<p>Phase 9: Implementation</p>



<p>The idea becomes real. If the technical ZenIP/EONIP includes codes implemented on Github, the PR is merged. If the proposal is budget-related, the necessary funds are transferred. Status is either IMPLEMENTED or FINAL if the idea is also activated on the network.</p>



<p>Foundation moderators or DAO members must remain informed and involved throughout.</p>



<p>It’s possible to delegate voting power on Snapshot, when you publish the ZenIP IDEA or DRAFT, you can create a second topic to ask for delegated funds to post the proposal.</p>



 ZenIP naming convention 



<p>The revised ZenIP numbering conventions will use a format starting with “424” followed by two unique, sequential digits. Once the number 42499 is reached, the numbering will continue starting from 42500 onwards. This system ensures a cohesive and orderly sequence for all ZenIPs, maintaining a straightforward approach to their identification and categorization.</p>



<p>For the previous ZenIPs, editors used the following conventions when numbering ZenIPs:</p>



 
 All ZenIP numbers are prefixed with a 42 and followed by three digits. E.g. his very first ZenIP has the number 42000. 



 If a ZenIP directly corresponds to a BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) or ZIP (Zcash Improvement Proposal), the same number is used, but without the prefix “42”. 



 Process and Informational ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42000 to 42199. 



 Consensus ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42200 to 42399. 



 Standard Track ZenIPs will be assigned a number in the range 42400 to 42599. 



 ZenIPs that should or will be deployed together will be numbered consecutively (wherever possible), and in a coherent reading order. 
 



<p>These conventions are subject to change by a majority decision of the Editors.</p>



 Express yourself through the vote 



<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) and/or the Horizen EON chain (the EVM chain).</p>



<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>



<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is well configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>



<p>If you already linked your address for a previous vote, then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still advise you to verify if your mainchain address is well-linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>



<p>If your address is not linked, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-improvement-proposals-how-to-vote-tutorial/">follow the tutorial here</a>.</p>



<p>When linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.castelion.com/">Castelion</a> is a defense manufacturing company building the systems America and its partners need to keep liberal democracies safe and deter future wars. The company’s first product is a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) for the US Department of Defense. Traditional defense primes such as Lockheed &amp; Raytheon have failed to develop an HGV despite receiving billions of dollars per year in funding for the last 20 years. Meanwhile, China &amp; Russia have developed fully operational HGVs, emboldening them to expand their borders militarily.</p><blockquote>“To counter this growing threat, and to support democracy for generations to come, America’s defense industry needs new technologies, new manufacturing approaches, and new ideas to stay unequivocally ahead. That’s why we founded Castelion — a new kind of defense manufacturing company.”</blockquote><p>The Castelion team comes from SpaceX, where they made substantial contributions, including leading the development of Starlink &amp; Starshield, and billions of dollars in sales to governments.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Incumbent defense primes will be unable to attract the necessary talent to iterate fast enough to keep up with adversary nations on hypersonic glide vehicles. The SpaceX approach provides the best odds of liberal democracies catching up technologically while also providing venture-scale returns. If Castelion is successful at delivering a cost-effective HGV, they have the potential to apply its development methodology and team to more US Department of Defense capabilities and become a large standalone defense&nbsp;prime.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the Castelion team on their mission to build essential hypersonic deterrence systems to keep democracies safe.

<p>Did you miss Panther co-founder and CEO Oliver Gale’s presentation at last week’s ETHDam conference? Don’t worry, we have you covered.&nbsp;</p><p>The session, “Alpha Protection Through Privacy: A Web3 privacy primitive for DeFi,” explored the $2.6T problem of open blockchain privacy and Panther Protocol’s solution. A recap of the presentation follows.&nbsp;</p> Pseudonymity: A $2.6 trillion problem <p>Open ledgers are supposed to be a good thing. They help to ensure that users can’t commit fraud, prevent duplicate transactions, and more. All of these things are true and important, but until now, they have come at the expense of another basic human need: privacy. On pseudonymous blockchains, if a third party can link a wallet address to a user, they can follow, measure, and use the complete transaction history associated with that wallet address. Every transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>This is wrong. Although we recognize blockchain technology’s enormous benefits, financial privacy should be a fundamental human right.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s a huge problem. Of the approximately $2.6 trillion invested in crypto, all but a relatively tiny amount is on public blockchains.&nbsp;</p> Your Data is YOUR Data <p>The problem with pseudonymous blockchains goes beyond third parties monitoring your spending habits: your data is valuable– and it should be YOUR data. Europe’s <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> reflects a broader shift in how we perceive ownership of information. Just as it set a benchmark for consumer privacy and control, DeFi users should have ownership of their data both as a personal matter and because there is value in your data.&nbsp;</p><p>This is especially true for high-volume traders and institutions, who risk having others copy their trades, their “alpha,” and their strategy.&nbsp;</p> The “solution” created a new problem. <p>The reaction to this problem to date has been the creation of privacy protocols, which sever the link between wallet and on-chain public ledger, using a variety of technologies. Unfortunately, this causes a new problem: compliance hurdles. Tornado Cash is a prototypical example of how severing the link between the public chain and wallet alone is not a viable solution to privacy. Tornado Cash has been accused of facilitating money laundering and sanctioned by the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">U.S. Treasury</a>, among actions from other regulators. If DeFi is going to welcome a new era of mainstream adoption, it is clear that privacy protocols also need to enable compliance. In fact, regulators, including the U.S. Treasury have specifically <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">called this out as a market need</a>.&nbsp;</p> Market requirements for any solution <p>Greenfield Capital’s <a href="https://greenfield.xyz/2023/11/22/reviving-transaction-privacy/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Report on Reviving Transaction Privacy: Approaches To Combat Compliance And Usage Challenges</a> covers this exact issue. In the report, they recognize the enormous potential of removing a major obstacle to mainstream DeFi adoption by enabling compliance and privacy simultaneously. They state that any such solution would need to keep bad actors from abusing the system, especially through KYC, and that it would need to navigate regulatory ambiguity, given that regulatory requirements may vary from one jurisdiction to another, giving the Travel Rule as an example. The Travel Rule is a regulatory mandate by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization formed by the G7 to combat money laundering and terrorism financing, which requires cryptocurrency exchanges and other virtual asset service providers to share specific transaction details of the parties involved in transfers​.</p><p>Greenfield also points out that success for any protocol hinges on:&nbsp;</p>  Providing sufficient value relative to any fees associated with its use (keeping gas relatively low).  Ensuring there is a large enough anonymity set to keep transactions private.  Integration with existing DeFi protocols: Users are unlikely to use protocols that don’t enable use across the most popular tokens and chains.&nbsp;   Enter Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol will add a privacy layer to blockchain transactions and DeFi applications. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, including zkSNARKs, the protocol will provide users with the ability to preserve their privacy while also enabling them to disclose data to whoever they choose. Flagship features include:&nbsp;</p>  Preservation of privacy: Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a> technology will help to preserve your privacy by separating your transactions from the public ledger, safeguarding your identity.&nbsp;  Control over your data: Enable KYC validations without exposing your personal details. Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-example-explaining-zkps/">Zero-Knowledge proof</a>-based technology will let you choose exactly who can see your identity and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Panther’s DeFi adapters will facilitate seamless integration with existing DeFi protocols, ensuring privacy without sacrificing functionality and allowing users to engage with DeFi platforms while keeping their transactions private.  Decentralized Identity: Your zAccount will act as a decentralized ID that helps safeguard your personal details, allowing you to make crypto transactions while protecting your identity.  Modular and expandable: Zones will offer customization for asset lists, user lists, transaction limits, and DeFi application access.  <p>For more detailed information about Panther Protocol, please click <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-panther-protocol-and-why-it-exists-a3fd4470de55/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Competitive Landscape <p>Greenfield identifies 11 elements that can enable the solution to the issue of privacy in blockchain. Panther’s model includes all of these, with the exception of compliance committees, which is by design and not necessary for Panther’s privacy preservation and compliance enablement.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther is also one of only two projects in Greenfield’s report that includes KYC in its model, which is a requirement in nearly every major jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p> How to get involved <p>If you are interested in helping Panther usher in a new era of DeFi adoption where your right to privacy is respected, we would love you to join us:&nbsp;</p>  Have coding skills?

About Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

Thematic Tease<p>Greetings community,</p><p>On May 1st, we will begin to reveal an internal initiative, story, and brand that outlines the future of Shade Protocol. The first two years of Shade Protocol was sharply focused on building the key building blocks for unstoppable finance — a world of decentralized money and products that help people reclaim their autonomy &amp; digital sovereignty.</p><p>The road has been&nbsp;arduous.</p><p>In early 2024 we collectively had a chance to take a deep breathe and reflect. We considered what has been built, how it was built, and why it was built. We’ve built the following primitives:</p>  SILK (unstoppable private stablecoin tracking a basket of currencies &amp; commodities)  ShadeSwap (DEX that protects your&nbsp;privacy)  ShadeLend (private collateralized positions)  Bridge (onboard &amp; wrap public assets into private&nbsp;assets)  Staking (passively earn real yield for securing Shade Protocol)  Bonds (protocol treasury management tool)  Transaction History (examine your private transactions)  <p>A deep analysis left us dissatisfied. This is an absurd amount of product; what is stopping growth? What is disabling our ability to onboard millions into true unstoppable finance?</p><a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930">https://www.iflscience.com/how-a-helmet-and-a-bulletriddled-plane-perfectly-demonstrates-survivor-bias-60930</a><p>Enter survivorship bias.</p><p>You see, we started noticing a trend — thousands of new users were interacting or checking on Shade Protocol for the first time that never came&nbsp;back.</p><p>It was troubling.</p><p>The brand penetration of Shade Protocol is consistently generating new users, which considering our size is somewhat remarkable. However, when users actually landed on the product suite and tried to start using it we began to uncover a common&nbsp;trend:</p><blockquote>Shade Protocol is too hard to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><p>The core contributors began to talk to users. Hop on calls. We gathered the harshest feedback from the fiercest critics. It gave us the realization that if we continue down the path of building more and more complexity into the product suite, it will go unused. The beautiful, innovative pieces of the DeFi puzzle that have set the stage so well would slowly be wiped off the table of the Free&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Utility without simplicity is unused&nbsp;utility.</p><p>At it’s worst, complex utility is a repellent.</p><p>Naturally, the current users are okay with the user experience. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here continuing to use the app. This consumer survivorship bias has perhaps blinded us to the truth of the quality of what we have&nbsp;built.</p><p>Await our next blog post on May 1st, where we reveal the next stage of Shade Protocol’s evolution — a quest for simplicity that will redefine unstoppable finance, expanding its reach in ways yet&nbsp;unseen.</p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p>

<p>Blockchain technology has many different use cases. Some are more suitable for public blockchains, and others are more suitable for private blockchains. The difference between public and private blockchains can be confusing, leaving many people wondering which of the two is most suitable for their situation.&nbsp;In this article, we will explain the main differences between public and private blockchains, and when you should use which one.</p>



<p></p>



 What is a public blockchain? 



<p>Let’s start with the definition of a public blockchain. A public blockchain is a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">permissionless blockchain</a> that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. This means anyone can contribute to the blockchain and can access the data on it.</p>



<p>In addition, public blockchains are decentralised, ensuring no single entity has control over the blockchain. This decentralisation also ensures that transactions on the (public) blockchain are verified by all nodes and are immutable once they’re on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Differences between public and private blockchains 







<p></p>



<p>While the above features sound nice, private blockchains might seem very similar at first glance. What are the differences and benefits of both types of blockchains?</p>



<p>The main difference between public and private blockchains lies in who can write and read data from that blockchain. On public blockchains, everyone can write data to and read data from the blockchain. On private blockchains though, a permissions system is in place, which determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data.</p>



<p>Another important difference is the ownership of the blockchain. Generally speaking, public blockchains are decentralised and do not have an owner. Private blockchains, however, are generally owned by a single entity. This makes public blockchains more resistant to censorship than private blockchains.</p>



<p>Anonymity is another key difference between the two. Due to the permissionless nature of public blockchains, participating entities are anonymous. This can be both a benefit and a downside, depending on the use case.</p>



<p>Other differences are speed and scalability. Public blockchains tend to be slower and less scalable, due to their decentralised nature, while private blockchains are generally much faster and more scalable, as they don’t have to worry about decentralisation.</p>



<p></p>



 Picking the right blockchain 



<p>Now that you understand the differences between public blockchains and private blockchains, you should consider <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy">which blockchain is most suitable for your solution</a>.</p>



<p>If your solution requires censorship resistance and the added security of decentralisation, a public blockchain is the best fit. However, if the need for high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system take priority, a private blockchain is likely more suited.</p>



 Which public blockchain should I use? 



<p>While picking the right kind of blockchain to suit your situation best can be quite challenging, picking the right public blockchain can be even more challenging. There’s a wide variety of available public blockchains, each of them designed to serve a specific use case and/or industry. So, which one should you use?</p>



<p>A lot of people assume Bitcoin or Ethereum are the best public blockchains, and in a sense, they are. They are the first of their kind and are very resistant to censorship due to the high number of participants. However, these blockchains have relatively low transaction speeds and suffer from scalability issues, due to outdated consensus mechanisms used.</p>



<p>Modern-day, public blockchains use newer, faster, and more scalable consensus mechanisms that safeguard the benefits of public blockchains while tackling the transaction speed and scalability issues generally associated with public blockchains.</p>



<p>One of these public blockchains is the <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">Europechain by Zaisan, an enterprise blockchain</a> created by a group of system integrators and technology providers from around the European Union. This public blockchain uses the latest software to ensure fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability. In addition, the blockchain offers solutions that ensure compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), making blockchain legal issues a problem of the past.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 A public blockchain is a permissionless blockchain that allows anyone to join and participate in blockchain activities. 



 Public blockchains are decentralised, which means that no single entity has control over the blockchain. 



 Private blockchains feature a permissions system that determines who can perform certain actions, including reading and writing data. 



 Private blockchains tend to be owned by a single entity, which makes public blockchains more censorship-resistant. 



 Public blockchains are better suited for solutions that require censorship resistance, added security, and decentralisation 



 Private blockchains are better suited for solutions that require high scalability, fast transactions, and a permission system. 



 Zaisan offers a <a href="https://zaisan.io/solutions/europechain">public, GDPR-compliant blockchain</a> built with the latest technology to offer fast transaction speeds and enterprise-level scalability.

Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</p><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>We are excited to be expanding the BlueYard team with a dedicated Crypto Associate position. This is designed to be a two-year role based in the US (ideally New York, but we’re flexible with the right candidate), supporting the team in backing entrepreneurs that are decentralizing markets and empowering humanity using crypto. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs (and networks / protocols…), and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small and value-driven team, we want to hear from&nbsp;you.</p><p>The Associate role includes:</p>  Identifying technologies and trends that will positively impact economies and societies and represent attractive early stage venture investment opportunities in&nbsp;crypto  Carrying out market, company and protocol due diligence on investment opportunities  Working with our portfolio companies and networks / protocols to support&nbsp;them  Helping with our community management and&nbsp;events  Supporting with fund reporting and&nbsp;analyses  <p>Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:</p>  A strong understanding of and passion for all things&nbsp;crypto  Self-(fire)starter — be able to run on your own, identify opportunities and prioritize without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets, companies and networks / protocols, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Ability to carry out market and financial analyses  Native (or close to) English language skills both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>There is no ideal background for this role and a formal degree is not required.

<p>One of the most important hurdles to mass adoption is represented by blockchain scalability, which also hinders the real-life utility of its numerous applications. While there are different solutions being experimented with, one should not overlook the importance of security and decentralisation. Saga introduces the concept of chainlets, interoperable Cosmos-based sovereign blockchains that share the security of Saga’s mainnet validator set.

<p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder, CTO, and Chief Scientist at Panther Protocol, recently joined Meher Roy on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhBWdn3R5M&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Epicenter Podcast</a>. They discussed Anish’s journey into crypto, the genesis of Panther Protocol, how Panther will preserve the privacy of its users, what’s coming in its Mainnet launch, and its mission to enable privacy and compliance in the DeFi space.&nbsp;</p> Who is Anish Mohammed? <p>Anish Mohammed’s foray into the tech world began at Ericsson, where he developed payment systems and became familiar with cryptography. His two decade-long career in security and cryptography has seen him design and audit several blockchain protocols and advise leading Web3 projects. His previous roles include being the lead security architect at HSBC and Lloyds Banking Group, and he’s held strategic positions at Accenture and Capgemini. Four years ago, Anish and Oliver Gale embarked on a journey to found Panther Protocol, a Zero-Knowledge, cross-protocol layer to safeguard user data and facilitate compliant DeFi access.</p> The need to preserve privacy and enable compliance <p>Panther Protocol addresses a critical gap in current blockchain technologies, where public ledgers like Bitcoin and Ethereum expose all transactions and smart contract interactions. This lack of privacy can disadvantage high-performing investors and significantly impact high-volume traders and corporations, who may want to protect the insights and advantages (or alpha) gleaned from their trading strategies. Unlike many 'dark’ pools and privacy chains, which lack transparency and complicate regulatory compliance, Panther provides DeFi users with access to its privacy-preserving protocol but also enables their transaction history to be disclosed to anyone of their choosing, in part or as a whole, at will, enabling compliance. For example, a user might disclose certain information to a tax authority or a regulator, as required in their jurisdiction. Panther uses Zero-Knowledge proof-enabled KYC checks to ensure malicious actors do not use the protocol.</p> Preserving privacy amid disclosure <p>While Panther Protocol allows users to disclose transactions as needed, Panther takes steps to ensure there is always sufficient overall volume to mask non-disclosed transactions effectively.</p><p>One key component of how this gets done is via network participants who are rewarded for staking their assets to generate additional transactions and increase liquidity pools. In the process, the privacy of non-disclosed transactions is preserved.&nbsp;</p> The importance of Shielded Pools for DeFi's future <p>Shielded Pools are at the heart of Panther Protocol, offering a privacy-centric solution for DeFi transactions. These pools, supported by advanced cryptographic methods like zk-SNARKs, allow users to transact while retaining the option to disclose information for compliance. The Shielded Pool is pivotal for the Protocol, enabling users to interact with DeFi applications privately and securely.</p><p>For a deeper dive into Shielded Pools, including the intricacies of Zones and Zone Managers, visit<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/"> Panther’s blog on </a>Shielded Pools.</p> What’s coming in Panther’s Mainnet beta launch? <p>Anish presented some of the features that Protocol participants can expect to see in the upcoming&nbsp; Mainnet beta product:&nbsp;</p>  zAccount registration. A zAccount is your private identity and entry point to Panther, aligning with KYC protocols and using Zero-Knowledge proofs.  Privacy-staking reward mechanism: Panther incentivizes network participants to enhance the pool’s transaction set and liquidity by staking assets.  Transactions and communication between Zones: exchange of assets and information across different Zones in Panther.  Withdrawals: The action of converting and transferring zAssets back to standard tokens.  Basic disclosures: The user can reveal details about transactions conducted within Panther, allowing for compliance and verification.  Advanced disclosures: Offers users the capability to selectively disclose specific aspects of their transactions, providing flexibility in privacy and compliance.  zAccount renewals: Regular verification and update of a user’s KYC information to ensure ongoing compliance and integrity of their zAccount.  DeFi Swap adapter: A tool that integrates Panther with external DeFi platforms, facilitating private and compliant swaps and other transactions.  zTrade: Zero-Knowledge trades with others in the same Zone.   Conclusion <p>As DeFi continues to evolve, the need for on-chain privacy solutions that accommodate regulatory compliance becomes increasingly critical. Panther Protocol, under the guidance of Co-Founder Anish Mohammed, is at the forefront of addressing this challenge. By pioneering Shielded Pools and facilitating the role of Zone Managers, Panther is setting a new standard for privacy preservation and compliance in DeFi. Panther Protocol’s innovative approach protects users’ data and paves the way for institutional participation in the DeFi ecosystem. As Panther progresses toward its next development phases, the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">call for testers</a> lets you, the community contribute to a more private and compliant DeFi future.&nbsp;</p><p>Join Panther’s journey in shaping a balanced world where privacy meets compliance, empowering users and institutions to navigate the DeFi landscape securely and transparently.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

         TL;DR&nbsp; 
 
 Horizen’s proof verification chain is live on testnet!&nbsp; 
 Aims to redefine blockchain efficiency with ZK proof verification and settlement layers 
 Marks a significant milestone for web3 as the first instance of a modular proof verification network 
 Future plans include enhancing zkStack compatibility and opening up testnet access to the public 
 
<p>We are excited to announce that Horizen has achieved a major milestone: the deployment of our proof verification chain to testnet.&nbsp; This leap forward signals a new era for the Horizen ecosystem, where we aim to redefine blockchain efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
 Backstory: 
<p>Horizen is pioneering a new layer in the modular blockchain stack focusing on ZK proofs verification and settlement. This focus dramatically reduces costs and improves efficiency for zk rollups and appchains. Following the passing of <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP 42400</a>, we have been heads down building and leveraging dev tools like Substrate, Polkascan, and other open-source resources to bring our vision to life rapidly. Check out this 10-minute demo to see Horizen’s proof verification chain live in action!</p>     
 

 
                     
             
                                    
                                 
            
         
        
             

 
         
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Matters? 
<p>The launch of this testnet marks a significant point for the broader web3 space as the first instance of a modular proof verification network. The New Horizen network is composed of the following key components:</p>
 
 A Revamped Mainchain: Powered by Substrate, the Horizen mainchain is the foundation for our modular proof verification network. This network allows for the exchange of $ZEN (Horizen’s native token) and verification of FFLONK Proofs produced by Polygon zkEVM instances. 
 Proof Submission Interface: A user-friendly interface that enables zk-rollups to submit proofs seamlessly to the Horizen network for verification. 
 Attestation Mechanism: A protocol published on date to Ethereum and validates proofs (providing additional transparency). 
 New Horizen Smart Contract: The storage and validation mechanism on Ethereum that allows Horizen users to verify that their proof was included in an attestation. 
 Polygon zk-EVM Rollup: A rollup built with Polygon’s CDK that generates and submits proofs to Horizen’s proof verification chain. 
 
 Looking Ahead: 
<p>Celebrating this milestone is just the beginning. Horizen is committed to pioneering advancements in the modular blockchain space, focusing on dramatically reducing costs and improving efficiency for rollups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are already setting our sights on the next development phase, with lots of exciting developments on the horizon!</p>
<p>Here’s what you can expect from us in the coming months:</p>
 
 Enhanced Compatibility with zkStack: We aim to expand the compatibility of New Horizen with zkStack, and further broaden its interoperability and market reach. 
 Opening Up Access to the Public: In the spirit of bringing our community along for feedback, we will open up access for the Horizen community to run testnet nodes and become validators.

 Introducing Switch — The Gateway Currency to Switch Between Stablecoins on&nbsp;Verus  Switch is a decentralized currency fully backed by VRSC, DAI, USDC &amp; EURC. Use it to switch between Verus and the different stablecoins. Or hold it while it accrues value from conversion fees.  ⏱️ Switch is launched on block: 2,984,851 (Saturday 30 March,&nbsp;2024).  🔁 Convert VRSC, DAI, USDC or EURC to Switch, or vice versa. Or use Switch as an AMM and convert the reserves with each&nbsp;other.  ❓ <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/eurc">EURC</a> are stablecoins issued by <a href="http://www.circle.com">Circle</a>. DAI is a USD stablecoin issued by&nbsp;<a href="https://makerdao.com/en/">Maker</a>.  💸 Low-cost, MEV-resistant DeFi conversions with max. fees of&nbsp;0.05%.  ⌨️ See the Switch statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at <a href="https://cryptodashboard.faldt.net">Cryptodashboard</a> or <a href="https://raw.verus.trading">verus.trading</a>. Or type in /switch in the #trading channel in the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">community Discord</a>.  📚 Learn in this article how to convert the stables with each other, and how to convert to and from Switch. Also you learn how to bridge EURC or USDC to the Verus&nbsp;network.  What is&nbsp;Switch? <p>Switch is a decentralized currency on the Verus blockchain. It is fully (100%) backed by its reserves. Its initial supply is 20,000&nbsp;Switch.</p>  Its reserves are weighted as follows: VRSC (16%), DAI DAI.vETH (21%), USDC vUSDC.vETH (21%) &amp; EURC EURC.vETH (42%). What does this mean? E.g. when you put EURC in the reserves you get more Switch after preconversion than when you put VRSC&nbsp;in.  Use Switch to convert between any of the reserves for a max. fee of 0.05%. Switch is a MEV-resistant AMM. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi.</a>  Switch accrues 50% of the conversion fees — the conversion fees stay in the reserves, increasing the value of&nbsp;Switch.  The other 50% of the conversion fees go to the miners and stakers of&nbsp;Verus.  There is a risk to holding Switch — USDC &amp; EURC are distributed by the centralized company&nbsp;Circle.  The supply of Switch is dynamic. Switch gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETHor EURC.vETH, and get burned when people convert back to the reserves.    Register subIDs— *.Switch@ for a 10 EURC (in Switch) fee. Those fees get burned. <a href="http://docs.verus.io/verusid">Learn more about subIDs (VerusIDs).</a>  Switch is perfect to use with <a href="https://docs.verus.io/veruspay/">VerusPay</a> — Get your local businesses to take DAI, USDC &amp; EURC on Verus. If you hold VRSC, DAI, or USDC and need to buy coffee in EURC, just scan a QR code! Verus scales to everyone worldwide and auto-converts payments from your favorite currency for always low transaction fees &amp; a 0.05% conversion fee.   There was a preconversion period for&nbsp;Switch <p>There was a 7-day preconversion period where the reserves of Switch were filled with VRSC, DAI DAI.vETH, USDC vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC EURC.vETH. Depending on how much people added they got their fair share of the 20,000 Switch after the 7 day&nbsp;period.</p><p>After the 7-day period Switch became a MEV-resistant AMM. All reserves can now be converted between each&nbsp;other.</p> How to bridge USDC &amp; EURC over to&nbsp;Verus <p>USDC and EURC are ERC-20 token stablecoins issued by Circle. Get them on <a href="http://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase</a> or other exchanges. On the Verus blockchain they are called vUSDC.vETH &amp; EURC.vETH.</p><p>DAI DAI.vETH is readily available on the Verus network. Below are the ERC-20 token contracts for the&nbsp;tokens:</p>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48">USDC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x1aBaEA1f7C830bD89Acc67eC4af516284b1bC33c">EURC token&nbsp;contract</a>  <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f">DAI token&nbsp;contract</a>  <p>To be able to use those ERC-20 tokens to preconvert into Switch they need to be bridged to the Verus blockchain. The bridging is done through the non-custodial and trustless Verus-Ethereum Bridge. Bridging and preconverting can be done with <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/mobile">Verus Mobile</a>, <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> (full node) &amp; MetaMask with <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">the bridge&nbsp;website</a>.</p> Verus Mobile&nbsp;bridging <p>Let’s start by bridging with Verus Mobile. First thing to do is to add the ERC-20s in Verus Mobile. This is how to do&nbsp;it:</p>Adding ERC-20s to Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner  Press “Add ERC-20&nbsp;Token”  Select checkmark to “Find using mapped PBaaS currency”, and fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth. Then press Continue.  Press OK when a warning screen pops&nbsp;up.  <p>Now you are ready to receive USDC, EURC or DAI (as ERC-20s) on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Before bridging the tokens over to Verus let’s add the currencies on the Verus blockchain to the&nbsp;wallet:</p>Adding the currencies on the Verus blockchain on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press the plus-button bottom-right corner.  Press “Add PBaaS currency”.  Fill in eurc.veth, vusdc.veth or dai.veth and press continue.  Press “ADD”.  <p>Now we are ready to bridge the ERC-20s over to the Verus blockchain.</p>Bridging EURC to Verus. It will come out as EURC.vETH.  Select the ERC-20 you want to bridge. (In the example we use&nbsp;EURC).  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”.  Press “Send off-chain”.  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID).  Fill in the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over.  Then as “Select network to send to” choose&nbsp;Verus  Then as “Select currency to receive as” choose EURC.vETH  <p>That’s it. It can take up to 90 minutes before the ERC-20 arrives as a currency on&nbsp;Verus.</p> Bridging with&nbsp;MetaMask <p>Let’s bridge with MetaMask and the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">Verus-Ethereum Bridge&nbsp;website</a>:</p>Bridging with MetaMask to a Verus-address, EURC used as&nbsp;example.  Connect MetaMask with this website: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>  Address: where you want the DAI, USDC or EURC to end up on the Verus blockchain (as DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH or EURC.vETH)  Select token: [Euro Coin] as EURC.vETH, [0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48] as vUSDC.vETH or&nbsp;DAI.vETH  Destination: select the same&nbsp;… on&nbsp;VRSC  Choose the amount you want to bridge&nbsp;over  It may take up to 90 minutes before the funds arrive on&nbsp;Verus   Convert DAI, USDC, EURC &amp; VRSC with each&nbsp;other <p>Now that Switch is fully launched you can convert between VRSC, DAI.vETH, vUSDC.vETH and EURC.vETH. It’s now an AMM. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more on Verus DeFi&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Convert with Verus Desktop or Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p> Convert with Verus&nbsp;Desktop <p>On Verus Desktop click the “Convert Currencies”-button and then go to the “Advanced”-tab.</p>Convert all Switch reserves with each other on Verus&nbsp;Desktop.  Choose amount to&nbsp;send  “From Currency”: fill in DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  “To Currency”: fill in DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  “Via Currency”: fill in&nbsp;Switch  “Destination Address”: fill in a R-/i-address or VerusID where you want to receive the currency.  Now click “Convert Currencies”, and that’s it! Wait between 1 and 5 blocks and you will receive the&nbsp;amount.  <p>If you want to convert to&nbsp;Switch:</p>  “To Currency”: to&nbsp;Switch  Leave out “Via Currency”   Convert with Verus&nbsp;Mobile Convert all Switch reserves with each other on Verus&nbsp;Mobile.  Press DAI.vETH&nbsp;, vUSDC.vETH, EURC.vETH, VRSC  Press “Send” and then “Convert or cross-chain”  Press “Convert currency”  As the recipient address fill in a Verus address you own (R- or i-address, or VerusID) or self to receive it on the same address where you send it&nbsp;from.  Fill in the amount you want to&nbsp;convert  Then as “Select currency to convert to” choose what you want to convert it&nbsp;to.  The network to send to is “current network” =&nbsp;Verus  Now press “Send” and confirm, and that’s it! You now have to wait between 1 and 5 blocks and you will see the currency in your&nbsp;wallet.

 Introducing Pure — The Currency 100% Backed by Verus &amp;&nbsp;Bitcoin  Pure is a decentralized currency fully backed by Verus (VRSC) &amp; Bitcoin (tBTC). Hold Pure to be exposed to both Verus and Bitcoin while accruing fees from conversions. Or use it to convert from tBTC to VRSC and vice&nbsp;versa.  ⏱️ Pure is launched on block: 2,975,703 (Sunday 24 March,&nbsp;2024).  🔁 Convert tBTC &amp; VRSC to Pure, or vice versa. Or use Pure as an AMM and convert tBTC &amp; VRSC with each&nbsp;other.  ❓ tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. <a href="http://threshold.network/">Threshold.network</a> supplies a decentralized bridge for users to bridge BTC to Ethereum. tBTC is also bridged to Verus (as tBTC.vETH).  ⌨️ See the Pure statistics (protocol prices, amount in reserves) at <a href="https://cryptodashboard.faldt.net">Cryptodashboard</a> or <a href="https://raw.verus.trading">verus.trading</a>. Or type in /pure in the #trading channel in the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">community Discord</a>.  📚 Learn in this article how to convert tBTC &amp; VRSC with each other, and how to convert to and from Pure. Also you learn how to bridge tBTC to the Verus&nbsp;network.  What is&nbsp;Pure? <p>Pure is a decentralized currency launched on the Verus blockchain. It is fully backed by its reserves: Verus (VRSC) and Bitcoin (tBTC), with a reserve ratio of&nbsp;50/50%.</p><p>The currency is called Pure because it aligns with the true ideals of decentralization and transparency:</p>  Bitcoin and Verus are fully decentralized and controlled by its nodes and block producers. No single entity or company controls them. They are not a business — they are rent-free protocols.  Bitcoin and Verus had fair launches. No ICO, no premine and no developer fees or&nbsp;taxes.  Bitcoin and Verus have a limited&nbsp;supply.  Bitcoin and Verus are censorship-resistant.  <p>Hold Pure to be exposed to two decentralized cryptocurrencies upholding true cypherpunk values.</p> Pure is an&nbsp;AMM <p>Another benefit of holding Pure is that the currency accrues conversion fees. When users convert from Pure to VRSC or tBTC (or vice versa) they pay a conversion fee of 0.025%. When users convert between VRSC and tBTC they pay a conversion fee of&nbsp;0.05%.</p><p>Half of those conversion fees (50%) stay in the Pure reserves, increasing the value of Pure since no new Pure is minted. The conversions are MEV-resistant and verified by the miners and stakers of the protocol. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">Learn more about Verus&nbsp;DeFi</a>.</p><p>Conversions between VRSC and tBTC are only possible after the preconversion period has ended on Sunday 24 March,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Users can also create subIDs which cost 0.00021 tBTC.vETH (in Pure). These costs are burned reducing Pure in circulation. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">Learn more about VerusID and what you can do with it here</a>. If users create an identity with your subID as referral, they pay 2/3 less — you get 1/3 and 1/3 is discounted.</p> Preconversion period before the launch of&nbsp;Pure <p>Before Pure was fully launched, there was an 8-day preconversion period. In that period users could fund the reserves of Pure with VRSC and tBTC. During this period no conversions could be done. Depending on how much they added they got their fair share of 20,000 Pure after the 8 day&nbsp;period.</p><p>The initial supply of Pure was 20,000. After the initial supply has been distributed by the protocol, the supply became dynamic. When users convert from VRSC or tBTC into Pure, Pure is minted. When people convert from Pure back to VRSC or tBTC, the Pure is&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Learn below how Pure was launched without any coding needed. Just a simple API&nbsp;call:</p> What is tBTC, how do I get it &amp; bridge it to&nbsp;Verus? <p>tBTC is BTC on the Ethereum network. The decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum is supplied by the <a href="http://www.threshold.network/">Threshold Network</a>.</p><blockquote>Existing solutions that bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum require users to send their Bitcoin to an intermediary, in exchange for an ERC-20 token that represents the original asset. This centralized model requires you to trust a third party and is susceptible to censorship, threatening the premise of Bitcoin as sovereign, secure, permissionless digital&nbsp;asset.</blockquote><blockquote>The second generation of tBTC is a truly decentralized (and scalable) bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum. It provides Bitcoin holders secure and open access to the broader DeFi ecosystem. tBTC v2 allows you to unlock your Bitcoin’s value to borrow and lend, mint stablecoins, provide liquidity, and much&nbsp;more.</blockquote><p>Get tBTC on Kraken, Uniswap, Curve &amp; others. <a href="https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC/mint">Or mint it&nbsp;yourself</a></p><p>tBTC token address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88">https://etherscan.io/token/0x18084fba666a33d37592fa2633fd49a74dd93a88</a></p><p>You can send tBTC to your MetaMask wallet or Verus Mobile first, and later you have to bridge it to the Verus blockchain.

<p>We’ve gathered insights from our team of web3 experts who are eager to share their most valuable tips with you. Whether you’re just considering using blockchain or already knee-deep in the technology, our experts have got you covered. With our wealth of experience and learnings along the way, our web3 experts are here to offer you valuable insights and guidance.</p>



<p>Top web3 expert tips for web3 projects:</p>



 
 Decrease time to market 



 Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



 Address compliance at an early stage 



 Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 
 



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #1: Decrease time to market 



<p>In the fast-paced web3 world, time is everything. New applications pop up daily, not to mention the numerous new players that enter the space.</p>



<p>By decreasing the time to market, you can launch your product before your competitors. Additionally, it allows you to receive feedback from the (web3) community early on, which can help you refine your product. But remember, this whole web3 space is also new to them. Innovation takes time to sink in. Finally, a faster time-to-market can help you avoid running out of resources before your product even gets to market.</p>



<p>Simplicity is key. By prioritising a smooth and seamless process, and abstracting away as much technical complexity as possible, you create better experiences for your customers and increase your chances of success.</p>







<p></p>



 Expert Tip #2: Ask the community to avoid mistakes 



<p>For a novel and complex technology, it is essential to have a second pair of eyes on all your software. By involving the community and asking for help, you can ensure that your project is built on a solid foundation and has the best chance of success.</p>



<p>Many projects fail because people rush into building something without asking around. Newcomers to the field may not realise the potential challenges they could encounter, many of which may have already been resolved by others. There are public forums for developers and all types of project participants, including technology-focused and business-focused groups.</p>



<p>However, in the web3 space, there remain many solutions that are new and lack proper documentation, making it even more critical to consider what works and what doesn’t work. So, how do you ensure you get the best advice?</p>



<p>Firstly, ensure that you talk to a diverse group of industry players from different budgets and backgrounds. Secondly, clearly understand your project requirements and what you need help with. Clear communication will help your community understand what it is you are trying to achieve and where you might need improvements. Finally, always be respectful and appreciative of people’s time and efforts.</p>



<p></p>



 Expert Tip #3: Address compliance at an early stage 



<p>Before spending a considerable amount on building a minimum viable product (MVP), it is crucial to at least have a quick chat with a seasoned lawyer, to explore potential legal issues. A relatively small investment will help to identify any legal challenges related to your plans. For example, regulatory issues for custodial wallets, property law for tokenisation, intellectual property for NFTs, and GDPR compliance for web3 wallets and public chains. <a href="https://zaisan.io/services/web3-consultancy/">Inserting legal know-how at an early stage</a> might save tons of costs and a lot of time. It might prevent you from completely re-developing or spending precious resources on a project doomed from a regulatory perspective. Professional legal involvement will sit well with investors too.</p>



<p>At Zaisan, we understand that the law might look like a scary beast, but that compliance is essential for the success of your blockchain project. It’s too often that this initial, relatively small spending saves the day.</p>



   



 Expert Tip #4: Mitigate risk by decreasing volatility 



<p>One common challenge faced by many blockchain projects is the lack of users, particularly those projects that rely on transactional volumes such as wallets, exchanges, and marketplaces. Furthermore, when a project has a tradable token, there is a high chance that it can become volatile, which can make the project unusable. To mitigate these risks, we suggest that you ensure your project is sustainable through budget planning and mitigating volatility risks by hedging.</p>



<p>It’s important to avoid basing your business model solely on the token on which it is running. Instead, use business logic and design the project in a way that it doesn’t have overdependence on the system token. You could mitigate the risk by using stablecoins and a variable pricing model.</p>



<p>Introducing crypto or tokens to a project has its pros and cons. On the one hand, leveraging cryptocurrency or tokens can provide a new level of flexibility and accessibility, enabling streamlined transactions and potentially unlocking new revenue streams. Additionally, it can foster community engagement and loyalty through token incentives and reward systems. However, this approach also comes with its challenges, including regulatory compliance complexities, volatility in token values, and the need for robust security measures to safeguard against cyber threats and fraud. Therefore, careful consideration and strategic planning are essential to navigate the intricacies of integrating crypto or tokens effectively into a project. </p>

<p>As technology progresses, infrastructure should be commoditised, especially in Web3, in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks and gatekeepers. Blockchains are naturally oblivious to off-chain data, so they need oracles to fetch data. However, given their past technical limitations, oracles have failed to provide a decentralised and permissionless framework for data query. SEDA seeks to change this by creating an intent-based modular data layer, which brings off-chain data on-chain, in order for it to be available to any party, regardless of who requested it first.</p><p>We were joined by Jasper De Goojier, co-founder of SEDA Protocol, to discuss the oracle landscape and how SEDA aims to decentralise it and make data access permissionless.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jasper’s background  High level overview of SEDA  Oracle use cases  How SEDA Protocol functions  Intent-based data availability  Verifying subjective data &amp; LLM integration  ZKPs &amp; FHE for data privacy  Interoperability &amp; bridging  Roadmap &amp; optimistic oracles  SEDA token migration  Chain abstraction  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jasperflux">Jasper De Goojier on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/sedaprotocol">SEDA Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

        <p>This ZenIP proposes lowering the thresholds required for:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) formally submitting both technical and non-technical improvement proposals; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) achieving a quorum of votes for both technical and non-technical improvement proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes would increase accessibility for community members to put forth proposals and would bring quorum requirements in line with the broader web3 industry standards. Please note that these proposed changes apply to both Zen improvement proposals (ZenIPs) and EON improvement proposals (EONIPs).</p>
<p>ZenIP 42401 aims to make it easier for community members to participate in governance by lowering the $ZEN threshold required for posting a non-technical ZenIP/ EONIP for community vote, as well as lowering the quorum threshold for a vote to be considered valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current thresholds for both ZenIPs and EONIPs are as follows:</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 200,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 10% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 
<p>This ZenIP proposes the following changes to the thresholds:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 200,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating (vs. 10% currently) 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 25,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 100,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 3% of circulating supply participating (vs. 5% currently) 
 
 
 
<p>Again, if ZenIP 42401 passes, these changes will apply to both ZenIPs and EONIPs. There are also no changes proposed to the majority requirements for either proposal type (i.e., 67% of votes in favor for technical proposals, simple majority in favor for non-technical proposals).</p>
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are public proposals for the Horizen community to approve or decline. We encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> on ZenIP 42401 and share your thoughts on the proposal. We also encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440">ZenIP 42401: Updating Proposal and Quorum Thresholds</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of this proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42401 will start on Tuesday, March 12th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, March 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on the Horizen EON chain, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. The snapshot is taken once voting begins.</p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the vote instructions detailed tutorial, please have a look to the dedicated blogpost. Below we cover an overview of how to vote.&nbsp;</p>
 How to vote – Instructions 
<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold, either on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) or Horizen EON (the EVM chain).</p>
<p>If you already linked your mainchain address for a previous vote, you won’t have to connect it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Connect your wallet and verify if it’s properly linked here.</a></p>
<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>
<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is properly configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>
 A/ You already voted and linked you mainchain address 
<p>Then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still encourage you to verify if your mainchain address is properly linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not linked, follow the tutorial just below.</p>
<p>If it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
 B/ You have to link your mainchain address 
<p>1/ First, make sure to have some ZEN on Horizen EON, you will need some gas tokens in order to interact with the EVM chain, link your address, and vote.</p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain address(es). Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable. Here, we will focus on Sphere By Horizen. If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address.&nbsp; 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy your EON address. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We also have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain-based payment surges, the need for on-chain privacy is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-files-for-privacy-etf-with-sec-zcash-part-of-offering.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Crypto-focused%20asset%20manager%20Grayscale,be%20an%20industry-first%20fund">capturing the spotlight</a>. Privacy is particularly important for institutional users and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). And, the problem is that any public, pseudonymous blockchain reveals transaction details.&nbsp;</p><p>From wallet addresses, to gas fees, to transaction value, and the tokens traded; transaction data is public. This enables transaction linkage, which exposes a huge data exhaust that may ultimately result in wallet:identity mapping. Simply attempting to make a trade can trigger MEV front-running; even price discovery can be followed. Neither privacy nor confidentiality are a feature of public ledgers.</p><p>Let’s examine how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> A vision for regulatory-compliant, on-chain privacy <p>Panther Protocol breaks the links between the wallet initiating the trade and the trade itself, i.e. it enhances transaction privacy: specifically, it preserves identity, the assets traded, and value transferred. This privacy is granted by Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pools</a>. Shielded Pools, known in TradFi as dark pools, obscure the trade initiator whose privacy must be preserved from peer traders and external liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p><p>The Shielded Pool acts like a walled garden: only invited users and assets may enter. Assets are deposited in the Panther Vault, part of the Panther Smart Contract, in exchange for a zAsset, or Zero-Knowledge Asset. It’s the zAsset that masks the detail of the user’s trades from observation.</p> What is a zAsset? <p>A zAsset represents a digital asset that users may trade with anonymity within a Panther Shielded Pool. The technology underpinning the zAsset enables trades to be settled privately on a public ledger.</p><p>In essence, the zAsset, is a "mirror" asset that is printed when a digital asset is <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/depositing-transferring-and-withdrawing?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">deposited </a>in the Panther contract. It’s subsequently spent when that asset is withdrawn. Therefore, the zAsset:asset always exists in a strict 1:1 ratio. Users can send, swap, receive, and pay with zAssets within a Shielded Pool.&nbsp;</p> How does a zAsset enhance trading privacy? <p>A zAsset utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. ZK proofs are cryptographic protocols that enable the prover to demonstrate to the verifier that something is true without revealing the underlying data required to form that proof. For example, you could prove that you are over 18 without providing the birth certificate or ID used to generate that proof, nor indeed your actual age.&nbsp;</p><p>zAssets represent their underlying asset in the form of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). It’s these UTXOs that users trade within a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>. To store UTXO data on-chain, the Protocol uses ZK-SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) proofs. This allows a user’s on-chain state to be stored privately and to ensure private state changes, i.e. the UTXO data that represents the asset on-chain is condensed and encrypted. This means that asset balances and balance changes are not publicly available should a Panther account address become known to an observer.&nbsp;</p><p>To the observing world, the only available data that results from a trade is that a UTXO was committed to the smart contract. Only the owner of the UTXO can decrypt the proof and ascertain the value and token that the UTXO represents.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that UTXOs are not all created equal adds further support to the privacy set. The number of UTXOs created as a result of trades does not map to the number of tokens that UTXO represents. Some UTXOs may not even represent an asset, they may prove a zero balance, or null data, allowing the activity level of the protocol itself to also be shielded.&nbsp;</p> Deepening privacy <p>Panther Protocol offers two privacy layers; one is optional, and the other is a feature of the protocol. The zAsset is the protocol’s core feature, and the Panther Relayer is a protocol service provider that adds an additional privacy-enhancing mechanism.</p><p>Panther Relayers provide an additional privacy layer by breaking the link between the initiator of the transaction and the transaction itself. These ecosystem operators charge a fee for:</p>  signing the transactions with their public key  paying the gas fees  relaying bundles of transactions to the Shielded Pool contract&nbsp;  <p>Relayers, therefore, enhance privacy, since observers are unable to pinpoint the actual address that initiated the transaction because the Relayer signs the blockchain transaction with their key.</p> A brighter, more private, public-ledger future <p>Relaying alone goes a long way to confounding transaction linking by disbursing the data exhaust when compared to a peer-to-peer or peer-to-AMM transaction. Combined with zAsset trading, we believe this suite of solutions offers the most robust, and yet compliant, trading privacy mechanism created to date.&nbsp;</p><p>As the global economy migrates to a digital native medium that operates on public ledgers, the utility of on-chain protocols will largely hinge on how effectively they implement features that confer privacy where and when it is needed. We believe that Panther Protocol’s privacy-enhancing technology solves the public ledger privacy problem. Panther Protocol has developed a mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol provides dedicated, customizable space, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a Panther Zone</a>, to empower institutions to trade in Shielded Pools with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the needs of compliant privacy-enabled DeFi in mind, Panther Zones deliver a chain-agnostic, fully decentralized, suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone for privacy-enhanced trading? Reach out to us at <a href="mailto:contact@pantherprotocol.io">contact@pantherprotocol.io</a>. Want to help us develop Panther’s chain-agnostic app layer? Then join our community testers and try out the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">testnet dApp</a>.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>The monolithic blockchain era appears to be sunsetting. Among the first to contribute to this paradigm shift was Cosmos, which introduced the idea of specialized sovereign blockchains (appchains), made possible by the Cosmos SDK. Nowadays, the modular thesis employs external data availability and even execution solutions, which enables the creation of countless new chains. Each new blockchains comes with its own ‘specs’, and centralised RPC and node providers have to adapt to each chain’s setting. However, the saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ applies in this scenario too - we have often witnessed RPC failures during high demand periods.

<p>As transparent Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/euro-backed-stablecoin-eurm-trials-spain?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">(CBDC) pilots</a> continue to gain traction, on-chain privacy has exploded into one of the polarizing issues in the Web3 industry. However, as is the nature of polarizing extremes, neither absolute transparency nor absolute privacy will serve users' real-world needs.</p><p>In fact, the privacy vs. compliance issue has existed and has already largely been solved for, across states and time. Existing systems based in the physical domain tend to operate on the principle of default privacy. As such, state-approved mechanisms are implemented to mitigate against fraud and other dishonest practices. These introduce and enforce transparency, such as mandatory financial reporting and audit requirements. Furthermore, additional privacy protections are extended to individuals and private enterprises such that their financial reporting isn’t exposed.</p><p>In contrast, those blockchain-based, public-ledger systems that underpin DeFi operate on default transparency. This means public ledgers require additional mechanisms that preserve privacy. Then, as per their physical domain equivalents, discoverability features must be implemented to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of malicious activity from eluding the state.</p><p>The issue, therefore, is really about Web3 accepting that while DeFi does “solve money”, it must also solve for a balance between privacy and compliance, because money will always be in the domain of the state’s law enforcement (even when the state no longer prints it).</p> Going beyond early teething pains <p>Most Web3 advocates believe that blockchain ecosystems have the potential to provide the best conditions to operate an integrated global economy that is prosperous, liquid, resilient, and fair. However, institutions are never going to agree to operate in a fully transparent environment. Compliant on-chain privacy is the catalyst required to push decentralized financial players to penetrate the mass market.</p><p>To achieve this, the Web3 community must shake off the tendency to polarize DeFi privacy projects as teetering between terrorist financier and a tyrannical surveillance facilitator. While the nascent public ledger privacy sector has been met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-strong-defense-trial?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">litigation</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-drops-multi-month-lows-binance-delisting?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">critical delistings</a> — it becomes clear that now is the time for a mature solution set that respects the financial privacy rights of institutions and individual users, while providing the compliance features of its physical-domain cousins.</p><p>Now is the time to get serious about adoption. And, to achieve widespread adoption, Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in facilitating the fundamental process of exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations. In short, these issues are a matter of existential importance to the future of decentralized systems.</p> On-chain privacy, a problem solved <p>Panther Protocol has developed the mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>With Panther, institutional players have access to a suite of DeFi tools to manage dedicated trading spaces, called Zones, to trade digital assets in Shielded Pools — revolutionizing private trades with public, on-chain settlement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Zones</a> are highly customizable, as are their disclosure mechanisms. The Panther suite empowers institutions to leverage privacy-protocol trades with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the operational efficiencies of institutions in mind, Panther simplifies portfolio and asset management with a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol recognizes that the path to adoption isn’t about the mechanics of privacy, transparency, or discoverability, per se; it’s about providing meaningful abstraction to the end user. Panther’s Privacy Protocol is doing for the on-chain domain what the Microsoft Office suite did for the personal computer — delivering abstractions that make it usable. However, unlike Microsoft, Panther presents a Web3-native protocol based on chain-agnostic, decentralized principles.</p><p>Here at Panther, we believe that those who understand institutional operations and pain points intimately and who apply the technical know-how to develop versatile on-chain systems with refined privacy functions will be the major winners in Web3’s next major wave: the institutional onboarding process. We intend to spearhead that revolution.</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone? Reach out to us at contact@pantherprotocol.io.</p>

This is because despite vesting progression &amp; completion for various categories (private raise, grants, dev fund, etc.) many entities have chosen to not claim their earned SHD — thus not directly impacting circulating supply (yet). Another key disclaimer is that of the 1.8M SHD dev fund, none of the dev fund SHD is staked / nor active in any capacity so as to not impact staking yield or governance proposals.</p> Protocol Liquidity Matching <p>Another distribution component to note is Protocol Liquidity Match (PLM) — a novel mechanism whereby Shade Protocol loans out tokens in collaboration with other protocols to bootstrap liquidity. This model is favorable as it does not involve an OTC and does not involve any emissions. However, this deal structure was invented prior to full blown decentralized governance; the core contributors are not comfortable categorizing PLM as “LP” without a community vote. As of right now PLM is handled and accounted for from the dev fund until a formal ratification of categorization via the community pool.

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>



<p></p>



 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

        <p>Horizen Labs has submitted a ZenIP Discussion topic on Discourse, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>

Verus offers a different perspective and a new approach. Together we will come to the conclusion that the Verus Protocol solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or security, effectively solving the trilemma.  A Closer Look at the&nbsp;Trilemma <p>Before we dive in, let’s examine the current perceived definition of the crypto trilemma: “You can’t have a scalable blockchain that is truly decentralized and thus secure” — it is said to achieve worldwide scalability a blockchain needs to be fast so it can process all the transactions for a large population (btw, this is a false premise, you can read about that later.) And to get a fast, high tps (transactions per second) blockchain it must compromise on decentralization and thus security.</p><p>Decentralization and security go hand-in-hand. A truly decentralized protocol (open to all, many validators) is secure because it is difficult to 51% attack such a protocol. If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain — censorship-resistance.</p><blockquote>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>There is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all, which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.</p><p>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.</p> Scalability Does NOT Mean High&nbsp;Tps <blockquote>Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator — like GHz for computers.</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example — how fast servers&nbsp;are.</p><p>To bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let’s make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are not connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It’s millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.</p><p>Now, with this perspective in mind, let’s get back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn’t scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Instead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.</p><p>Verus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.</p> Unlimited in&nbsp;Scale <p>Before we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let’s start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.</p><p>Most, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up — increasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.</p><p>Verus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It’s called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the organization’s need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>There is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don’t go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.</p><p>Of course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are — in a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.</p><p>Cross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (&amp; ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) — it’s all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to&nbsp;use.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let’s dive into&nbsp;it.</p> Built to be Decentralized <p>There are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security — Verus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee&nbsp;Pool.</p><blockquote>Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or&nbsp;tax.</blockquote><p>Before we jump into the above let’s acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralized protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the&nbsp;world.</p> A Hybrid Consensus Mechanism <p>Now let’s unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It’s a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it’s <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf">a provable solution to 51% hash attacks</a>. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by&nbsp;staking.</p><p>VerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC &amp; FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5’s are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It’s accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.</p>An Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member&nbsp;DCAL4.<p>Additionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to&nbsp;support.</p><p>This approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol’s design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Then we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solved the “nothing-at-stake”-problem</a> therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?</p> Protocol Security at Another&nbsp;Level <p>Seeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it’s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It’s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.</p> Verus Introduces the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>Let’s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and&nbsp;stakers:</p>  PBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched&nbsp;chain)  Currency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20&nbsp;VRSC  subID registrations: 0.02&nbsp;VRSC  DeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max.&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Builders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on top of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6&nbsp;VRSC).</p><p>The Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to “snipe” the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many&nbsp;blocks.</p> Smart Contracts Are Not&nbsp;Secure <p>Most blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model — smart contracts written with Solidity. It’s full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it’s easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle — the most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.</p><p>Now you might ask yourself “But can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?”. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.</p> Does Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma? <p>A fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is&nbsp;“yes!”.</p><p>Let’s summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability. Unlimited scalability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.</p><p>Decentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>High security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and&nbsp;stakers.</p> Now is the Time to Build with&nbsp;Verus <p>Without having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any&nbsp;kind.</p><p>The foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.

<p>As part of the deprecation, all TokenMint users will need to remove their $ZEN from the sidechain before the deprecation date to avoid loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
 
 Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 – TokenMint Testnet will be Deprecated 
 Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 – TokenMint Mainnet will be Deprecated 
 
<p>To move $ZEN off of TokenMint, users can simply send their ZEN from their Cobalt Wallet to a Horizen mainchain address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: ZEN can only be sent to Horizen Mainchain Sphere addresses from Cobalt. Sending ZEN to another Horizen Mainnet address outside of Sphere could lead to a loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please open a ticket on our <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord server</a> with any questions or concerns during the deprecation period and please be sure to REMOVE your ZEN from TokenMint BEFORE March 6th, 2024, as the funds will be permanently lost after that date.</p>
<p>How to Send ZEN to the Horizen Mainchain from Cobalt Wallet</p>
 
 Open your Cobalt Wallet and make sure you are connected to the TokenMint chain.&nbsp; 
 In the Assets and Activity page, click the ZEN row. The page now allows you to send ZEN. It displays the current amount available. 
 Click the up arrow to send a transaction. 
 In the Send to field, enter the desired address you want to send the ZEN to. This field will display an error, if you enter an invalid address. 
 In the Amount field, enter the amount of the ZEN you want to send. 
 In the password field, enter your password to complete the transaction. 
 Click Submit. The Sent flag appears indicating that the transaction is successful. 
 Click Back to display the transaction activity. The Send page appears. If the transaction is pending, a notification will appear stating that the last pending transaction for this address has not been confirmed. Note that it can take up to 72 hours for the transaction to show on the destination wallet, even if the transaction is confirmed on the TokenMint explorer.
