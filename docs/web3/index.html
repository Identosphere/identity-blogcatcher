<p>Today we’re announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards. An initial group of invitees—and soon Brave users around the world—will be able to receive BAT earned from Brave Rewards to a self-custody wallet address on the Solana blockchain.</p>

 Invite only to start 
<p>Rewards on Solana is launching as an invite-only feature, starting with a limited group of early participants. Brave will send out invitations via a notification in the Brave Rewards panel. This invitation will unlock the ability for users to connect a self-custody Solana address and start receiving BAT on-chain. To find out if you’re eligible, keep an eye on Brave Rewards in your Brave browser.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Invitees will receive a notification in the Rewards panel and new tab page</p>
<p>To connect a Solana address to Brave Rewards, you’ll use a Solana wallet to verify that you own the address. You can do this with Brave’s very own integrated wallet, <a>Brave Wallet</a>, or with a third-party browser extension like Phantom.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Solana address connected to Brave Rewards</p>
<p>Once connected, monthly BAT rewards will be deposited directly on-chain to your Solana address in Wormhole-bridged <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">SPL-BAT</a>. That means you’ll be able to receive earned BAT without a custodial account (though the option to receive BAT rewards via a custodian will remain available).</p>

 Only possible on Solana 
<p>We chose Solana as the ideal network for the launch of on-chain Brave Rewards given its high transaction speed and low fees, which help reduce the costs associated with distributing BAT earnings to hundreds of thousands of users. For example, a single transaction on Solana costs on average $0.002 USD, while a single transaction on Ethereum, or on its most popular layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, costs on average <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$1.00 and $0.10 respectively</a>.</p>
<p>This new way of distributing BAT removes many of the barriers everyday people face when onboarding to Web3. There are no withdrawal fees or limits, since the Solana wallet is entirely owned and managed by the user. Users can earn and receive BAT directly on-chain, and use it on-chain however they like. For example, here are some great ways BAT can be used on Solana:</p>
 
 Contribute directly to your favorite <a>Brave creators with on-chain contributions</a> (details below) 
 Exchange between hundreds of tokens through the swap feature in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/13397025065357-What-are-Brave-Swaps-">Brave Wallet</a> 
 Buy a .SOL domain from <a href="https://www.bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a> 
 Earn trading fees by depositing SPL-BAT to <a href="https://www.orca.so/">Orca</a> liquidity pools 
 Mint and buy <a>NFTs</a> with SPL-BAT 
 

 Support your favorite creators on-chain 
<p>We also <a>recently announced a new on-chain contributions feature</a> as a more Web3-native way for users to support their favorite creators, including with the SPL-BAT they earn. Supporting self custody for users and creators is an important step toward a more decentralized Brave Rewards and Brave Creators experience. Together, they further our mission of providing users with greater control over how they browse, search, and transact on the Web.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our blog, social accounts, and <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Community</a> forums for the latest news from Brave, and announcements about new rounds of Solana on-chain invites.</p>

<p>Last September, we <a>released a roadmap</a> of innovations for <a>Leo</a>, Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve completed another piece of the roadmap: Leo can now interact with PDFs and Google Drive files. By seamlessly integrating with these popular productivity apps and document types, Leo enables users to save time and accomplish more at school and work, while preserving user privacy.</p>

 How we built document support 
<p>Brave’s built-in AI assistant Leo has recently gained new capabilities for understanding how to help users while using web-based tools and workflows. Specifically:</p>
 
 
<p>By using the accessibility tree in a PDF’s metadata, Leo can understand the underlying semantic structure of PDF documents.</p>
 
 
<p>By leveraging a technique called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on canvas-rendered apps, Leo can use an image of a page to extract text in Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>
 
 
<p>In both cases, Leo can offer insights and suggestions for users working with many different productivity applications, whether at school or at work.</p>

 Use cases for Leo’s document integrations 
<p>With this novel use of the accessibility tree, OCR, and other techniques, Leo can help with several important use cases. These include:</p>
 
 
<p>PDFs: Leo can extract topics and data deep within PDF documents. This can help with understanding research papers, preparing analysis from reports, finding details in a technical specification document, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Docs: When you’re editing a Google Doc, Leo can propose relevant terms or writing styles, or even review the document as a whole.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Sheets: Leo can analyze tables and data in a Google Sheet, and even suggest formulas.</p>
 
 
<p>Slack workspaces: Leo can highlight key discussion points from a thread in a Slack workspace, extracting the thread’s essential points while saving you the time of reading the entire thread history.</p>
 
 
<p>YouTube: Leo can produce video transcripts from classes, industry events, and influencer videos. These transcripts can then be summarized for useful details mentioned in the video, and allow the user to ask Leo follow-up questions about the video or the transcript.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo—and its document integrations—is no different. This is particularly relevant as work and school documents may contain sensitive information:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Just as Leo utilizes these techniques to preserve your privacy as you chat, it offers the same protections when Leo is helping you analyze documents and other files.&nbsp;</p>

 How to use Leo for PDFs and Google Drive files 
<p>Leo’s support for PDFs, Google Docs, and Google Sheets is available now for all Brave desktop users on version 1.63 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try it out, simply open a PDF, Google Doc, or Google Sheet in a tab in the Brave browser. Then click the  in the sidebar, and start asking Leo questions about the file.</p>
<p>Don’t have Leo in the sidebar yet? Just click Settings, then click Leo, and toggle on the Show Leo icon in the sidebar option.</p>

 What’s next for Leo and document / file support? 
<p>Leo will soon support other documents and file types. For example, Leo will integrate with GitHub, allowing code reviewers to summarize the purpose and impact of pull requests by analyzing code changes without line-by-line inspection. Keep an eye out for announcements about GitHub support, and for even more document and file integrations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we saw Leo as far more than an AI chatbot (though it can handle real-time, contextual chats with ease). Rather, we saw Leo as a true smart assistant that could help you engage with the applications you use every day, to help you learn, work, and plan more efficiently. By surfacing insights from within PDFs, suggesting text for Google Docs, writing formulas for Google Sheets, summarizing YouTube videos, analyzing code in GitHub (and more), Leo saves you time and makes you more efficient and productive.</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>It is our honor to announce the two year anniversary of the Shade Protocol governance &amp; utility token: SHD.

This is because despite vesting progression &amp; completion for various categories (private raise, grants, dev fund, etc.) many entities have chosen to not claim their earned SHD — thus not directly impacting circulating supply (yet). Another key disclaimer is that of the 1.8M SHD dev fund, none of the dev fund SHD is staked / nor active in any capacity so as to not impact staking yield or governance proposals.</p> Protocol Liquidity Matching <p>Another distribution component to note is Protocol Liquidity Match (PLM) — a novel mechanism whereby Shade Protocol loans out tokens in collaboration with other protocols to bootstrap liquidity. This model is favorable as it does not involve an OTC and does not involve any emissions. However, this deal structure was invented prior to full blown decentralized governance; the core contributors are not comfortable categorizing PLM as “LP” without a community vote. As of right now PLM is handled and accounted for from the dev fund until a formal ratification of categorization via the community pool. The following are the 11 protocols that have been partnered with on liquidity deals (accounting for 40%+ worth of ShadeSwap’s volume) for both PLM &amp; OTC liquidity deals:</p>  Kujira  Manta  Andromeda  FINA  Persistence  Levana  Archway  Composable  White Whale  Sienna  Stride   Onwards To Governance <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119">https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119</a><p>With the passing of <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/280">prop 280</a> Shade Protocol has helped spearhead and coordinate the cross deployment of DAO DAO which will be usable as open source code by various protocols on Secret Network.

For example, when generating key shares with a threshold of 2, an attacker could silently increase that value to e.g. 3. Thus, two participants would never be able to successfully generate signatures since three or more would be required. Additionally, if the attacker increases the threshold to a number higher than the number of shares, then it would be totally impossible to generate valid signatures. In the Zcash context, this could mean that deposits made into a freshly-generated FROST wallet could become unspendable, leading to loss of funds.</p><p>We do agree that this is a confirmed and important vulnerability, which has been successfully remediated by adding <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/e1fb9bc953a5ea5c22304c0018f56f407163f101">a simple check</a> to make sure the polynomials generated have the correct number of coefficients. This fix is included in the recently published 1.0.0 stable release of our FROST implementation. We are not aware of any production-ready FROST Zcash deployments using our software, so no user funds should be at risk.</p><p>We thank Trail of Bits for identifying the issue, providing a test case showing our crate was vulnerable and coordinating its disclosure.</p>

<p>The traditional clouds (AWS, GCP, and Azure) are getting dated. They continue to be the standard for the vast majority of cloud workloads, of course, but they are built around a set of operational practices that were more relevant a decade ago. Lately, we’ve seen the rise of a number of hosting platforms that are better aligned with modern development practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These include Fly.io, Railway, and even front-end platforms such as Netlify and Vercel (which sometimes are built on traditional clouds). The benefits of these new platforms can be functional — Fly.io, for example, has far simpler multi-region support than AWS — but they also get adopted because they have better native support for modern applications frameworks and practices, and a far better developer experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, storage has been a key issue for moving applications wholesale to these new clouds. Offering a robust cloud storage solution is a very complex operational and technical problem. And so, many applications adopt these new clouds for the front end, but keep the back end on a traditional cloud where there is a traditional cloud storage service like Amazon S3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why I’m so excited to announce our investment in Tigris, as well as the release of its globally available S3-compatible distributed object-storage service. Tigris is built to make the application developer’s job as simple as possible. It allows an application to write in any region, and to read in any region. Heck, you can even write confliction updates in multiple regions at the same time and Tigris will resolve the updates and give a consistent global view of the data. It truly is a global multi-master storage platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a key service for application developers who are looking to get away from the provisioning headaches and clunky interfaces of the traditional clouds. And, as a casual dev on evenings, it’s one I’ve been hoping someone would build for years.</p>
<p>There are very few teams who have the background to build and run such a solution, which is why I was so excited when I ran into Ovais Tariq and the Tigris team. The Tigris co-founders ran the global storage team for Uber, and had significant experience building on FoundationDB when we first met. (FoundationDB has been used to build global object-storage systems internally at companies like Apple.) We talked at length about how now was finally the right time to build a global object-storage system given the number of new cloud platforms like Fly.io, in addition to new applications being built around Javascript frameworks on hosting platforms like Netlify and Vercel.</p>
<p>And so here we are, with that vision having been realized. Tigris is so simple to use, I strongly recommend you give it a try — even for your evening hacking project like I do. I’m certain you’ll not want to go back to the traditional clouds again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is excited to announce the first stable release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">frost-core</a>, a reference implementation of Two-Round Threshold Schnorr Signatures with FROST, written in Rust. This implementation has been <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">fully audited</a> and conforms to the latest and final version of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IRTF draft specification</a>, which we are confident will soon make it as a final Informational RFC.&nbsp;</p>



 



 What FROST does and why it matters 



<p>FROST is a threshold multi-party signature scheme. It allows a key to be split into multiple shares (or even to be created in a distributed fashion without having to create an original unsplit key), and then enables creating a signature by aggregating multiple signature shares created by participants who hold key shares. The threshold means that a minimum number of participants are required to be able to create a signature.</p>



<p>In the context of Zcash, this means that FROST allows creating wallets where transactions have to be authorized by multiple participants. This has multiple benefits: it’s more robust, since if a participant loses a share, it is still possible for the other participants to sign transactions (and they can help to reissue the lost share); and in the same vein, if a participant gets hacked, the attacker won’t be able to solely sign transactions.</p>



<p>With the <a href="http://www.github.com/zcashfoundation/frost">frost</a> Rust library, the Zcash Foundation provides a reference implementation for the informational “Two-Round Schnorr Threshold Signatures with FROST” CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) Internet Draft. The CFRG is a general forum for discussing and reviewing uses of cryptographic mechanisms and is part of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which in turn promotes research of importance to the evolution of the Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology.</p>



<p>This release includes the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/tree/main/frost-rerandomized">frost-rerandomized</a> variant, an adaptation to the FROST threshold signature scheme to make it unlinkable, which is a requirement for its use in the Zcash protocol. The adapted scheme generates signatures that are compatible with spend authorization signatures in the Zcash protocol, for the Sapling and Orchard network upgrades. This makes it possible for Zcash transactions to be authorized by more than one party, while preserving the privacy of individual signers.</p>



 



 Privacy-preserving threshold multi-party signatures for Zcash 



<p>Now that the frost reference implementation is production-ready we look forward to the acceptance of <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/662">ZIP-312: “Shielded Multisignatures using FROST”</a> and its implementation in the Zcash ecosystem. We will continue to work on a set of demos to show how some of the challenges for integration into wallets may be solved, as well as to provide a reference for implementers.</p>



<p>We would like to thank the following current and past ZF team members for their contributions to the FROST reference implementation; without their work and support, we would not have reached this milestone today:&nbsp;</p>

<p>We would also like to thank all of the numerous external contributors to the spec and code base.</p>

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>

 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights a series of key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an AMA session featuring Panther Protocol’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, and Head of Community, Joris Koopman.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-NfX_4ldY&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Watch the recording</a> for full insights into our latest testnet updates, testing processes, reward systems, and upcoming testnet releases.</p> Panther testnet video guide for account creation <p>You asked – we delivered! Panther has received numerous requests to provide support materials dedicated to the account creation process. For a step-by-step video guide detailing how to make your very own testnet Panther account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3LhZKvM_U&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">check out our tutorial video</a>. Once you have your account set up, the video will also show you how to get started earning $ZKP rewards. All you need is a MetaMask wallet and 10 minutes!&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 800+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a 3rd party Bundler service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.</p><p>Users will be able to submit transactions via Bundlers and pay gas fees in $ZKP instead of $Matic (on Mumbai testnet but similarly on Polygon) from the Panther Gas account that holds $zZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Integration testing is underway, with two end-to-end Bundler providers operating successfully. Changes on the dApp side are expected to reach completion as we utilize resources from other stages of development taking place in parallel.</p> Enhancement Stage - 1 developments <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage was slated to implement various fixes from previous stages along with a feature for Gas Management. This key feature allows users to move their $zZKP inside MASP from the regular balance to the Panther Account Gas balance and vice versa. Gas Management plays a significant role enabling users to top up their Gas balance and make sure they have sufficient $zZKP to pay for various transaction costs.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes overall fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. Stage 6 allows users to test:</p>  Fee deductions from the Panther Gas account and payment to 3rd parties such as Compliance providers and Bundler service providers.  Protocol fee deductions in a transacted token currently set to be charged on Withdraw.  Basic disclosures that allow Panther users to provide adequate transaction reporting to outside parties issuing requests that can be satisfied by independent on-chain verification.  &nbsp;A zAccount renewal function (after the expiry date). This feature functions in a similar manner to KYC renewals.  <p>Additional smart contract and testing changes are in progress, and will require one more week to complete. Following the completion of these changes, development on the dApp will begin.&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

  Partnering with LangChain: The LLM Application Framework  <p>Harrison, Ankush and their team are building the AI programming framework every engineer needs.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/romie-boyd/">Romie Boyd</a>	 



Published February 15, 2024
  



Team LangChain



 
<p>We are at the dawn of a new age of applications, with large language models (LLMs) as the enabling technology. But programming an LLM remains more art than science. The instructions that generate robust, reliable performance out of these non-deterministic models remain poorly understood. We are still in a wild west of prompt hacking, eyeballing outputs and a lot of duct tape when it comes to Generative AI.</p>



<p>We have seen this movie play out before. In Software 1.0, frameworks such as React and Next have abstracted, modularized and organized the most common building blocks of software engineering, making it fast and reliable to build and test your next mobile app or website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI, too, deserves a proper programming framework. Developers are craving a common set of best practices and composable building blocks for their LLM applications, to simplify the complex and to avoid reinventing the wheel. <a href="https://langchain.com/">LangChain</a> founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola have designed just that: an open-source toolkit for building sophisticated, data-aware applications on top of LLMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineering teams use LangChain to accomplish a myriad of tasks: accessing datasets to power retrieval-augmented generation (LangChain boasts over 600 integrations); running “chains,” or collections of calls, to enable more complex applications (some companies run chains with thousands of links or more); giving LLMs access to external tools; and using LLMs as full-fledged “agents” capable of planning and reasoning to accomplish goals.</p>



<p>Zooming out, LangChain is a platform that allows companies to build the scaffolding of their applications’ cognitive architectures. It is paving the way for developers to build much more powerful LLM applications, going beyond simple one-shot queries to the intelligent, interconnected systems in which these reasoning engines truly shine. The more complex LLM operations are what allow for jaw-dropping results, and we at Sequoia believe that LangChain can be a force multiplier on the pace and quality of AI application and agent development.</p>



<p>Harrison was a standout machine learning engineer at our portfolio company Robust Intelligence when he started LangChain as a nights-and-weekends side project, with no plans to build a company. But after he released the first version, it quickly took off. He quickly started working with Ankush, a star colleague from Robust. From the start, they have been humble, responsive, and fast—all key ingredients for keeping up in the quickly evolving world of generative AI. And above all, they are community-first, spearheading a community of more than 2,000 open-source contributors.</p>



<p>Today, more than 50,000 LLM applications have been built using LangChain, with use cases ranging from internal apps to autonomous agents to games to chat automation to security scanners and more. And while the platform is already a mainstay at weekend hackathons, we have also been excited to see many of our portfolio companies moving their LangChain use cases into production. Soon, your delivery order or customer support or gaming experience may be powered by LangChain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there is more to come. To continue the Software 1.0 analogy, developers benefit not just from open-source frameworks like React and Next, but also services such as GitHub, Datadog, Vercel and Heroku to deploy and monitor their applications into production. LangChain’s ambitions are similarly expansive.</p>



<p>The company’s latest “big bet” is <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a>, a product that helps developers debug, test and monitor their LLM applications. As customers move from prototyping into production, LangSmith is providing the visibility and tooling they need to make their generative AI applications more performant and reliable. Elastic powers their Elastic AI Assistant for security in LangChain and leverages LangSmith for visibility helping them get to production fast. Rakuten relies on LangSmith for rigorous testing and benchmarking so they can make tradeoff decisions about their copilot Rakuten AI for Business, built in LangChain, in a systematic way. And Moody’s relies on LangSmith for automated eval, easy debugging and experimentation so they can quickly iterate and innovate.</p>



<p>Since the announcement of LangSmith’s closed beta in July, 70,000 users have signed up and more than 5,000 companies now use LangSmith every month. We look forward to seeing that list grow with the product now in GA. More recent product launches include LangServe, an easy way to deploy LangChain into production, and LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.</p>



<p>Even all of this is still just a taste of what LangChain has in the pipeline. The team is building in a rich problem space with plenty to explore, and they are guided by a passionate user community with no shortage of important problems for them to solve.</p>



<p>We are thrilled to partner with LangChain and lead their Series A.</p>

  Sequoia Open Source Fellowship: Applications Now Open  <p>Calling all open source developers to pursue your projects with no strings attached.
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published February 15, 2024
  



 
<p>Last year we introduced the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship with the goal of encouraging the development of open source software and supporting the community of open source developers. More than ever, open source serves as the bedrock and lifeblood of the world’s software, with companies of all sizes utilizing OSS. The entire ecosystem relies on libraries and software packages—often solely maintained by open source developers. While Sequoia has partnered with many companies that found success commercializing OSS, the non-commercial spirit of open source collaboration underpins almost every aspect of modern technology. The fellowship was designed to support this work without any expectation of an equity stake in a commercial project or company.</p>



<p>We started the fellowship as an invite-only program. This year, we are excited to announce that we are opening applications to the public. Starting today, any developer working on an open source project may apply for a fellowship stipend. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open source software is critically important for ensuring that progress continues to come from every corner of the globe and not just from a few companies in Silicon Valley. We see a pressing need for collaboration, for developers to collectively push forward what new technologies are capable of in ways that serve the entire ecosystem and the public good.</p>



<p>To apply, simply complete our brief questionnaire and we’ll be in touch if your project is a good fit. We will primarily be focused on existing open source projects. Fellows will receive a stipend to cover reasonable living expenses for 6 to 12 months. They will continue to own the fruits of their labor—any code written before, during and after the program will remain entirely the fellow’s. Sequoia will not take equity or expect anything in exchange for the sponsorship. We plan to accept 2 to 3 fellows per year.</p>



<p>If you’re building something exciting in open source, we want to hear from you. Applications are now open—see <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/oss">here</a> to apply.</p>

<p>The serverless platform shift is unfolding at a rapid pace. By that, we mean services that scale to zero, are globally distributed, and scale up based on demand. Having spent the last few years studying this market, we observed two key drivers behind the adoption of this platform shift — one architectural, and the other organizational.</p>
<p>First, application logic is becoming event-driven for new apps, necessitated by high volume and low-latency communication between third-party APIs and microservices. The benefit is that each service can scale up and down independently, but it requires an elastic caching or queuing mechanism to buffer the interactions between services. What’s more, because modern platforms like Vercel, Fly.io, and Netlify are serverless in nature, it pushes all the data services in the stack to be serverless, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the “no DevOps” effort is particularly appealing for organizations aiming to minimize the operational overhead related to scaling and maintenance. It allows for a leaner web team structure without sacrificing feature velocity, and truly gives developers the freedom to build for customer value, instead of managing infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a year ago, we started seeing <a href="https://upstash.com/">Upstash</a> show up as a popular key-value store choice for new applications. Developers loved the intuitive onboarding and the meticulous design of the SDKs. By relying on Upstash as the extended devops team to handle scaling and reliability, product teams can focus more of their time on things that create a delightful end-user experience. A year later, Upstash powers caching and messaging for tens of thousands of production applications across four different products.</p>
<p>Many popular AI applications also rely on Upstash’s rate limiting and caching SDK when working through the quirks of OpenAI’s SLA. They also just unveiled a truly serverless vector data store that’s native to the modern web stack and capable of supporting a large amount of data with great performance and sleek developer experience (the thing about Upstash that first caught our attention).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building such a highly reliable and scalable data fabric requires a team with deep distributed systems knowledge, as well as a strong database background. This is exactly what founders Enes, Mehmet, and Bilal bring to the table. Through years of experience building developer infrastructure, they realized the importance of a robust cloud offering and a data platform that can scale and support multiple use cases from key-value stores to search. More importantly, their unique product instinct and taste for what developers love has positioned them uniquely in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more application logic disseminates into transactional backends (as explained in <a href="https://a16z.com/the-modern-transactional-stack/">this</a> blog post), we believe there’s a huge need for an entirely serverless data layer to power development teams with reliable, fast, and easy-to-use products for all the transitions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why we’re so proud to invest in Upstash, and to help their team build this serverless future where more application developers can bring their dream apps to fruition!</p>

<p>The biotech industry is built on one of the cleanest go-to-market strategies in existence: if you make a safe drug that really works, patients are likely to receive it and payors are likely to pay for it. This simplicity is of course shrouded in the complexity of biology, and demands that biotech companies thoughtfully de-risk existential concerns throughout the drug development lifecycle. But how can biotech teams effectively communicate to investors and partners how they will, with each round of financing, incrementally reduce the risks of discovering and developing successful new drugs? One powerful avenue is through the use of an exceptionally well-curated, comprehensive, and accessible virtual data room (VDR)! VDRs don’t just support external financing campaigns, but can also serve as valuable tools for pharma-facing business development deals in growing biotech companies. One of the most common questions we get from early stage founders is “what should I put in my data room?” Here, we’re sharing an actionable guide for biotech leadership teams as they start the process of building or renovating their own data room.</p>
 What must be included: the MVP of VDRs  
<p>So what are the essential must-haves in your VDR? Based on our evaluation across hundreds of biotech VDRs at a16z Bio + Health, we’ve assembled a list of what we believe should be included in the “MVP” (minimal viable product) of VDRs. Together, these documents will help distill not only your vision for the current fundraise, but more broadly the long-term differentiation and trajectory of your company.</p>
 Company overview deck 
<p>If you’re under CDA with an investor, this is where to add your expanded confidential pitch deck (typically, you’ve already shared a non-confidential deck over email). In this confidential deck, consider providing as much information as possible to accelerate the diligence process, including details about any underlying technical platform, your intended near-term pipeline targets and substantive program-specific data (e.g., key in vivo data results).</p>
 Deep dives on your programs 
<p>For each program, develop a series of vignettes that address each of the following: the current market/unmet need, competitive landscape, why your company has a differentiated insight or modality advantage when pursuing this particular target, and the full extent of preclinical and clinical data available.</p>
 Gantt chart for the fundraise 
<p>Where does this round of funding get your team? What milestones do you intend to hit along the way (e.g., platform validation; or, 2 DCs; or, 1 program entering the clinic with a follow-on pipeline; or, early clinical POC data)? Adding a Gantt chart for the fundraise that neatly arranges your intended trajectory across all programs will achieve two important goals: it provides thoughtful rationale for the current funding requirements, and also reveals how your platform and pipeline will mature over the next round.</p>
 Business development strategy 
<p>While rare for earlier stage companies, those that have secured BD partnerships should consider including as much detail as possible around the structure of your partnership and how it is progressing. This helps investors understand sources of BD partner excitement, early partner feedback, what additional non-dilutive funding may exist, and also indicates what types of downstream economics are likely when valuing partnered programs. If you’re building a horizontal business model (e.g., not building your own pipeline and rather seeking to enable a partner biopharma organizations), projections on deal volume and average deal size are a must.</p>
 Intellectual property 
<p>Here the goal is to help diligence teams understand what the company’s IP position is and demonstrate a clear-eyed recognition of the differentiation and defensibility of your platform. Include copies of any patents or trademarks that have been filed, as well as IP licensing or option agreements that have been executed. It can also be helpful to show the summary of a freedom to operate (FTO) analysis, to show investors that pre-existing IP or other in-flight filings are unlikely to represent a competitive threat.</p>
 Finance 
<p>While the Gantt chart outlines the high-level use of proceeds and associated progress during the next financing round, this is where additional granularity is appropriate. How has money been spent to date, and how do you plan to spend it going forward? How is the company’s go-forward budget split across platform investments and program-specific spend? How much of the total financing is allocated towards the lead program? What is the split between pre-clinical and clinical R&amp;D expenditures? These are all common questions you’ll hear from biotech investors. Specific documents that can help communicate the answers to these questions include:</p>
 Use of proceeds 
<p>What is the rationale for the amount you are raising and how do you plan to spend it? This is a simple table in which each row represents a spend category, and the sum of each row is roughly the quantum of capital which you are currently raising. It divides the total financing proceeds into G&amp;A functions (both headcount and categories like real estate), platform R&amp;D, and program-specific R&amp;D (often further subdivided by each stage of development, CMC, etc). This budget is important to demonstrate to investors that you are planning ahead and have a realistic view of the runway that new capital will support.</p>
 Financial statements (historical and forecasted) 
<p>Some companies choose to include historical and forecasted income statements in the data room. This level of detail can help investors understand what the most capital intensive aspects of your company have been, and, importantly, how that may change in the next phase of company building.</p>
 Capitalization table 
<p>Adding a current cap table can help investors understand important financing details such as whether there remains a sufficient quantity of option pool equity for future hiring, how founder equity is shared among multiple founders, and what the relative distribution of company equity across existing investors looks like. It is also OK to wait to share this particular piece of information until an investor expresses clear interest, and a desire to move towards consideration of a term sheet.</p>
 Bonus content that helps your VDR really shine: the nice-to-haves  
<p>This section includes additional ways to streamline the data sharing process and highlights unique ways to demonstrate a robust vision for company growth. </p>
 Background reading 
<p>What are the publications or other background information that investors or partners will need to catch up on in order to thoroughly evaluate your platform and/or programs? Make it easy on them and provide it here. This may include foundational work from academic founders or related work in the field more broadly.</p>
 Pipeline prioritization framework 
<p>Top-down or bottom-up? Have you “turned over every stone” for all targets amenable to your modality or platform construction, or did you take an indication-centric approach to building your pipeline? Walking investors through the decision process leading to your current pipeline programs informs your broader strategy, and reveals how you may add additional future programs.</p>
 Raw data 
<p>Some investors may want to see what the spread in plotted data looks like outside of a deck-polished graph. Providing access to raw data for few key experiments to enable plot replication will send a positive signal on your underlying position on data transparency.</p>
 An “investment memo” 
<p>Part of the investor’s job is to establish a case for why an investment in your company should be considered. Typically, this takes the form of a written description outlining the strengths, current areas of focus, vision for the biggest form of your company, and the ways in which this opportunity is differentiated from the competition. Developing your own investment memo may help further crystallize your vision and longer-term ambitions while also allowing you to flex a long-form written description on the upside for your approach.</p>
 Anonymized FAQs from prior and/or current diligence processes 
<p>Not all investors home in on the same diligence questions, and not all potential BD partnerships will be concerned with future pipeline development. However, collating the output of prior and current ongoing diligence Q&amp;A may reveal previously unforeseen strengths in your approach, and will certainly exhibit the technical breadth and depth of your team in providing the responses. It can also save you from repeatedly answering the same diligence questions!</p>
 Investor-specific Q&amp;A docs from this diligence process 
<p>Frequently, investors or BD partners will ask you to respond to one or more sets of written diligence questions. It’s helpful to document these questions and your responses, and share those investor-specific Q&amp;A sets in the VDR (with viewer permissions allowing the documents to be visible only to that specific investor). While you have undoubtedly already shared these responses by email or live discussion, it’s helpful to see all the correspondence documents in one place.</p>
 Legal agreements 
<p>Although there’s no need to flood the data room with every legal document signed throughout the company’s existence, it’s helpful to share relevant documents outlining your company’s major IP filings, external contractual agreements (e.g., academic technology in-licensing terms, sponsored research agreements, business development contracts) and obligations going forward (e.g. substantial real estate lease agreements).</p>
 Human Resources 
<p>The HR section should include consulting agreements, recruiting agreements, and any specific board/director expertise not already covered in your confidential investor deck. Some companies also choose to provide a deep-dive on their full organization here, with CVs of key leaders; this is not necessary, but can occasionally be additive.</p>
 What to exclude  
<p>To ensure you’re spending more time on science, and less on VDR construction, there are a few things that are typically unnecessary and you may consider specifically excluding them or pushing back on investors who ask for such information too early in the financing process.</p>
 Items not covered under CDA 
<p>If it isn’t outlined in the executed CDA, it likely doesn’t need to be included. Don’t overshare irrelevant corporate information.</p>
 Ultra-sensitive information 
<p>Documents under attorney/client privilege shouldn’t be included in your VDR. Additionally, do not share protein or nucleic acid sequences or chemical structures for your lead molecules. The same holds for very specific details about your platform, such as exact library composition, or an exhaustive list of all targets discovered. These data can be shared with additional protection with a smaller handful of investors who have expressed strong interest in investing and are conducting deeper, confirmatory diligence.</p>
 Board minutes &amp; board decks 
<p>Board minutes are often too general and don’t significantly aid in due diligence. Similarly, previous board decks are outdated and might not reflect the current and future direction of your company. Unless an investor specifically asks for them, it’s usually OK to omit both.</p>
 Litany of “extra” legal docs 
<p>Office leases for small spaces, employee offer letters, etc. are essential pieces of the operating pie, but won’t typically sway an investment/partnership decision and can be excluded unless specifically requested.</p>
 How to execute  
<p>The vendor you select, the hierarchical organization, and security/tracking privileges are all important considerations to keep in mind when getting your VDR off the ground. Remember, the goal of your VDR is to facilitate communication with potential investors and/or partners and therefore you should be optimizing for clear, organized information that is easy to navigate.</p>
 Vendor considerations 
<p>We recommend you research and choose a vendor that covers your needs. Example vendors include Egnyte, ShareVault, Box, DocSend, Citrix, ShareFile, Datasite, and many, many others. Regardless of which you choose, make sure to clearly communicate to investors that they should expect to receive a data room access email (and who from)—these are often sent to spam or lost in the deluge of daily emails, so make it easy for them to find!</p>
 Hierarchical organization 
<p>Your file system should follow an interpretable logic. More directories are better than fewer, denser ones. Make it easy for the person doing diligence to find what they’re looking for. Additionally, automated indexing is a plus and will help avoid clogging the VDR with deprecated document versions.</p>
<p></p>
 Access and tracking 
<p>Universal access to a VDR is unnecessary. Limiting access to very specific subsets of investor/partner team members is appropriate. Adding document watermarks and view-only permissions will also drive transparency. Lastly, tracking metrics on access history with time-specific logs is often a great way to clarify just how serious an investor’s interest is, and who specifically from their team has been spending time digging into your data.</p>
 Sharing lead compositions 
<p>Late into the diligence process, investors may want to understand some finer-grained details on your lead molecules. It’s understandable to be hesitant in sharing molecular structures or sequences. One mechanism to assuage concerns regarding novelty or differentiation is to set up a 3rd party review process with a trusted consultant. Typically, these consultants can share their analysis back with potential investors in a way that directly answers investor questions and fairly highlights areas for development.</p>
 Conclusion  
<p>A thoughtfully constructed virtual data room is critical for biotech companies wanting to clearly convey their vision and strategy to potential investors and business development partners. By including key documents covering platform, programs, milestones, IP, finances, and more, founders can readily share the information required for diligence in an organized, trackable manner. Ultimately, a robust VDR helps derisk biotech companies and ensures your precious time and capital can remain focused on science and patients. With the right preparation and execution, virtual data rooms enable management teams to open their doors to key partners on the journey of transforming promising science into approved medicines that improve lives.</p>

Metadata leaks with every single online interaction.</p><p>The mixnet achieves this by splitting data into identically sized encrypted Sphinx packets and dispersing these in three hops to ‘mix nodes’ worldwide at randomized intervals. Next, the mixnet shuffles in dummy ‘cover’ traffic, further complicating tracing. Together these features make tracking metadata patterns impossible even for powerful adversaries with a global view of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Nym and Zcash share the same vision of privacy for everyone. The invention of Zcash by the Electric Coin Company has already made great strides to defend user privacy by bringing zero-knowledge proofs to market, an innovation that many other projects are now building upon. However, like every technology, zero-knowledge proofs remain vulnerable at the transport layer of the internet — a problem acknowledged <a href="http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf">in the original Zerocash whitepaper</a>.</p><p>Powerful adversaries can analyze traffic patterns such as the stream of TCP/IP packets used to submit transactions, which can then be used to de-anonymize users. ISPs can snoop on traffic patterns to passively record Zcash activity. And the growing crypto surveillance industry can passively spy on peer-to-peer traffic, as well as conduct active&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Even advanced privacy protections like Zcash’s auto-shielding feature are vulnerable at the network layer. For example: if an adversary obtained a Zcash user’s transaction address, or extracted it from a unified address, they could then send a transaction to the address. Then, they could observe the user’s wallet as it broadcasts the t2z auto-shielding transaction. By repeating this process, the attacker could obtain more granular details such as IP measurements, and track these over&nbsp;time.</p><p>“We at Nym believe people deserve privacy — it is an alienable right to a dignified life free from gross intrusion and interference,” said Harry Halpin, cofounder and CEO at Nym Technologies. “But in the digital realm, intrusion and interference are simply the normal state of affairs. This is unsustainable and needs to change. With this groundbreaking integration, Nym and Zcash are working together to make real privacy online a reality.”</p><p>Josh Swihart, CEO of ECC (Electric Coin Company), said: “I’m extremely pleased to see Nym come to life on the Zcash network. Network-level privacy has been a missing piece since Zcash’s inception. This partnership between these two projects will significantly deepen protections from everyday users wishing to protect their financial privacy. It’s fantastic to see the privacy ecosystem come together.”</p><p>Jason McGee of Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) said: “ZCG is excited to support Nym’s proposal to enhance network-level privacy protections for Zcash. This effort aligns with our core mission to advance the Zcash network, and underscores ZCG’s commitment to addressing challenging issues related to privacy and security. By integrating Nym’s mixnet technology into Zcash’s lightwalletd infrastructure, Nym is laying the foundation for future integrations with Zcash nodes and wallets. Our hope is that this collaboration marks the beginning of a long-term partnership that results in significant improvements in privacy protections for Zcash&nbsp;users.”</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-begins-integration-for-complete-privacy-protection-on-zcash-ecosystem-7452d1ea7141">Nym Begins Integration For Complete Privacy Protection On Zcash Ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Brave now offers a fully native version for ARM64 Windows. When you newly install Brave on your ARM64 device, then you get an even faster browser. Read on to learn more, or skip to the end to find out how to get the new version.</p>

 What is ARM64, and why is it important? 
<p>ARM64 is a newer type of CPU, developed for speed and efficiency. Every computer has a processor (or “CPU”) that acts a little like a brain. Processors can be made in different architectures that essentially govern at a low level how the CPU works. Typical architectures are the 32-bit x86 architecture and the more recent 64-bit x64 architecture.</p>
<p>You can only run programs on your computer that are compatible with your CPU architecture. For example, you cannot run a program made for x64 on an x86 processor.</p>
<p>Software companies get around this by offering multiple versions of their programs. So you can, for example, download an x86 version of Brave if you are on an x86 CPU, and an x64 version if your computer’s processor has the x64 architecture.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most Windows computers have an x64 CPU. But recently, another architecture has entered the mainstream through products such as Microsoft’s Surface laptops. This architecture is called ARM64 and it offers better power efficiency and performance.</p>

 ARM64 and Brave 
<p>Newer CPU architectures are usually able to run programs with an older architecture. For example, an x64 CPU can run an x86 program. Likewise, ARM64 CPUs can run x64 and x86 programs. But there is a significant performance overhead. In the example of Brave, you could run x64 Brave on an ARM64 computer. But it would be slower than it should be. We therefore spent considerable effort last year to offer an ARM64 version of Brave for Windows.</p>
<p>So what’s necessary to get an ARM64 version of Brave? To create Brave, we write code in programming languages such as C++. The programming language is readable as text by us humans. But CPUs operate in their own machine language. In order for the CPU to be able to run our code, it needs to be translated to machine code with a program called a compiler. We can tell the compiler the architecture of the CPU we want to target. So, mostly, we could take our existing C++ code and tell the compiler to produce machine code for the ARM64 architecture.</p>

 On-demand updates and universal installers 
<p>Given how complex Brave is, there were of course also parts where this process didn’t work quite so seamlessly. The first problem we encountered was the following: When you type <code>brave://settings/help</code> into Brave’s address bar, you get a page that shows Brave’s version. Crucially, this page also checks for a new version of Brave with a little spinning animation. This feature showed an error in x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. After extensive research, we realized that this is caused by a fundamental limitation in the Windows operating system itself.</p>
<p>To work around the problem, we introduced a universal installer which ensures that our users do not accidentally install x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. Instead, they always receive a copy of Brave with the correct architecture for their system. What does this look like? When you go to brave.com and download its installer, then you get a 1 MB .exe file. When you run it, it downloads the latest version of Brave for your CPU architecture from our servers. This ensures that you don’t get the error described above.</p>

 DRM protected content and Widevine 
<p>The second main technical hurdle was caused by an optional and downloadable component of the browser called Widevine. Web sites such as Netflix use this component to protect their content. If you do not have the Widevine component installed, then Netflix (and similar sites) may only serve you low-quality videos, if anything at all.</p>
<p>Widevine is proprietary technology and its licensing terms do not allow us to redistribute it. This means that we can’t just create an ARM64 version of Widevine and include it in Brave. But an ARM64 version of the component can be downloaded from public Google servers. So we do the following: The first time you visit a web site that requires Widevine, we ask you if you agree to downloading and installing the component:</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>If you agree, then Brave downloads and installs Widevine from Google’s public servers. While Brave already worked this way for other architectures, it required a lot of extra work for ARM64. If you are interested in the technical details, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/18695">pull-request #18695</a> on the brave/brave-core repo.</p>

 This sounds great. How do I get ARM64 Brave? 
<p>You need Windows 11 and an ARM64 CPU. To check if your CPU is ARM64, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/check-if-processor-arm64-x64-64bit-windows-11/">How to check if processor is ARM64 or x64 (64-bit) on Windows 11</a> article on pureinfotech.com. If you have an ARM64 CPU, but installed Brave before December of last year, then you need to first uninstall this old copy of Brave to get the newer ARM64 build. When the uninstaller prompts you for confirmation, be sure not to select the check box that says “Also delete your browsing data?”. Once you’ve uninstalled the x64 build of Brave from your ARM64 CPU, go to brave.com, click on the Download button and follow the instructions. When you then type <code>brave://version</code> in Brave’s address bar, you should see “arm64” mentioned on the page.</p>

 Summary 
<p>More and more new Windows computers have ARM64 CPUs. In order for Brave to be as fast as possible, it needs to be optimized for this architecture. We completed this technical work last year. There were some technical challenges on the way, but we were able to overcome them. You can now install ARM64 Brave on Windows 11 by visiting <a>brave.com</a>!</p>

<p>Please note that a version of this conversation originally ran on the <a href="https://hrheretics.substack.com/">HR Heretics</a> podcast. This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.</p>
  Key takeaways 
 
 Write a MOC. A MOC document can help you prioritize what jobs you need an executive to do so you can hire against those needs. 
 Leading by influence, not directive. Build trust with founders and then offer your own data-backed take on why a founder’s decision might not be the best decision they could make.&nbsp; 
 Betting on potential or experience. When you’re betting on experience, you’re betting on someone to continue on their established growth trajectory. When you’re betting on potential, you’re betting on someone’s ability to learn your company and your product. 
 Working sessions. Getting executives out of the 1:1 interview process and into a whiteboard session can help you assess their core competencies and how they’ll work with your team. 
 Talent in 2024. It’s getting more difficult to hire great talent at the growth stages because many companies were expected to go public and get the associated capital infusion from going public.&nbsp; 
 Retaining great talent in a tight market. This has more to do with retention issues and less to do with raising new capital. Retaining employees means resetting their valuations, providing additional equity to true them up.&nbsp; 
 
 Transcript 
<p>Nolan Church: Matt, thanks so much for joining us on HR Heretics. How are you today?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Doing really well. I appreciate both of you inviting me to join you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: So happy you’re here, Matt.&nbsp;</p>
  How a16z talent partners assess talent 
<p>Kelli Dragovich: So Matt, you and I worked together a little bit when I was at Carta. You were the shoulder I would go and cry on anytime I would have some sort of executive-level problem or executive recruiting problem.</p>
<p>Starting with where the world is today: talk to us a little bit about venture’s lens on talent and how does a venture talent partner assess talent?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: So I think it all starts with what your mission and what your role is. And I think the way that we’re structured over here is somewhat different and unique relative to a lot of the other venture talent partners that are out there. We’re coming at it from the lens of not being recruiters. We’re coming at it from the lens of being advisors. We’re coming at it from the lens of being counselors.</p>
<p>When we’re meeting executives, the difference is we’re focusing a lot more on their intangibles, and their soft skills in addition to their functional capabilities, because we’re not really meeting executives and evaluating them for a specific role. We’re meeting them to bring them into our network and be there as a resource to help them further their careers. We’re not necessarily interviewing them for a specific role in the portfolio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when we’re talking to executives and evaluating them, it’s a lot about EQ.For example, how do you take feedback? What are the things that you’re aware of that might be your personal triggers? What do you see as your interpersonal impact in a room? What sort of balance do they have between humility and self-confidence? A lot of those things. We’re also looking at motivations: intrinsic motivations, extrinsic motivations.</p>
<p>We’re doing a lot on critical thinking, like looking at their analytical skills, their business acumen skills. We spend time looking at their org savvy, their leadership skills. All these things that aren’t necessarily role specific, but going to be a lot more relative to who they are as an executive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think then that also plays in—look, I’ve worked with both of you when you were in the portfolio and the conversations that we had were always a bit more strategic around how to approach the role. How can we help the team get calibrated on the role? Who are the best search partners to use, and let then letting you and that search firm run with the execution. And we remained in that advisory capacity, being there to help you with referencing compensation guidance, our views of people that are in process that we know that type of thing.</p>
<p>So I think our lens on talent is going to be a little bit different because the role as the talent partner is defined here very differently.</p>
  Balancing internal and external roles 
<p>Kelli Dragovich: Matt, what percentage of time are you spending on external succession planning, meeting new executives versus advising companies inside the portfolio, and how do you balance that?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: It’s a great question. I think it’s probably about 40% with the portfolio, about 40% with the executive community, and then about 20% on work with the veterans community, which we can get into later. But if you look at portfolio versus external in total, it’s probably about 40–60%, honestly. But, as both of you know, in a given week, it might be 80–20% and then it might be 10–90% the following.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We measure a lot in terms of tracking how we’re spending our time. Where are we putting our energy? Are we putting our energy into meeting new executives? Are we putting our energy into sustaining those relationships by being there to offer counsel or introductions? Are we putting our energy into being on search from update calls? We have a lot of different metrics that we track internally so that we can make sure that we’re keeping a good balance and that there are certain parts of the work that we do that aren’t forgotten or left behind in the heat of the moment.</p>
  Measuring success in talent assessment 
<p>Nolan Church: That’s really interesting. How is your success measured?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: So, we have metrics that kind of roll up as a team. But within that set of metrics, we have a fair amount of flexibility and latitude where we choose to spend our time.</p>
<p>So, for example, when I first started here back in 2012, there was a ton of energy being put towards building a network of executive relationships that is now somewhat more about sustaining those relationships. So the activity and cadence around sustaining that is very different than it is when you’re building.</p>
<p>We’re also measuring the activity with that network in terms of, “hey, how many new execs have you interacted with this year? What have you been able to do for the executive community in terms of the number of counsels you’ve provided, number of introductions you’ve provided. Hey, how many search programs have you worked on with the portfolio? What’s the value you’ve been able to add there in terms of on the search update calls, helping them with MOCs beforehand? How many subject matter experts beforehand were you able to introduce?” All these different things that just help us really figure out what works and what doesn’t work with the portfolio and the executive community, but also as a way to track the amount of energy that we’re generating in terms of our daily work and making sure that we’re getting done what we need to get done.&nbsp;</p>
  The MOC 
<p>Nolan Church: Yeah. You mentioned MOC and the MOC is something I was not aware of before I worked with you all. And it completely blew my mind. I think it’s the best framework for executive hiring that I’ve seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you just describe the MOC to our audience, what it is, and why you guys are so passionate about using it?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: What we really tried to do with the MOC—it stands for mission, outcome, competency.</p>
<p>The mission is the elevator pitch. It’s the 1 or 2 lines that dictate exactly what you want this person to really deliver at a high level. The outcomes are basically 6 or 8 things that you want them to achieve in the course of the first 12 or 18 months in the job.</p>
<p>And then the competencies are related to: what are the things this person needs to have accomplished? What are the skills that you need to have that we have evidence, therefore, they can actually achieve those outcomes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the thing that you see that’s missing from this is a recitation of responsibilities in the job and largely a recitation of the type of experience a person has in the role.</p>
<p>It’s a deliberate distinction because we have found that, unless you really lay out what almost amounts to that person’s performance review in reverse—which is the outcomes—it doesn’t really matter what you list as the day-to-day responsibilities, because when you do that massive recitation of day-to-day responsibilities, it doesn’t come with any prioritization. And then what happens so often is, a person gets hired off of that list of responsibilities, their onboarding is pretty limited because in a startup it’s hard just to get time to talk through these things. So a person might be in the job 30, 60, 90 days before they have any sense from the CEO or founder they’re working for what the actual priorities are that you want me to get done out of this long list of responsibilities.</p>
<p>If you lay out through the MOC process what the outcomes are going to be, you interview against those outcomes to drive the competencies. Even if there’s some limited comms during the onboarding process, they still know from the position description what the heck the outcomes are that they’re supposed to be working towards.</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: That makes a ton of sense, Matt. And we know that the chief people officer role, CHRO—unlike maybe finance or sales—entrepreneurs have a harder time understanding what that role is, right?</p>
<p>Many founders I’ve worked with are like, “well, that’s why you’re here. Tell me what the priorities are.” And so that framework helps think that through before you start talking to folks, which I think is very smart.</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: It almost feels a lot like tree rings in some ways. The product and eng stuff is what they always know the best. Then that next ring out is a lot of go-to-market. They have some knowledge of that, but it’s more limited. But when you get out to that last ring, which is the operation stuff, which might be finance, legal, the HR function, manufacturing and supply chain, when you’re talking about companies with that physical product—that’s the area where often they’re most limited.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we often try to do is say, “Hey, let’s put a first draft of the MOC together.” And that’s where the subject matter piece comes into play. Because we’ve got this network of executives, and let’s say you have a CFO search. I’ll spend time telling an entrepreneur: okay, there are 3 or 4 or 5 stage- and market-appropriate CFOs I’d love to have you talk to you for the CFO search, so you can take that draft MOC that we’ve started and stress test your thinking with people who are real life in the job. And then let’s also then have you go and calibrate against that, especially on the personality part of it. Because, for the most part, they probably haven’t spent a lot of time with CFOs over the course of their career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the subject matter expertise conversations are really helpful to flesh the MOC out further, but also to start to give the entrepreneurs a sense of: what does the personality profile for this pool of talent look like? And start to get them to think more about: who am I going to click with best from a chemistry and fit perspective?</p>
<p>Because there’s always going be a lot of people out there who could do the job. Let’s go ahead and figure out who’s gonna be able to do the job with you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: It’s so funny because you’ve sent a bunch of those entrepreneurs to me over the years, which I’ve loved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And one of my biggest advice to those folks is, look, presumably, we all have the technical and functional skill set for this job. That’s not really what you’re interviewing for or unpacking. It’s the personality of that person, the disposition, the fit, what they value. I say we’re all crayons in a crayon box, but we’re all different colors. You have to pick the right one for you, which is usually the kicker and the most important thing.&nbsp;</p>
  Whiteboard sessions for assessing fit 
<p>Nolan Church: I totally agree with that, Kelly. And how do you actually assess fit? I don’t think entrepreneurs really spend a lot of time thinking about it. It’s more of a feeling that they have. And when you’re in the executive recruiting process, feeling is not scientific. It’s not strategic. It’s like, “Oh, I have a good vibe.” And it turns out most execs are great talkers. So how do you assess for fit?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: And let me tack on: how do you help CHROs assess for fit, Matt? Because I’ll be honest, I didn’t do that as well as I should have 10 years ago.&nbsp; You learn, but: how do you coach the other side to also assess that side, which I didn’t do very well all the time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: I think it starts a lot with stepping out of a typical interview process. Look, we’ve all been doing this long enough. We all can tell when someone’s on their best behavior, and you have to test people by putting them in real-world working situations. You can do that in a number of ways.</p>
<p>Go through a whiteboard session with an executive in an interview. Let’s actually take a real-world business situation you’re grappling with as a founder, and let’s brainstorm it together. And people just naturally, without even realizing it, start letting their guard down and start behaving like they truly are when you get into that pretend work session.</p>
<p>We also always advocate, towards an end of a process, get the whole executive team together. You may give a candidate a topic—and if you give them a topic that’s related to your business, you’ve got to give them the data room to back it up so that they can actually put a real presentation together on how they would have addressed the specific issue from a business standpoint that you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Or maybe they come in when there’s no data room, and they come in and do a 120– or 180–day game-planning session on: “hey, here’s everything I’ve learned during my interview process. Here’s how I’m going to approach building out the finance function” or the legal function or the sales function, whatever it is.And you have this working session as a team, which basically allows you as the entrepreneur not only to be assessing the fit between you and the candidate, but you can see how that candidate fits into the room, and then you follow that up. Maybe that goes for 90 minutes, and then you all go out to dinner as a team. And you just continue to see how that social dynamic develops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing, which often doesn’t get as much emphasis in the referencing process, is really this question of fit. And a lot of times during referencing, we want to know, what did the candidate do? We need to confirm or dispute things. They’ve said they’ve done assertions. They’ve made about their success at the company, but sometimes there’s not enough time spent on what it was like to work with that individual. And I think that’s the second part of it:, it’s your own real-world experience during an interview process with the working session. But then it’s also, “let me go test out how well they worked with everybody else in prior roles.”&nbsp;</p>
  Referencing as a continuous cycle 
<p>Nolan Church: Yep. And then I also think with references, founders are typically showing up with their 5 to 7 reference questions. I find actually running through a process, getting some data on people, and then actually using that data to inform the reference questions specifically in the areas in which we currently have flags gives me better signal. What are the tips that you have for reference processing both on the front door and the back channel references?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: I think you brought up a really good point there. Referencing should be almost like a continual loop. You’re interviewing, then you’re referencing, you’re interviewing, then you’re referencing.</p>
<p>Referencing should be happening throughout a process. And I think by the time you’re done with an interview process, you probably should end up with maybe 50% to 75% of the references are probably front sheet stuff. And then another 25 to 50% are the back channel. And a lot of the back channel is going to be happening in those early stages where you’re interviewing someone, collecting some data and you’re like, “Hey, I need to go confirm this. Let me go figure out in the market who I may know that can help me with this.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I think we are honestly in a period where people are getting sloppy with back channels. Some of the biggest things I tell our entrepreneurs is: don’t cold call into current employers.Only reach out to people that you know well that are going to probably give you good information. Don’t be out there carpet bombing someone’s network to try to get 15 or 20 or 30 references. It’s just poor form. And it puts the candidate in an awkward position, makes you look unprofessional, potentially poisons the whole recruiting process.</p>
<p>Honestly, and even before you get to outreach, I talk a lot to our entrepreneurs about being precise, like: what is your referencing strategy? First of all, what are we trying to learn and what we’re trying to learn will evolve during a recruiting process. But let’s figure out what we need to learn at each point. And then who are the best people to contact to find out that information? And be targeted and selective as a result of that and only be reaching out to people that you do know. I think the other thing that’s important to is: if you’re gonna be doing the back channel stuff, there’s a strategy where you can simply just tell a candidate, “hey, I may get referred to other people that I may want to call as a reference. And is it okay if I do that without you knowing?” In the course of just talking to them as a candidate, say that to them, and that way nothing’s a surprise, nothing’s a problem, later on.</p>
<p>Nolan Church: And they can identify if there are issues that you would not otherwise know of before you go and reach out to somebody. It’s just such a human thing to do that people just skip the step on. They want to have all these like back alley conversations, which I’ve never really understood, as opposed to just like, “Hey, this is a part of our process. We do back channels. I just want to let you know and give you the opportunity to let me know if there’s any flags that you want to tell me about right now.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Well, and you may find this funny, but in the end, it’s about building a relationship with somebody. You’re going to work with them. And the funny part of it is, if this were someone—let’s say you were going to try to go on a date. You wouldn’t be calling all of their friends who you’ve never met to ask about them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a certain way to do this that is constructive and that actually adds to the process rather than causes friction and problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: And using back channels wisely, to the dating example. If you back channel with someone that broke up with them, have the wherewithal to know they’re probably not going to say all great, wonderful things, and have the maturity to filter and understand that back channels are back channels. And you have to vet that out because a lot of people could text 1 person, who could be biased. Boom. And it’s just not complete.&nbsp;</p>
  Putting negative references in context 
<p>Nolan Church: I want your take on this, Matt, because people do well in some situations and not well in others. I worked with Tony at DoorDash and he used to say that the Michael Jordan of executive recruiting gets it right 2 out of 3 times.</p>
<p>He’s had incredible stability amongst his leadership team, but that’s not always the case. And sometimes it’s situational context. Sometimes it’s business context. Sometimes it’s my manager context and it doesn’t work. How do you guys think about negative references and when it comes up, as it relates to the specific new role, how do you advise founders on that?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Eventually if you call enough people, you will get a negative reference on somebody. That’s largely unavoidable. Now you get a negative reference, I think you have to evaluate, as you were saying, is it a state of the situation or as a trait of the individual? That’s really what it comes down to in the end, because if you’re looking at someone and it was a bad fit or they didn’t perform well, or maybe they perform great, but the company didn’t execute like they were a great CFO, but products and sales could never get their act together. You can go through a long list of reasons why somebody may have done well in a job, but it didn’t work out for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And it’s one thing we spend time with our entrepreneurs to help them go. Okay, you’re never going to hire someone who is 100th percentile on everything. They are going to have weaknesses. And let’s look at those weaknesses. And like I said, figure out: were they a result of the situation they were in or is the trait that they have? If the weakness is a result of the situation, let’s parse out whether that’s relevant to your company right now. Are they going to experience those same things that caused them potentially to have failures? If it’s a trait, let’s look at the rest of your team. Is this a trait that you could afford to take on that you could potentially have as a development area for this individual? Or is that trait that they’re weak in so mission critical to the role that it just isn’t possible for them to successfully execute in your company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it’s a lot of nuance and Nolan, that’s I think what you were getting at. It’s just a ton of nuance in the end and rarely are these things black and white.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: I also think the best candidates—at least I’ve talked to and including myself—is to have the EQ to actually talk through that before you hear it from a reference, right? I think that’s a big sign as well as that self awareness, that reflection to talk through that during the interview process.</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Exactly. And I think also when you’re talking about talking through, I think it’s really a great point. Founders sometimes feel like, “Oh, God, can I actually bring up something to a candidate that I learned to referencing?” Absolutely. Have a conversation with them to get the added context on exactly what may have happened in that situation. Because it may give you an additional set of data that helps you make a more informed decision about what to do with that referencing information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan Church: I totally agree. I also really believe that people grow and people change. And the more experiences that you have, the more weathered you get, the better off that you will ultimately be.</p>
<p>I mean, I look back and I’m candidly embarrassed about the person that I was 10 years ago. And I think that’s kind of my general—it’s how I know I’m doing okay. Every 10 years I look back and if I was embarrassed, that means I’m growing really fast. I think that’s when people talk about the negative aspects of their career. That’s how you can begin to assess if they actually have been growing versus if they’re putting some veneer bullshit on it, you could pretty easily suss that out for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Absolutely.&nbsp;</p>
  Assessing personal growth vs. mistakes 
<p>Nolan Church: How do you guys think about that, though, on the Andreessen side? Because you guys have, I’m assuming, so much data on people. But as they move through their careers, they grow and change. How do you guys think about that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: That’s why I think it’s really important to reengage with executives. It’s something I was talking about earlier in the discussion where it’s like, hey, I spent a lot of time in my early years here building a network of executive relationships. And a lot of what I’m doing now is sustaining those relationships and continuing to find ways to add value for those executives.</p>
<p>But in the course of those conversations, you’re getting an update on them and you’re getting an update on their lives, what they’ve accomplished, and where they’ve gone. And I think that’s really an important part of this, these are not snapshots in time. Everyone is on a continuum of personal and professional growth.</p>
<p>And that’s why I always think it’s dangerous to—we talk about this with our entrepreneurs—it’s like, “Hey, I know 3 people that worked with them 10 years ago.” That’s really not going to be relevant data. You may see some things in their past that come up at that point that maybe continue in the future or things that they grew out of.</p>
<p>It’s really for me, what have the last 5 to 7 years been like in somebody’s career? And let’s really hone in on that when we’re really trying to figure out who they are and what they’re going to be able to do for you right now. Because anything that’s earlier than that is just too dated.</p>
  Establishing trust with founders 
<p>Kelli Dragovich: Matt, in the talent partner role, it’s a slippery slope sometimes in supporting these entrepreneurs and also helping them see maybe what they can’t see for themselves. I’d love any spicy stories about when you’d have to put your foot down and tell a founder they’re wrong or they’re making the wrong choice. And how do you choose those precious moments to do that or not?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: It starts with how we operate. We’re not over the top with our founders. Our founders run their companies. So whatever you’re trying to do, it’s a lot of leading by influence versus directive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when you’re doing the influence thing, you have to start with a foundation where the founder has to have valued your contribution up until this point. And the founder wants you involved. The founder has appreciated the advice that you’ve provided to their business and that founder trusts you.</p>
<p>So it starts with that basis of trust to say, “okay, I trust you and I look to you as a consigliere or advisor on things.” If that hasn’t been established, there’s no way you’re going to be able to have any impact on the decision. Full stop. But I think once you have that trust established, you can then say, “hey, here’s why I think this is a mistake.”</p>
<p>And when you tell them “I think it’s a mistake,” it has to be grounded and backed up with data. We’re dealing with technical founders who are very data oriented individuals. It can’t be just this subjective “well, I think, or I feel this way.” They’re gonna ask you, “well, what’s the data behind it? Why do you think that way?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective data points can come in all different flavors. Maybe it’s referencing data, maybe it’s information you have because you’ve met the executive and have a deeper sense of who they are based on your own referencing independent and your own evaluation, independent of whatever may have happened during the process.</p>
<p>You may have company performance data. Let’s say it’s a sales executive. A sales exec is saying, “Hey, we hit this quota,” etcetera, etcetera. Well, guess what? I actually know objectively whether that happened or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think that’s what it comes down to really in the end is the trust has to be established. And once they trust and value your role in the process, you then have to be able to provide them the objective data versus subjective feelings or thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: It reminds me of our episode with Steve Nolan Cadigan, where he said, “our products are judgment and credibility.” Those two things have to be there before utilizing those chips, Matt, for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan Church: But at the same time, many founders are in the role because they’re headstrong, they have a belief, they trust their instincts and they follow it. And so what I’m hearing you say, Matt, is you have to very seldomly pull that card just in general and then back it up with data.</p>
<p>But then at the end of the day, it still is the founder’s decision. And I’m sure there’s been times when you’ve actually been convinced that, hey, this person is making a mistake but they went forward anyway. Maybe it actually was a mistake or maybe it wasn’t. And people are tactile learners. They do have to learn by making their own mistakes too, right?&nbsp;</p>
  Vetting EQ 
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Absolutely. And I think it also comes down to: we naturally try to work with entrepreneurs—back to that whole conversation we had at the beginning about how we view talent—and one of the things I mentioned at the time was EQ.</p>
<p>You have to have a group of individuals who you’re advising that want your input. They are willing to show vulnerability and ask for help. They have the right blend of humility versus confidence—all those things so that they’re actually open to getting the feedback in the first place and open to hearing differing and conflicting opinions, perhaps on a decision that they’re making.</p>
<p>Because this goes beyond talent. They’re making business decisions every day. And they have to be of the mindset that I’m going to take in as much data as I should and can so that I have the most diverse set of information to work with to make a decision for my company, whether it’s whether we, invest in product A over product B, whether I hire this CFO candidate or another one—they have to have a mindset that is already predisposed to wanting the help and wanting the input from multiple constituencies.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it’s probably not going to work for them as an entrepreneur, honestly, because they’re going to stub their toe a lot of times and eventually, that repeated toe stubbing is going to have a serious impact on the business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: And Matt, I’m assuming that’s part of the vetting process and investing in entrepreneurs: that EQ side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: We have a whole operating team over here that spends a lot of time helping entrepreneurs learn the nuts and bolts of: how do you hire talent, build teams, market the company, sell product, raise money. All stuff that as entrepreneurs, they haven’t done before for the most part, but it’s all stuff they need to learn how to do well to be successful.</p>
<p>We want to work with entrepreneurs that are going to tap into that. So naturally, we’re going to be predisposed to working with folks that are going to want to leverage all of those resources that are available to them to help them become a better CEO.&nbsp;</p>
  Measuring success of what you can’t control 
<p>Kelli Dragovich: Yep. Matt, you mentioned you have a lot of latitude in your role, which is great. It’s also a lot of pressure. Are there any moments where that latitude becomes a little less and you’re feeling the pressure? What is that like in your role when those moments hit?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Having worked in startups before, it’s a different feeling of pressure than it is when you’re in an operating role and literally you’re looking at the bank account balance going, “Hey, can we make payroll at the end of the month?”</p>
<p>I think that the biggest thing from a pressure standpoint over here is just: when you’re in an advisory role, again, you’re operating by influence. You don’t really have control over the situation, but yet your own success—I think both personally how I measure myself and also, to a degree, how we measure ourselves here at the firm—is based on the success of these things.</p>
<p>So you’re basically measuring success against things that you don’t have control over. I think that’s the essence of the difficulty of the advisor role when you feel pressure at times. You’re like, “Hey, I think this is how this should go. This is what I would do if I were in your situation. But at the same time, I can’t go make you do that.”</p>
<p>We take a lot of ownership in what we do working with the portfolio because we’re really involved with all of you very closely on a day-to-day basis, and part of the reason we’re able to do that is that we have such a large team, we’re able to be proactive. We’re not just running around reactively putting out fires. When I work on a project with the portfolio, I’m probably investing at least 4 months, sometimes upward of a year, on the whole process.</p>
<p>So there’s a tremendous sense of ownership that comes with that and a tremendous sense of responsibility and pressure to make sure that’s done right, even though I’m only in an advisory capacity. So that’s a big part of it for me, honestly. Probably more self-induced pressure in some ways.</p>
  Why hire veterans for startups 
<p>Nolan Church: I want to talk a bit about veteran hiring. 2 of my favorite people I’ve ever worked with—shout out to Jeff and then also to Casey North at DoorDash—were ex-military. And you do a lot of work with transitioning veterans into startups. Talk to me a little bit about why this is such a good fit from a skillset standpoint. Why is going from the military into startups—like, why does that work so often?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: If you think about the military environment, especially folks have been in the special operations community, they’re used to dealing with very dynamic, chaotic, very resource-constrained environments where that is very analogous to what happens in the startup world. Obviously, the subject domain and the work environment are very different. But in the end, what a lot of these folks are very good at, especially from the Iraq/Afghanistan generation, is: I’m going to take a disparate group of people, probably some or most of whom don’t even like each other. And I’m going to get that group of people together to accomplish a common mission and a common purpose. How many times can you think of when you’ve been in a startup, or you’ve had a similar situation, where you got to get a bunch of people in a room, you got to maybe bang some heads to get them to work together well, but we have a problem we need to solve that’s cross-functional in nature.</p>
<p>These people are used to dealing with that type of situation. Again, the subject matter is completely different. The process to get to the answer, though, is very, very similar. And when you combine that skillset with the leadership they bring to the table, I think that’s why they’re successful as they usually are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan Church: I love that. The 2 guys I was referring to are in operations roles and have ascended insanely fast. I see this issue, though, with founders—especially in today’s job market—who are indexing on people that have done the job before. How do you think about the experience versus trajectory conversation?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: You’re having to buy into a different kind of potential. The potential you’re buying into is their ability to learn your product and learn your business, which is different than the potential you usually buy into, where someone is very good technically, or they’re very good at go-to-market, they’re very good at finance, and you’re merely betting on them to progress and ascend in both the scope and level of their responsibilities as a leader. So it’s almost the exact inverse where you’re already bringing someone in who’s very good on the leadership and the soft skills side, but now you need to bet on their ability to ramp on your business. So that’s how I usually frame it with entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other challenge oftentimes is—especially for folks who’ve been enlisted, not officers—these people are incredibly skilled, incredibly gifted individuals. But it’s very difficult for recruiters to be able to map their skillset to what the open jobs may be in a company. And the translation guide doesn’t exist anymore like it used to because, once we left the draft behind and we went to all volunteer armed forces, most of society doesn’t have regular contact with people who are in the military anymore. So they don’t understand as easily what those folks can do as may have existed 30, 40, 70 years ago, when you had a huge proportion of the population was veterans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I often talk to vets about is: honestly, don’t go through normal recruiting processes, because you’re going to have people looking at your paper that just don’t understand what you’ve done. When you see a company that has a role that you’re interested in, make sure you already have built out the network that allows you to go talk to somebody outside of the recruiting process who can help you, who understands who you are. Maybe someone who’s a vet who already works at the company. We talked to vets a lot about: build your network first, and then the job will follow from that. Because when you see something that looks of interest at a company, you can reach out to your contacts there and they can be advocates for you because you’re going to be an out-of-the-box hire. You’re not going to be someone who checks everything that goes down the list, for sure. So you’ve got to have people who are outside the process who are advocating for your candidacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: Matt, how do you all structure that? Is it more informal? Is it a more formal widespread program for you all? How is that set up?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: We’ve worked with a number of organizations over the years. I’ve been on the board of Commit Foundation now for probably about 7 or 8 years. We do a workshop with them every year. We worked pretty closely in the past with Bethany Coates and what she was doing at BreakLine. We’ve got good relationships with Honor Foundation. We’re investors in shift.org.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it becomes a bit of a hybrid. We do these workshops where we have folks that are interested in technology and VC who are coming in. I take a lot of 1-on-1 intros as well, where veterans who I know that I’ve worked with who have transitioned—I can say like, “Hey, you know, there’s this individual over here that you really should meet. I think would be, you know, a fantastic, high potential person in the industry.” That type of thing. So it’s a mix of both, honestly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: I love that. Those informal connections are super powerful. So I love that.&nbsp;</p>
  Talent landscape in 2024 
<p>Nolan Church: Matt, just transitioning to a little bit about the moment that we’re in today. I am of the belief that at least the beginning of 2024 is still going to be really tough on the venture backed tech space. How are you advising founders on their talent strategy right now? And how are you thinking about 2024?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: We’ve still got a lot of uncertainty out there. I think part of the advice depends on the stage of the company. When we’re talking about the earlier stage companies, a lot of what they’re working on is still those very focused searches, like our first engineering leader, our first product leader, our first go-to-market leader. And I think if you have your funding secured where, for the next couple of years, you’re going to be working on what you’re working on, regardless of what those macro conditions look like—I think moving ahead with building that core leadership team is really important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the challenge starts to come in on the growth and later-stage side because you’ve got a lot of companies that, in some cases, already expected to be public entities by now within the infusion of capital from that, and others that are stacked up now waiting for that wave of companies to go out. So I think when you’re looking at your hiring plan, it’s really about: we need to be focused on profitable growth. It is not growth for the sake of growth anymore. Companies have to run much more lean and tighter than they have over the last 15 years, and it’s a little bit of a back-to-the-future feeling because we’ve returned, I think, to a macro environment that reflects where we were in the 2000s and earlier.</p>
<p>So, the advice that we provide is somewhat dependent on the stage of the company and where they are from a liquidity standpoint.&nbsp;</p>
  Recruiting top talent in a tight market 
<p>Kelli Dragovich: Matt, we talked about this I think a couple of months ago and we chatted on the phone: about the market shifting, especially with those later-stage companies that were close to IPO, valuations changing, coupled with the struggle of hiring top-notch executives in this time, especially with that equity change.</p>
<p>Have you seen any creative ways of reconciling that or thinking about that or anything companies are doing to still get great talent? Even though this market has shifted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: I think you do, at some point, just have to recognize reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of the reset that has taken place has had to do with employee retention issues, a lot less to do without going out and raising new capital. So this idea of trying to retain your top employees—and one of the main ways you have to do that—is to reset what their valuations look like, and potentially then provide additional equity to help true them up. I think that’s a really important thing to be considering right now to be able to retain that top talent.</p>
<p>If you do that, then there’s a whole bunch of cascading effects that, of course, then make you more marketable to potential new employees. But I think the core of it starts with, honestly, ripping the bandaid off and going, “Hey, the longer it takes for us to do this, the less competitive we probably become.”</p>
<p>We have to just recognize that and just bite the bullet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan Church: I talked to a founder a few weeks ago who had raised a really large round at a really high valuation that no longer makes sense in today’s world. And they’re now recruiting for C-level roles. And I asked him first: how are you talking to candidates about this? And he was like, “well, how do you think I should, because I have no idea?” And my guidance to him was: just be honest, right? We raised in 2021. This was the market price. I know it’s no longer the market price, but we don’t need to go to market today for a new financing round. But my commitment is when we do, we will mark you to market at that new financing price and then re-up your equity. Do you think that’s good advice? And are you talking to founders similarly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: It’s very situational. Let’s say you have a very long runway of capital. Let’s say you’ve got 3, 4, 5, 6 years, even some companies I’ve talked to have had 6 or 7 years of runway. I think it’s very dependent on that question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan Church: Damn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Yeah. So it’s: how long do you have before you have to go reprice via an equity raise? And if you’ve got a long time—let’s say it’s over 36 months—I think that argument can work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, of course, the candidate has to buy into everything else. A vision of the company, buying into who you are as a leader and your ability to execute on the vision. Everything else has to be rock solid, because there’s going to be a lot of other opportunities that are going to be out there during that time frame after which you hire this person that are going to be more financially attractive in most cases. The last thing you want to see is a candidate who you hire who’s constantly looking over their shoulder going, “Hey, oh, that looks interesting. Oh, that over there looks like a lot.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you don’t want to go win the battle that way, but then eventually lose the war because you brought this person in, but they weren’t totally on board with everything and therefore they’re always going to be looking for the next best thing.</p>
 Hiring the “operational glue” 
<p>Kelli Dragovich: Really well said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So Matt, I know we have a few minutes left. Just to transition to our rapid fire round called Talent Rules. A couple of quick questions for you.Who has been your best hire in your career and why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: So I think y’all will appreciate this. There was a woman I hired in the third startup I worked for. When you’re still like under 50 people or even 100 people, there’s always someone who’s that operational glue, and it was a woman named Rochelle. And I hired her, she was my first hire when I joined the company. And she basically did all the QuickBooks work, was the office manager, handled all the HR paperwork, was the company confessional as to everything that went on—and we had a lot of drama. That one person basically did 5 or 6 jobs. And I always find those people are incredibly short supply in startups. There’s not a lot of them out there, but when you find one, they are a true gem and they can do so much to help the company.</p>
<p>So probably not the answer you were expecting—</p>
  The value of tough feedback 
<p>Kelli Dragovich: I can feel what you’re explaining though. I love it. I can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What has been one of your most favorite interview questions over the years that has given you the biggest, best signal on candidates?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Really good signal I get is: I ask people, “what’s the toughest piece of feedback they’ve received in the last 5 years, and how did they respond?” That’s always one that I find gets at a lot of issues related to EQ, critical thinking, organizational savvy in a lot of cases too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nolan Church: Growth mindset. Yeah, that’s also my favorite question, Matt. I feel like when you ask somebody about a tough piece of feedback, not only do you get like all the soft spots, you also get what, tactically, did somebody give them feedback on? What did someone else think that their biggest area of growth is? And then, were they able to learn from that and make it a strength?</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: And then when someone also basically answers with that, classic, looks like a backhanded compliment to themselves by the time they’re done, you’re like, okay, you are no good to me.</p>
<p>Nolan Church: That just makes me throw up. Like, I throw up in thinking about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: We’ve heard that on like multiple episodes. So like, when is that just going to die? Because everyone knows now. And so to Nolan’s point—</p>
<p>Nolan Church: Just be authentic.</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: Yeah. There are slow learners out there.</p>
<p>Nolan Church: Matt, this has been so good. Thank you so much for the time. Our audience is going to take away so much about exec recruiting from this episode. We can’t thank you enough. 100%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kelli Dragovich: Thanks, Matt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt Oberhardt: My pleasure. Appreciate you both inviting me on and do it again anytime.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Horizen Labs has submitted a ZenIP Discussion topic on Discourse, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>

 Next Steps – Where Do We Go From Here?&nbsp; 
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, we encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> around ZenIP 42400 and voice your thoughts. We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of what this means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42400 started on Thursday, February 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST and ended on Sunday, February 18th, 2024 at 12pm EST. The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was taken. Users can head to Snapshot here to review the result of the vote, which passed with 99.99% of votes “for”: <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0x3f846aac0e0640d4286f0cc83c26c3710146a47af2ed670e4ef962d82f0d46c0">https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0x3f846aac0e0640d4286f0cc83c26c3710146a47af2ed670e4ef962d82f0d46c0</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp;

		<p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> was originally designed and built by the Horizen Ecosystem team as a POC (proof-of-concept) sidechain, called Tokenchain, to test the scalability and durability of the Horizen network. TokenMint was a live proof of concept that permitted the team to build Horizen EON, and now that Horizen EON is successfully running, the time to deprecate TokenMint is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the deprecation, all TokenMint users will need to remove their $ZEN from the sidechain before the deprecation date to avoid loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
 
 Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 – TokenMint Testnet will be Deprecated 
 Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 – TokenMint Mainnet will be Deprecated 
 
<p>To move $ZEN off of TokenMint, users can simply send their ZEN from their Cobalt Wallet to a Horizen mainchain address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: ZEN can only be sent to Horizen Mainchain Sphere addresses from Cobalt. Sending ZEN to another Horizen Mainnet address outside of Sphere could lead to a loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please open a ticket on our <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord server</a> with any questions or concerns during the deprecation period and please be sure to REMOVE your ZEN from TokenMint BEFORE March 6th, 2024, as the funds will be permanently lost after that date.</p>
<p>How to Send ZEN to the Horizen Mainchain from Cobalt Wallet</p>
 
 Open your Cobalt Wallet and make sure you are connected to the TokenMint chain.&nbsp; 
 In the Assets and Activity page, click the ZEN row. The page now allows you to send ZEN. It displays the current amount available. 
 Click the up arrow to send a transaction. 
 In the Send to field, enter the desired address you want to send the ZEN to. This field will display an error, if you enter an invalid address. 
 In the Amount field, enter the amount of the ZEN you want to send. 
 In the password field, enter your password to complete the transaction. 
 Click Submit. The Sent flag appears indicating that the transaction is successful. 
 Click Back to display the transaction activity. The Send page appears. If the transaction is pending, a notification will appear stating that the last pending transaction for this address has not been confirmed. Note that it can take up to 72 hours for the transaction to show on the destination wallet, even if the transaction is confirmed on the TokenMint explorer.

<p>As Ben Horowitz says, it’s “<a href="https://a16z.com/why-must-you-pay-sales-people-commissions/">no prize, no fight</a>” when it comes to getting the best salespeople on your team. But building a sales compensation plan that both aligns your sales team’s compensation with your customers’ objectives and recruits top salespeople can be incredibly difficult in usage-based pricing.</p>
<p>The problem comes down to incentives. In traditional B2B SaaS sales, companies want to sell large upfront annual commitments, so salespeople’s compensation is mostly designed to maximize deal size. Big swing, big deal, big check.</p>
<p>This incentive structure gets turned on its head in product-led growth and usage-based pricing, where more companies land low- or no-dollar deals and expand them over time. This can lead to a number of common issues in sales compensation: paying your salespeople for activities that don’t actually drive more usage; failing to motivate your reps to land new customers, especially in the enterprise; compensating reps for all incremental customer usage and, consequently, diluting their focus and demotivating them (if everything your salespeople do is important, nothing’s actually important!); and struggling to recruit and retain high-performing salespeople who aren’t used to having their compensation tied to a slow usage ramp-up period.</p>
<p>In order to build a usage-based sales compensation plan that motivates your reps to drive the best possible customer outcomes, then, it’s important to understand where your sales team actually makes your customers more successful, prioritize the most impactful behaviors for your business, and choose the right compensation levers to drive those behaviors.&nbsp;</p>
  1. Determine where your sales team makes your customers more successful&nbsp; 
<p>In usage-based pricing, value = usage. The more customers like and use your product, the more revenue you bring in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you’re building out a usage-based sales compensation plan, you need to first understand how customers get value out of your product, then identify where your sales team can either accelerate or expand their usage. One of the best ways to do this is to analyze each step of your ideal customer journey—signup, onboarding, and expansion—and specifically identify how your sales team influences your customers’ actions and decisions.&nbsp;</p>
 Signup&nbsp; 
<p>How do your customers find and sign up for your product?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some key questions to ask yourself include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 What channels lead potential customers to your solution? 
 How do they determine if your product meets their needs? 
 Are demos or trials available before purchase? 
 What are the steps to become a long-term customer? 
 Can customers self-purchase advanced options or commit to a usage-based plan? 
 
<p>Sales value-add:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The sales team’s primary role is acquiring new customers and helping them get started with your product. If your product’s journey is mostly self-guided, chances are this isn’t where your sales team is having a big impact. 
 
 Onboarding&nbsp; 
<p>How do your customers first find success with your product?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onboarding is your customers’ journey from initial purchase to active use, marked by key milestones like deploying their first solution. Consider how customers engage with your product during onboarding and whether they need support from your team.</p>
<p>Some key questions to ask yourself include:</p>
 
 Do customers independently activate the product for their use case(s)? 
 Is support from your team, including sales, generally required for activation? 
 Should your team proactively assist customers facing obstacles? 
 
<p>Sales value-add:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The sales team’s role is guiding customers to their first major success milestone, which might include coordinating resources and project management. If customers self-onboard, this probably isn’t where your reps have the most impact. 
 
 Expansion&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>How and why do your customers use more of your product?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure out why customers use more of your product and the sales team’s impact throughout. This may involve increased processing capabilities, new features adoption, or enhanced data throughput.</p>
<p>Some key questions to ask yourself include:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Are you, as the vendor, consistently engaging with customers to identify additional use cases, features, or user groups?&nbsp; 
 Is the same salesperson who partnered during the signup and onboarding process also highly valuable for the customer during these activities (due to established relationships or specific business context)?&nbsp; 
 Conversely, does the customer experience much of this additional incentive to expand through the product experience? 
 
<p>Sales value-add:</p>
 
 Salespeople may act as “farmer” account managers to drive broader adoption or “hunter” account executives to introduce new features. However, if the product itself drives more usage, this likely isn’t where your reps have a lot of impact. 
 
  2. Prioritize the most impactful sales activities 
<p>Once you know where your sales team adds value, the next step is to prioritize the top 1 or 2 activities that have the most impact, then devise a weighting system that incentivizes those behaviors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the most important step in this process.</p>
<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In usage-based pricing, a great sales compensation plan will compensate your sales team for making your customers as successful as possible, which creates the virtuous flywheel of consumption most businesses are looking for with usage-based pricing. Over-incentivizing can dilute your sales team’s focus and actually weaken the impact of your comp plan—if your sales team is reaping a lot of benefits for little work, why work harder?—while misaligned incentives may lead to outcomes that don’t make your customer or your business successful. Why would you bonus your sales team on new logos, for instance, if most of your growth will come from expanding usage in the customer base you already have?</p>
<p>Of those high-value sales activities you identified in the previous step, then, what is the relative impact of those when compared with one another? There are different ways to score that impact (split of 100%, point system, etc). What matters most is that you work with the key stakeholders in your business—CFO, CRO, etc.—to find the distributed weights that work for you and your overall business goals.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s say you’re a database company selling into complex enterprises and you’re trying to capture market share. Your sales team needs to land net-new logos in your ideal customer profile (ICP) and get them up and running on your platform.</p>
 
 Sample sales compensation plan weights:
 
 Acquisition: 75% 
 Onboarding: 25% 
 Expansion: 0%&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>Or let’s say you’re a developer tools company selling to companies of all sizes. Your product and marketing are designed to attract users and paying customers. Your sales team is responsible for helping customers build their first application (onboarding) and—more importantly for your overall growth—for driving continued use of the tools for more projects, across more teams (expansion).</p>
 
 Sample sales compensation plan weights:
 
 Acquisition: 0% 
 Onboarding: 30% 
 Expansion: 70% 
 
 
 
<p>These examples are obviously simplified versions of a given customer journey, and you’ll most likely decide to make your compensation plans more granular and tailored to your own business model. Maybe your compensation plans aren’t divided neatly into 3 buckets, for example, but starting with these 3 buckets of the journey can help you figure out where to tweak so you can better model your own process.</p>
  3. Choose the right compensation levers 
<p>Now that you’ve determined which stages of the customer journey your sales team impacts the most, you need to select the appropriate levers to incentivize your sales team’s behavior. While there’s rarely a straightforward “if X, then Y” formula for choosing these levers, the following considerations can help you determine the best ways to measure and calculate those incentives.</p>
 Signup 
<p>The best signup incentives motivate your reps to carry out challenging campaigns associated with prospecting, managing a sales process, and securing commercial agreements with newly acquired customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
 
 New customer signups. In usage-based models, customers’ signup spend usually isn’t big enough to give your reps a significant bonus or commission. If that’s the case, consider compensating them on the number of newly acquired customers they bring in instead of the actual initial revenue. 
 Minimum committed spend. If you and your customers still value minimum upfront commits in usage-based pricing, consider compensating reps on the dollar value of that committed revenue. Typically, we see companies credit the salesperson the full annual value of this during signup, even if the customer staggers the committed revenue throughout the contract period. 
 Hybrid. A combination of both of the above can be useful if you need to incentivize each of these outcomes. 
 
 Onboarding 
<p>Here, the goal is to incentivize your sales team to get your customers to that first indicator of sustainable success with your product—whether that’s over an initial period of time or on the completion of a given milestone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
 
 Year 1 revenue. You can incentivize based on the revenue you expect from each customer’s first full year using your product. We see companies pay based on actual attained revenue, rather than a projection or forecast. If you also paid your reps on minimum committed spend during signup, then incentivize for revenue above that minimum committed spend during onboarding. 
 Key milestones. If your customer can hit distinct milestones during their initial use of your product—like deploying their first solution to production—consider incentivizing reps when customers hit one or more of those milestones. This can be used as an alternative to a time-based incentive. 
 
 Expansion 
<p>Incentivize your reps for ongoing incremental usage and additional product purchases.<br>
<br>
Considerations:</p>
 
 Overall incremental revenue. This is the calculation of sales team incentives based on the ongoing net incremental revenue from customer usage. This is generally one of the most straightforward and commonly applied incentives, given its direct link with the actual timing and value of incremental revenue. 
 Incremental revenue above minimum commit. For companies that incentivize on commit during signup, expansion incentives are instead associated with the value above the minimum commit. 
 Additional products. Consider incentivizing separately for this, if necessary, to create additional incentives above and beyond those represented as incremental revenue. 
 
<p>***</p>
<p>Reconciling the conflicting sales, company, and customer priorities in usage-based pricing can be incredibly difficult. Though this framework is far from exhaustive and the specifics of your business will heavily influence the particulars of your sales compensation plan, we hope this framework helps you think more concretely about building a compensation plan that makes your customers successful and helps your reps learn, earn, and have fun. </p>

Combining a high performing 2-hop VPN mode with a full privacy 5-hop mixnet mode, the app encrypts your traffic and routes it across a decentralised global mixnet, enabling actual private and secure communication.</p><p>To have a chance to try the NymVPN, join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">the NymVPN channel in Matrix</a> and introduce yourself. Nym is looking for people with a strong awareness of privacy to help battle-test NymVPN before V1.0 rolls&nbsp;out.</p> Introducing Nym Squad&nbsp;testing <p>The Nym community have already got their hands on the alpha and are busily testing the VPN in a series of workshops all over the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.daoariwas.xyz/">DAOariwas</a> <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squads-e2972f70a778">Squad</a> were the first to jump at the occasion. Based out of the hackerspace <a href="https://platohedro.org/">Platohedro</a> in Medellin, Colombia, they travelled to the recent <a href="https://ethcincodemayo.com/">Ethereum Hackathon</a> in Cholula, Mexico and held the first community-organised NymVPN test&nbsp;session.</p>Left: the Daoariwas squad in Puebla, Mexico. Right: NymVPN session in Cholula,&nbsp;Mexico.<p>NymVPN alpha test sessions were also underway at the Swiss Free Software movement meet-up in Vaud, Switzerland — and in Lyon, France at the bitcoin meet-up, with many more planned in Kyiv, Prague, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>The alpha version will roll out in a staged launch, starting with Nym Squads and friends and then in batches to members of the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN waitlist</a>. Newer batches will be added based on the stability of the applications and the capacity of the network to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Alpha and beta testers are gaining free access to the NymVPN.

The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/follow-the-packet-spoiler-you-cant-9c14380335c7">mixnet encrypts your traffic</a> in novel onion encryption, then routes it via an entry gateway, three mix nodes and an exit gateway. This makes it near impossible for anyone to link sender and receiver, ensuring advanced privacy against even government-level adversaries. It is the optimal solution for sensitive use cases like crypto transactions, messaging, and secure email, that are not timing sensitive. It protects metadata, IP addresses and patterns of communication from traffic analysis and end-to-end correlation.</p><p>Read more about the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym&nbsp;mixnet</a>.</p>  The 2-hop Nym dVPN&nbsp;mode  <p>The 2-hop dVPN mode is optimised for speed.

Most VPNs don’t provide privacy at all. Instead they just shift who knows your IP address and has access to your habits from the server you are communicating with, to the VPN provider. In fact, many free VPNs take advantage of this fact and sell your browsing habits for profit.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to in January and our plans for February. In this month’s update, we cover ecosystem updates, team expansion, product highlights, and a glimpse of next month’s plans; here’s everything you should know:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 3 is now live with a new design, enhanced security, and added features <p>Testnet Stage 3 was released in January, bringing a new design, enhanced security, and added features. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther’s Shielded Pool.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-3-is-now-live-with-a-new-design-enhanced-security-and-added-features">Stage 3 of our testnet</a>.</p> LBank lists Zero-Knowledge DeFi pioneer Panther Protocol’s $ZKP&nbsp; <p>We are excited to share that Panther Protocol’s $ZKP is now listed on LBank, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. This listing follows $ZKP’s listing on BitMart in December 2023. These listings are part of our focus on cementing strategic partnerships and a strong exchange presence before Panther Protocol’s V1 launch.</p><p>More about the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lbank-to-list-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">LBank listing</a>.</p> AMA recap: Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, discusses $ZKP listing on BitMart and the future of privacy in DeFi <p>Following the recent listing of $ZKP on BitMart, Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart’s community. Catch a summary of the conversation in our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-recap-panthers-ceo-oliver-gale-discusses-zkp-listing-on-bitmart-and-the-future-of-privacy-in-defi/">latest blog</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Number of current testnet users: 634  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share?<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Learn more and sign up</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Panther’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale on CryptoCoinShow <p>&nbsp;Our co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was recently on the @CryptoCoinShow discussing Panther’s strategic direction and the future of privacy-preserving tech in DeFi. Watch the complete episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM65JyReAj0&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> Panther hires Harrie Bickle to improve product documentation <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriebickle/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Harrie Bickle</a> has joined the Panther team as a Senior Technical Writer. Harrie brings over a decade’s experience in Documentation and Product Marketing and has been in the blockchain space since 2018. Her range spans writing and editing articles, whitepapers, yellow papers, developer portals, and API documentation.</p><p>We are delighted to welcome Harrie and look forward to seeing our documentation reach a new level, thanks to her expertise gained while editing for Starkware in the Zero-Knowledge space and building out developer portals for Qredo’s crypto trading API and Neon EVM’s Solana settlement layer solution.</p> Product updates  Stage 4 developments <p>The dApp development for Stage 4 is complete, and we expect to launch it in the first week of Feb. Stage 4 of testnet allows users to send zAssets inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can also undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 development is underway in parallel, thanks to the team’s efforts over the last two months. The team is currently working on integrating bundle services into the dApp. Stage 5 includes using a third-party Bundler service and the ability to submit gasless transactions using an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Oshiya update <p>We’ve updated the code for our Panther miner, Oshiya. The latest version of Oshiya comes with an enhanced miner setting: FORCE_UTXO_SIMULATION. This parameter gives control over whether the miner should consistently add a simulated UTXO, regardless of the presence of any pending queues. When set to ‘false’, a simulated UTXO will only be added if a pending queue exists. We recommend running the updated version of the Oshiya code.&nbsp;</p> Plans for February&nbsp; <p>Following the launch of Stage 4, the team will concentrate on enabling the dApp to support users to select a transaction for the Bundler service and perform end-to-end testing of this feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In parallel, the core team will focus on Stage 6, with its revised scope offering a cohesive Fee and Rewards mechanism. In this stage, users will pay all the fees (mimicking a production experience) and receive ‘subsidies’ from the DAO for certain fees, such as for compliance checks, among others. These subsidies are part of the bootstrapping and will be limited to the initial period of the protocol launch. We wish to understand our users’ views on the fee structures and invite the community to engage with the DAO to discuss the subsidies that should be applied during mainnet launch.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to talk about new technology without talking about human flourishing — every new technology from the plow to the microchip has typically been followed by a period of newfound wealth for consumers in the form of cheaper goods, improved productivity, and longer, healthier lives. In many ways, the most financially average person in our modern society experiences daily luxuries that history’s Pharaohs and Caesars could not imagine: instant communication, broadcast television, global travel, antibiotics.</p>
<p>As we enter the AI era, we predict the benefits to consumers will be as profound as the technology is magical; what indeed are the implications for software that can write poetry, listen emphatically, compose music, or provide dating advice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a word, we predict <a href="https://gamma.app/docs/a16z-Consumer-Abundance-Agenda-ieotbnzbxj81biu?mode=doc">an Era of Abundance</a>&nbsp;— consumers’ lives will be enriched through new channels for creativity and self expression, new paths to self discovery and belonging, and new ways to do the most meaningful work of their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<p>Consumers will rediscover the latent creativity that lives within all of us. Lacking creative skills will no longer be a barrier to creating art; indeed, AI will close the gap between taste and art, and new creative workflows like Real Time will emerge from the technology.</p>
<p>Consumers will have an opportunity to craft their most impactful and efficient work, as their productivity multiplies and their administrative overhead goes to zero. New skill sets, new techniques, and new ways to gain expertise will clear a path toward wider, more meaningful careers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers will find new opportunities for connection and belonging, as the fundamental human need for compassion and fellowship is increasingly facilitated by AIs that are infinitely empathic to everyone’s unique forms of weird.</p>
<p>And consumers will have access to richer opportunities for personal development and self care. Teams of smart and dedicated specialists focused solely on the needs of one person will exist for all, as AI plays the role of a patient tutor, savvy wealth manager, and expert therapist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumer software companies are amongst the most valuable in the world (FAANG is all consumer) and were built during a major platform shift or product cycle. We expect this time to be no different.</p>
<p>Below you’ll find our thoughts and observations regarding the state of consumer AI. As we say, “Consumer cannot be predicted, only observed” — so we put forward these thoughts with the humility of knowledge that founders will be the ones to invent and define the future, and we can’t wait to invest in them.

This is what we in crypto affectionately refer to as TradFi and they recently came out with a BTC ETF and have big plans for future tokenization.

<p>The Zcash Foundation (ZF) is excited to share our vision for the next two Zcon conferences: ZconV (virtual) in May 2024 and Zcon6 (in-person) tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. Get ready for impactful presentations and outcomes at ZconV, under the inspiring theme “Zcash Unified!”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 ZconV 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ZconV will be a virtual conference, happening online in early May 2024. It will be a celebration showcasing how the diversity of&nbsp; individuals, organizations, and projects within the Zcash ecosystem contributes to its success and innovative spirit. Our goal is to open doors for inclusive and widespread participation from our global community, while maintaining our commitment to fiscal responsibility amidst the uncertainties surrounding the Dev Fund and market conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using the popular Whova web and mobile app, which received rave reviews during our last conference, ZconV will offer an interactive and dynamic platform for real-time Q&amp;A, discussion boards, polls, chat, and video conferencing. Keep an eye on the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/zconv/">ZconV webpage</a>&nbsp;for continuous updates and ways to engage in these enriching discussions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zcon6 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As for Zcon6 we plan to bring the Zcash Community together for an in-person event in Mexico City in early 2025. This gathering will focus on strategic planning and commitment to long-term projects, empowered by a clear understanding of available resources. The timing in Q1 2025 not only offers cost-effectiveness but also a warm and inviting atmosphere during the colder months in many parts of the world, adding an extra layer of appeal for attendees. Stay tuned for more details on Zcon6, including the exciting reasons behind choosing Mexico City, coming your way by the end of Q3 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us for these two landmark events as we continue to propel Zcash into a bright and unified future!</p>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support, patience, and feedback: we could not do this without you.&nbsp;</p><p>Testnet Stage 3 is now complete, and it provided us with valuable insights, resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 4 of our testnet is live. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p><p>Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p> Protocol rewards update: <p>Before diving into the new features supported by Stage 4, we need to announce our enhanced protocol reward mechanics:</p>  Automatic conversion of pending PRPs into available PRPs upon spending of UTXO/s during transfers and withdrawals  A flat PRP bonus upon spending UTXO/s   Wallets, accounts, and transactions <p>Stage 4 testnet now supports internal transfers and withdrawals.</p> Internal transfers (send and receive) <p>Users can transfer zAssets to other Panther users inside the shielded pool using their zAddress. Every Panther user is assigned a zAddress upon sign-up. Find your zAddress in the dashboard by clicking the Receive button, as shown in the screenshot.</p><p>You can also share your Panther account address (zAddress) via a QR code from the receive screen. </p> Withdrawals <p>Users can now withdraw zAssets from the shielded pool to their external, linked wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>This external wallet may be the wallet linked to the original Panther account. Alternatively, testers may create a new Panther account with an alternative external wallet and withdraw to an account that did not originally deposit assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The withdrawal process performs compliance checks to ensure that users own the zAccount they are interacting with. This step also verifies that the wallet accepting withdrawals has no illegal association as part of the KYT (Know Your Transactions) check.</p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p> Get started with Stage 4 testing <p>To start testing Stage 4, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps outlined.</p> Internal Transfers <p>Log into your MetaMask wallet and sign into the Panther dApp.</p> Step 1: Navigate to the Send screen <p>Send is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt;Send tab  zAssets &gt; Portfolio card &gt; Send button  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the amount to send and choose the token from the menu.

As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in testnet Stage 4! </p><p>Note: An issue was reported after Stage 3 that made a specific zZKP UTXO unusable. This UTXO was created by converting PRP to zZKP. Because this UTXO was unusable, we made a custom filter on dApp to not fetch them thus avoiding confusion between good and bad UTXO.&nbsp;</p><p>Users who had those zZKP UTXO, however, will be compensated by a direct distribution to their externally owned account thereby ensuring rewards are not lost. Users do not need to perform any action on their side. </p> Not sure how to create a Panther testnet account? watch our tutorial below:

          About Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

		<p>On February 7th, 2024, at approximately 12:00pm UTC, ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via hard fork at block #1502800. As previous communications have stated, after this hard fork it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then.&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to remove shielded ZEN from shielded addresses prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your shielded ZEN. It’s important to note that transparent ZEN is not affected by the hard fork, just shielded ZEN.&nbsp;</p><p>This move came with the successfully passed <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a> earlier this year, which enabled the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain. This change built upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">ZenIP 42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features. As a result, it will no longer be possible to conduct a private transaction on Horizen or access private addresses as of February 7, 2024.</p><p>This is a complete removal of all private payment features from Horizen, effective Feb 7, 2024. There will be no private payment capabilities in Horizen as of this change. Regular public payments, just like Bitcoin, will continue to be supported by Horizen. Horizen will not be a privacy cryptocurrency anymore when this takes effect on Feb 7, 2024.</p><p>Again, we strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses transfer their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 7th, 2024. After February 7th, 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p><p>There is a guide on the Horizen Blog on how to De-Shield ZEN on Sphere Wallet, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool. Please reference the guide here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/</a></p><p>The Horizen Ecosystem Team remains readily available to answer any questions around this, please open up a ticket, or reach out to us on our Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a></p>

  Partnering with Oasis Security: The Stars Align  <p>At Sequoia, we look for strong teams going after growing markets. In Danny Brickman and Amit Zimerman, and non-human identity security, that’s exactly what we found.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a>	 



Published January 31, 2024
  



Bogomil, Danny and Amit hiking Twin Peaks in San Francisco.



 
<p>When we first met Danny Brickman in the summer of 2021, we identified him as a young star in the Israeli entrepreneurial ecosystem and someone we should watch. At the time, he was still ideating and had not started a company. But we recognized in him the same passion and drive we’d seen in the founders of Sequoia portfolio companies Wiz and Cyera (who, like Danny, are graduates of the elite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot program</a>).</p>



<p>At the same time, we at Sequoia were developing a thesis that identity was the largest remaining opportunity in security. Why? In part because when we asked CISOs to name their top three priorities, identity security was the most frequent theme. In the lingo of security pros, identity is the new perimeter, with the majority of security attacks today occurring via a malicious actor stealing a user’s identity. It is more important than ever to tighten that perimeter, and to have solid answers to questions like who should have access to what—and who is actually accessing what. Which team members need to use which apps and resources? What kind of access should they have? Are their current privileges too broad?</p>



<p>Most of us are very familiar with the process of securing how humans access systems. We may even get annoyed by the constant reminders to choose stronger passwords—but we know how costly it can be to have our private identity stolen or to allow an attacker into our corporate systems. What comes as a surprise to many, though, is that only a very small fraction of access requests in a company today actually come from humans. In the age of distributed systems, microservices, APIs, automation and AI agents, the overwhelming majority of these requests are from systems and machines—with their own identities, just like ours—accessing other systems and machines.</p>



<p>These non-human identities now outpace human ones by a factor of at least 10, and in some companies 50 or 100—an abundance of riches for an attacker to go after! But even more important, some of these non-human identities like service accounts and secrets (API keys, tokens and certificates) have much broader privileges than most human users; they may be able to not only access an application but also modify its settings or even delete it entirely! And in the hands of bad actors, such identities can wreak yet more havoc—from deleting an entire AWS environment to exfiltrating a lot of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As critical as non-human identities have become, however, the processes and tools for securing them and managing their lifecycle are still emerging—and that can leave teams vulnerable to ticking time bombs, just waiting to explode. One security leader told us about a key generated with permission to read all of the company’s email, with no constraints—which was then emailed to an external contractor who used it to write software on their personal device. Another security admin found a Slack app designed for Christmas greetings that also had full read access to all conversations. Then there was the small recruiting product with root access to all Gmail.</p>



<p>As we at Sequoia explored the challenges and opportunities in the identity security space, we wrote an internal white paper detailing the need we saw, and were considering incubating a company in the domain. But Danny and co-founder Amit Zimerman were recognizing the same opportunity—and they decided to tackle it themselves.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oasis.security/">Oasis Security</a> takes a holistic approach to securing non-human identities, solving for the specific issues that make managing their lifecycle so different from managing human identities. This includes not only the scale, but the rate of change. Human identities change at the rate of employees joining and leaving the team—or changing their passwords. Non-human identities, on the other hand, can be ephemeral, including short-lived tokens and certificates that expire in seconds. Oasis Security’s platform also accounts for the “blast radius” of non-human identities, which are more likely to interfere with entire systems than with individual users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sequoia team is thrilled that the stars aligned for us to support this important work and lead Oasis Security’s Series A, and we are proud to be in business with Danny, Amit and their team as they work to build a generational company. In the face of the huge and growing challenge of securing non-human identity, they are leading the charge toward a solution—and we will all be safer for it.</p>

<p>January 31, 2024, San Francisco, California— Today Brave Software announced the launch of Brave Ads Manager, a new platform to buy, manage, and report on privacy-preserving ad campaigns in the Brave ecosystem. The platform had been in limited <a>beta</a> since last spring and is now offering open <a href="https://ads.brave.com/">registration</a> to customers worldwide.</p>
<p>The Brave browser has grown to an audience of over 65 million monthly users while Brave Ads, which was <a>introduced in 2019</a>, has successfully run 9,000+ campaigns for 1,500+ advertisers in 200 countries. Throughout 2023, Brave Ads also expanded with the help of early adopters to ad placements on <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, the fastest growing search engine since Bing. Brave’s recent clients include Ford, Intuit, Norton, Swarovski, and Wayfair.</p>

 Reaching the next generation of early adopters 
<p><a>Brave users</a> are lead users and are passionate about their role in the future of the Web. As early adopters of emerging technologies like Web3 and AI, they value independence, quality content, and privacy above all when browsing. This makes them engaged but not easily reachable through conventional channels.</p>
<p>Brave Ads reconnects users with advertisers and enables direct relationships where users and brands meet on their own terms. Users set preferences for privacy-respecting ads, choosing when, where and how often to engage. Advertisers signal care for customers by respecting these choices, building goodwill and trust. No trackers or cookies are ever used. Ultimately, both parties benefit from Brave’s model of transparency and control over online experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With over 65 million users and growing, Brave can’t be ignored by brands who want to reach the people at the frontier of the Web. What Brave users do, buy, and talk about today, the rest of the world will be doing, buying, and talking about in years to come.”</p>
<p>Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations</p>
</blockquote>

 The easiest way to advertise with privacy in mind 
<p>Customers can navigate a familiar and streamlined campaign creation process to create their Brave Ads campaigns in minutes. Once a campaign is submitted for review, customers can expect launch within 48 hours. Throughout the campaign, customers will have access to a dashboard to view campaign performance through a range of basic and advanced tools, all designed for practical use in the cookieless Web.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Brave Ads Manager campaign creation</p>

 Unique browser-based ad placements 
<p>Brave Ads Manager customers have the option to buy Notification and Newsfeed ad placements, two of four available ad types found throughout the Brave <a>browser</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/notification/">Notification ads</a> were the first—and remain the most popular—ad unit to launch with Brave Ads in the browser. For acquisition-based campaign objectives, advertisers can leverage Mindset Ad Targeting, Brave’s unique ad-matching technology that delivers precision, interest-based targeting at the browser level without risks or harm to privacy.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/news/">Newsfeed ads</a> are native image and text placements integrated seamlessly within Brave News, a free and customizable RSS and news aggregator available in the Brave browser via a new tab page. Ads in Brave News are always 100% SOV (share of voice)—two ads will never display in the feed at the same time.</p>

<p>About Brave Ads</p>
<p><a>Brave Ads launched in 2019</a> with the goal of reforming an increasingly user-hostile Web, made worse by ever-invasive tracking from innumerable ad-technology firms competing to capture as much data—people’s data—as possible. Brave Ads are cookieless, don’t track or identify users, and offer choice in how brands engage with them as they browse and search the Web.</p>

<p>Happy 8th Birthday, PIVX!</p><p>It’s time to celebrate another incredible year of achievements and growth. Over the past year, PIVX has reached new heights, expanding its use cases, increasing rewards, gaining listings on various exchanges, and engaging with its vibrant community.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of this remarkable year for&nbsp;PIVX:</p><p>Rewards Increase: <br>The most significant highlight was the rewards increase. With the mandatory PIVX v5.5.0 update in January 2023, payments to the treasury, staking rewards, and Masternode rewards all received a significant boost. Treasury payments surged by an order of magnitude to 10 PIV per block, staking payments doubled to 4 PIV per block, and Masternode payments also doubled to 6 PIV per block. These increases have incentivized more participation and further strengthened the PIVX&nbsp;network!</p><p>Use Case Expansion: <br>PIVX expanded its use cases throughout the year. PIVCards, Coinsbee, and <a href="https://www.travala.com/">Travala.com</a> embraced $PIVX as a payment option. Users can now purchase gift cards from all over the world with PIV on<a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/"> mypivxwallet.org, PIVCards</a>, <a href="https://shopping.io/">Shopping.io</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coinsbee.com/">Coinsbee</a> offers a platform where $PIVX can be used to purchase various gift&nbsp;cards.</p><p>Listing Growth: <br>PIVX experienced significant listing growth, providing more opportunities for PIVX enthusiasts. New listings included <a href="https://whitebit.com/">Whitebit</a>, <a href="https://changeangel.io/">Changeangel</a>, <a href="https://houdiniswap.com/">Houdini Swap</a>, <a href="https://cointopay.com/">Cointopay</a>, <a href="https://swapuz.com/">Swapuz</a>, <a href="https://easybit.com/">Easybit, </a><a href="https://www.coinex.com/">CoinEx</a>, <a href="https://dex-trade.com/">Dex-Trade</a>, Securus Wallet, <a href="https://www.biconomy.com/">Biconomy,</a> Coinstore, <a href="https://nonkyc.io/">NonKYC</a>, <a href="https://changenow.io/">ChangeNOW </a>widget added to PIVX.org, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/markets">TradeOgre</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/breaking-news-9615d5416f6c">P2P payments on Binance,</a> <a href="https://www.lbank.com/">LBank</a>, <a href="https://arcticwallet.io/">Arctic Wallet</a>, <a href="https://finchpay.io/">FinchPay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xt.com/en">Xt.com</a>.</p><p>Enhanced Trading Options: <br>PIVX gained enhanced trading options with various exchanges. In addition to the PIVX/USDT Binance trading pair, some other exchanges introduced BTC as well as USDT options, allowing for more convenient and accessible trading options for the PIVX community.</p><p>Community Engagement: <br>PIVX actively engaged with its community through various activities. These included YouTube shorts, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), the SuperBlock Report (PIVXLabs), PIVXcommunity contests, and the Privacy Roundtable, a collaborative group consisting of PIVX, BasicSwapDEX, Particl, and Firo. The Privacy Roundtable, hosts monthly Twitter spaces where trending privacy topics are discussed and other privacy projects are introduced. These initiatives are fostering a more vibrant and engaged community.</p><p>As we celebrate PIVX’s 8th birthday, we can proudly reflect on these achievements over the past year. The rewards increase, expanded use cases, listing growth, enhanced trading options, and community engagement have all contributed to the growth and success of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>On this special day, let us say that growth is not a destination, but an ongoing journey. As we celebrate PIVX’s achievements, we recognize that it is through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the embrace of new opportunities, and the adaptability to changing circumstances that PIVX continues to evolve and expand. Let us come together as a community committed to learning and adapting, keeping PIVX at the forefront of innovation and progress in the pursuit of privacy and financial sovereignty</p><p>Happy 8th birthday, PIVX!

With this grant, StarShell will allow users to route wallet RPC requests through the Nym mixnet, bringing metadata protection and robust privacy guarantees to end users. The wallet will include real-time metrics and visualizations based on mixnet activity. A new API will allow web applications to route all chain-directed traffic through the mixnet via the&nbsp;wallet.</p> <a href="https://www.nodies.app/">Nodies DLB</a> <p>Grant amount: $30,000USD</p><p>Nodies DLB is a managed infrastructure provider for centralized and decentralized remote procedure call (RPC) nodes, which enable communication between applications and blockchain networks. Nodies DLB gives its clients access to thousands of decentralized nodes while maintaining best-in-class security and performance standards. However, there is currently a scarcity of decentralized privacy-preserving RPC solutions. Nodies DLB proposes integrating its software with the Nym mixnet to bring end-to-end privacy protections to its assets including advanced metadata protection.</p> Pastenym by <a href="https://notrustverify.ch/">No Trust&nbsp;Verify</a> <p>Grant amount: $3,000USD</p><p>Pastenym is a text-sharing service proposed by long-time Nym community contributors and node operators,<a href="https://notrustverify.ch/"> No Trust Verify</a>. In the manner of Pastebin, Pastenym is an online text-drop but with added privacy protections for its users via the mixnet, encrypting their data as well as their metadata when text is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Congratulations again to these successful teams!</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">Nym Innovation Fund remains open for submissions</a>.</p><p>As these projects mature over the next quarter, we will introduce them to the venture funds that have pledged to support the Nym Innovation Fund. In addition, we’re hoping to onboard existing mature projects with their own plans for growth using Nym that can attract venture capital funding. Proposals with a business plan, a unique market proposition, and that are mature enough for seed investment will receive priority.</p><p>In addition to opening a pipeline to respected VCs, Nym will mentor successful teams to further refine their proposals.</p><p>With the VPN market alone projected to be <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/report/vpn">worth $151bn by 2030</a>, there’s enormous market potential for an entire ecosystem that actually respects people’s right to privacy&nbsp;online.</p><p>People are fed up with the surveillance capitalism model of web 2.0.

<p>To our winner, Sam Richter, congratulations on this well-deserved $2,500 cash prize you can use toward tuition, books, or anything else college requires. When informed of his big win, Sam said: “I plan to put the money towards my college tuition as I pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science at Iowa State University.” In addition to the cash prize, Sam’s photo will be seen by Brave’s 60+ million worldwide users as a featured background on the Brave browser’s new tab page throughout 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam took the picture when he and his family hiked on a trail in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada. His photo not only shows a remarkable moment in nature, but also his technique and creative eye.</p>
<p>At Brave, we believe in building a human-first Web, and empowering anyone to participate in that Web by creating user-generated content. The Brave new tab page is another surface where people can show their creative selves.</p>
<p>For those who submitted but did not win: Thank you! And, stay tuned—there may be more opportunities and exciting events in the near future.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for being a part of the Brave community.</p>

Decentralization enables strong privacy properties making it near-impossible to trace your traffic through the internet. But NymVPN is not just a dVPN, it also features mixnet technology: a novel feature ensuring unlinkability and strong privacy protections of not just the content of your messages but also your metadata.</p>The Nym mixnet in action via NymVPN’s 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode<p>Mixnets are a unique privacy technology that have only now, after years of research, become available to ordinary people. By shuffling your traffic through a stratified network of nodes and shuffling the order of packets, your patterns of communication vanish and become untraceable to unwanted observers. NymVPN is the first user-friendly application built on the Nym network. As plug-and-play privacy-as-a-service infrastructure across the transport layer of the internet, the mixnet will in time be folded into browsers, search engines, and blockchains across the Web3 ecosystem. <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Read more about mixnets&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Combining the best of both worlds, NymVPN has two distinct modes in one simple application:</p><p>The NymVPN 2-hop dVPN&nbsp;mode:</p>  Optimized for&nbsp;speed;  Customisable entry and exit nodes for geo-blocking resistance;  IP address obfuscation for everyday browsing, streaming, or&nbsp;gaming;  Multi-hop by default, going far beyond the privacy standards of most&nbsp;VPNs.  <p>And</p><p>The NymVPN 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode:</p>  Optimized for&nbsp;privacy;  Complete privacy against even government-level adversaries for sensitive use cases like crypto transactions and secure email that are not timing sensitive;  No more metadata leakage of timing and volume of&nbsp;packets;  Traffic analysis resistance via packet shuffling and dummy traffic in inner-three mix&nbsp;nodes.  <p>Nym is trustless, permissionless, and totally transparent. Unlike traditional VPNs where you have to trust that the provider isn’t spying on your communications, Nym’s full stack is decentralized and open source with gateways and mix nodes dispersed all around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>As <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nyms-2024-new-year-resolutions-aeb6d1123c00">Nym CEO and cofounder Harry Halpin said in his new year note</a>, if 2023 was about readying the Nym network for usage, 2024 is the year everyone everywhere will be able to enjoy truly private access to the internet.</p><p><a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">Sign up to the NymVPN waitlist&nbsp;now.</a></p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvQAMpeqJB?s=20">Catch Marc Debizet, Head of Product at Nym for a live Ask Me Anything on Twitter spaces, 30 January at 14:30-UTC.</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-alpha-is-ready-for-private-launch-in-february-f268a9388e62">NymVPN alpha is ready for private launch in February</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This latest version is a hotfix release, to temporarily remove the experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature introduced in the preceding 1.5.1 release. Following the 1.5.1 release on GitHub, we identified difficulties in publishing the&nbsp;zebra-chain&nbsp;crate to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, to resolve this challenge, which involves an unpublished dependency, we had to temporarily remove the internal miner support introduced in version 1.5.1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 1.5.1 release includes a utility for reading results from the zebra blockchain scanner, thus finalizing a minimum viable product for scanning the Zcash blockchain with a viewing key. It also added an experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature, temporarily removed with the 1.5.2 hotfix release, which can mine blocks within&nbsp;zebrad. This feature is only supported on testnet as you need to use a more efficient GPU or ASIC for mainnet mining.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We plan to reinstate the&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature once our PRs are merged and released into the&nbsp;equihash dependency. You can track development progress on this issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/8183">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of this release we have also improved our documentation with details on how to use the new blockchain scanning feature as well as making it easier to find documentation for all our crates in <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see a full copy of the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.1">v1.5.1 Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.2">v1.5.2 Release Notes</a> on github.</p>

 Zcash Viewing Keys 



<p>When a Zcash user creates a shielded transaction, they encrypt it to the recipient’s address. Being able to access the data hidden behind the encryption is a necessary condition for the recipient to spend the funds, but it’s not sufficient since the recipient also needs to prove ownership of the spending key corresponding to the address. To decrypt the shielded transaction, the recipient uses a so-called viewing key, which they derive from their spending key. A viewing key allows decryption of the shielded data but reveals nothing about the spending key, effectively allowing “viewing” of shielded transactions but not spending of them.</p>



 Blockchain Scanning with Zebra 



<p>All Zcash users use their viewing keys to learn about what transactions belong to them. They try to decrypt each transaction in the blockchain to see if they can unlock the shielded data. We refer to this process as scanning or trial decryption. Light clients can perform the scanning locally so that the public server they communicate with doesn’t learn anything about their transactions. However, some users operate their own infrastructure. These are typically enterprise users, such as exchanges, which are best served using a scanning service closely linked to their full node.</p>



<p>At Zcon4, the Electric Coin Company and Zcash Foundation agreed to move the Zcash ecosystem to Zebra. To be able to do so, Zebra needs to support wallets capable of replacing the wallet in zcashd. As a first step toward this goal, we decided to extend Zebra with a blockchain scanner that accepts viewing keys and performs the trial decryption of shielded transactions. The scanner then stores the results in persistent storage. This functionality should allow for an efficient implementation of wallets relying on Zebra.</p>



 Implementation Details 



<p>The current scanner is a new crate in the Zebra repository, in the form of a minimum viable product. It relies on the librustzcash library to perform the scanning, and supports only Sapling. It reads all blocks through Zebra’s internal state service and stores the TXIDs, referring to transactions that contain notes decryptable by the provided viewing keys. The storage is a separate instance of RocksDB that Zebra also uses for storing the state.</p>



<p>The current version of the scanner is documented for users in our <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">Zebra book</a>. If you want to give it a try, you can use <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-utils#scanning-results-reader">this tool</a> to read the scanning results. If you submit the scanning <a href="https://zecpages.com/boardinfo">key from ZECpages</a>, it will print all posts from the board to standard output. The next step for the scanner is to implement a gRPC frontend, exposing the scanner’s capabilities to Zebra users.</p>

 New C/C++ bindings open the door for deeper Bitcoin, Zcash, Firo integrations and&nbsp;more. <p>The Nym mixnet is a powerful plug-and-play privacy infrastructure that protects any kind of communication in transit. Not only does the mixnet protect your data, but by shuffling traffic it protects metadata too, making your internet habits invisible. In order for the mixnet to be really plug and play, though, it needs to be able to communicate outside of its native Rust code&nbsp;base.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/pembaruan-nym-rust-sdk-25dc81aa15ff">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-nym-rust-sdk-bc2464efb07b">Русский</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n1adb4103b630">日本</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-rust-sdk-g%C3%BCncellemesi-0bfadbb15841">Türkçe</a></p><p>Now, any projects written in C++ will be able to more easily integrate with the Nym mixnet thanks to a new interface available in the Nym Rust SDK: <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp">C/C++ bindings</a>. And there are a lot of projects that have C/C++ components, from the Bitcoin source code to libbitcoin, Zcash, Firo, some components of the Signal messaging app and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Developers: please try out these bindings! You can find a reference implementation example <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp/src/main.cpp">here</a> for how C/C++ devs could interact with the SDK. Try to connect your application with the mixnet and see what you can do. If you have any questions or feedback, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">please do reach out on Matrix/Element</a>.</p><p>For the rest of you, what do these bindings mean? Let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p> Why does Nym need C/C++ bindings? <p>The backend of the Nym stack is written in Rust. Rust is a great language and has been adopted by projects across the crypto, security, and privacy space because of its design — to be a flexible and fast low-level systems language, which aims to remove an entire class of memory-related issues that other languages fall foul&nbsp;of.</p><p>However, when you’re making a generic network layer for the rest of the internet, relying on a relatively new language can create issues — after all, Rust’s first stable release was in 2015. Projects use a lot of other languages, and not all of these are interoperable.</p><p>In an ideal world, one would be able to write everything in Rust and cross-compile it to be able to use it anywhere. (See the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/Motivation.html#how">Motivation section</a> of the UniFFI documentation for a bit more on&nbsp;this.)</p><p>Unfortunately this glorious future has not yet come to pass. So instead the team has to rely on writing Foreign Function Interface (FFI) code; this essentially creates a translation mechanism for code in one language to call code in&nbsp;another.</p><p>The Rust compiler cannot and does not understand C++ code. Therefore, the Rust compiler needs to be told about code to use on the C++ side. Language bindings are the glue to make this communication happen.</p><p>One of the nice things about Rust is that it, like many other languages, exposes a C <a href="https://slightknack.github.io/rust-abi-wiki/intro/what_is_an_ABI.html">Application Binary Interface</a> (ABI) — something that defines how to interact with a piece of compiled code. For example, with Nym this might be how to call a function that starts a process of listening out for incoming messages from the mixnet, or how the code deals with managing data in memory such as storing incoming messages and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html#private-replies-using-surbs">replySURBs</a> for your app to use later&nbsp;on.</p><p>Why is this important, and how does one acronym (ABI) relate to the other (FFI)? Like&nbsp;so:</p><blockquote>“The FFI is the user-code interface the language provides to interact with other executables, which may have a different ABI. The FFI forms the transition layer between different ABIs.” — <a href="https://slightknack.github.io/rust-abi-wiki/intro/what_is_an_ABI.html#what's-the-difference-between-an-abi-and-an-api%20fi">From the Rust ABI&nbsp;wiki</a>.</blockquote> Nym Rust SDK&nbsp;update <p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp">The first version of some FFI bindings for the Nym Rust SDK</a> were published this&nbsp;week.</p><p>This means applications written in C/C++ can start experimenting with integrating mixnet functionality by interacting with the Nym Rust SDK, using these bindings.</p><p>The development team has covered the initial functions that developers will need for starting to experiment with the mixnet: creating a Nym client and sending and receiving messages. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp/src/main.cpp">reference implementation / example</a> of how C/C++ devs might interact with the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This is an important step in making the mixnet more accessible to third parties, so previously unsupported developers can use Nym’s Rusk SDK.

<p>With today’s desktop browser update (v1.62), we are excited to announce that we have integrated Mixtral 8x7B as the default large language model (LLM) in <a>Leo</a>, our recently released, privacy-preserving AI browser assistant. <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is an open source LLM released by <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a> this past December, and has already seen broad usage due to its speed and performance. In addition, we’ve made several improvements to the Leo user experience, focusing on clearer onboarding, context controls, input and response formatting, and general UI polish.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Unveiling Mixtral 8x7B 
<p>Mixtral is now the default LLM for all Leo users, for the free version and the Premium version ($15/month). The free version is rate limited, and subscribers to Leo Premium benefit from higher rate limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Among other benefits, Mixtral can:</p>
 
 Handle larger contexts 
 Interact in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish 
 Generate code 
 
<p>Brave is already using Mixtral for its newly released <a>Code LLM</a> feature for programming-related queries in <a>Brave Search</a>, and the combination of Mixtral’s performance with its open source nature made it a natural fit for integration in Leo, given Brave’s commitment to open models and the open source community.</p>
<p>“Since its release, Brave Leo has been adopted by tens of thousands of free tier users and paid subscribers, and we expect even greater adoption as we expand our availability of LLMs to include Mixtral,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder at Brave. “Our aim is to create novel and convenient use cases in the context of users’ browsing sessions, and to help our users interact with the Web in groundbreaking ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very happy to see Mixtral being used to power CodeLLM in Brave Search, and to now have Mixtral integrated in Brave Leo,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO at Mistral Al. “Making Mixtral available as an open model enables Brave to easily integrate it and to fulfill their users’ growing AI needs.”&nbsp;</p>

 Giving Leo users choice with a variety of LLMs 
<p>Unlike other AI assistants, Brave Leo offers its users the flexibility to choose from different models according to their needs and budget. While we’ve added Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for both the free and premium versions of Brave Leo, we also offer Claude Instant from Anthropic in the free version (with rate limits) and for Premium. The free and premium versions of Leo also feature the Llama 2 13B model from Meta.</p>
<p>With Mixtral’s integration, Leo users will notice a significant performance improvement in the answer/result quality. Regarding the free Leo version, users will also have the option to revert to the previous Leo experience with Llama 2 and continue their AI experience once they reach the rate limits for Mixtral.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>Privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. Privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers. 
 No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp; 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 Ready to try Brave Leo? 
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it’s built right into the browser, so no extra apps or extensions are required. Leo provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or as a sidebar, chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage. Leo helps users with all sorts of tasks in the context of the page they are on by creating real-time summaries of webpages or videos. Leo can also answer questions about content, generate new content, translate pages, analyze them, and rewrite them. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, writing code, or creating content, Leo is integrated in the browser for enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>To access Leo, Brave desktop users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in the Brave Sidebar.</p>
<p>Leo has been available to Brave desktop users since November (<a>version 1.60</a>). Leo will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) soon. Learn more about <a>Brave Leo</a>, or see a <a>roadmap</a> for Leo.</p>

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  To kick off 2024, we're thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>To kick off 2024, we’re thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed. The improved Brave News creates an even more seamless experience for catching up on personalized news, by simply scrolling down in a new browser tab. Brave News is free and the update includes a streamlined interface as well as an upgrade to the local personalization algorithms. These changes make Brave News both easier to use and smarter about the stories you see, while maintaining Brave’s privacy promise.</p>
<p>This newly optimized Brave News feed gives users more choice and control over what they see, and options for filtering content by channel or publisher. The improved local feed algorithm helps users discover new and interesting stories and provides suggestions for following channels and publishers they might enjoy. Users can also add RSS feeds, and choose to view content only from their favorite local publishers, blogs, or community sites.</p>
<p>Key updates include:</p>
 
 A For you section that shows stories based on your interests and local browsing history - while never infringing on your privacy 
 An updated top news section and story clusters 
 A filter view for viewing content by channel, source, or RSS feed 
 An easily visible news preview on the new tab page, with the latest news that may be of interest to you 
 

 One place, better control 
<p>In this update, we were hyper-focused on the way news is presented. We redesigned the Brave News space to show more articles and be more conscious about how we display images so you can get more value from a glance. We also added a side navigation panel so you can explore your favorite channels and publishers in a single click.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking for an interesting mix of daily news, then check out the For you and Following feeds. Whether you want an overview of the day’s news, or you’re looking for something specific, Brave News puts you in control of your news experience…all while protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>To find Brave News, just open Brave on your desktop, then open a new tab and scroll down.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Redesigned Brave News feed page</p>

 Content that’s relevant to you 
<p>Endlessly scrolling through irrelevant news can be a real time waste. That’s why we overhauled how your feed is created and personalized, making it smarter and more attuned to your interests. The improved Brave News now prioritizes showing you content you may actually want to read.</p>
<p>Some new features take the form of new types of cards displayed in the feed. Channel cards, for example, are single-themed deep dives into the channels and topics you care about the most. And for US users, Top stories cards neatly summarize the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Left: Channel card: single-themed deep dives into topics you care about most. Right: Top Stories card: summaries of the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>To make customizing your feed even easier, we added Customize cards to the feed. These cards will recommend new publishers and/or channels you might be interested in, based on your existing preferences and signals.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Brave News customization cards</p>
<p>The customization menu is also accessible via the settings button at the bottom right, or via the Add button in the new side navigation panel.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>News aggregators are a common way to consume news. However, the way most popular aggregators work is by collecting and storing your preferences, consumption habits, and other behavioral data to determine what news to show you.</p>
<p>But the news you consume can tell a lot about you, from your political beliefs to fine-grained interests (e.g. a review about a self-help book) and more. For these reasons, we believe that the news you consume should have the same privacy protections as anything else you do online. Unlike others, Brave does not collect or store your data.</p>
<p>From how articles are delivered to how and where personalization happens, Brave News has been designed with privacy in mind. Information about your consumption habits—what channels and publishers you follow, the exact articles you click and read, and more—never leaves your computer. Because a great news experience does not require data collection, Brave’s local personalization mechanisms ensure the news in your feed is relevant, interesting, and private.</p>

Only nodes running on Mainnet have to be updated.      <p>IMPORTANT: 5.0.0.<br>After the previously mentioned Hard Fork, it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br><br></p><p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0.md">Here.</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p>Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase: A Gateway to Promising Opportunities</p><p>As we commemorate the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://pivx.org/news/pivx-rewards-increase">PIVX’s rewards increase,</a> it is a moment of celebration and reflection on the positive impact this decision has had on the PIVX ecosystem. On January 22, 2023, coinciding with block 3715200, PIVX embraced the version 5.5.0 upgrade, marking a significant milestone in its financial structure. This upgrade brought forth remarkable changes, including increased payments to the treasury, staking and Masternode rewards, setting the stage for further growth, innovation, and community engagement.</p><p>Expanding Opportunities and Strengthening the Network:<br>With the rewards increase, maximum treasury payments soared to 10 PIV per block. This surge in funding allows for greater support for listings, use cases, development, marketing, and essential initiatives within the PIVX community. Simultaneously, staking rewards doubled to 4 PIV per block, providing an incentive for more PIVX holders to actively participate in securing the network. Doubling of Masternode payments to 6 PIV per block further encourages the growth of Masternodes, enabling them to vote on treasury expenditures and contribute to future PIVX applications. These advancements not only strengthen the PIVX network but also open doors to exciting opportunities for growth and development.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>As we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the PIVX rewards increase, we acknowledge the positive impact it has had on the project’s financial structure. The rewards increase is succeeding in enhancing funding, stimulating proposal submissions, expanding use cases, and attracting more listings for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX.</a> It has played a vital role in supporting various initiatives and contributing to the growth and opportunities of the&nbsp;<a href="http://Discord.PIVX.org">project.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/celebrating-one-year-of-pivx-rewards-increase-9c4146cd3e17">Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

The reasons for this are twofold: enormous operating costs and seamless user experience (e.g. social logins and account recovery), which, until recently, could only be solved through centralisation.

		 Introduction <p>The target date for full secure node depreciation is Mar 11, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> was introduced and voted on in November 2023 and the community overwhelmingly voted in favor of deprecating secure nodes and repurposing the coinbase reward that secure nodes were receiving to EON forger nodes.&nbsp; However, secure nodes have not yet been fully deprecated.&nbsp; This blog post outlines the steps remaining, the timeline to full secure node deprecation, additional information on EON forger nodes and a link to instructions on setting up a forger node.</p> Details <p>This date listed above represents the date that the secure node tracking system is shut off, and that changes to both EON and Horizen are implemented (and sufficiently tested) to enable the movement of the coinbase reward from Horizen to EON, and then the subsequent distribution of the coinbase reward to forgers who have forged blocks.</p> Timeline   Jan 25, 2024 – changes to EON implemented  Feb 7, 2024 – next mainchain hardfork  Mar 10, 2024 – last secure node earning period ends  Mar 11, 2024 – last secure node payment performed, secure nodes fully deprecated  Mar 18, 2024 – first coinbase rewards deposited into Horizen EON   What are Horizen EON Forger Nodes and Why are they Important? <p></p><p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p><p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>  Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral.  Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded.  Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss of rewards if they behave maliciously.  Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power.  Sybil attack resistance: The larger the number of honest forger nodes, the harder a sybil attack becomes.  Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved.  <p>Learn more about Horizen EON Forger Nodes and why they are important by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-are-horizen-eon-forger-nodes-and-why-we-need-them/">reviewing our blog post on the subject.</a>&nbsp;</p> EON Forger Node Instructions <p>For step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run an EON forger node, please visit <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified">our GitHub repository below</a> to learn more. If you intend to run a forger node, please select ‘forger’ when executing the ‘init.sh’ script for the first time. Keep in mind that both the Mainchain node and the Sidechain node will require some time to fully synchronize the entire chains.</p>

Some of you will already know about it. You might even have heard of how this problem can be fixed and have joined the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">community working together to fix it</a>. For the rest of you, it’s time you’re also let in on the secret. This is for you: discover exactly what happens to your data and come along for a five-hop ride through the maze of mixnet technology.</p><p>The internet is a wild and wonderful place. An immense, global network of information, gossip and chatter, broken into little packets and routed through networks organised by protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP, UDP, FTP, TLS,&nbsp;DNS…</p><p>Billions of packets are routed through the internet every minute using these common protocols. But here’s the problem: the packets can be traced. It doesn’t matter that the content is encrypted, packets can still be watched to see who is speaking to who, how often, and from where. The standard protocols of the internet leave your patterns of communication fully visible to anyone watching parts of or the whole network. This includes internet service providers, VPN providers, internet exchanges, autonomous systems, BGP routers, even WiFi routers, LAN, and famously, the NSA and other security agencies.</p><p>So what can be done about&nbsp;it?</p><p>The obvious thing would be to immediately throw a cover over the internet to protect these packets. After all, it’s ludicrous that one of the main vehicles of communication for the entire world allows all kinds of people, companies and agencies to watch your communication without your knowledge. This is really not a normal state of affairs. And it’s about time it&nbsp;changes.</p><p>A mixnet is an ‘overlay network’ and provides just such a cover for internet&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>A novel update to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358549.358563">decades-old concept</a> of mixed networks, the Nym mixnet scrambles traffic patterns to prevent corporate and government surveillance — and is designed for scale, usability, and anonymity.</p><p>Mixnets send your packets through several hops and mix them so that it becomes nearly impossible to trace these patterns of communication from one end to the other. Let’s go on a journey through the five hops of the Nym mixnet to learn more about exactly how that&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Here’s the TL;DR overview of the full&nbsp;journey:</p>  The Nym client (this lives on your device to encrypt your packets before they get sent to the&nbsp;mixnet)  The entry gateway (this is the first hop and entry point to the magical world of&nbsp;mixnets)  The three mix nodes (these perform packet shuffling, scrambling communications)  The exit gateway (where data is sent out from the&nbsp;mixnet)  Hello world! Your packet has now entered the internet with no traceability back to&nbsp;you.   Nym mixnet traffic flow step one: the Nym&nbsp;client <p>The Nym client lives on your device. It takes any outbound traffic before it leaves your device and wraps each packet in layers of encryption. A packet is simply a piece of data that’s built using cryptographic primitives. The Nym mixnet uses a special type of packet called <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Sphinx</a>, which is different from a TCP/IP packet. The way a Sphinx packet is designed is to ensure the confidentiality of your content or communications. Each Sphinx packet looks identical to others, to make them untraceable within the network based on their binary&nbsp;pattern.</p>Diagram of the traffic sent by the Nym WebAssembly Client<p>At the high level, a Sphinx packet is composed of two independent parts, a header and a body/payload part.</p><p>The header encapsulates all routing information needed to route the packet through the mixnet to the recipient. The payload contains the content of the communication, for example our ‘Hello World!’ message that we want to send through the mixnet. Both the header and the payload are independently layer-encrypted, meaning that there is a separate layer of encryption for each hop in the route. This also means that if your client has selected mix nodes A, B, C for your packet P, no other nodes can successfully process your packet P. And for each packet sent through the Nym mixnet, a Sphinx acknowledgment is received by the previous node, so they know it has&nbsp;arrived.</p><p>Sphinx encryption is a novel type of onion encryption, named for the lustrous layers of the root vegetable protecting its tiny core. Onion encryption ensures ‘bitwise-unlinkability’. In short, this means that when your packet traverses a mixnode, it changes its binary appearance. Neither the nodes in the route, nor a global surveillance actor observing the whole network, can link sender to receiver. For example, even if an entry and exit node collude, neither of them can tell whether they processed any common packets because of the changing binary pattern. Traditional TCP or UDP packets do not provide such a property, i.e. they look the same ‘going in’ as they do ‘going&nbsp;out’.</p><p>In addition to unlinkability, Sphinx provides ‘integrity protection’. What this means is that if a malicious node tries to malform a packet, Sphinx detects it and the packet is dropped in the network to prevent the tracing of tainted packets. Moreover, the Sphinx protocol also offers Single-Use-Reply-Blocks as a tool for anonymous replies, so the recipient of a packet can reply to the original sender without the need to learn their network location (i.e.,&nbsp;IP).</p><p>To summarize, the Nym client lives on a user’s device or in an app. The Nym client manages the secure connection with the selected gateway, encrypts your communications and facilitates sending packets through the Nym mixnet. It also does things like storing a user’s private keys and NYM tokens to facilitate bandwidth credentials and more — but that’s for another&nbsp;time!</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step two: the entry&nbsp;gateway <p>A gateway is the entry point to the mixnet. It acts as a proxy between the Nym client and the Nym mixnet and checks that a user has the necessary credentials to use the mixnet — whether they or the app they’re using have paid for fair&nbsp;usage.</p><p>All gateways are operated by the Nym community to ensure complete decentralization of the mixnet system. There are currently <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">70 gateways</a>, which can be viewed on <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways">Nym Explorer</a> along with metrics like routing score and reliability.</p><p>The gateways are necessary for a few&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Gateways check bandwidth credentials to ensure that a particular user has a right to use the Nym mixnet — i.e., that they paid for it. This also limits Denial of Service attacks and free-riding, where people squeeze resources from networks without contributing to&nbsp;them.  Secondly, gateways also act as offline storage for incoming packets — so if a client is offline, the gateway stores this incoming communication until it gets back&nbsp;online.  And third, the gateway is your, well, gateway into the mixnet from the Nym client. This also means that the gateway can potentially see the client’s IP address. But they do not know anything about the destination of the packet, nor its content or metadata.  <p>For super users, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">it’s possible to run your own gateway</a> if you don’t want to expose the IP to that first&nbsp;hop.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step three: the three mix&nbsp;nodes <p>Your packet has now been Sphinx encypted by your client and sent to the entry gateway. Now what? This is where the magic ‘mixing’ happens. The entry gateway decrypts one layer of Sphinx to check which mix node to send your packet to first. What is a mix node? An independently run server that someone in the Nym community has created, also called a ‘hop’. All mix nodes are visible on the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways">Nym Explorer</a>.</p><p>This hop depends on a number of factors including geographical proximity and which mix nodes have been selected for the ‘active set’. The active set is simply the amount of nodes that are currently active and mixing traffic: 240 at any given&nbsp;time.</p><p>This ‘active set’ changes every ‘epoch’ — one epoch lasts an hour — and a selection algorithm checks the performance and reputation of nodes. This ensures traffic paths are continuously changing and malicious paths cannot be established by hostile node operators.</p><p>What is a ‘layer’ in the mixnet? Well, the mixnet arranges nodes into something called a ‘stratified topology’, which just means that the nodes are grouped into three layers, with the three hops distributed across these layers. This is to ensure horizontal scalability, efficiency, and anonymity by&nbsp;design.</p><p>When a data packet is routed, a mix node is picked at random from each layer, and a path is composed that has three hops. Take a look at this&nbsp;gif:</p><p>These mechanisms alone vastly improve user anonymity compared to traditional VPNs or even other decentralized privacy-preserving technologies.</p><p>But that’s not all: there are two very important features that make ‘following the packet’ even more difficult. These are timing obfuscation and cover&nbsp;traffic.</p>POV: you’re the NSA trying to track a data packet on the&nbsp;mixnet.<p>Timing obfuscation means that the order of packets are shuffled and reordered by each of the three mix nodes. This makes it near impossible for an observer to correlate an incoming to an outgoing packet. These intervals are practically imperceptible to&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Adding even further anonymity, all real data packets are mixed in with cover traffic. These are empty data packets that are the same size as real data packets. They’re useful for privacy because they create a “crowd” of packets obscuring any traffic patterns in a flurry of fake communication that’s useless to anyone snooping on the&nbsp;network.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step four: The exit&nbsp;gateway <p>Your packet has now reached the final hop in its journey: the exit gateway. The exit gateway will decrypt the final destination of the packet, working in tandem with a service provider that will connect the packet to whichever ‘clearnet’ website or app you are trying to&nbsp;reach.</p><p>The gateway can see the final destination. However, your data is routed on a per packet basis. This means that even in the event a malicious exit gateway was set up and was picked for the active set, it would only see a tiny portion of your traffic. Furthermore, the gateway does not see any plaintext. Content is still end-to-end encrypted by the original sender and is only decrypted by the receiving client.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step five: Hello&nbsp;world! <p>Your packet has now reached the rest of the world, passing through the protective cover of the mixnet. The patterns of your traffic have been protected, your data end to end encrypted, and any snoopers will have surely lost your packet by now. But this journey is just for a packet going out. But what about replies? And what if an app wants to fetch information via the&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>Nym uses something called Single Use Reply Blocks, or SURBs. These allow applications to interact with other applications anonymously via the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Say a client application needs to interact with an online service or a P2P application on another person’s machine. To avoid revealing any gateway or client keys (and defeating the point of anonymity via the mixnet), SURBs allow for anonymous interactions.</p><p>A SURB is a layer-encrypted set of Sphinx headers that detail a reply path that ends in the original application’s address. These are encrypted by the senders’ client so that a receiving service or application can attach its response and send back a Sphinx packet, without knowing who it is replying&nbsp;to.</p><p>In the case of larger anonymous replies like files, the mixnet uses something called ‘MultiSURBs’ — where a bundle of SURBs are created rather than just the one to handle bigger data capacity.</p><p>There is much more to the story, so stick around for next week’s deep-dive into the Nym&nbsp;client.</p><p>The power of the mixnet will soon reach ordinary people: <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> is launching later this&nbsp;year.</p>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">Sign up</a> to the&nbsp;waitlist  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">Get involved as a beta&nbsp;tester!</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p>Privacy loves&nbsp;company</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p><p>The Nym mixnet is run by a wonderful community of operators all over the world.

<p>Following the recent listing of <a href="https://www.bitmart.com/en-US?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP on BitMart</a>, Panther's CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart's community. This post provides a summary of the conversation. Firstly, let's quickly revisit the BitMart:Panther partnership.</p> BitMart:Panther partnership <p>In December 2023, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitmart-lists-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">Panther Protocol's $ZKP was listed on BitMart</a>, a leading cryptocurrency exchange serving a global user base spanning 180 countries.</p><p>This partnership with BitMart and upcoming listings on other trusted exchanges are part of Panther commitment to make <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/tokenomics?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP more accessible</a> to the wider Web3 community.&nbsp;</p> Panther's value proposition <p>Oliver Gale, Co-founder and CEO of Panther, presented his vision of how Panther Protocol solves some of the pressing pain points that act as barriers to entry to both retail- and institutional-level investors in DeFi.</p><p>Oliver asserts that, for the decentralized Web to scale and attract more users, it must first overcome several significant challenges that crypto faces. He summarized these as four key issues:</p>  Exposed investment strategies: with the rise of blockchain analytics solutions such as Nansen, institutional investors are increasingly worried about exposed investment strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fragmented liquidity: the inability to leverage liquidity across multiple chains makes it difficult for institutions to buy and sell their preferred crypto without affecting the price.  Lack of transaction security: since June 2020, MEV bots have made at least $1 billion in profit across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana chains by exploiting transaction queues.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Compliance and privacy: existing privacy-focused DeFi products lack features to comply with AML/CTF requirements amid increased regulatory scrutiny.  <p>Oliver explained how Panther's privacy-preserving infrastructure for the decentralized Web, consisting of a shielded pool, cross-chain bridges, and ZK compliance tooling, solves these issues. This means that users can send, swap, and receive shielded assets through Panther while their on-chain privacy is being protected.</p> Panther Protocol: the product suite <p>Oliver gave BitMart's audience a run down on how Zones within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs) empower users by providing a unified privacy set for all assets within a given smart contract environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther allows users to trade stablecoins, utility tokens, and NFTs within a single shielded pool, simplifying trading in a privacy-preserving environment. The innovation of Zones represents the first coherent solution to enable institutional access to DeFi, as they enable AML compliance, customization, and enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver expanded on how Panther Protocol’s rich feature set positions Panther as the go-to solution to onboard users to private DeFi in a privacy-preserving manner. Panther’s strong position is, in part, due to its integration with third-party on-chain compliance providers. This enables the protocol to authenticate users — solving for the KYC demands of regulators by offering users a unique set of credentials on completion of verification. This key innovation is that the user data is private thanks to zero-knowledge proofs generated directly within the user's browser. The credential provided allows the user to seamlessly integrate with blockchain-based DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and similar platforms.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the flexibility of its design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider. Similarly, financial institutions can benefit from flexible zero-knowledge compliance tools or fully integrate their existing AML controls.</p> The current status of Panther <p>Oliver shared that Panther is currently deploying testnet versions of Panther Protocol in 9 Stages. Multiple protocol functionalities, such as intra-shielded pool transfers, DeFi swaps, and zTrade, are being tested during these stages. Through zTrade, users can conduct OTC transactions while enjoying unprecedented data privacy-preservation. More on Panther testnet stages <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> BitMark asks: What are you looking forward to? <p>Oliver, as always, enthused about the growing interest in privacy-preserving infrastructures. He feels that, thanks to the recent paper by prominent authors such as Vitalik examining <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Dark Pools</a>, this is a clear signal that the market is ready for such solutions. As he points out, Panther is a pioneer in the space — having been building for over 2 years, and is looking forward to releasing the V1 of the protocol once testnet rollouts are complete.</p> Want to get involved? <p>If you are interested in joining our community of testers, there is still time. Panther is rewarding engaged community members with $ZKP in return for battle-testing the testnet version of the product. Learn how to <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">get started</a> as a community tester.</p> About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>This is the 28th post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in the Brave browser. This post describes work done by Sr. Research and Privacy Engineer Arthur Edelstein, and was written by Edelstein and by Privacy Engineering Lead Shivan Kaul Sahib.</p>
<p>With desktop and Android version 1.64 in a couple of months (and in today’s <a>Nightly</a> release for testing), Brave will sunset Strict fingerprinting protection mode. This does not affect Brave’s industry-leading fingerprinting protection capabilities for users. Instead, it will allow us to focus on improving privacy protections in Standard mode and avoid Web compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Brave currently offers two levels of fingerprinting protections. which make it harder for tracking companies to identify you as you browse the Web: Standard and Strict mode. Over time, however, we have observed significant disadvantages of Strict mode:</p>
 
 
<p>In order to block fingerprintable APIs, Strict mode frequently causes certain websites to function incorrectly or not at all. This website breakage means that Strict mode has limited utility for most Web users.</p>
 
 
<p>Fewer than 0.5% of Brave users are using Strict fingerprinting protection mode, based on our <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/P3A">privacy-preserving telemetry</a> data.</p>
 
 
<p>This tiny cohort of users could be more vulnerable to being fingerprinted because they stand out as a result of using Strict mode. Although we have not seen issues around this, it is a valid concern given that users who select Strict fingerprinting protection might have done so because of an elevated concern about tracking.</p>
 
 
<p>Maintaining Strict mode and debugging why some websites are broken on Brave takes our engineers’ time away from focusing on default privacy protections that can benefit all of our users.</p>
 
 
<p>These observations have led us to the conclusion that sunsetting Strict mode in Brave will actually be beneficial to our users’ privacy.</p>
<p>Brave’s Standard fingerprinting protection is already very extensive and the strongest of any major browser. Brave’s innovative <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Fingerprinting-Protections">farbling</a> of a number of major fingerprintable Web APIs makes it difficult for fingerprinters to get a reliable unique ID on your browser. Going forward, we will continue to strengthen and expand Brave’s Standard fingerprinting protections so that all our users have ever-improving protection against fingerprinters, while maintaining the highest possible level of compatibility with websites.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/wallets/spherebyhorizen/">Sphere by Horizen</a> is a desktop wallet created by the Horizen ecosystem team. It features both lite and full clients, offering wallet functionality that currently supports transparent and soon-to-be deprecated, shielded transactions. Sphere allows funds to be restored using a seed phrase and supports backward and forward transfers between Horizen’s mainchain and sidechains.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Sphere was able to send two different types of transactions: transparent transactions and shielded transactions:</p>
 
 Transparent Transactions: These are similar to Bitcoin transactions. The details of the transaction, including the sender’s and receiver’s addresses and the transaction amount, are visible on the blockchain. This transparency allows anyone to view and verify transactions, contributing to the network’s auditability. 
 Shielded Transactions: In contrast, shielded transactions offer enhanced privacy. They use advanced cryptographic techniques (like zk-SNARKs) to encrypt transaction information. This means the details of the transaction, including who sent or received the funds and the amount, are hidden from public view.&nbsp; 
 
 The Need for De-shielding 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">Horizen has announced that ZEN will be discontinuing support for shielded transactions with the release of Zen v5.0.0.</a> Consequently, Sphere, Horizen’s multifunctional app, will also cease supporting these types of transactions. To ensure the accessibility of their funds, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Who needs to De-shield their ZEN? 
<p>The upcoming changes to ZEN and Sphere necessitate action from all users who possess shielded addresses. If you have any ZEN in a shielded address, it’s crucial to de-shield these funds to avoid any loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine if you need to take any action:</p>
 
 If You’re Using Lite Mode: If you’ve only used the lite mode in Sphere and never switched to full mode, you don’t need to do anything, as shielded addresses are only available in full mode. Your funds are secure and no action is required on your part. 
 If You’re Using Full Mode: In full mode, look through your wallets. If you don’t see any addresses with a small shield icon next to them, you’re all set. No action is needed. 
 
<p>For any address with a shield icon, you should move (de-shield) these funds to a transparent address (one without a shield icon). This is important to ensure your funds remain accessible and secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another check is to look at the prefix of the address. Addresses start differently depending on the network and the type, so this also helps you identify your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>On mainnet:</p>
 
 “zn” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zs” (or rarely “zr” or “zt”) for multisig address 
 
<p>On testnet:</p>
 
 “zt” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zr” for multisig address 
 
 Step-by-step Guide to De-shielding Your ZEN 
 Prerequisites 
<p>As a reminder, de-shielding to an exchange deposit address is strongly discouraged. Before you begin de-shielding your shielded addresses in Sphere, it’s important to have at least one transparent address where you can transfer your funds. If you don’t already have a transparent address (any address without a shield icon next to its name, or that is not prefixed with “zc”), you’ll need to create one. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar select one of your wallets. 
 Click on the “Add Address” button. 
 Give a name to the new address, and make sure that, if there’s any “Private” checkbox, it remains unchecked. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once you have a transparent address, you can proceed with the de-shielding process for your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>You can get your new address by hovering over the information icon and clicking on the “copy” button that appears:</p>
<p></p>
 De-shielding Process 
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to de-shielding your funds in Sphere by Horizen:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar take a look at your wallets.&nbsp; 
 Select the wallet containing a shielded address. If you have multiple wallets with shielded addresses, you’ll need to repeat this process for each one. 
 Within each wallet, follow these steps for every shielded address:
 
 Select the shielded address you want to transfer the funds out of. 
 Click on the “Send” tab. 
 Enter a regular, transparent address that you own, where you wish to receive the funds. 
 Click on the “MAX” button to transfer all the funds from the shielded address. 
 Click the “Confirm” button and wait for the transaction to complete. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once the transaction is successful, you have de-shielded your funds. Repeat this process for every shielded address in your wallets.</p>

Additionally, we are announcing a formal request for comments period covering Aztec’s Sequencer Selection and Prover Coordination Protocols, key components of Aztec’s block production.</p><p>At the heart of Sidecar’s design is the decision to facilitate proving outside of the scope of the protocol, enabling integrations with various solutions, such as decentralized zero-knowledge proving marketplaces.

<p>Today we are excited to announce a new feature that allows  <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creators</a> to receive on-chain contributions for their content from their fans. Creators can now add Ethereum and Solana addresses to their registered websites and channels, allowing their fans to send them contributions directly on chain. On-chain contributions currently support BAT on Ethereum, BAT (Wormhole) on Solana, as well as ETH and SOL.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards users will now see the option to use their Web3 wallet when sending contributions to creators who’ve set up crypto addresses for their sites or channels.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
The Web3 wallet button in the Brave Rewards contribution interface</p>
<p>The Web3 wallet button will open up a creator’s Web3 contribution page, where users can make contributions via any Web3 wallet—including <a>Brave Wallet</a>, other Web3 wallets, and even mobile wallets. Creators can also share a link to their Web3 contribution page with anyone, allowing them to receive contributions not only from Brave Rewards users, but from anyone on the Web.</p>
<p>

		  5.0.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of 5.0.0 to Mainnet later in January 2024.  Pre-release 5.0.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1404200, on January 16th, 2024 at approximately 02:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release on Testnet:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates.  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled, so that it will be no longer possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.      Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 5.0.0 will be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pools before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br>  <p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0-rc1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0-rc1.md">Here!</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

		<p>2023 was an incredible year of growth for the Horizen ecosystem! Lots of milestones were reached including:</p>  The mainnet launch of Horizen’s first EVM-compatible sidechain, EON&nbsp;  The launch of the Horizen DAO and pivot from Zen Blockchain Foundation (ZBF)&nbsp;  Passing two major ZenIPs (42204 &amp; 42206)  Onboarding new partners and projects into the Horizen ecosystem  <p>It’s an exciting time for the Horizen ecosystem and the team has hit the ground running in 2024! We will be sharing details on our 2024 proposed roadmap but before we get there, let’s dive into what happened in 2023!</p> 2023 Highlights <p></p> Community Growth <p>Discord</p><p>In 2023, we reached over 20,000 members of our Horizen Discord, a growth of over 5,000 users throughout the year. With the launch of Horizen EON and various growth campaigns on platforms like Galxe and Layer3, we have had new community members learning about the Horizen ecosystem and exploring the new integrations. We look forward to seeing more of this growth in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Discourse</p><p>In 2023 we established the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse forum</a>, to facilitate active community discussions around the Horizen Ecosystem. In 2023, activity on this platform increased as the broader community discussed ZenIPs, shared tutorials, explored content created by the Horizen Ambassadors, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage the Horizen community to join Discourse and engage with the rest of the community on the platform!</p> 2023 Highlights – Our Technology <p>In October of 2023, Horizen EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain went live on mainnet, marking a new milestone in the Horizen multi-chain ecosystem!&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Horizen EON ecosystem has continued to grow, with additional partnerships, integrations, and tools launching on the platform. There has also been a significant influx of TVL and developer activity on Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p><p>The full range of dapps and partner integrations can be found on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">EON Ecosystem</a> page – let’s dive into a few of the major announcements. </p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-interport-finance/">Interport Finance Integration</a></p><p>At the beginning of December 2023, we announced an integration with Interport Finance, which brought cross-chain trading capabilities to Horizen EON! This integration not only boosts the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions but also signifies a step towards a broader vision of a cohesive digital finance ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate fluidly across diverse blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/archon-bridge-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">Archon Bridge</a></p><p>Archon Bridge launched on Horizen EON in Q4 of 2023, bringing a new bridging protocol to the ecosystem. This protocol facilitates the transfer of various cryptocurrencies including ETH, WBTC, WZEN, USDT, USDC, DAI, and LINK, between the Horizen EON network and the Ethereum and Avalanche networks.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-layerzero-to-boost-trustless-cross-chain-communications/">LayerZero</a></p><p>Another innovation to enhance cross-chain communications on Horizen EON saw an integration with LayerZero go live, ensuring seamless and direct communication between various blockchains via arbitrary message bridging. This integration offers enhanced interoperability, allowing data, assets, and information to be transferred across blockchains without compromising on efficiency or security. Beyond just messaging, this integration signifies a broader vision of creating a unified digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/spookyswap-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">SpookySwap</a></p><p>Another exciting announcement for Horizen EON came in November 2023, when we announced an integration with SpookySwap! This helped bolster DeFi innovation, bringing a DEX multichain integration and yield farming to EON. USDC is tradable against ZEN and wZEN, with additional pairs being enabled once sufficient liquidity develops.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-ascent-exchange-with-simple-liquidity-opportunities-via-ichi-vault-to-boost-the-defi-ecosystem-on-eon/">Ascent Exchange</a></p><p>The DeFi ecosystem on Horizen EON was boosted with the integration of Ascent Exchange, supported by the automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, enabling simple yield opportunities for EON users. This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Ascent Exchange is the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, marking a major milestone!</p><p><a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/service_providers/eon_native_stablecoin/">Stably/ZUSD</a></p><p>2023 marked the 1st native stablecoin to be launched on Horizen EON, ZUSD, which was made possible by our partnership with Stably! The collateral for ZUSD is held in liquid USD-denominated assets by a designated trustee for the benefit of verified ZUSD token holders. This ensures that each ZUSD token can be minted or redeemed at a 1-to-1 rate with USD or USDC by users who passed Stably’s KYC verification process.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/yuzu-finance-horizen-eon-unlocking-yield-opportunities-in-the-horizen-ecosystem/">Yuzu</a></p><p>Our last major partnership announcement of 2023 welcomed Yuzu Finance onto Horizen EON! This integration unlocked yield opportunities for the Horizen Ecosystem, including borrowing, lending, and yield farming (soon)! Yuzu is a non-custodial decentralized liquidity market protocol that enables users to deposit or borrow crypto assets securely. Depositors provide liquidity on Yuzu, while borrowers can take out overcollateralized or undercollateralized loans.</p> Horizen EON TVL &amp; Metrics <p>As of December 31st, 2023, Horizen EON had $3.08M in TVL (as tracked by <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Horizen%20EON">DefiLlama</a>), highlighting impressive ecosystem growth within the first few months of mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the mainnet launch of Horizen EON in October 2023, there have been over 900,000 total transactions across over 18,000 wallet addresses. There have also been 950+ contracts in total since Horizen EON went live on mainnet.</p> Launch of the Horizen DAO <p>In 2023 the Horizen ecosystem reached a key milestone in decentralized governance by launching the Horizen DAO! The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system. $ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. All $ZEN holders can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">blog post</a>, as well as joining the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse!</a></p> ZenIPs (<a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">42204</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">42206</a>) <p>Building off of the launch of the Horizen DAO, 2023 saw two very important ZEN Improvement Proposals (ZenIPs) pass with overwhelming community support.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">ZenIP 42204</a> – Deprecation of Shielded Pools  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> – Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON&nbsp;  <p>Let’s take a closer look at both.&nbsp;</p><p>ZenIP 42204</p><p>This ZEN Improvement Proposal proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, preventing shielded transaction (t addresses to z addresses) support at the consensus level. The goal of ZenIP 42204 was to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risk. Regulatory threats are top of mind, they are not friendly towards privacy coins and that drove a lot of the ambition to propose ZenIP 42204, which passed with overwhelming community support. Additional information can be found <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">here.</a></p><p>ZenIP 42206</p><p>In August of 2023, ZenIP 42206 was proposed, to redirect the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. This will help drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network. There is a strong need for forger nodes in EON to help enhance the security of the network, and for decentralization, which the current secure node reward can be put to better use by redirecting. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Horizen Node Network <p></p> Horizen Ambassador Program <p>Throughout 2023, we were very proud to see all of the work accomplished by our amazing Horizen Ambassadors.

We launched EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain, which significantly helped Horizen’s journey into the contemporary Web3 world. That’s especially important because it allows Horizen Labs to leverage its relationships and bring more companies, developers, and brands directly into the Horizen ecosystem. We’ve been hard at work bringing best-in-class partners to EON, from oracles like Pyth and Band to DeFi protocols like Spooky, Yuzu, and Ascent to RPC providers such as Ankr and Tatum. We’ve built a strong relationship with LayerZero as well, which will lead to many exciting things happening within the ecosystem.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mainchain saw the introduction of forward and backward transfers, a technological feat that sometimes gets overlooked but is significant. How many UTXO-based tokens can be used on EVM chains? Beyond Bitcoin and ZEN, not many! We also saw the start of the deprecation of shielded pools and ZEN’s move away from being a privacy token.</p><p>Now, as we enter 2024 we’re gearing up for what should be the most exciting year in Horizen’s history. In the coming weeks and months, we’ll announce a slew of new partners, initiatives, and focus areas relating to the Horizen Ecosystem through a significant expansion and push on DeFi to RWA programs. We’re also working hard on expanding access to ZEN and directly to the EON ecosystem, along with making sure that EON can host a sustainable, consistently growing ecosystem as it moves forward.</p><p>And the vision of a New Horizen is on the docket too. I can’t wait to talk to you all about it and the modular future that Horizen and Horizen Labs will push forward together.”</p> Additional Links:&nbsp;   <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q1-2023-report/">Q1 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q2-2023-report/">Q2 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q3-2023-report/">Q3 2023 Report</a>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support and feedback: we could not do this without you. Testnet Stage 2 is now completed and it provided us with valuable insights resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 3 of our testnet is live. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>On depositing $ZKP, users may divide their ZKP deposit holdings to store it as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay for Protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services.</p><p>One of the key compliance requirements on the Panther roadmap is building different disclosure mechanisms. Stage 3 includes basic disclosures, which can be found under the History tab. We expect to improve the information within the History tab in future testnet stages.</p><p>This testnet stage comes with an enhanced circuit to improve KYT/KYC signer fields, overall protocol security through extended zAccount UTXO, and further improvements related to scaling and rewards. Supporting these updates required retrofitting previous stages and end-to-end testing, resulting in Stage 3 being released later than we initially planned. </p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.<br></p> Get started with Stage 3 testing <p><br>To start testing Stage 3, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated test link and follow the steps outlined below. Here are a few additional details to consider before you start testing:&nbsp;</p>  Previously created testnet accounts will need to be reactivated for Stage 3. The protocol will treat these as new accounts. To that effect, all prior testing Rewards (ZKP and ZKP equivalent of your PRPs) will be sent to your EOA (externally owned account) used for creating the account.  You can also create a brand new account and complete the KYC process to continue. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#gid=0">Here’s</a> a guide to creating your account.   After activating your zAccount, if you immediately go to the ‘Deposit’ or ‘Voucher’ etc. screen, you may see the action button with the status “Oshiya Processing/Syncing/Mining.” It may take a few minutes for the testnet to complete as it waits for Oshiya to process your account activation. The buttons will be active once that is done.  During the first interaction with the dApp, it downloads the ZK proof information in the background (close to 100MB). While this happens, you may see a status on your action button saying “ZK Proof downloading,” this needs to be completed before any user action can take place.   Onboarding rewards have been increased to 5000 PRPs to reflect that this stage retests the onboarding flow.  <p>Once you’ve created your new testnet account, follow these steps to make a deposit to your account:</p> Step 1: Initiate a deposit <p>Go to the Deposit screen by selecting any of the available options: </p>  Within the zAsset menu item, click on the Deposit button as shown in the screenshot below.  Within the My Public Asset section in the Dashboard, select the token; this takes the user to the Deposit screen.  The Private zAsset section; which also has the option to select and deposit  On zAsset Portfolio, click on the balance card.   Step 2: Select the token type <p>Select the token to deposit if it is not preselected, or adjust your selection via the token selection modal window.</p><p>NOTE: ZKP has its own dedicated deposit flow, which supports splitting a deposit amount between two zZKP subaccounts, zAsset and Gas. The Gas can be used to pay for relayer or verification services in a privacy-preserving way; with no direct interaction with a blockchain.</p> Step 3: Set up the deposit <p>3.1 Enter the amount to deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>3.2 Click the Deposit button and complete the transaction.</p><p>Congratulations, the deposit is complete!</p><p>You may now view the updated balance in your Dashboard, your Private zAssets section, and the adjusted balance of the deposited asset.</p><p>You can view your transaction history under the History tab.&nbsp;</p><p>This screen provides information about different types of transactions you performed within Panther, along with its transaction hash and the date/time of the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks a significant advancement in the protocol's capabilities and gets us a step closer to our V1 release. As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in Testnet Stage 3!&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs.

      Arvind Jain Pushes into AI-powered Productivity         
	By Zee Zakheim	 



Photography: Kelsey McClellan



Published January 10, 2024
        Glean solved enterprise search. Now it’s unlocking generative AI for the workplace.      



 
<p>Arvind Jain hunched over his desk, sifting through hundreds of employee surveys, searching for the answer to a problem. Rubrik, the cloud security company he had co-founded four years earlier in 2014, was one of the fastest-growing businesses in cloud data management. Since its launch, it had scaled from a handful of employees to almost a thousand. But a problem came to light in 2018: Productivity had stagnated. The company’s output wasn’t growing with its scale.</p>



<p>Jain pored over the results of the survey that had been commissioned, scouring for patterns. Was it talent? Not a chance. Company culture? Not according to the surveys. And then, a troubling insight: Employees reported spending hours of their time trying to find and piece together fragmented bits of information from across the 300 SaaS products Rubrik used in its internal operations—onboarding materials, meeting notes, support tickets, project archives and more. In their quest to find answers, they were stalled and sidetracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rubrik’s problem, Jain realized, wasn’t Rubrik-specific, but universal: the seemingly impossible task of wrangling digital information from every facet of an enterprise. What if there was something like Google Search, but for the workplace? Jain began researching search engines for enterprises, but none could do what he imagined. “I spoke with other CEOs to see if they had solutions I’d missed,” Jain says. “Their response was, ‘If you find something like that, let us know.’”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I spoke with other CEOs to see if they had solutions I’d missed. Their response was, ‘If you find something like that, let us know.’”</p>

<p>Search engines are notoriously difficult to build—they require crawlers sophisticated enough to index data in a multitude of formats in real time and algorithms smart enough to sort and rank that data with precision for any given search. What Jain was considering developing would be even more complicated, as every search would need to be personalized for every employee based on their degree of access to a company’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, this provocation became the springboard for Jain’s next startup: an AI-powered search engine for enterprises called <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a>. As it happened, Jain was the perfect person for the job.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In 2003, hundreds of employees unpacked boxes and settled into office space in Mountain View, California. Google had officially signed its new lease in the heart of Silicon Valley, taking over the former Silicon Graphics campus. While the new digs were reflective of Google’s success, the company was also at a crossroads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch in 1998, Google had gained a loyal following of users. But as the internet evolved—growing rapidly in size and shifting from rudimentary websites to include pages that were more complicated and nonstandard—Google Search wasn’t able to keep up with the velocity of new data. Meanwhile, alternative search providers were closing in, the most competitive of which was Yahoo. “Google and Yahoo were locked in a battle for the most sophisticated, comprehensive web indices,” says Bill Coughran, a Sequoia partner who was then SVP of engineering at Google.</p>



<p>Coughran gathered the web crawler team and told them they needed a new system design. It would have to be able to respond to diverse and rapidly changing data, and do it at scale. The timeline for the new system? As soon as possible.</p>



<p>Arvind Jain, a recent hire then in his late 20s, was one of the leaders of what became the new effort. Over the next few weeks, Jain and his colleagues spent days analyzing Google’s search engine. Eventually, they approached Coughran with an idea for the new design.<br>“What was interesting about their vision is that it took advantage of the basic primitives Google’s web crawler already had in place and built on top of those,” Coughran says. “The design showed a system that could index not just websites, but dozens of file types from HTML to PDF, including PowerPoint, Flash, PostScript and JavaScript. And, as the web continued to scale, it could operate more and more instances of itself and do more and more work.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”</p>
Bill Coughran</blockquote>



<p>Some senior executives, however, viewed the proposed framework with skepticism. “They looked at the design and just didn’t believe it would work,” Coughran says. But he was convinced. “My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain and his colleagues spent a year building out the system, which launched in the fall of 2004. In November of that year, Coughran published a blog post on the Google website with the headline “Google’s Index Nearly Doubles.” He says, “It could inhale hundreds of gigabytes of traffic at a given time and it could do it quickly, so when you searched something, you weren’t getting stale information. It was a difficult undertaking, but it worked. They pulled it off.”</p>
 





 
<p>The thoughtful meticulousness Coughran observed in Jain grew out of an introspective childhood in Jaipur, a tourist destination in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. “My father always encouraged me to be confident,” Jain says. “To look people in the eye and talk to them, but extroversion wasn’t something that came naturally to me.” Instead, Jain took after his mother, who exuded a quiet confidence and had an ability to defuse conflict with calm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain became fascinated with computers after his older brother introduced a PC—loaded with Pac-Man—to the family home. Jain delighted in the game, but even more so in the idea that coding had real-world applications, for video games or otherwise. Jain decided to pursue computer science in earnest, placing into an advanced high school track and then gaining admission to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. After graduating, Jain set his sights on the U.S. Following a stint at Microsoft, the allure of Silicon Valley beckoned, and Jain cut his teeth in the startup world at Akamai and Riverbed before joining Google.</p>



 



<p>“I’m not an entrepreneur,” Jain said. It was 2013 and he sat across from Bipul Sinha, an engineer who had an idea for a cloud security company and wanted Jain as its technical co-founder. Jain was taken aback. “I was like, ‘Of all your contacts, why me?’” he says. Sinha explained that, more than anyone else, he believed in Jain to build a product from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the years since arriving at Google and working on Google Search, Jain had left his mark on a series of other projects. He had helped engineer YouTube’s video serving system—which pulled up videos related to a user’s search, but also recommended content based on their browsing history. Jain had also worked on the search functions for Google Maps, which were more technically ambitious by far than Google Search and YouTube. “Maps’ data is the most chaotic,” Coughran says. “You’re dealing with ever-changing, wildly inconsistent data, coming from many disparate sources—public records, land developers, people taking photos, enterprises submitting information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, Maps was rewarding, not just because it challenged him as an engineer, but because of the app’s real-life, societal impact. “Maps changed the way people understood and navigated the world around them,” Jain says. He loved seeing couples on the street pull up Maps to direct them to a restaurant, or a family open the app to walk to a relative’s house. The Maps team was also deep in the weeds documenting places that weren’t previously mapped, including small towns in rural areas of India. “Making these places accessible and seeing the impact of that was just amazing,” Jain says. “It was very meaningful to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain’s contentment with his work at Google was one reason he wasn’t sure about founding a company with Sinha. The other reason was philosophical. “I always thought that people became entrepreneurs when they encountered a problem that nagged at them and that nobody else wanted to solve or knew how to solve, but them,” Jain says.</p>



<p>Despite these reservations, Sinha was convincing—he would build the business while Jain built the product. He won Jain over, and in 2014, they launched Rubrik. Four years later, Jain would encounter a problem that nagged him. One that nobody else wanted or knew how to solve, but him.</p>

<p>Sitting at his desk in the Rubrik headquarters in 2018, reviewing his employees’ notes on the challenges of finding information within the company, Jain thought to himself, “Data should not be the reason why you fail. It should be the reason you succeed.”</p>



<p>Jain convinced co-founders T.R. Vishwanath, Piyush Prahladka and Tony Gentilcore to tackle the project with him. They built Glean, which officially launched in 2019, to solve what Jain believes to be the most urgent problem in today’s workplace: that it’s often easier to find answers in the vast expanse of the internet than it is within a single organization. “Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally,” Jain says. “Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally. Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”&nbsp;</p>
arvind jain</blockquote>



<p>Even with Google Search, YouTube and Maps’ search engines under his belt, Jain knew building Glean wouldn’t be easy. The difficulty of creating a search engine for an enterprise is that, unlike the information in a general-purpose internet search engine, “company data doesn’t live in readily organized forms,” Jain says. “Information can be fleetingly exchanged over one communication suite, like Slack or Google Chat, but not formalized in another. And it’s not just that data is spread across a range of SaaS tools—each individual has their own level of access to those systems. The CEO has access to different data than someone in research and development who has access to different data than someone in human resources.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain assembled a team of engineers to help him bring Glean to life, many who had worked with him at Google, others who were familiar with his reputation as one of the best search engineers in Silicon Valley. The company described its initial product, launched in 2021, as a “work assistant with intuition,” modeled on a Google-like search engine. It worked by transforming the entirety of a company’s data, in all its various forms, into nodes on a knowledge graph. And it was able to do this in under two hours, meaning it was Google-fast and required minimal onboarding time. Glean then used state-of-the-art natural language processing and deep learning to deliver individualized search results. “AI was always core to our product,” Jain says. “But in the last year, the shift in the capabilities of AI models—it’s changed everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spring of 2023, Glean announced it was incorporating generative AI into its product. “If Glean’s user interface started out with a feel similar to Google Search, now it’s more like Google plus ChatGPT,” Jain says. “Glean is no longer just surfacing information, it’s taking that information, consuming it and then performing a task. For example, if an employee were to ask Glean to provide a list of the company’s top 10 customers who are likely to churn, our engine can actually go and hunt through information in your enterprise corpus, figure out what makes it likely for a customer to churn, go to your metrics dashboard, look at whether those metrics are looking bad for certain businesses and actually give that answer back to you.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”</p>
Sonya Huang</blockquote>



<p>The integration of enterprise search capabilities with generative AI has become Glean’s superpower. “CIOs and knowledge workers have been waiting for an enterprise AI product that is workplace-knowledge-aware,” says Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia who serves on Glean’s board. “Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, the challenge of Glean wasn’t only in developing its product, but in growing into the role of CEO and leading an entire company. Jain rose to the occasion by drawing on the traits of his parents: his father’s confidence and practice of reaching out to others, and his mother’s approach to conflict, which prioritizes listening and never saying “I told you so.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Glean serves over 200 enterprises, some with hundreds of employees, others with hundreds of thousands, saving them hundreds of hours of work per month and millions of dollars per year. “Similar to how Google Maps changed our navigation of the world, soon, Glean will alter the way we work, period,” Jain says. He envisions that one day, every employee who uses Glean will have a “work double,” essentially a digital assistant who can perform tasks and track every project, every communication and every piece of company knowledge. It’s a world in which employees aren’t impeded by the challenges of locating information, but empowered by data to tackle their next challenge—maybe even the thing that won’t stop nagging them.</p>

<p>Today, Brave Search added its newly built CodeLLM to its search engine. CodeLLM is aimed at queries that involve programming, and combines the depth and quality of search results with the summarization and explainability power of large language models (LLMs). CodeLLM offers programmers an option to get AI code snippets grounded in search results, with step-by-step explanations and citations of the sources for reference and validation. CodeLLM is free and is integrated in Brave Search so users do not have to switch apps or compromise on privacy.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Figure 1: Query “kill all processes listening to port 80”</p>
<p>CodeLLM&nbsp; is available to all Brave Search users, on desktop and mobile. To access it, head to privacy-preserving Brave Search and try it out with your favorite programming query:</p>
 
 If Brave Search is your default search engine, simply start a search in your browser’s address bar 
 If Brave Search isn’t your default, visit <a href="https://search.brave.com/">search.brave.com</a> and start your search that way 
 
<p>CodeLLM automatically detects programming-related queries, so there’s no need to generate a special search. On top of the search results, if an answer is possible there will be a widget to trigger the CodeLLM response. The detection of programming queries happens outside of the LLM, by other search components (similar to the ones able to detect queries about the weather, queries that lend themselves well to be summarized, queries about stock prices, etc).</p>

 How we built CodeLLM 
<p>The underlying technology is built on top of <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral</a>, a large language model that can use text prompts to generate code, and it is further equipped to answer questions by tapping into our unique capabilities as a search engine, in real-time. As the models get more accessible, and more affordable to run, the value-add is the context we’re able to provide to them. This highlights how vertical search engines can be easily replicated, and also emphasizes how important it is to be independent and to own the whole stack, like Brave Search.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Figure 2: query “install fzf mac”</p>
<p>We are excited to release CodeLLM in Brave Search, and are already considering a number of improvements and additions to its capabilities. CodeLLM results will also be offered via the Brave Search API in the near future.  See something you like? Wish it could do more? Tell us! Simply click the Feedback button at the bottom of the CodeLLM window to share feedback.</p>

 About Brave Search 
<p>Brave Search is the only independent, global-scale search engine outside Big Tech. It’s the default search engine for many of the Brave browser’s over 60 million users, and is available on any browser at search.brave.com. Since its launch two years ago, Brave Search has grown to serve an average of 25 million queries per day.</p>
<p>Rather than adding layers on top of third party APIs and services, Brave Search is truly innovating in the search space. From <a href="https://search.brave.com/help/goggles">Goggles</a> (which allows community-driven alternative rankings) to <a>AI summarizer</a> (which offers AI-powered answers at the top of SERP, similar to the <a>Leo</a> experience in the browser), and more, Brave offers novel ways to search the Web and engage with its content. All this while maintaining Brave’s user-first promise: Brave Search does not track users, their queries, or their clicks.</p>
<p>The power of Brave Search is also now available to businesses. <a>Brave Search Ads</a> allow advertisers to reach Brave’s global audience in a way that still respects their privacy.</p>
<p>Its index, meanwhile, is powered not just by simple crawlers, but also by the <a>Web Discovery Project (WDP)</a>. This mechanism allows users to anonymously contribute data about searches and page visits, thus ensuring the index is constantly refreshed with the content real humans are searching for and engaging with. The index comprises more than 20 billion quality pages, with 700 million pages indexed each day, 15% of which are new. This index is now available to power other search and AI applications, train models, and more with the <a>Brave Search API</a>.</p>

<p>What began as an AI company trying to seek solutions in order to pay remote (unbanked) workers, Near AI became, in 2018, Near Protocol. Its sharded design was inspired by modern database architecture and large language model (LLM) training. Near Protocol aimed to solve the scalability trilemma, through a modular approach, combining data availability sharding with stateless validation. By abstracting away archaic blockchain standards, Near basically enabled decentralised full stack development and, in terms of UX, a distributed custodial solution via chain abstraction and account aggregation.</p><p>We were joined by Illia Poloshukhin, co-founder of Near Protocol, to discuss Near’s journey, from AI company to high-throughput L1 blockchain, and how LLM training influenced the modular design choice.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Illia’s background in AI &amp; ML  Scaling large language models (LLMs) and the role of attention  Stochastic Parrot vs. Understanding spectrum  From Near AI to Near Protocol and the role of LLMs  How Near abstracted the blockchain away and enabled decentralised full stack development  Defining ecosystem standards to improve UX  Chain abstraction, account aggregation and interoperability  Chain threshold signature  Near’s intent layer  Near’s modularity, Nightshade sharding &amp; stateless validation  EigenLayer integration  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon">Illia Polosukhin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol">Near Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

		<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">ZenIP 42207 </a>for the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain was submitted on January 4th, 2024, opened for Community voting on January 8th, with voting closing on January 11th, resulting in 99.97% vote share “for”. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ZenIP proposed the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP-42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Complete Disabling of Shielded Transactions: All functionalities related to the shielded transactions (z-addresses) will be completely deactivated, preventing any type of transaction related to the shielded pool. 
 Removal of Related RPC Calls: RPC calls specifically related to shielded transactions, such as z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress, will be deprecated. 
 Migration Path for Users: A migration path with the necessary tools and guides will be provided to users to move their assets out of the shielded pool before the hard fork. Community support and detailed documentation will be available to facilitate this transition. 
 Network Upgrade: The deactivation of the shielded pool will occur through a network upgrade at a specified block height (TBD). Extensive testing, community preparation, and communication will precede this upgrade. 
 Communication and Timeline:&nbsp;Representatives of the Horizen ecosystem will communicate regularly with the community about the timeline, necessary user actions, and available support resources throughout the transition process. 
 
<p>IMPORTANT: ZEN 5.0.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible to send any shielded transactions, including transactions to de-shield coins from shielded to transparent addresses.</p>
<p>ZenIP 42207 goes further than the hard fork originally announced with ZEN 4.2.0-rc1, ZEN 5.0.0 will completely remove the shielded pool. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. &nbsp;Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged. Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>
 Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, we encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> around ZenIP 42207 and voice your thoughts. We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">full ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42207 started on January 8th, 2024, 5pm UTC and ended on January 11th, 2024, 5pm UTC. The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was also taken. <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">You can view the results of the vote here on Snapshot.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP 42207</a> voting period ended on January 11th, 2024, at 5pm UTC, and passed with 99.97% of votes “for”, with .03% of votes “against.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to thank the community for their engagement on this new ZenIP. The voting participation marks a new step in the progress of the Horizen DAO and we are glad to see that our community is involved in the project’s decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successfully passed ZenIP 42207 enables the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by ZenIP 42204 and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step is to unshield your ZEN on private addresses. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>

      AI in 2024: From Big Bang to Primordial Soup         
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 





Published January 3, 2024
        2023 was a frenzied year in AI. 2024 will be a year of exploration and discovery.      



 
<p>Over the Christmas holiday, I had time to reflect on 2023 and the whirlwind year we had in AI. </p>



<p>The “Big Bang” of ChatGPT in late 2022 unleashed a fervor and, ultimately, a feeding frenzy in 2023. Not only was AI the #1 story in Silicon Valley, but it became a hot topic in every corporate boardroom, in the media and even in Washington, DC. AI drove public market stock performance too.</p>



<p>For a technology so nascent and still with low usage, as we covered in <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/">Generative AI’s Act Two</a>, the feeding frenzy of 2023 had a key weakness. It was an assumption that the hard problems in AI had been solved, and therefore it’s a foregone conclusion that AI will become ubiquitous and powerful.</p>



<p>This fallacy is understandable. It is human nature to avoid ambiguity because humans desire certainty. The idea that AI is the “end of history”—and that we’re within sight of that—appeals to this instinct. This is an easier idea to hold in our minds than the reality we are living in: We are in the primordial soup phase of AI. There is much potential in the air, and yet it is still amorphous. Vision is required to convert it into something real, tangible and, ultimately, impactful.</p>



<p>In Silicon Valley, the frenzy of 2023 was productive in attracting talent to AI. But it was also unproductive in the type of company formation it drove and the psychology it induced. Specifically, it led to implementation-oriented thinking vs. vision-oriented thinking. If you believe that the hard problems have already been solved, it changes the nature of the company that you build. Instead of building deep-benched teams that are eager to face down new, unsolved problems, you build shallower organizations.</p>



<p>As a result, you had themes in AI with five or six new companies being formed, each with one or two great technologists and a very similar objective. One of the biggest challenges for startups in 2023 was convincing talent to join their companies—everyone wanted to start an AI company of their own.</p>



<p>In 2024, we need to look farther out and build companies that are fundamentally architected for the murky reality of AI. When we realize that we are in the primordial soup phase, we begin to think not about how we can win the race, but about how we can invent new things. And we realize that we need to join forces to do that. By focusing on impact, we can assemble teams capable of taking on demanding challenges and surmounting them.</p>



<p>I want to draw an explicit contrast to SaaS. SaaS was an evolution from on-premise, license-based software to cloud. AI is a revolution, where we are building new intelligence for the first time. There is no precedent, so we don’t even know what problems are worth solving. Fundamental innovation is going to be exceptionally important.</p>



<p>The primordial soup phase will give rise to visionary founders. I believe we will see more visionary thinking emerge in 2024. In times of murkiness and uncertainty, vision is required to see through the fog and understand what needs to exist on the other side. Vision is also necessary to attract a team capable of getting there.</p>



<p>We are going to move away from “AI for X” toward customer-centric companies. The goal of solving deep societal problems by building hard technology will reshape the culture of these companies, how they are built and the type of talent they attract. We will see innovation in the company formation process itself—the AI research labs are one expression of that creativity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, we will build from the substrate of Transformers, GPUs, RAG, Diffusers, open source and everything else that has been floating around the ecosystem in 2023. From these primitives, we will discover new ideas and new insights about how to build advanced AI systems. We will look back at 2024 and say, this is the year that we began to convert AI’s potential into real solutions.</p>



<p>At a conference in September, I heard Jakub Uszkoreit, one of the inventors of the Transformer, say he thought we had prematurely jumped from the exploration phase of AI to exploitation. 2024 will be a reset year, where those focused on quick and easy exploitation of this technology lose steam, and founders who are driving deep exploration toward value creation will pull ahead.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of turning this primordial soup into impactful products and companies. And here’s to the daring founders who will build them.</p>



<p>If you are building a visionary company in this primordial soup, I’d love to hear from you. Please reach out at <a href="mailto:dcahn@sequoiacap.com">dcahn@sequoiacap.com</a></p>

<p>For Nym, 2024 will be the year that ordinary people all over the world start using Nym to have private access to the internet to enable freedom of communication. Our resolutions are&nbsp;to:</p>  Get NymVPN working on every operating system to onboard thousands of ordinary users, increasing the traffic through the network, and thus the anonymity of users and the revenues of the Nym community via transaction fees — in short, making the entire Nym project financially sustainable.  Integrate against every major zero-knowledge blockchain that wants to deliver real privacy to their users via our new Rust and Typescript SDKs.  <p>One of the open secrets of the blockchain industry is that there are almost no actual people using blockchain tech for anything except for stablecoin transfers or trading, with many projects living off inflation before collapsing. And so, most blockchains are ghost-towns that don’t have anything resembling real-world usage outside DeFi and NFTs. What makes Nym different?</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8B-nym-%D0%BD%D0%B0-2024-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4-5a812108dc75">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/resolusi-tahun-baru-2024-nym-d865645eb486">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/nb640cb84badd">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/prop%C3%B3sitos-de-a%C3%B1o-nuevo-de-nym-para-2024-8558fe4f6bd9">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nymin-2024-planlar%C4%B1-9bbeff41e0d5">Türkçe</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym%E7%9A%84-2024-%E5%B9%B4%E6%96%B0%E5%B9%B4%E6%84%BF%E6%9C%9B-201661f3ae5c">中文</a></p><p>Nym has one of the few use-cases that actually have a chance at getting massive real-world adoption outside of cryptocurrency: replacing VPNs — which are almost entirely based on false promises — with something that actually works to preserve the security and privacy of end-users. Rather than aim just for a larger share of the tens of thousands of blockchain developers or the millions of cryptocurrency users, we at Nym are serious about our mission to enable privacy for all humanity: we’re aiming at the billion people that use VPNs&nbsp;today.</p><p>As the world continues to descend into geopolitical chaos with wars in Europe and the Middle East — and likely an economic war between the US and China over the next few years — the only guaranteed outcome is that internet surveillance and censorship will increase for everyone. The restrictions that we see now in Iran and China will soon spread to America and Europe under the banner of fighting “misinformation” and “fake news.” As we stated in 2019 in our <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym_litepaper.pdf">litepaper</a>, surveillance is ultimately about mind control. Against this rising tide of repression, Nym is the only solution out there that can give a person protection against global passive adversaries such as nation-state intelligence agencies that can watch an entire internet connection. Unlike traditional VPNs, thanks to blockchain-based decentralization, in 2024 Nym will also focus on validators and gateways so that the network is resistant to being taken out by powerful malicious actors.</p><p>Nym needs an easy way for ordinary people to use it, and that’s why we created NymVPN. In 2023 we launched <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">NymVPN</a> for testing at <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-returns-to-chaos-communications-congress-a2a08194a487">Chaos Computer Congress</a>, the world’s largest hacker conference, the same conference where we launched the first version of the mixnet for testing in 2019! Under the leadership of Marc Debizet, the plan for NymVPN is to make it available on every operating system, including mobile operating systems. In 2024, the focus will be on enabling every one of our hundreds of mix nodes to also serve as a gateway for open internet access, allowing unparalleled access across different jurisdictions for Nym users. The ability to have zero-knowledge proofs to access for privacy-enhanced payment to be turned on for&nbsp;NymVPN.</p><p>The wheel will then start turning: as people start using Nym, with payments being activated and transformed to NYM tokens on the backend, the entire ecosystem will become financially sustainable by receiving real transaction fees, something that only a handful of blockchains have achieved so far. Of course, we don’t know how many people actually want even a truly private communication tool, much less how much they will pay. In 2024, we’ll find out. In order to make privacy a reality in 2024, we will need thousands of NymVPN&nbsp;users.</p><p>And NymVPN isn’t the only way we’ll get users. Thanks to the Nym Innovation Fund and our new Head of Partnerships Ade Molajo, Nym is ready to integrate against any application, and blockchain. Autonomous verifiable anonymous computing is revolutionary technology, and every blockchain that uses zero-knowledge proofs should integrate Nym as an anonymous channel, as otherwise there will be no privacy. We’ve started this year with Liquid, Aztec, Firo, Monero, and are now in discussions with many L2s. In 2024, another goal is privacy by default over every zero-knowledge blockchain.</p> Looking back on&nbsp;2023 <p>Looking back, 2023 was a year of getting Nym ready for usage. While the mixnet was working via a SOCKS5 proxy even back in 2021 before the token launch, it was not easy to integrate against by programmers and required ordinary people to cut and paste obscure looking “localhost” IP addresses in even more obscure windows in their programs like Telegram and Electrum Bitcoin wallets. Led by Mark Sinclair and the new integrations team, the major focus of 2023 was making it possible for developers to integrate against the Nym mixnet by releasing a Rust API and Typescript APIs, including the wonderful mixFetch that makes integrating against Nym as simple as cut-paste for web applications.</p><p>The year closed with <a href="https://nymtech.net/learn/shipyard">Nym Shipyard</a>, a six-week intensive privacy academy training the next generation of Nym operators, builders and community visionaries. The academy enabled the community to get much more organized, forming “squads” that operate mix nodes across the world (especially in LatAm, Russia, Ukraine). Some squads use their rewards to support local hackerspaces and community organizations, others use the rewards to start building apps on the mixnet. This budding, professional operator community is essential for Nym as the industry’s network privacy DePIN. They form the decentralized underpinning for not just NymVPN but any application.</p><p>In 2024, Nym will continue with our general principles:</p>  Nym will put the user first. This includes the user experience of the NymVPN as well as all our users of Nym operator binaries, the Nym SDK and people using the NYM token to bond and delegate.  Nym will be community driven. The Nym global community — across 80 countries! — are increasingly our experts on the mixnet and token economics as it operates in the real world. We resolve to have close collaboration and quarterly town halls to enable rapid iteration and improvements on software and token economics as the NymVPN goes to&nbsp;market.  Nym will continue to leverage the latest technological breakthroughs to enable ordinary people’s privacy. Starting with rolling out zk-nyms for the NymVPN to prevent leakage of data when paying for services. The focus will then shift to enabling censorship resistance and post-quantum cryptography with leading academic experts in the&nbsp;field.  <p>As a team, we’ve transformed from a small startup to over fifty people working full-time on Nym, hundreds of mix nodes, and a global community of thousands across different languages and cultures. As the old world of nation-states and the traditional monetary system teeters on collapse, our mission of enabling privacy is critical for the survival of humanity more than ever. Without privacy, there can be no communication. Without communication, humanity cannot empower our collective intelligence to create a new world. It’s our only way out to escape the soul-crushing despair of war, surveillance, bureaucracy, and&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>Being able to communicate freely is the first step, but it’s simply too hard for people. For too long, truly private communication has been the province of only an aristocracy of technically-adept hackers, and it’s our turn to bring — as we promised at the Web 3.0 conference in 2020 — power to the people. In 2024, Nym is taking privacy out of the underground, opening a tunnel from this world to the next.

   In December, we opened a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment […]

<p>In December, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment on the question of whether the Dev Fund should be replaced after it expires in late 2024.</p>



<p>The poll closed this morning and the results are in. </p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The results of the ZCG election are as follows: </p>



 
 Jason McGee – 111 votes 



 Michael Harms – 96 votes 



 Amber O’Hearn – 89 votes 



 Roosevelt Gordones – 69 votes 



 Kworks – 45 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>Congratulations to Jason, Michael and Amber, who are duly reappointed to the ZCG Committee. Thank you also to Roosevelt and Kworks for volunteering to serve the Zcash community. </p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>The poll respondents voted in favour of amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, with 99 votes in favour versus 39 against. </p>



<p>We will therefore draft an appropriate amendment to ZIP 1014. </p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we put the following question to ZCAP: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>111 respondents voted Yes, and 27 respondents voted No. </p>



<p>We look forward to seeing further discussion and proposals from the community in the coming weeks about what form a new funding mechanism might take. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Through techniques like ZK rollups, multiple transactions are bundled into a single proof, streamlining the verification process. This compact form of verification reduces computational requirements and enhances the network’s overall scalability. By processing larger volumes of transactions more efficiently, zero-knowledge proofs boost blockchain network throughput without compromising security or decentralisation. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic tools that work like magic tricks, allowing one party to prove they know something without revealing the actual details. They maintain confidentiality while confirming specific information and have a key role in web3. This article will explain what they are, how they work, their use cases in web3, and take a deep dive into how zero-knowledge proofs improve blockchain scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 What are zero-knowledge proofs? 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs, often referred to as ZKPs, are a clever way to prove something without revealing any details about it. Imagine being able to show you know a secret password without actually saying what the password is. That’s the magic of ZKPs – they allow one party to confirm they have certain information without giving away the information itself.</p>



<p>In every zero-knowledge proof, there’s a prover and a verifier. The prover wants to show the verifier that they know something without disclosing what it is. They do this by demonstrating knowledge of some facts that only the rightful owner of the information would know. It’s like solving a puzzle without showing the solution.</p>



<p>They can be used for a variety of purposes. Still, their main applications include improving data security, scalability, and privacy in blockchain transactions, safeguarding sensitive information in industries like healthcare and finance, and enabling secure authentication without unnecessary exposure of personal details.</p>



<p></p>



 How zero-knowledge proofs work (in simple terms) 



<p>While relatively simple at the surface, understanding the intricacies of zero-knowledge proofs can be complex. To explain how they work we will use a simple analogy:</p>



<p>A scientist claims to have discovered a complex mathematical proof for a groundbreaking theory. Verifying this proof conventionally requires extensive computational resources and time. Alternatively, using a zero-knowledge proof, the scientist can demonstrate the proof’s validity without divulging the entire process, significantly reducing the time needed for verification while ensuring the credibility of the discovery.</p>



<p>In essence, the zero-knowledge proof is a distilled version of the proof containing only the details necessary to prove its validity. When using zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain for improved scalability and privacy it works in similar ways. To explain how this works, consider the following scenario:<br><br>A validator has verified and put together a block of transactions that produces a certain hash value. To verify this hash (and thus the transactions inside the block), someone could verify this hash by following the exact same energy- and time-consuming process of recreating this block. However, another option would be for the validator to provide a succinct zero-knowledge proof to make it easy to verify the validity of this block without revealing the details. This proof is called a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument, widely known as a ZK-SNARK.</p>



<p>Similar to the mathematical proof example, the validity of a statement can be verified quickly without revealing the underlying details of the statement.</p>



<p></p>



 Use cases of zero-knowledge proofs in Web3 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs have a variety of use cases within the web3 space, with some of the main ones being:</p>



 
 Enhancing privacy 



 Improving scalability 



 Enabling regulatory compliance 



 Secure authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s look at each of these in more detail and how methods using zero-knowledge proofs differ from traditional methods.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy within web3 by concealing transaction details, such as sender addresses, transaction amounts, and contract terms. Unlike traditional blockchain transactions that are transparent and visible to all, zero-knowledge proofs enable confidential transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This heightened level of confidentiality ensures that sensitive data remains protected within decentralised systems. Moreover, zero-knowledge proofs facilitate private interactions, allowing users to engage in transactions and collaborations while maintaining their privacy. This advantage is particularly beneficial in business environments where discretion and confidentiality are paramount.</p>



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs surpass traditional methods by offering a higher level of confidentiality. By concealing transaction details and protecting sensitive data within decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs address concerns related to data breaches and unauthorised access. Additionally, their ability to enable private interactions ensures that users can engage securely in web3 environments without compromising their privacy. Another thing that sets them apart from existing privacy solutions is their ability to offer increased privacy with similar levels of security as their non-private counterparts.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for greater scalability 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are increasingly used in layer 2 scaling solutions as well as modern blockchain protocols for their ability to improve blockchain scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They achieve this by optimising data processing and reducing blockchain congestion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to traditional methods, zero-knowledge proofs offer an optimised approach to data processing, reducing computational overhead and enhancing efficiency. This streamlined verification process improves scalability by enabling the processing of larger transaction volumes without congesting the blockchain network.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for better regulatory compliance 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can be useful in ensuring compliance with data regulations. They provide a more secure way to handle user data while keeping it private. By hiding sensitive bits, zero-knowledge proofs balance showing what’s needed and keeping things secret. This helps decentralised systems follow the rules without giving away personal details. They check data without revealing everything, keeping user info safe from breaches and hacks which happen regularly.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, zero-knowledge proofs are a clever way to aid in sticking to complex privacy rules while still being open. They make sure user data stays safe in decentralised systems, meeting rules and keeping trust and privacy intact in the web3 world.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for secure authentication 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs offer a secure method for verifying identities or approving actions without revealing unnecessary personal information. They function by allowing individuals to prove specific credentials without disclosing the exact details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In scenarios where secure interactions are vital, like proving age without revealing the birthdate or approving a transaction without disclosing account specifics, zero-knowledge proofs enable individuals to authenticate themselves or authorise actions while keeping sensitive information private. Amid B2B collaborations, where confidentiality is paramount, zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure interactions by permitting verifications without unnecessary exposure of private details, establishing trust without compromising confidentiality.</p>



<p>Overall, they serve as a discreet way for parties to validate identities or approve transactions securely. They enable necessary verifications while protecting sensitive information, and ensuring trusted and confidential interactions, particularly vital in B2B environments where secure collaborations rely on maintaining confidentiality.</p>



<p></p>



 Deep dive: Blockchain scalability with ZK Rollups 



<p>Let’s take a deeper dive into one of the most prominent applications of zero-knowledge proofs in web3. Scalability is a challenge as old as blockchain, and with an ever-increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is also a constant need for increased scalability. ZK Rollups emerged as a potential solution for this challenge.</p>



<p></p>



 How ZK Rollups work 



<p>ZK Rollups function by grouping multiple user transactions off-chain and then submitting these bundled transactions as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Alongside this batched transaction, a succinct proof, derived from zero-knowledge proofs, is added to validate the correctness of these bundled transactions. To be specific, a ZK rollup follows these steps:</p>



 
 Transaction bundling: Initially, numerous individual user transactions occur off-chain, which are grouped or bundled together into a single package. 
 



 
 On-chain submission: This bundled package is then submitted as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Rather than posting each transaction separately on the main chain, ZK Rollups compress these transactions into a single entry. 
 



 
 Accompanying zero-knowledge proof: Alongside this single transaction, a concise proof is included. This proof is derived using zero-knowledge techniques, ensuring that it confirms the validity of all the transactions within the bundle without disclosing the specific details of each individual transaction. 
 



 
 Verification process: On the main chain, validators or smart contracts verify this bundled transaction using the accompanying proof. The proof allows for a swift verification process without unravelling the details of each transaction within the bundle. 
 



 
 Final confirmation: Once verified, the bundled transactions are confirmed on the main chain. The main chain acknowledges the validity of these transactions, thereby updating the blockchain’s state. 
 



<p>This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain. At the same time, it maintains the ability to verify the accuracy and integrity of these transactions. It optimises blockchain scalability by condensing multiple transactions into a single entry and facilitating a more efficient verification process using the accompanying zero-knowledge proof.</p>







<p>To make this even more clear, the above image visualises these steps.</p>



<p></p>



 The benefits of ZK Rollups 



<p>The efficiency of ZK Rollups lies in their ability to maintain security guarantees of the underlying blockchain while vastly improving its scalability. Users benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction finality, making ZK Rollups a promising avenue for scaling Ethereum and other blockchain networks. This technique optimises the blockchain’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions, paving the way for broader adoption and enhanced usability of dApps.</p>



<p>As the development and adoption of ZK Rollups continue to evolve, ongoing research and advancements aim to further enhance their efficiency and usability. The synergy between ZK Rollups and zero-knowledge proofs showcases a promising path towards resolving scalability issues faced by blockchain networks. It offers a scalable solution without compromising the foundational principles of security and decentralisation.</p>



<p>In summary, ZK Rollups represent a significant leap forward in addressing the scalability concerns of blockchain networks. By leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs, they pave the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem, laying the groundwork for a future where decentralised applications can operate at scale without compromising on security.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are complex mathematical proofs that effectively allow parties to prove information without divulging the details. They can be used in web3 to improve scalability, increase privacy, boost compliance, and allow for better authentication. They are the cornerstone to the future of web3 and will be central in existing and future web3 use cases.</p>

Manwendra brings diversified experience across industries, including as the first marketer for blockchain analytics firm, <a href="https://www.merklescience.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Merkle Science</a>. Before moving to Web3, Manwendra was a marketer at leading cybersecurity firm, <a href="https://www.radware.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Radware</a>(NASDAQ: RDWR).&nbsp;</p><p>Panther plans to further expand its marketing team with two more hires in the coming weeks.</p> R&amp;D Updates  Product Updates <p>In 2023, we made significant product development progress. We started the year with a workshop in Dubai (UAE) to evaluate our progress, examine the market fit of our product, compliance requirements, and institutional perspectives.</p><p>The workshop's goal was to strategically position Panther and our suite of products to align with the anticipated growth and adoption of the DeFi. After the conclusion of the workshop, we recognized that privacy as a feature couldn’t be a differentiator if we can’t enable practical applications of it. And, to achieve this for a DeFi protocol, compliance support is essential. We noted that privacy and compliance should coexist, but it requires more effort and innovation, particularly in leveraging zero-knowledge technology. Additionally, we aimed to enhance the efficiency of our protocol without overwhelming the user experience with an excess of Zero-Knowledge proofs.</p><p>As a result, we revamped our Product Architecture to align with industry needs, incorporating several outcomes from the workshop:&nbsp;</p>  Integrate with third-party compliance providers that can satisfy the new Panther design requirements.  Create a bank account-like on-chain identity ( zAccount) which acts as a link for all transactions users perform. zAccount is further crucial for compliance as it is activated only after a successful KYC completion.&nbsp;  Data Safe mechanism to satisfy AML requirements.&nbsp;  Introduce Zones to allow institutions to become licensed Zone Managers and run a dedicated zone to enable their customers to trade with whitelisted assets and counterparties.&nbsp;  Oshiya (referred to as Panther Miner) for off-chain zero-knowledge proof computation and to reduce the update on every transaction by batching 64 transactions into one. A concept that lets users put their transactions on a “bus queue”.  DeFi adaptors logic to align with the new architecture.  Support interchain communication, scheduled for V2.  <p>After 4-6 months of development, including smart contract development, circuit development, and integrations with PureFi, we began deploying features on the Mumbai test network. This process involved continuous and iterative development of the dApp. We further devised an incentivized testnet plan, organizing the testnet releases into 8 stages.</p><p>Initially, we estimated three weeks of dApp development. However, we encountered internal bugs and external issues during the testing phase, doubling the anticipated duration.</p> Testnet Updates <p>The testnet currently has 400 users and we’ve distributed a total of over 200,000 $ZKP as rewards. The proposed total amount of Testnet rewards is 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover any additional rewards, if necessary.</p><p>Have you signed up for our testnet yet?<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTB8MP6VMtJ2VMERcwLokZ3LLSHZdKn3j32QqLN1FMFRN/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Sign up here</a> to join our community and receive your $ZKP rewards.Here’s a quick recap of our testnet stages.</p><p>Testnet Stage 0</p><p>In July this year, we launched Panther Stage 0. In this Stage, we released the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network. This testing stage (and activity in production) is directed towards miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem, as opposed to DeFi users. Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 1</p><p>After a successful Stage 0, in August this year, we released Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. In this Stage, testnet users were allowed to test two of Panther’s most anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts. Learn more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 2</p><p>In November, we released the second stage of our testnet. This second phase was designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. More information on Stage 2 <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3 development is complete, and internal testing has begun. This third phase will allow users to whitelist test Matic in addition to test ZKPs into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>Further, when it comes to $ZKP, users can now deposit and store $ZKP either as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as a zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). At the time of deposit, testnet users will have the flexibility to divide their ZKP deposit amount between the two. The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services beyond the core.</p><p>Stage 3 is undergoing internal testing at the time of publishing this year-end update and will be released immediately after the tests are completed.</p> V1 Launch Updates <p>We've been working to streamline our development process, make integration testing more efficient, and possibly work on two testnet stages parallelly to ensure we meet the deadline for the V1 release.</p><p>Audits</p><p>The suggested plan is to undergo two sets of audits before the mainnet launch. A pre-audit will be done in January and then a final audit will be done once all stages are released, tested and bugs are resolved. </p><p>V1 Launch and expansion to multiple chains</p><p>V1 is expected to be live after the second Audit. After the successful launch of V1, the plan is to extend V1 to different EVM chains, subject to community voting and approval.&nbsp;</p> Research Initiatives <p>In 2023, we published two research papers in the International Association for Cryptologic Research: (1) A flexible Snark via the monomial basis, and (2) An optimization of the addition gate count in Plonkish circuits.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1255?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">first paper</a> presents a new pairing-based Snark. The principle advantage of which is, in contrast to other Snarks such as Groth16 and Plonk, it allows freedom in the choice of an elliptic curve with the consequential benefit of supporting non-native field arithmetic (a considerable bottle-neck for other Snarks). This research was also presented at the ETH Privacy Conference in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1264?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">second paper</a> proposes a generalization of Plonk’s permutation argument to obtain a protocol on weighted sums which has the benefit of eliminating intermediate gates from high fan-in additions in circuits with Plonkish arithmetization.</p><p>Other research work includes a survey paper (to be completed soon) that focuses on different approaches to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) clients via snarks.&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that strive to meet regulatory standards and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>This year, Nym returns to Europe’s largest and longest-running hacker event, <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Chaos Communication Congress</a>, where thousands of activists, technologists, cypherpunks and artists will gather in Hamburg to shape the techno-political zeitgeist.</p><p>It was at CCC in 2019 that <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/happy-birthday-bitcoin-hello-world-nym-mixnet-600cc7539190">Nym first launched the workshops</a> to build out its testnet. A great deal has happened since then and now, the core team will be back to sip Club Mate among the crowds and gather vital feedback for the mixnet, before the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> private beta launches in Q1&nbsp;2024.</p>Nym cofounder and CEO Harry Halpin at CCC in&nbsp;2019 At a glance: Nym at CCC&nbsp;2023 <p>If you’re heading to the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/infos/startpage.html">37th CCC</a>, catch Nym at the <a href="http://decentral.community/">Critical Decentralisation Cluster</a><a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/swiss_cryptoeconomics/"> where you will find the Nym team at the Swiss Cryptoeconomics space</a>. Attendees will be able to try an alpha version of the NymVPN for the very first&nbsp;time.</p><p>Most critically, there will be workshops led by Nym Product Manager Marc Debizet to gather in-depth feedback from some of Europe’s finest hackers around the VPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>Meanwhile Nym DevRel, Serinko, will be running a workshop on setting up high-quality Nym nodes and host open discussions about exit nodes and the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-galaxy-update-has-just-completed-c54beea6c01a">Tor Null</a>&nbsp;policy.</p><p>On the ground you will also find community OG Huxian as well as Nym core team long-timers Jaya Klara Brekke and Alexis&nbsp;Roussel.</p><p><a href="https://pretalx.c3voc.de/37c3-lightningtalks/talk/AUXLKH/">The Nym core team will present at the Lightning Talk stage on 28 December at 16:45 in Hall G</a> as well as participate in assemblies, so keep your eyes peeled in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> WTF is&nbsp;CCC? <p>Staunchly political, the Chaos Communication Congress has always been fighting government overreach and censorship stretching back to the ’80s with the founding of the <a href="https://www.ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club</a> hacking&nbsp;group.</p><p>The Chaos Computer Club was co-founded by pioneering activist and hacker<a href="https://archive.ph/KajgH"> Wau Holland</a> in 1981 — in what was once a room of Berlin’s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommune_1"> Kommune 1</a>, heart of the radical German student movement and later an editorial base for the left-wing newspaper Die Tageszeitung. The group, with foresight, understood that the information sphere was set to change the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Along the way, Chaos Computer Club put its ideas into action, like when it created a DIY modem from toilet pipes — the<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q996548"> Datenklo or ‘dataloo’</a> — in the face of a government telecommunications monopoly that viewed connectivity with suspicion and criminalised plugging computers into phone lines. Members even conducted the first digital bank robbery using an exploit in the early<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/btx-hack-1984-angriff-der-ccc-hacker-gegen-die-bundespost-a-1002443.html"> Bildschirmtext (BTX)</a> computer network and were regarded by the press as<a href="https://www.nycresistor.com/2008/07/04/cats-dataloos-and-a-btx-bank-robbery/"> ‘electronic Robin Hoods’</a> (because, of course, they returned the missing Deutsche&nbsp;Marks).</p><p>It was in 1984 that the first <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Chaos Communication Congress</a> was held in Hamburg. With only 100 attendees at the inaugural event, CCC now attracts over 10,000 participants. It <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xygxn4/chaos-communication-congress-a-very-german-hacking-conference-5886b73a9848b145c38b3f06">retains its fiercely political heart</a>, a moral compass oriented to ethical hacking, and the idea that technology should be transparent and a public good — and spotlights art, beauty, and humanity as much as it does the digital&nbsp;world.</p> Nym at CCC 2023: help build privacy for&nbsp;everyone <p>Perhaps more than most, the philosophical centre of CCC aligns with the Nym mission of decentralisation and privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>And it was for those reasons that the first steps of the Nym mission to build a working mixnet, to free people from government and corporate surveillance, were taken at Chaos Communication Congress in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>A few incredibly busy years later and Nym proudly returns to CCC, to ready the mixnet for mass adoption.</p><p>The core team will hold a CLI demo, workshops and 1:1 meetings, and is proactively seeking feedback from the attendees of Europe’s biggest volunteer-run hacker event to further refine the Nym network as it gears up for&nbsp;launch.</p><p>So if you’re attending CCC, please do drop by the Critical Decentralisation Cluster to meet the team! You will also find friends of Nym from <a href="https://riat.at/">RIAT</a>, <a href="https://dod.ngo/">Department of Decentralisation</a>, <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a>, <a href="https://www.namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a> and more. Find Nym in the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/swiss_cryptoeconomics/">Swiss Cryptoeconomics</a> assembly along with <a href="https://alephium.org/">Alephium</a>, <a href="https://www.ethswarm.org/foundation">Swarm</a> and Hodling. Come chat with the team and see the NymVPN in action for the very first&nbsp;time.</p><p>And if you’re not attending this year, keep your eyes peeled for videos and other updates from CCC in the new&nbsp;year.</p><p>While you wait, here’s some Nym lore — the launch at CCC in&nbsp;2019:</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-returns-to-chaos-communications-congress-a2a08194a487">Nym returns to Chaos Communication Congress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		  4.2.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of ZEN 4.2.0 to Mainnet later next January 2024.  Pre-release 4.2.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1396500, on January 3rd, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 4.2.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible anymore to unshield funds from private addresses to normal transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen. Unshielding will still be possible to P2SH (multisignature) addresses, but the process to do so will be more involved.  Because of this, we recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses in Sphere by Horizen before February 2024. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.    <p>Main Features (from 4.1.1 to 4.2.0-rc1):&nbsp;</p>Shielded Pool Deprecation:<br>Unshielding RestrictionsPR <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/624">#624</a> is a follow-up in the gradual path of shielded pool deprecation, it introduces a hard fork requiring the unshielding of private funds to target only script addresses. After the hard fork, unshielding to P2PKH addresses or to P2PK addresses will not be allowed. For this reason, the following RPC commands have been (partially) deprecated: z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress (check inline documentation for additional details).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until December 31st. The purpose of this poll is threefold:&nbsp;</p>



 
 to fill three seats on the Zcash Community Grants committee,&nbsp; 



 to solicit feedback from the community on a proposal to pay a stipend to ZCG committee members, and&nbsp; 



 to assess community sentiment on the question of whether a new funding mechanism should be introduced to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year. Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcash-community-grants-committee-december-2023/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Five candidates are standing for three seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/jason-mcgee-for-zcg-december-2023/46154">Jason McGee</a>

 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/kworks-for-zcg-december-2023/46168">Kworks</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Last Thursday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KbIM4yNRxts?si=NhncKMnXzd1j4oDq">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your Spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!&nbsp;</p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>Since its inception, the Zcash Foundation has provided a stipend to members of the Zcash Community Grants committee. Last month, we shared the news that this stipend would be reduced from its current level of $1,725 USD to $650 USD (paid in ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several community members have expressed concerns that this reduction may have a detrimental impact on the Zcash Community Grants program. ZCG committee member GGuy has proposed that the stipend be maintained at its current level by funding it from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, we are putting the following question to ZCAP: Do you support amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forum discussion of this proposal can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">h</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">e</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">re</a>.</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves this proposal, we will draft an amendment to <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> to permit for a stipend to be paid from the Major Grants slice, with the hourly rate and cap to be set or changed by ZCAP poll. Note that the text of the amendment will be finalized by the Zcash Foundation after the results of the ZCAP poll are known, and following consultation with legal counsel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves the stipend, it is expected that any time for which ZCG Committee members claim the stipend would be in furtherance of the stated purpose of the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and the ZCG Committee, as set forth in ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If approved, the stipend will be subject to the same policies that govern similar payments by ZF, and may be subject to veto if the Foundation judges them to violate U.S. law or the ZF’s reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regulations.</p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>Earlier this year, members of the Zcash community began discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. In October, we published a <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-future-of-zcash-ecosystem-development-funding/">blog post</a> explaining how the Zcash Foundation will support the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During discussions on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dev-fund-2024-community-poll-discussion-megathread/44527">Zcash Community Forum</a> and community-organized <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaKbrNVmmVKX">Twitter Space discussions</a>, some strong opinions have been expressed both for and against the concept of renewing or replacing the current Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we are initiating an advisory poll of ZCAP on this question: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that the result of this advisory poll (which will be released alongside the results of the ZCG election in early January) will help move discussion about Zcash ecosystem funding forward, and help community members draft more specific proposals in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s my great honor to be asked to lead ECC as CEO.</p>



<p>I want to thank Zooko for everything he’s taught me in the six years that I’ve known him. I have deep respect and admiration for Zooko and his contributions to this industry and to mankind. He is a truly remarkable human. There will only ever be one Zooko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a special project. Its purpose to empower economic freedom is wholesome and good. Its legacy is indelible. The innovation within and the talent behind it are undeniable. That it flourishes is vital. All the earth must have access to private, self-sovereign money if we are to be free.</p>



<p>To realize it, we must begin to move into a new season with a different rhythm. Our focus will be to find product-market fit. That will require a continuous and iterative process of observation, hypotheses development, and testing. We will work with you to invent new things.</p>



<p>This will be a time of wide-eyed discovery, experimentation, and pulling our strengths together to make magic happen. We will be one team, in concert with one another, rapidly ideating and iterating, while working collaboratively with many across the Zcash and crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>My near term priorities are threefold:</p>



 
 Remove friction and barriers, at ECC and within the community, that impede our ability to iterate quickly 



 Focus efforts to exponentially increase Zcash utility through user-focused products and continual feedback 



 Secure ECC financial sustainability so we can deliver more, for longer 
 



<p>In support of these priorities, a few changes will immediately take effect:</p>



 
 We will optimize ECC’s organizational structure to support efficiency and improve the likelihood of our success. 



 Internal processes and policies will change to support increased focus, empowerment, and voice. 
 



<p>While I have been asked by ECC to formally help forge a new path ahead, ECC is only one participant in the Zcash community. Realizing a renewed Zcash requires a chorus of voices, both within ECC and across the Zcash community. I look forward to collaborating with you.</p>



<p>I’d like to thank Zooko and the other Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board members, including Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, and Zaki Manian, for your leadership, and thoughtfulness. This trust is the honor of my professional life.</p>



<p>I’d also like to thank the many of you across the community who have engaged with me in recent weeks on the future of Zcash — ideating, dreaming, encouraging, and collaborating. You know who you are, and you’re invaluable both to me and this legacy we’re collectively building with Zcash. We all need each other, now more than ever. Let’s go!</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>We are writing to share some significant news regarding the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and our path ahead. We are opening a new chapter in our story, with a new strategic roadmap, under new leadership.</p>



<p>Since 2015, when ECC (then known as the Zcash Company) was formed, Zooko has been our leader — and one of the most important and revered figures in the crypto and blockchain universe. Under his leadership, ECC launched Zcash in 2016 and since then has contributed groundbreaking technology that underpins Zcash — and a majority of respected crypto projects that exist today.</p>



<p>A few highlights:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In Zcash, ECC delivered the first real-world application of zero-knowledge proofs, a novel method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This is one of the most important contributions to blockchain tech since 2008.&nbsp; 



 The Sapling upgrade for Zcash made mobile-wallet shielded transactions possible for the first time, paving the way for broader adoption of private money. 



 Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way. Halo on Zcash made trustless, private digital cash payments on mobile phones possible for the first time.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Now, it’s time to start a new chapter. Josh Swihart, formerly SVP of Growth at ECC, will return to ECC and take over the reins from Zooko as CEO. He will be responsible for all strategic and tactical decisions. Zooko will remain in his role as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, the parent company of ECC. And first, he will take some much-deserved time off. Together, we will fully support and enable Josh to lead ECC into a new chapter of service to humanity.</p>



<p>Fulfilling our mission of economic freedom requires not just groundbreaking technology, but also great products that bring joy to the people who use them. So today we’re excited to redouble our focus on the Zcash user, and we feel confident in Josh’s leadership — in finding product-market fit, unlocking new partnerships and collaboration, improving Zcash usability, and increasing adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to a vision for ECC and an optimistic passion for Zcash, Josh has a strong entrepreneurial, technical, and product background. He is committed to fostering broad inclusivity within the Zcash community, and he’ll share more on that with you shortly.</p>



<p>We have challenging but exciting days ahead. We’re here for it. Thank you for standing with us.</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>



<p>The Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board of Directors: Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, Zooko Wilcox, and Zaki Manian</p>

 Quality of life and bug fixes for Aztec’s local developer testnet <p>A few months ago, we released the Aztec <a href="https://aztec.network/sandbox/">Sandbox</a> at zkHack&nbsp;London.</p><p>The Sandbox is a local developer testnet intended to be a first look into how Aztec will ultimately work: as a privacy-first Layer 2 on Ethereum. It allows developers to write Aztec-native smart contracts with public and private logic, testable in Aztec’s Private Execution Environment (PXE).</p><p>In conjunction with our <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/">announcement</a>, we quietly recruited multiple teams of developers to work closely with us to identify bugs in the Sandbox, expand its feature set, and begin experimenting with novel privacy primitives.</p><p>As a result of close collaboration with these pioneers, we are proud to announce a series of bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and other enhancements to the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p> Our Ambition <p>Our Sandbox announcement blog post called it “the most ambitious software release in Aztec Labs’ history.” And with great ambition comes great quality of life improvements.</p><p>So we’re thrilled to share some of the obstacles our developers have run into and the work we’ve done to improve Aztec’s DevEx in order to highlight the novel application design space enabled by our software.</p><p>Now that the Sandbox is more stabilized and feature complete, we will be welcoming folks into future rounds of feedback.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter to stay in the loop and get the latest with <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a>, Sandbox, and Aztec&nbsp;Labs:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📰 Subscribe to the Aztec Developer Dispatch</a></blockquote> Developer Experience Improvements <p>Early on, developers had to update a bunch of different pieces of software every time we pushed a new update. Docker, NPM packages, dependencies in nargo.toml, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>With the volume of updates we were (and still are) shipping — weekly on Tuesday — this quickly became very annoying. In fact, one of the major complaints about the Sandbox-and the reason this wasn’t an open-invite testnet-was the speed of iteration and the number of continuous changes.</p><p>So we designed a new update flow ( <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2488">aztec-cli update</a>) that updates all components in one go via a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2875">Docker-only install</a> experience, instead of manually juggling 4 different components.</p><p>We also bundled nargo (the Noir package manager) as WASM in the Docker image in the new update flow. This removes the extra step of installing nargo for writing contracts, so developers can get right into <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">writing Aztec.nr contracts</a>.</p><p>We’ve also implemented a slow updates tree to make it easier to read historical public storage in private functions.</p><p>Many external developers kept running into this constraint — if a private function is reading from public data, it is conceivable that by the time the private function executes, the public data has changed. This is one nuance of working with a network that has both private and public state, but we wanted to make it easier for developers to handle&nbsp;this.</p><p>So as mentioned above, we’ve implemented a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/slow-updates-tree">slow updates tree</a> — this is a contract containing public data that won’t change within a predefined time interval (for example, ‘over the next epoch’ or ‘over the next 500 blocks’). As long as the transaction in question is executed before that time interval, the public data will stay constant as it’s read from the slow updates&nbsp;tree.</p><p>At any time during the epoch, devs can tell the tree to update their particular public values to a new value. This data is stored in a pending tree. Once the epoch is over, the slow updates tree gets updated to use the pending values. This should be a useful data structure for developers who want to explore the new design space opened up by public ←→ private interactions.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;name? <p>Finally, better names. We know that Aztec Labs has not historically been great at naming, so we’re trying to be better at&nbsp;it.</p><p>First, we’ve removed the term ‘commitment’ in favor of ‘note hashes’. This is just more intuitive, since the ‘commitment’ actually comes from the hashing of the note (in other words, by hashing a note, you commit to the contents of that note, since changing any of the contents will change the hash!). <br>We’ve also named the private execution environment of the network as PXE (or ‘pixie’), instead of the other candidate name that we almost went with&nbsp;(PEE…).</p> Tutorials and&nbsp;Examples <p>The challenges of working with a completely new execution environment are not lost on us, so we’ve also been creating additional references for developers exploring a new ecosystem like Aztec’s. Here are some of the improvements we’ve made for tutorials and accompanying examples:</p>  More examples of custom notes — our network abstracts away a lot of the complexities associated with UTXOs, note commitments, and nullifiers. But custom notes are still hard to grasp without examples.  So we created a few more examples!  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/address-note">AddressNote</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/field-note">FieldNote</a> are two examples of custom notes that should help developers grasp the note structures.  Aztec boxes — our version of Truffle Boxes. Essentially, a package with a dedicated user interface showing developers how to use Aztec.js and how to write Aztec contracts. These <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/cli/blank_box">Aztec boxes</a> act as a reference for developers to install and see how the different components interact to help create full stack&nbsp;apps.  Portal tutorial, using Uniswap — Aztec portals are one of the most unique features of the Aztec L2. Portals allow for direct interactions with Ethereum, privately. In other words, no one can know where the transaction is coming from, besides the fact that it is coming from somewhere on&nbsp;Aztec.  <p>(Long time followers may recognize this type of functionality as <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, a previous iteration of our network. The <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec network</a> gets Aztec Connect functionality, out of the&nbsp;box!)</p><p>Tactically, portals are smart contracts written in Solidity that are related to the Ethereum smart contract that is being interacted with. <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/tutorials/uniswap/main">This Uniswap tutorial</a> helps developers understand how to use these portals to interact with L1 applications from the Aztec&nbsp;L2.</p> Smashing Bugs <p>Finally, bug fixes. There are always going to be a lot of bugs in new software, and the Sandbox is no exception.</p><p>Here are a few of the bugs that we’ve fixed recently:</p>  If the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3012">length of a note</a> was incorrect in the compute_note_hash_and_nullifier method, developers would just get a ‘no method found’&nbsp;error  We weren’t properly <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3193">deserializing arrays of&nbsp;structs</a>  Multiple things broke in the Sandbox — here is one&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2953">Example</a>  The sequencer would go into <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2502">an infinite loop</a> when duplicate nullifiers were submitted  Here are <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug">all of the bugs</a> we’ve fixed in the past 2&nbsp;months  <p>Hopefully, it’s clear that we’ve been busy making the Aztec ecosystem a more enjoyable place for developers to explore the design space opened up by programmable privacy. These improvements should meaningfully improve the quality of the developer experience for interacting with the Aztec Sandbox, and in due time, the Aztec&nbsp;network.</p><p>We are committed to improving the intuitiveness of our execution environment and continuously upgrading our documentation (look at <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+docs">this activity</a>!). All of this work is a result of listening to the challenges that the Aztec developer community is facing, fixing problems transparently, and working diligently to create a credibly neutral network with programmable privacy.</p> To our&nbsp;partners <p>We couldn’t do it without you. You chose to chew glass and soldier through weekly updates, breaking changes, bugs, all to make privacy more intuitive for others.

Participants could follow whichever tracks they wished to based on their skills and enthusiasm — or even follow all&nbsp;three.</p><p>By the end of the final two&nbsp;weeks…</p>  Builders were invited to submit a project for selection by the Nym DevRel&nbsp;team  Operators were invited to submit a node for the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-delegation-programme-is-now-open-c371c74610c5">Delegations Programme</a>  Visionaries were invited to submit impact proposals either as an individual “Nymja” or as a “Squad” — organisations based on camaraderie, shared enthusiasm, group chats and multi-sigs. (If you want to dive deeper into squads, <a href="https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/">have a read of&nbsp;this…</a>)  <p>Many community members met new people during Shipyard and formed Nym Squads as operators, builders or visionaries.</p><blockquote>But you might be wondering what is a squad?? Squads are an organisational form based on camaraderie, shared enthusiasm, group chats and multi-sigs. If you want to dive deeper, have a read&nbsp;<a href="https://otherinter.net/research/squad-wealth/">here…</a></blockquote> How were the winners selected? <p>Several squads submitted great projects across all three tracks. Winners were shortlisted by the team of track leads, with final winners selected by core team leadership on the basis of quality, completeness and to ensure a good spread across competencies and geographies.</p>  3 builder projects were&nbsp;approved  100 node operators have been selected for the Delegations Programme out of more than 300 applicants and have been notified individually  28 squads have been selected focusing on building software, building community, and building network&nbsp;capacity  <p>Thank you to everyone who applied. Due to the quality of applications Nym rewarded 28 squads instead of the initially planned&nbsp;10!</p><p>This is just the first round, so even if you weren’t successful this time, get ready to organise for next year — where new opportunities will open for promising squads and node operators.</p> Winning squads: spotlight <p>To give you a taste of some of the winning squads, here are a few of the most outstanding proposals:</p> <a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim">TupiNymQuim Squad</a> <p>One of the top-performing squads was TupiNymQuim of Brazil. Not only did they apply with a high-quality impact proposal strongly rooted in their community, they also built a Nym integration with <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> during the Shipyard Level 3 hackathon:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/TupiNymQuim/Incognito">Incognito Search</a>  <p>Congratulations!</p> <a href="https://github.com/Raw-Box/graypaper">Rawbox Squad</a> <p>Rawbox were another top performer, developing a strong proposal to create a Nym router with the mission to “create a basic physical infrastructure for a new generation of decentralized internet.” The RawBox router will be based on<a href="https://opnsense.org/"> OPNsense</a> (FOSS enterprise-grade firewall), BTCPay Server, and Nym services.</p><p>Congratulations!</p> <a href="https://linktr.ee/lunardao">LunarDao Squad</a> <p>LunarDao Squad hardly needs an introduction among those who have been working and advocating for privacy online. LunarDAO is one of the first truly anonymous decentralised organisations with a main focus on collective investment into privacy projects, while also focusing on education and Lunarpunk culture. An important ecosystem partner for Nym, they enable Nym engagement and adoption among Web3 privacy OGs and newbies&nbsp;alike.</p> <a href="https://t.me/CoinMetrika">CoinMetrika</a> <p>If you’re familiar with the crypto scene of the CIS region, or have had a closer look at the nodes making up the Nym mixnet in the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">network explorer</a>, CoinMetrika may ring a bell. Long-time Nym supporters and node operators, CoinMetrika is a popular Russian-speaking group focused on crypto education and running validators for various blockchain projects. As part of their Squad Grant, CoinMetrika is joining the Nym Delegations Programme as Russian-speaking mentors, and will spread the word about Nym and its mission within the CIS&nbsp;region.</p><p>Smaller grants were awarded to squads who are just starting out with their local communities. These included:</p> <a href="https://heather-yacht-ddf.notion.site/Roadmap-f40e3b3e621d4c9e96858dcc5a51a1c0">Ukraine Privacy Alliance&nbsp;Squad</a> <p>The UPA squad (not to be confused with the <a href="https://privacyalliance.com/">Universal Privacy Alliance</a>) was formed by the growing Ukrainian community. Their objectives include setting up nodes and producing educational material in Ukrainian, pursuing local partnerships and more. Nym has a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/be-brave-as-ukraine-build-anondrop-at-the-kyiv-tech-summit-hackathon-4959ea99cfb8">long-standing relationship with Ukraine</a> as <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-could-help-anonymously-document-war-crimes">reported</a> so it is only fitting to boost the local community and Ukrainian language&nbsp;content!</p> WSA Squad (Web3 Safety Advancers) <p>The WSA Squad was set up by Nymja cadets in Bangladesh to educate the local Web3 community on privacy. The grant will enable them to set up nodes and begin education on Nym and privacy in the&nbsp;region!</p> Privacy Warriors&nbsp;Squad <p>The Privacy Warriors squad was formed by Turkish Nym community members with the aim of establishing partnerships with Turkish universities, holding events and creating Nym Turkish language content and educational material. The Turkish community is one of the largest and most active communities around Nym and this will help level up the resources and events available to strengthen the community and make it increasingly autonomous.</p> And finally the top reward goes&nbsp;to… <p>The top reward of 100,000 NYM tokens went to outstanding community member <a href="https://twitter.com/pawnflake">Pawnflake</a> for building <a href="https://explorenym.net/">ExploreNym</a>!</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/community-spotlight-introducing-explore-nym-delegation-advisor-f713b64b1478">Community spotlight: introducing Explore Nym &amp; Delegation Advisor</a></p><p>Last year, Pawnflake joined the very first Shipyard Academy and went from being a full time gamer to teaching himself how to code and growing his skills to become a pillar of the Nym community. Pawnflake will be leading mentorship in the Nym Delegations Programme.</p><p>Congratulations and a huge thank you to Pawnflake for all his work, enthusiasm and dedication to the Nym&nbsp;mission!</p><p>These are just a handful of the many incredible projects — scroll down to the bottom of this post for the full list of fantastic winners.</p> Nym Shipyard: what&nbsp;next? <p>Shipyard was just the beginning of training and preparing the Nym community for next year. Nym will be launching its first commercial application, <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">the NymVPN</a>, on the mixnet. This means everyone will need to step up to prove that this powerful privacy infrastructure is run by a strong community of operators and token&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>Squads will play a crucial role in 2024, increasingly responsible for autonomously leading the Nym communities across the world. They will act as hubs of knowledge, running channels, running high-quality nodes, organising builders and beta-testers, running workshops, hackathons and more. Each squad will be unique, shaped by the talents of the founding&nbsp;members.</p><p>Be among the first to find out more — peek into 2024 on Friday, 15 December for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myt6QE_U4FY">last Nym community call of&nbsp;2023</a>!</p> Full list of winning&nbsp;squads <p>An enormous 104 squads submitted impact proposals. Out of these, 28 were selected as the top applicants.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.0.</p>



<p>This release includes a “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP) implementation of shielded scanning, with a new “zebra-scan” crate and behind an experimental “shielded-scan” feature. This marks the first step towards full support for shielded scanning in Zebra and we’re excited to continue building out the functionality. Ongoing development is tracked in issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7728">#7728</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Important Security Warning 



<p>This new feature is for experimental use only and has known security issues. We recommend that you do NOT use regular or sensitive viewing keys with Zebra’s experimental scanning feature. You should also NOT use this feature on a shared machine. If you do want to <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">try this out</a>, we suggest that you generate new keys for experimental use.</p>



<p>Also included in this release:</p>



 
 A fix for a panic that was introduced in Zebra v1.4.0, which happens in rare circumstances when reading cached sprout or history trees. 



 Further improvements to how Zebra recovers from network interruptions and prevents potential network hangs. 



 Improvements to limit the ability of synthetic nodes to spread throughout the network through Zebra, to address some of the Ziggurat red team report. 
 



<p><br>As of this release, Zebra requires Rust 1.73 to build. </p>

  Partnering with Tacto: Future-Proof Supply Chains  <p>André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building the modern supplier-management solution millions of businesses need.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/">Luciana Lixandru</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/julien-bek/">Julien Bek</a>, and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/cornelius-menke/">Cornelius Menke</a>	 

Published December 11, 2023
  



TACTO CO-FOUNDERS JOHANNES GROLL, NICO BENTENRIEDER AND ANDRÉ PETRY.



 
<p>Sometimes you meet a team and you just know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first learned last year about Tacto co-founders André Petry, Nico Bentenrieder and Johannes Groll and the procurement solution they were building, we already had a keen interest in the category. While businesses have for decades used CRMs (customer relationship management systems) to grow their revenue, where was the SRM (supplier relationship management system)? More attention to the supplier and cost side of the equation was clearly needed, as geopolitical tensions, COVID ripple effects and regulatory changes have created unprecedented supply chain uncertainty and price volatility.</p>



<p>For the world’s largest companies producing physical goods, some supplier relationship tools are available via incumbents. But for millions of mid-sized businesses (SMBs), these options are too cumbersome and too expensive; 90% have no procurement solution at all. Instead, they’re stuck tracking every supplier, certificate and quote manually, in email and Excel. It’s a daunting proposition—especially when you realize that even a company making a seemingly simple product like tape might have hundreds of suppliers and procure tens of thousands of different articles.</p>



<p>Those mid-sized industrial companies are exactly who <a href="https://www.tacto.ai/">Tacto</a> was built to serve, so in late 2022, we reached out to their team to discuss the possibility of a partnership. Unfortunately for us, they’d just finished raising their seed round. But we didn’t want to give up—so we started speaking with customers in the sector, hoping to learn more about the business. What we heard made us even more interested in the product André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building.</p>



<p>Customers told us Tacto had helped them streamline every aspect of the procurement process, from requesting, evaluating and responding to quotes; to tracking suppliers’ regulatory certifications; to analyzing prices and preparing for negotiations. Where their employees once spent hundreds of hours on interviews, questionnaires and data entry, the platform now automatically gathers and standardizes that information—and of course, uses AI to help them make sense of it. Tacto has also dramatically simplified compliance with Germany’s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which imposes stricter supplier reporting to every business with at least 1,000 full-time employees. Even better, it’s easy to integrate—no year-long sales cycles or big IT projects—and, thanks to André, Nico and Johannes’s insistence on an elegant, consumer-grade UI, it’s easy to use, as well.</p>



<p>But customers didn’t just sing the praises of Tacto’s product; we also heard amazing things about its team. André, Nico and Johannes have stellar credentials—all three met at the elite Center for Digital Technology and Management in Munich. They started Tacto in early 2020 after seeing the challenges of procurement firsthand, pushed ahead when skeptics in the space told them it wouldn’t work, and now, have stuck with it long enough to prove those skeptics wrong. They are high-energy, thoughtful and relentlessly focused on performance—and, importantly, they have an impressive ability to attract talent. Tacto’s team members deeply understand the problems their customers are facing, and they work quickly to solve them.</p>



<p>After hearing those rave reviews, we knew we had to try again—so we traveled to Munich to meet André face-to-face. We walked out of that first one-hour coffee with a high degree of conviction in Tacto, and a couple of weeks later, flew back to spend the day with the team and offer them a term sheet. Sequoia was far from the only firm vying for Tacto’s attention—but in that high-pressure environment, we saw for ourselves the qualities that make André, Nico and Johannes great leaders. We were thrilled that they chose us to lead their Series A.</p>



<p>Today, the future is bright. Tacto is now serving customers across a wide range of industries, from mechanical engineering to packaging to medical technology, and impressively, they have grown quickly while retaining every one of their happy customers. In the months and years ahead, as supply chain challenges continue and new regulations expand beyond Germany across Europe, André, Nico, Johannes and their team will be there to make life better and easier for even more companies—and we are excited to support them along the way.</p>

<p>The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology adoption across industries has indicated widespread organisational acceptance of the novel technology. The advent of this new technology has brought more efficient and creative possibilities. However, the use of language models in AI raises concerns about trustworthiness in its training and the output it generates. This leads us to the question: How can we leverage existing technologies to bridge this lack of trust?</p>



<p>This article explores the challenges surrounding trust in AI system inputs and outputs, how blockchain could be the solution to establish trust, and various integration challenges that need to be accounted for.</p>



<p></p>



 Trust challenges of AI systems 



<p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, organisations have made enormous strides to implement AI within their technological systems. Enthusiasm for this new technology promising productivity enhancement, has also generated discussions on whether we can trust these systems. Who has been training these AI models? How can we be sure that the information output it generates is reliable and unbiased? </p>



<p></p>



 Transparency of AI language models  



<p>AI systems require a large language model (LLM) to learn and have a basis to create outputs from. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the LLMs, doubts arise on data input authenticity and reliability.</p>



<p>Authenticity: If the origin, quality, and representativeness of the input data are not transparent, it raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the model’s understanding.</p>



<p>Reliability: Lack of clarity regarding the source of training data leads to scepticism about the model’s ability to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and diverse perspectives. This creates uncertainty on whether the model’s output can be trusted and used accordingly.</p>



<p>Explainability: There is a lack of self-explanation in AI systems on how a specific outcome is generated when prompted. This poses a significant hurdle to understanding and trusting AI’s outputs. What data did the system pool together to carry out its decision-making process when prompted?</p>



<p></p>



 Ethical standards in AI training 



<p>AI systems often make decisions based on complex algorithms and data that include principles governing the training of AI models. Thus creating the need for a standardised set of ethical guidelines governing the training of AI models.</p>



<p>One primary concern is the ethical framework guiding the selection of data used in training these systems. The opaqueness surrounding the training data raises ethical concerns, particularly related to bias. If the data used to train AI models contain biases, the model may unintentionally perpetuate those biases in its outputs. Without transparency, it becomes challenging to identify and address biases in the training data. Therefore making it difficult to avoid potential negative consequences.</p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. AI output 



<p>Another significant challenge revolves around the ability to distinguish between outputs generated by AI systems and those by human intelligence. Can we reliably identify whether the output presented is a result of human thought or an algorithmic process? </p>



<p>Authentication is particularly crucial in scenarios where information transparency is essential, such as journalism, content creation, or academia. This distinction between human and AI-generated content also carries ethical implications. It prompts discussions on attribution, accountability, and the potential influence these systems might have in shaping public opinion. As AI becomes more integrated into society, different mechanisms are needed to transparently demonstrate the origin of information.</p>



<p></p>



 Output challenges 



<p>When speaking of trust within AI, we must also evaluate the ownership and intellectual property rights of AI-generated output. The challenge lies in determining whether outputs are established through AI’s novel agency or the accumulation of various other sources that warrant intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The artwork industry can be used to illustrate the debate on whether generative AI should give credit to artists. Since the system draws inspiration from its training model, would the new artwork’s ownership belong to AI? This debate highlights legal and ethical dilemmas, due to a lack of established frameworks that promote fair compensation for contributors. As AI systems evolve, there is a pressing need to redefine traditional notions of ownership. Acknowledgment of the collaborative nature of AI development is needed while safeguarding the rights of those involved in the generative process.</p>



<p></p>



 Role of blockchain in establishing trust 



<p>Based on the trust challenges discussed above, blockchain technology could be the solution as a trust layer for AI. Blockchain’s decentralised design, using transparent and immutable data records, guarantees universal accessibility, enhanced authentication, and verification processes for all users.</p>



<p></p>



 Ensuring transparency in data processes  



<p>One of the fundamental challenges in trusting AI, as discussed, lies in the lack of transparency regarding data input processes. Blockchain can resolve the transparency issue by recording every step of the AI training and data input process. This ensures that the origin and reliability of the data used to train AI models are traceable and verifiable to reflect real-world conditions.</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain, organisations facilitating AI technology can instil confidence in stakeholders regarding the reliability of its AI-generated outputs. This safeguards against potential misuse and establishes a foundation for accountability in the development and deployment of AI.</p>



<p></p>



 Tracing decision-making processes  



<p>Transparency enabled by blockchain technology can address the inherent explainability challenges associated with AI’s black-box nature. Establishing a transparent trail of the data and model processes integrated enhances the reliability of AI decisions.</p>



<p>The availability of a comprehensible trail can address the lack of confidence and scepticism present in generative AI. Traceability encourages independent evaluation, empowering users to revisit and assess AI’s decision-making steps, thereby contributing to a more accountable and trustworthy AI environment.</p>



<p></p>



 Leveraging immutability to validate data input reliability 



<p>The immutable nature of blockchain technology contributes to providing security to data records and data transactions. Every piece of information entered into the blockchain is time-stamped and linked to previous data blocks, creating an unbroken chain of custody. This not only enhances the accountability of data sources but also enables stakeholders to verify the authenticity of inputs. As a result, users can confidently rely on the integrity of the data feeding into AI algorithms, knowing that any attempt to manipulate or compromise the information would be immediately detectable. On the other hand, blockchain can be used to drive sustainability goals for successful operations in the long run. For further understanding of how blockchain can sustain long-term ESG goals for organisations, refer to this ebook on <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">using blockchain for sustainability.</a></p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. machine contributions 



<p>Distinguishing between outputs generated by human intelligence and those crafted by AI is critical. The widespread use of AI in optimising many of our daily processes is bound to be used in other various domains, such as work-related situations and advisory roles.  This has caused increasing evaluation on whether information distributed is completely human or contains traces of AI contribution. </p>



WorldID is used as a global digital identity to anonymously prove a person’s unique identity.



<p>Thus the use of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem provides a mechanism for creating verifiable identities for both human and machine contributors.  OpenAI’s <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">WorldID</a> initiative is an example of how smart contracts can be employed to authenticate the origin of contributions. Its application will enable a clear distinction between human and AI-generated outputs. Their initiative could address future concerns about accountability and ethical considerations in various domains such as authentic journalism and recognition.</p>



<p></p>



 Establishing auditable trails for tracing errors 



<p>In the complex landscape of AI, errors and biases in outputs can have significant consequences for end users. Blockchain-based systems can offer the solution of an auditable trail that records every transaction and interaction within the AI ecosystem. In the event of errors or biases in AI outputs, this auditable trail provides a comprehensive analysis of the training data and its parameters, facilitating the identification and rectification of issues. This auditable trail also serves as a critical tool for post hoc analysis, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of AI algorithms to meet evolving ethical and performance standards.</p>



<p></p>



 Challenges between AI and blockchain integration 



<p>The integration of AI and blockchain technology may provide us with a starting point in establishing trust, however, there are still potential challenges that experts should address when considering this integration.</p>



<p></p>



 Scalability 



<p>One prominent concern is the scale and scope of AI applications. AI systems often work with massive datasets, and to fully integrate them with blockchain, a highly efficient, low-cost network is essential. However, the transactional and resource costs associated with blockchain networks remain a significant hurdle.</p>



<p></p>



 Cost efficiency 



<p>Initial setup costs can involve acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure to support both AI algorithms and blockchain networks. Maintenance costs also arise as ongoing updates and improvements are essential to keep both technologies optimised and secure. Transaction costs associated with blockchain networks, such as fees for data storage and processing, can accumulate. Particularly when dealing with large-scale AI applications that require frequent interactions with the blockchain. Lastly, organisations will need to invest in skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain, adding to the overall human resource expenses.</p>



<p></p>



 Interoperability 



<p>There are various blockchain platforms available, and achieving interoperability between them poses a challenge since smart contracts and AI applications might need to interact across different blockchain networks. AI models and algorithms may be developed using different frameworks and technologies. Therefore, ensuring a seamless integration with blockchain platforms can be a complicated process. </p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Compliance 



<p>The topic of interoperability across both technologies also highlights regulatory challenges on two fronts. The decentralised and global nature of blockchain introduces uncertainty, as compliance requirements vary across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, the use of AI, particularly in sensitive domains, is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny with a focus on data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Combining these technologies requires a dual compliance effort of addressing regulations specific to each domain and staying up to date with technical developments, to develop a standardised process for compliance.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The widespread integration of AI technology has prompted critical discussions surrounding transparency, authentication and ethical standards in AI language models. Blockchain, through its transparent and immutable nature, emerges as a promising solution to address these concerns. It offers transparency in data processes, traceability of decision-making, and validation of data input reliability. However, the integration of AI and blockchain presents a set of challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Thus, when leveraging this integration, a balance is needed between innovation, and ethical considerations. AI developers should ensure that the collaborative development of AI is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy for the benefit of its users.</p>

<p>1) Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p><p>I’m what everyone knows as ‘JSKitty’ — the infamous dev cat of Labs (since the SnappySnap days)! Young British dev, a never-ending interest in tech, from crypto to global-finance, game-dev and AI, I’ve pretty much touched every computer-related subject that anyone could think of — and my end interest ended up being with crypto, after I found Bitcoin around early&nbsp;2014.</p><p>Before PIVX, I worked at ZENZO, before ZENZO, I worked on multiple early projects, like the “DeepOnion” privacy coin, or “eXperience Points (XP)” back in the 2017&nbsp;bullrun!</p><p>Before all those, I was a Game Developer, with two published games, and a handful of unpublished ones, mostly solo-built, some with friends, but all of them were built in a home-schooled method, I do not have a single academic grade to my name, and I don’t need&nbsp;one!</p><p>2) When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>In early 2013–2014 I ended up coming across (in a way that is now lost to my memories) a Bitcoin faucet, the ancient “Freebitco.in” site (which is still running today, damn!), at that point, I was just barely a game developer, had zero knowledge (hah) of Bitcoin, crypto, most of programming, and even finance in general — over the years, I collected Bitcoin, I learned about it, got incredibly obsessed over the technology from the newfound of decentralised systems and “programmable money”, I joined the BitcoinTalk forum and engaged, actually got a fairly reputable BitcoinTalk account in those days, back when coins would often do “Banner Campaigns” where BCT users would advertise a coin on their banner, fun times,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>3) When and why did you get into&nbsp;PIVX?</p><p>This is an interesting one, around late 2017 roughly, I was effectively a serial-tipbot-dev as a kid, a surprising amount of projects used to have my Tipbots, I built them from scratch, they had various community-building features, and I would bounce from project-to-project hooking them up and watching the communities enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>In that time, I met Snappy and the original-ish tipbot operator (Buer), in which I poked around for the status of it, and saw that it was effectively dead — so I teamed up with Snappy, who LOVED the idea, and immediately helped me to make the ‘PIVX Tipbot’ a reality — and for those months that it ran, I remember it was a huge success, with a bot-powered Radio and DJ system that members would gather and rock with — Snappy would act as a host — that, that community spirit, is what kept me in PIVX, even if the original idea, was merely to propagate a&nbsp;tipbot.</p><p>4) What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;market?</p><p>It’s teams (Core and Labs), it’s long-lived testament of surviving the harshest markets, it’s unique blend of Bleeding-Edge tech with PoS, in which a dozen “PIVX-firsts” occurred and continue to occur. — PIVX as a technology, and a currency, is an incredible feat, to say the least, one that is underappreciated by the wider&nbsp;market.</p><p>5) Can you tell us about your journey as a developer and engineer that led you to the creation of PIVXLabs; mypivxwallet and PIVCards?</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/PjuCvCHDyp">PIVX Labs,</a> or at least the ‘soul’ and idea of it, was born of Snappy — the Catalyst of PIVX Labs as-of-today was back when me, Snappy, Kyeno and various other developers, some long gone now — decided that PIVX needed more than just a Core Wallet, the problem with 2017–2020 PIVX was that there were a severe barrier to entry, as well as a UX that is not up to the modern standards of&nbsp;‘Web3’.</p><p>Labs came to fruition from the demand of Labs being needed — we knew PIVX needed a lighter, faster, easier wallet that anyone in the world, on any device, with any experience level; could setup and use, without compromising on security. <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> was Labs first creation.</p><p>We also knew that PIVX needed more than wallets to thrive as a currency — <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/">PIVCards </a>enabled using PIV in the real-world, easier than any other platform on the market — What will we build next? I’m not sure yet, but it will be another pillar to PIVX’s real-world adoption and usage — That, is why Labs&nbsp;exists.</p><p>6) As a developer, what are some of the technical aspects or challenges you encountered while building mypivxwallet, and how did you overcome&nbsp;them?</p><p>In general, there are three-ish ‘pillars’ of MPW’s architecture to decide&nbsp;upon:</p><p>- Convenience.</p><p>- (De)centralisation and/or&nbsp;Privacy.</p><p>- Security.</p><p>Increase one, and generally, the other two decrease, how do you build something perfect in all three? Truthfully, you can’t, there are trade-offs to be made somewhere, for something.</p><p>My first and foremost priority for MPW has been Security: for example, MPW since even the first day, NEVER allowed saving a wallet to disk without an encryption password — ironically, this is a more secure practice than the Core Wallet, which does not force this measure on first&nbsp;launch.</p><p>But for Privacy? This is tough, MPW uses Blockbook explorers to sync your transaction history, which requires the app to send your Public Keys to said Blockbook to retrieve your balance — this is not fun, but the alternative: chain header sync, would lengthen the synchronisation time of MPW MASSIVELY, which is a huge hit to Convenience.</p><p>Sure, only a gone-rogue Blockbook can actually collect, store, analyse that data — but it is still a possibility, depending on your threat model, that may already be too much data exposure for&nbsp;someone.</p><p>Back to security: many platforms, like Password Managers, will encrypt your password data locally, and then upload your encrypted data to their Cloud storage — this means you can retrieve your data from the internet, or cross-sync things across your devices, which is incredibly convenient: but what if that service gets compromised? It’s a ticking time bomb before your data is decrypted by an attacker, and boom, account gone — MPW could add encrypted cloud-sync for convenience, and to give users the ability to recover their wallet even if their device exploded randomly — sure, but is it worth the&nbsp;risk?</p><p>This is our daily challenge, a balancing act of conflicting design philosophies.</p><p>7) How does mypivxwallet simplify the onboarding process for new users, particularly those who may be unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets?<br> <br> <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MPW </a>focuses massively on: “less is more” in a User Experience sense — the default design assumption of MPW is to assume the user is the least knowledgeable in any area of the wallet, as such; complex features are walled off behind “Advanced Mode”, which hides complex things by default — users can create an MPW wallet, jot down their seed on paper, and encrypt their wallet, within just 1–2&nbsp;minutes!</p><p>8) With the recent launch of PIVCards could you share a little about this phenomenal PIVX use&nbsp;case?</p><p>PIVCards was, funnily, a completely random whim-idea I had a few months ago and decided to prototype in a single week of spare time — having gotten the ‘itch’ to do something new outside of MPW, PIVCards was a massive technological and logistical challenge, and I am surprised that such a small team managed to build it as well as we&nbsp;did.</p><p>PIVCards has processed almost 400 orders, worth a total of ~$17,500, since the initial prototyping, and we HUGELY underestimated the volume we’d be handling, so PIVCards had a full two/three weeks of additional polishing by me, to get it scaling better and with less manual input needed — now, although still imperfect, the service runs entirely autonomously, with near zero manual labour required aside from the occasional logistical ‘edge-case’ we&nbsp;hit.</p><p>9) Finally, what advice or encouragement would you give to aspiring developers and entrepreneurs who are looking to make an impact in the cryptocurrency industry?</p><p>Find what excites you, fascinates you, what grabs at you with the grasp a black hole has on the cosmos: and dive in to it, trust the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Why keep what you love, as a mere side-hobby, rather than a way of&nbsp;life?</p><p>Work doesn’t have to be ‘for someone’, nor does it have to be boring, unexciting — break the chains of being a corporate cog, find what you love, master it, and with enough time and energy (and very importantly: networking), you will make a living with it, doing what you&nbsp;love.</p><p>Sending gratitude to JSKitty for taking the time to sit down with me and share some insights into his background and experiences.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/decembers-pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-jskitty-founder-and-developer-of-pivxlabs-487e2cc3ba5f">December’s PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on JSKitty, Founder and Developer of PIVXLabs.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 TL;DR 



<p>As Electric Coin Co. (ECC) and the Zcash community prepare for public retrospectives of zcashd Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) and what has become known as the sandblasting attack, this blog post details ECC’s motivations, challenges, and accomplishments with regard to each.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The NU5 upgrade was an ambitious undertaking to eliminate the need for trusted setups, increase user confidence, and enhance Zcash’s security and scalability. 



 The implementation of Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, on Zcash made possible trustless, private, digital-cash transactions for the first time on mobile phones. 



 A malicious attack following the upgrade led to significant wallet performance issues, prompting ECC to enter Emergency Mode. Our response involved multiple technical updates, performance improvements, and the release of new mobile-wallet SDKs. 



 Despite the challenges and delays, ECC succeeded in improving the security and resiliency of Zcash. 
 



 



 



<p><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86440711631">Public retrospective: Wednesday, Dec. 13 at 22:00 UTC/17:00 EST</a></p>



 



 



 What the FUD? 



<p>ECC’s mission is to empower economic freedom, and most organizations that work on Zcash-related projects, like the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), have similar community-minded objectives for the betterment of humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, since Zcash came into the world in 2016 a stream of misinformation (and some coordinated propaganda) has been circulated on social media, forums, and other community platforms meant to incite FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>The rumors claimed that Zcash was compromised, or that it was vulnerable to counterfeiting, or that there was a backdoor that would allow third parties to access a user’s transaction information without their consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unfortunately, until NU5 was released, there was a major obstacle in confronting these attacks: the trusted setup. When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup phase, to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations using complex security measures.</p>



<p>Regardless of the extra-careful planning and execution plus redundant security, Zcash users and observers had to trust the historical fact that the ceremony participants weren’t conspiring to deceive the public. Trusted setups don’t allow for a mathematically verifiable supply, and as long as these complicated procedures were required for major Zcash upgrades, there would always be doubters and detractors. And the doubters would have a point — mathematics is verifiable, but history isn’t. The reputation and integrity of Zcash was being challenged, and in ECC’s view, this was an issue the community couldn’t afford to ignore.</p>



 NU5: A call to action 



<p>In 2019, ECC engineers Sean Bowe, Daira Emma Hopwood, and Jack Grigg had been working on scalability design and experimenting with a solution for efficient recursion when Bowe made a discovery.</p>



<p>“I just stumbled upon a technique to do this zero-knowledge proof construction on completely ordinary elliptic curves,” Bowe said. “And so over the course of maybe 24 hours, it went from, ‘Ooh, that’s really exciting, that’ll be neat if we can do that’ to ‘Holy crap, now that we don’t have trusted setups or anything, it’s all really simple. It was a series of steps that turned from a nice insight into a complete paradigm shift.”</p>



<p>Halo, as it would come to be known, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bowe’s discovery was a cryptographic breakthrough heralded by the industry, and in 2021 ECC committed to implementing Halo in Zcash.</p>



<p>Halo on Zcash would make trustless, private, digital-cash transactions possible for the first time on mobile phones. It would serve as a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and provide a path to much greater scalability, while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the ECC blog:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Halo on Zcash would enable circuit upgrades without the need for trusted setups, making the Zcash shielded protocol more agile for future improvements, such as supporting additional assets like [Zcash Shielded Assets, or ZSAs]. We want to make it easy for other projects and tokens to benefit from Zcash features, such as privacy through encryption. Trusted setup will become a remnant of the past.</p>



<p>In addition, this upgrade would pave the way for shielded Zcash scale through proof aggregation and blockchain succinctness, two scalability improvements. This would improve the user experience by eliminating frustrating synchronization time that plagues all blockchains today, reducing the traditional blockchain bloat, and allowing for non-escalating fees as usage increases. In conversations with large social platforms who expressed interest in native Zcash support, a viable path to scalability was given as a requisite near-term consideration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2021, after more than a year of Halo R&amp;D, ECC concluded that the benefits of Halo on Zcash outweighed other protocol priorities, and we proposed implementing it in NU5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/8qSA29vWWds?si=6hvbieHC23DzuvmX">Zcash Media video</a> about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes trusted setups obsolete.</p>



 NU5 objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our NU5 goals from the outset were to (1) make Zcash more secure, (2) give Zcash users confidence by making the supply mathematically verifiable, (3) make future upgrades easier, and (4) enable future upgrades to benefit from recursive proofs for scalability and programmability improvements.</p>



<p>Our original estimate of 6-7 months turned out to be overly optimistic — as new discoveries were made, opportunities were revealed in the process, and technical complexities arose — and in the end the journey took almost a year and a half.</p>



<p>Along the way, we confronted a number of technical challenges. For example, the complexity of including Orchard support in the zcashd embedded wallet was not properly accounted for in the original estimates for the NU5 timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECC faced time-consuming engineering hurdles, like building a complicated circuit for Halo-plus-Orchard to make it work on mobile devices. And midstream, we made the decision to implement <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified addresses</a> (UAs) to enable shielded by default in supporting wallets. The design and build-out of UAs were difficult, and if ECC had been practicing product-driven planning and development at the time (like we are now) we believe we would have identified the need for UAs sooner and their implementation would have been smoother.</p>



<p>In addition to battling technical obstacles like these, plus a few <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-4-5-1/">surprise bugs</a>, ECC spent significant time and resources advocating for and defending our roadmap decisions against criticism for: our rationale (getting rid of trusted setup wasn’t worth the time and effort, ZSAs were more important), our planning (we kicked off the discussion publicly before planning enough -and- we planned too much before starting the work), the decision to license Orchard under the Bootstrap Open Source Licence (BOSL), the decision to implement Unified Addresses (UAs), and our overall approach to network upgrades (our priorities were arbitrary and out of touch).</p>



<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we had significant community support during the process, too. Overall, community sentiment was positive. We received valuable insight and feedback from our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/team/">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and crucial security audits from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@qedit/zcash-nu5-audit">Qedit</a> and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/02/public-report-zcash-nu5-cryptography-review/">NCC group</a>.</p>



 NU5 timeline and accomplishments 



<p>Not including the pre-implementation research and development, NU5 was a 17-month endeavor that delivered novel technology and improved Zcash user experience.&nbsp;</p>



 Timeline 



 
 September 2019: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-recursive-proof-composition-without-a-trusted-setup/">Discovery of Halo</a> announced 



 January 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/announcing-zip-224-bringing-halo-2-to-zcash/">ZIP 224 proposes</a> the Orchard shielded protocol, which defines a new shielded pool with spending keys and payment addresses that are amenable to future scalability improvements (In January, we <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/announcing-zip-224-bringing-halo-2-to-zcash/">hoped</a> to release NU5 in summer of 2021) 



 February 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/network-upgrade-pipeline-2-0/">Original timeline</a> slated NU5 (with Halo) for release in October 2021 



 March 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-proposed-features/">NU5 proposed features</a> were published 



 April 2021: The NU5 release date was <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/halo-arc-for-zcash-proposed-for-release-later-this-year/">pushed to January 2022</a> because of new discoveries that would facilitate better interoperability and to allocate additional time for our third-party implementation audit cycle

 November 2021:&nbsp; <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-security-assessments-complete/">Security assessments were completed</a> 



 December 2021: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-and-halo-arc-timeline-update/">NU5 release date pushed</a> to April 2022 for additional development and to focus on ecosystem outreach and preparations 



 March 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activation-and-halo-arc-release-delayed-for-remediation-of-consensus-bug/">NU5 activation and Halo Arc release delayed </a>until May 2022 for remediation of consensus bug in testnet 



 May 31, 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">NU5 activates on mainnet</a>, eliminating trusted setup for the new Orchard pool and launching a new era for Zcash 
 



<p>When Zcash NU5 activated on mainnet May 31, 2022, it was one of the most important milestones for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016. As ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “an historic step forward for human society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In launching the Orchard shielded payment protocol utilizing Halo, we eliminated the trusted setup to improve Zcash security and sustainability, made the supply mathematically verifiable, improved scalability because future network upgrades won’t require a complicated setup ceremony, paved the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale, and introduced BOSL which has returned value to the Zcash community (e.g., Filecoin Foundation and Ethereum Foundation grants to Brave and Edge).</p>



<p>It was a massive effort, and after almost a year and a half of building and wrestling with the technical challenges of NU5, the ECC Core team was ready for some rest. But almost right away, Zcash was hit with another issue we couldn’t ignore.</p>



 



 The sandblasting attack 



<p>In June 2022, almost immediately after ECC launched NU5, a serious problem emerged. The Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction size and activity. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets (Nighthawk, Edge, and Unstoppable) from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. Wallets weren’t syncing and some users weren’t able to access their funds.</p>



<p>This was a problem that ECC, as the primary maintainer of zcashd and supplier of mobile-wallet SDKs, was best-positioned to confront.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: A call to action 



<p>Some parties at ECC did not initially want to make the assumption that this unusual transaction load was the work of a malicious actor. Eventually however, the evidence that it was a malicious actor became overwhelming — and we have reason to believe it may even have been coordinated by the same actor or group of actors who spread Zcash FUD, and that they may have been paid to do so.</p>



<p>But solving that mystery was less important than fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could regain access to and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world, private digital cash.</p>



<p>As an initial line of defense, we released&nbsp; performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80%. We also began working on performance upgrades to our mobile wallet SDKs.</p>



<p>In August 2022, with lots of work left to solve these wallet performance issues, ECC went into Emergency Mode. This was our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>The wallet performance issues presented a complicated series of challenges to address, and they required developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that would give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. The solution required changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



<p>Internally, fee changes were debated from the get-go, but for the first few months, the ECC team focused on additional performance improvements and worked to resolve the issue without fee changes. Later, we decided to implement fee changes to throttle the spam attack.</p>



<p>As users became frustrated with their user experience, some community members became vocal and publicly criticized ECC for not being prepared for the attack and slow to respond.</p>



<p>In February 2023, we were notified by blockchain security firm Halborn of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">vulnerabilities</a> inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains, including Zcash. This was another all-hands-on-deck emergency on top of the wallet performance issues, and as ECC was the only team notified of the vulnerability, we were the only ones who could make the necessary fixes. The coordination of the disclosure and remediation consumed approximately a month of our time.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, ECC as an engineering organization was attempting to do too many things at once: core node maintenance, supporting CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini, backports from Bitcoin, mobile SDKs, mobile wallet applications, and future protocol improvements. ECC <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">restructured</a> in May 2023, which further strained resources temporarily.</p>



 Additional challenges 



 
 At the time, ECC internal communication and project management practices weren’t organized for an Emergency Mode situation. This affected our understanding of priorities and workflow across teams. 



 Before the attack, ECC product strategy focused on adoption first, instead of performance and scalability. Users want new features, and working on improving performance slows feature releases. But the attack took Zcash UX to the limits immediately. 



 Technical debt: We had implemented previous network upgrades with only limited performance improvements. 



 ECC vastly underestimated how long it would take to fix outstanding wallet performance issues. 



 Other technical issues arose that caused delays, such as when speed.z.cash bitrotted and then got deleted while ECC was without a devops manager.&nbsp; 



 The ECC Core team had three different managers during Emergency Mode. 



 Emergency Mode slowed development of our planned wallet product, now known as Zashi. However, we were able to leverage the prototype internally to validate and test SDK improvements. 
 



<p>ECC was lucky to have proactive wallet partners — Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable — who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Timeline and accomplishments 



<p>In all, ECC’s sandblasting response and implementation by third-party wallets consumed about 16 months. By November 2023, Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable were working again (better than ever), and we announced an end to Emergency Mode.</p>



 Timeline 



 
 June 2022: Network spamming began; shielded outputs jumped from a monthly average of 42,600 to 21,622,590 in June alone 



 July 2022: Implemented performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80% and began working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs 



 August 2022: ECC officially entered <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860">Emergency Mode</a>, although we didn’t use that term in public written communications until March 2023; started researching Spend Before Sync 



 September 2022: While working on zcashd and improved mobile sync experience, re-opened research into possible fee change mechanisms (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317">ZIP 317</a>) and syncing efficiencies (<a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">DAGSync</a>/Spend Before Sync) 



 October 2022: Released zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-3-0/">5.3.0</a> with additional performance improvements to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the zcashd node 



 October 2022: Reaffirmed our immediate objectives regarding syncing issues with our wallet SDKs and <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/29">communicated our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode</a> 



 October 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-thirty-year-vision/">Communicated our intent </a>to have wallet performance issues resolved by the end of February 2023 



 October 2022: Changes to zcashd increased its robustness against the attack 



 November 2022: Identified and fixed the last known bugs that were blocking the first phase of SDK releases, continued progress on Spend Before Sync, and began prepping both zcashd and mobile wallets for ZIP 317; squashed the last known librustzcash bugs that were blocking wallet release and completed Android &amp; iOS SDK integration 



 December 2022: Completed the implementation of zcashd optimizations expected to save memory and to reduce orphan rates for miners 



 February 2023: Released zcashd<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-4-0/"> 5.4.0</a> to introduce a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase 



 March 2023: Published an <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">update and release schedule</a> calling for an end to Emergency Mode by the end of May 



 April 2023: ECC released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-5-0/">5.5.0</a> with the completed transaction-fee-structure change (ZIP 317) and infrastructure improvements that laid the groundwork for 5.6.0. 



 May 2023: (Restructuring at ECC) Pushed the release date for zcashd 5.6.0, lightwalletd, and SDKs to mid-June. As zcashd 5.5.0 began to be adopted by miners on the network, the fee structure changes began to blunt the efficacy of the sandblasting attack, reducing the rate of blockchain growth and wallet scanning load. 



 June 2023: Released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-6-0/">zcashd 5.6.0</a>, introducing the functionality necessary for light wallets to access spendable funds without fully scanning the blockchain; included updates to address issues related to the ZIP-317 implementation and privacy policy features. 



 July 2023: Lightwalletd 0.4.14 was released, which meant the mobile wallet SDK was the only outstanding piece in ECC’s plan to resolve wallet performance issues and exit Emergency Mode. At this point, we had hoped to release the SDKs in mid-July. 



 August 2023: By the end of July, the adoption of zcashd 5.5.0 by the network was complete, and network transaction load had returned to pre-NU5 levels. However, the accumulated chain data to this point still presented a problem for wallet scanning, and so to mitigate this issue ECC announced the pre-release availability of the Spend before Sync capability in our mobile SDKs and made this functionality available to wallet developers for testing. Several bugs and UX issues were discovered. Timeline for the SDK releases was shifted to mid-September. 



 September 2023: New bugs, UX issues, and dependencies arose that pushed the SDKs release date out to the end of September. 



 Sept. 26, 2023: ECC <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/162">released the updated mobile SDK 2.0</a> for both iOS and Android developers. This was the final deliverable for exiting Emergency Mode. 



 Nov. 1, 2023: After a month in production, no related, major wallet issues were reported and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/wallet-performance-issues-resolved-ecc-exiting-emergency-mode/">ECC declared an exit from Emergency Mode</a>. 
 



<p>The culmination of our sandblasting response was that third-party Zcash wallets were working again, and future attackers were further disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



 



 The work continues 



<p>NU5 and the sandblasting attack consumed nearly three years. But faced with organized adversity, competing emergencies, and community criticism (some of it warranted), ECC did not stray from our commitment to build. With allies along the way, the community overcame unprecedented technical challenges and resource constraints to make Zcash more resilient, reliable, and safe.</p>



<p>We learned a lot, and although we’d love to step back and take a break, we know the work is more important now than ever. We look forward to distilling the lessons from these experiences in the upcoming retrospective, and we’re honored to continue the effort to build for economic freedom and a world-class Zcash user experience.</p>

  Black Holes and the Intelligence Explosion  <p>Extreme scenarios of AI focus on what is logically possible rather than what is physically possible. What does physics have to say about AI risk?</p>   
	By Dan Roberts	 

Published December 7, 2023
  



 
<p>For better or for worse, physicists will try to understand things that are not obviously physics, with physics. As a <a href="https://danintheory.com/">physicist-turned-AI-founder-and-researcher</a>, I liked to imagine black holes as computers. (In some sense, they’re the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound">largest</a> and maybe the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/49">fastest</a> kind.) In this essay, we consider whether some very special computers will become black holes before they become gods.</p>



 Rising machines 



<p>Artificial intelligence has been a part of speculative fiction long before there was a specific genre called science fiction. AI has also been a part of computer science (though not exclusively so) for (almost) as long as there have been computers. In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop coined the name “artificial intelligence” for the study of machines that think like humans, and set out to solve the task in a <a href="https://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf">single summer</a>.1 &nbsp;That didn’t really work out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">as planned</a>.</p>



<p>One peculiar thing about progress in artificial intelligence is that the science is far outpaced by the technology: AI is still a “black box” that produces magical results such as winning Go moves, poker bluffs, emotional poems, compelling stories and stunning images. It’s easy to read about how to build such a system—though good luck actually doing so without a huge amount of capital and engineering talent—but nobody knows why, for example, a chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT produces this sentence and not that sentence when given a particular prompt.</p>



<p>But if AI is magic, then it can literally do anything … within the realm of logical possibility. Such possibilities include, according to some whose views are becoming <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">mainstream</a>, eliminating all biological life on earth.</p>



<p>How can we possibly evaluate these claims? If AI is a black box, how do we know what’s possible? <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-joe-biden-mission-impossible-ai-tech-order-1850980643">How do we separate sci-fi trope from scientific truth?</a></p>



 
 <p>No, seriously, in their above-linked proposal, they say, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems [of how to make machines think like humans] if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”</p>   
 



 Simulated in our universe 



<p>To start, I think that AI systems are not black boxes and can be understood in the same way that we understand any other physical system—through physics!</p>



<p>Okaaaay, you say, what does the abstract AI model that implements ChatGPT have to do with, say, the thermodynamics of the gas inside a room?</p>



<p>(It’s really funny and great that you picked that particular comparison to physics, I’d say!2)</p>



<p>To determine the properties of the collective gas in the room—its thermodynamics—from the underlying motion of the ~1025 or so gas molecules—their statistical mechanics—we needed physical intuition and a set of mathematical tools. Together, these let us zoom out of the microscopic perspective—where we keep track of their individual positions and velocities—to derive macroscopic features—like temperature, volume and entropy.</p>



<p>Another type of microscopically complicated system is the deep neural network (DNN) architecture that underlies recent successful AI models. These models are built from taking a simple but programmable mathematical operation—the artificial neuron—arranging them in layers to perform many such operations in parallel—and then stacking many layers in series to get a complicated function that can, if asked, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">write a play</a> proving the infinitude of primes in the style of Shakespeare. In this case, the microscopic description of the DNN is the literal code that the AI programmer writes, specifying how input is transformed to output.</p>



<p>For a language model, the text is broken up into pieces called tokens that loosely correspond to words; each token is mapped into a high-dimensional vector; the sequence of high-dimensional vectors are mixed up, re-weighted and biased in various ways according to the precise numerical values of the model’s parameters that are learned over the course of a training process; and finally, the model determines a probability distribution over all possible next words given the input and can generate a new word by sampling from that distribution. However, that code is the answer to the how question—how is an output computed from this input—but not the why question—why this output and not another for this input?</p>



<p>This description of how a chatbot works is like the following (microscopic) way of thinking about the pressure exerted by a gas: pressure is force per area; each individual gas molecule imparts a force on the wall every time it randomly collides with the wall; so, we can understand pressure by tracking the position and velocity of every gas molecule in the room, track their collisions with the walls, and add up all the forces. Analogously, this answers the how question for the gas—how does pressure arise—but not the why question—why does pressure rise when the temperature increases?</p>



<p>To answer the why questions, what we found—and, to be clear, by we here I mean historical physicists—is that for some types of microscopically complicated systems, simple macro-level descriptions emerge as the number of the elementary components of the system grows very large. (For example, we can derive the ideal gas law and show pressure is proportional to temperature by studying the distribution of velocities of the gas.) Moreover, we historical physicists were then able to find iterative refinements to these simple descriptions to understand how changing the size of these systems changes their behavior.3 (In this way, we can systematically model deviations from the ideal gas law.) It turns out, that as a complicated system with a large number of elementary components, deep neural networks also have precisely the right properties that enable such a physics-inspired approach to help us understand why they work as they do.4</p>



<p>But this is just an analogy to physics. There also is an explicit reason why physics matters for simulating an AI on a supercomputer.</p>



<p>To see why, consider that when we—and by we here I mean <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1726542556203483392?s=20">the people of OpenAI</a>—build ChatGPT, we need a physical object to contain ChatGPT’s parameters—the weights and biases that control the behavior of the artificial neurons in the network and thus define and implement ChatGPT—and make them available to process input prompts. This object is (vestigially) called a graphics processing unit—a GPU—and each GPU has a fixed amount of internal memory for storing the parameters of AI models.</p>



<p>To train and then run frontier AI systems like ChatGPT, you must leverage not one, but many such GPUs, organized together into a kind of supercomputer: groups of eight GPUs are assembled and connected together in a type of box called a GPU node so they can communicate at high speeds, and then GPU nodes are further stacked and connected together in a GPU cluster inside of a room known as a data center.</p>



<p>At the risk of being pedantic, let’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/4VjlheyWjFRHi4yxu06nenOa">imagine</a> that that room—the data center that contains the supercomputer running ChatGPT—also contains the gas whose thermodynamics we were just discussing. As anyone who is old enough to have bought a GPU for its original purpose—gaming—knows, GPUs come with fans because they generate a lot of heat. Needless to say, thermodynamics of the gas inside a data center is very much impacted by running ChatGPT!</p>



<p>In other words, AI systems are physical objects, and AI inference plays out in physical space. As such, all purported superintelligences are ultimately subject to the physical limits of computation. That’s the main point of this essay.</p>



 
 One could say that the proverbial “black box” was originally just a (black) box of gas… 



 In physics, this goes by the name of the renormalization group, which is a kind of physical refinement and extension of the central limit theorem in math/statistics. 



 For some details, check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00008">essay,</a> and for a full blueprint of this approach, check out this <a href="https://deeplearningtheory.com/">book.</a>   
 
 







 
 Collapse into a black hole 



<p>To see why this matters, I want you to now take a moment and imagine an AGI with access to unbounded computational resources. To those worried about the risk such systems may pose to humankind, this thought experiment is often tantamount to imagining an all-powerful <a href="https://ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">god</a> that can do anything. For instance:</p>



 
 It could be an information oracle—the ultimate successor to Google—as it would encapsulate and reason about the sum total of human knowledge.5 



 It could be used to “solve” science and create new technologies that we can hardly imagine. 



 It could escape the confines of your laptop by using the internet to synthesize artificial life.6 



 It could capture you inside the confines of your laptop by simulating you so accurately that you’d have no objective way of knowing whether you’re the physical you or the simulated you… and then torture that simulation to make you do its bidding. Maybe it creates one billion such simulations, making it near certain that the you having subjective conscious experiences is being simulated?7&nbsp; 



 (I’ll patiently wait here while you ask ChatGPT for a continuation.) 
 



<p>Where did this list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark">jump the shark</a> for you? As for me, rather than enumerating the possibilities of god, I started by imagining a black hole.</p>



<p>Lurking at the very extreme of any physical system lie black holes. Try to pack too much stuff—matter or energy—into any fixed volume, and you’ll find yourself a black hole; try to gather a large enough collection of identical objects together, and you’ll also find yourself a black hole. Although it may not be intuitive, this also places a limit on the amount of computation you can put together in any region of space.</p>



<p>To see why, consider what would have to happen if we scaled up our AGI system towards unbounded computation: as our hypothetical AGI becomes larger, we’ll need more and more GPUs to physically run it. This means constructing more and more GPU nodes, and networking them together in increasingly bigger GPU clusters.</p>



<p>So, how big of a GPU supercomputer can we—and by we here I mean literally anyone, whether humanly or artificially intelligent—actually make?</p>



 
 And it would not hallucinate facts or sources when providing responses. 



 Example from Yudkowsky’s recent Time <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">essay,</a> where he suggests that “to visualize a hostile superhuman AI …[v]isualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds …allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing.” 



 See e.g. this short <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c5GHf2kMGhA4Tsj4g/the-ai-in-a-box-boxes-you">post</a> by Stuart Armstrong, or perhaps watch some <a href="https://streamberry.tv/">Streamberry.</a> 
 



 Bounding computation 



<p>Untangling various network cables and contemplating a bound, let’s consider the interplay of economic limitations, technological limitations and, finally, physical limitations.</p>



<p>As anyone working in AI right now knows, procuring GPUs is extremely difficult, so even an order for only a finite number of GPUs will still take an undefined amount of time to materialize. These supply issues are of course not fundamental obstructions to building, but they do point to the heart of economic issues in scaling: how much of the world’s resources can actually be put to training a single AI model?</p>



<p>Estimates for the cost of supercomputers capable of training the current state-of-the-art LLMs are of order $100M. If the next-generation cluster <a href="https://twitter.com/pfau/status/1644741636172251137?s=20">costs $1B</a>, how many more generations remain? Sure, some very big (as in tech) corporations will be able to spend $10B, though beyond that, there are only ~150 companies globally with a market cap above $100B, and today’s biggest company, Apple, has a market cap of (only) ~$3T. Beyond even that, while the U.S. government can command more resources than an Elon Musk—though let us ignore the near-impossible amount of coordination it would take to incorporate frontier AI efforts into a functioning government institution—$100B–$1T is a likely overall U.S. maximum.8 Even so, imagine that we—and by we here I mean literally everyone—band together and devote all economic productivity towards building the biggest computer, there’s still not much room until we surpass the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD">gross world product </a>(which itself just crossed $100T in 2022). Altogether, this points to roughly 2-3 non-government iterations left (e.g., OpenAI can release GPT-6 or 7), or 5 all-in-world iterations left, before the end of economic scaling.</p>



<p>Ignoring the economics for the moment, couldn’t we in principle just keep making our supercomputers faster? Following the current gradient of innovation, we can see this strategy at work both at the level of the GPU—where we’ve been squeezing more and more transistors together on the same chip—and at the level of the cluster—where we’ve been networking together more and more GPUs in increasingly larger data centers.9 However, trends of smaller transistors and larger clusters are powered by breakthroughs in technology—stacks of innovations that enable us to engineer smaller transistors or efficiently power and connect clusters of GPUs—that are increasingly on a collision course with fundamental limits of physics.</p>



<p>While it’s more difficult to do in-context napkin-math as we did two paragraphs ago, we can give some intuition. The driving inspiration for faster GPUs is Moore’s law, one version of which—the empirical observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years—has held since its first observation in 1965.10 Unfortunately, such observations are likely to be discontinued: <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">estimates</a> predict that transistors made of silicon can be shrunk only by an additional factor of four before the hot environment of the GPU will begin to create computational errors.11</p>



<p>Moore’s-over, making bigger clusters is more than simply stacking server racks in bigger and bigger buildings: each node needs to be properly powered and cooled and networked.12 The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/06/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">interconnections</a> between GPUs are an essential technology of the supercomputer, since each GPU needs to communicate with every other GPU for a supercomputer-sized AI model to function. Note though that as the earthly footprint of any cluster grows, the typical distance between GPUs is growing with the square-root of that footprint (e.g. the typical linear dimension of the data center): thus, regardless of how good interconnect technology becomes, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1996/08/id/">the speed of light sucks,</a>” and latency is unavoidable in any superbrain.</p>



<p>So at some point (soon) we’ll reach a bound of how transformer-dense a chip can be, and putting more transformer-dense material together in the same room may not help us because the different parts of that material will be increasingly separated in space, making it harder and harder for it to communicate internally. Perhaps we can account for the former limitation by replacing transistors—e.g., move from electronics to photonics—or maybe we can somehow address the latter constraint by inventing better distributed computing algorithms? Now as computational optimists, let’s say we—and by we here I mean … you know what, I suppose that by we here I mean an actual superintelligent AGI—redirected our entire economy to further scaling the AI, converted all of our natural resources—perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">literally the planet</a>—into GPUs, and remedied the technical limitations above. What then?</p>



<p>Unfortunately there’s still a terminal point to this kind of scaling due to a more fundamental kind of physics: if you put enough GPUs together, eventually something very surprising is going to happen; they’re going to collapse into a black hole!13 &nbsp;The gravitational attraction of each of the GPU servers to one another is outrageously tiny, but, if you stick roughly 1037 of them together, they will eventually matter in a very serious way.14</p>



 
 As a point of comparison, the entire U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget">budget</a> for 2024 is (only) $842B. 



 N.B. there are also gradient-free, if you will, <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">innovations</a> to pay attention to. 



 An alternate version of Moore’s law—which observes that every two years the number of transistors doubles at the lowest price per transistor—has already <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">broken down.</a> 



 In technical terms, this is the scale at which <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/106/19/193503/27706/The-fundamental-downscaling-limit-of-field-effect">thermodynamic fluctuations</a> will begin to dominate. 



 Okay here’s some in-footnote napkin-math: a state-of-the-art GPU node (Nvidia’s DGX H100) uses about <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">10 kilowatts</a> of power; ignoring all the other power needs of the data center—e.g., cooling—a cluster of a million such nodes (8,000,000 GPUs)—roughly ~360x larger than the largest <a href="https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding">publicly known</a> AI cluster and a naive sticker price of ~$500B—would require the amount of power needed at peak by all of NYC in the summer. (See, e.g., Table I-3a, Zone J, <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2022-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf/cd2fb218-fd1e-8428-7f19-df3e0cf4df3e">here.</a>) Generating and delivering even that lower-bounded amount of power would be extremely nontrivial. 



 More in-footnote napkin-math: one of Nvidia’s <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">DGX H100 servers</a> contains 8 GPUs, has a volume of 0.15 m3, and weighs 130 kg. Meanwhile, the Schwarzschild radius Rs = 2GNM relates the mass of a black hole to its radius, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, M is the mass, and GN = 6.67 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 is Newton’s gravitational constant. If you try to pack enough mass into a small enough region with linear dimensions R such that R/M = 2GN, you will form a black hole. For any collection of N objects of constant density, the mass of the collection scales like N, but the radius of the collection scales like N1/3. Thus, R/M ~N−2/3, and you will always eventually form a black hole by increasing the number of objects in your collection.&nbsp; 



 For comparison, GPT-4 was trained on an order of only 104 GPUs. I hope it’s obvious, but not even the biggest AGI <a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets">accelerationist</a> is likely to bet on the actual existence of 1037 GPUs. 
 



 Practically speaking 



<p>1037 GPUs is a lot. So is 1036. (And so is 101, if you’re a startup, and 100 if you’re just a person. GPUs are expensive.) So what?</p>



<p>Is there anything on our list of unbounded-compute god-like AGI powers above that we expect is limited at 1036 GPUs but permitted at 1037 GPUs?</p>



<p>Items (i) and (ii) are the entire point of investing in AI today. It would be a tragedy if they were not possible. LLMs with the right guardrails and retrieval abilities already are information oracles. Given that humans can reason and do science—some of us without even any GPUs(!)—it’s not clear that a scaling bound from physics will limit AI.15</p>



<p>The <a href="https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/">original AI doomer concern</a> is born out of the idea of an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604180">intelligence explosion</a>: future AGI systems will have a general intelligence that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems…</p>



<p>This idea is sometimes called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/recursive-self-improvement">recursive self-improvement</a>; it’s really just the basic idea that investments—in this case, in intelligence—compound exponentially.</p>



<p>The point of this discussion is really just to illustrate the point that there’s no such thing as unbounded computation. This cycle will stop. All aspiring AGIs and their companies are first subject to practical constraints on computation—such as raising an enormous amount of capital to build or access a supercomputer—but even if those “prosaic” limitations are overcome, any derived AGI systems are ultimately subject to a variety of fundamental physical constraints.16</p>



<p>So, does a physical limit of computation perspective on AI matter in practice?</p>



 
 If your conception of AI is as new technology—perhaps even the most incredibly transformative technology—then, I think, likely no. 



 If your conception of AI is creating an infinitely powerful god (or maybe summoning a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzb_CSRO-0g">demon)</a>—a technology that may as well be unbounded magic—then, I think, likely yes. 
 



 
 For items (iii) and (iv), I really don’t know. We—you and me(!?)—should do some physics calculations and find out! 



 Not to mention any <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">“artificial” compute bounds</a> that may be put in place. 
 



 Cutting tails 



<p>By discussing a limit and embedding it in physics, I hope to differentiate between AI—the technology—from AI—the religion. Of course, if you are worried about an infinitely-powerful AGI god, then (self-consistent) fiction shapes your thinking about AI: anything permitted by logic raises a valid concern. My point is that that’s far too broad: thoughtful applications of physical constraints can cut off the very long tail of AI risk and restrict us to a more limited set of outcomes.17&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limited, but not any less crucial. For this reason, I think we should focus on the costs and benefits of AI as we would other revolutionary technologies, rather than treating it as something mythical. Demoting AI from god to tech, from religion to science, still leaves us the ability to accelerate both technology and science—right up to the limits imposed by the laws of physics. In other words, the really exciting outcome from our list of (i)-(v) above is the one where we build a toolfor scientific reasoning.</p>



<p>To get there, we’ll need new ideas that go beyond <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">pure compute scaling</a>. For researchers, for engineers, and for founders, that’s a (scientific) reason to be optimistic.</p>



 
 Just so we are clear, we are not claiming that a superintelligent AI would, as a cartoon villain set on world domination, choose to ignore the laws of physics and hubristically find itself confined in a black hole. On the one hand, this would certainly be very funny and a hilarious failure mode for any AI that aspires to commit malfeasance via item (iii) above. On the other hand, if you attempted item (v), as I did, you might have noticed that nowhere among ChatGPT’s very imaginatively-boring answers does it make this point; the current AI is blissfully unaware that its successors may be limited by physics. On our third hand, at the very least we may assume that some future chatbots may read this essay…

We expect to complete integration testing by this week.&nbsp;</p> dApp <p>We made significant progress on our dApp in November. Key achievements include the implementation of transaction tracking in the Wallet Engine and the development of a logic for Know Your Transactions (KYT) attestation for both native tokens and $ZKP tokens on the selected chain.</p><p>We have also introduced Commitment Message Encryption to handle sent and received UTXO's commitment hashes, which are critical for rebuilding past transaction history. Our team is further on track to complete updates for Stages 1 and Stage 2 by December 6th, enhancing our dApp's functionality and user experience.</p><p>UI/UX DesignThe community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Roadmap for December&nbsp; <p>We’re looking to launch Stage 3 and Stage 4 in December.

 The integration is supported by an automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, that enables simple yield opportunities on day one for all users on EON. &nbsp; 



<p>The Horizen ecosystem is excited to announce its integration with <a href="https://docs.ascent.exchange/">Ascent Exchange</a> with simple yield opportunities via <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vault</a>. This integration is set to significantly enhance the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> platform’s capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, bringing a new level of innovation and efficiency to the industry.</p>



 A New Chapter in DeFi: Horizen EON Meets Ascent Exchange 



<p>This integration represents a major step forward for the Horizen EON ecosystem. By joining forces with Ascent Exchange, Horizen EON leverages Ascent’s expertise in decentralized exchange operations, propelling our platform to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Moreover, this integration underlines a shared vision for a unified and interoperable digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can flourish across various platforms.</p>



<a href="https://ascent.exchange"></a>



<blockquote>
<p></p>



<p>“Our integration with Ascent Exchange is a testament to Horizen EON’s commitment to interoperability and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent’s expertise, coupled with Horizen’s EVM-compatible platform, marks a significant milestone towards creating a more interconnected and robust DeFi ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent Exchange’s early adoption of the Horizen EON platform is set to redefine the DeFi trading space.”&nbsp;</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



 Simple Yield Opportunities on Ascent Exchange via ICHI Vaults 



  
<p>Ascent Exchange was launched on day one with the support of an automated liquidity management protocol called <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vaults</a>. </p>



<p>This will enable liquidity providers to earn yield with their favorite tokens on Ascent Exchange. Each ICHI Vault allows a depositor to deposit a single token which will then be used as liquidity in an underlying liquidity pool. The Vault prioritizes deposit token yield while protecting from impermanent loss. ICHI Vaults will be launched for a wide range of assets supported by Ascent Exchange.</p>
 <a href="https://ichi.org/"></a> 



 The Ascent Exchange Impact on Horizen EON 



<p>The integration of Ascent Exchange into the Horizen EON ecosystem is expected to bring numerous benefits. As the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, Ascent Exchange is poised to establish a new benchmark in DeFi trading. This strategic move by Ascent Exchange is anticipated to attract a substantial volume of trading activities and users, thereby reinforcing Horizen EON’s position as a leading platform for developers and DeFi enthusiasts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As Ascent Exchange embarks on its journey with Horizen EON. We are positioned at the forefront of decentralized exchanges, leveraging a first-mover advantage that sets the stage for unparalleled innovation. </p>



<p>Horizen EON’s exceptional scalability and efficiency empower us to process an increased volume of transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, revolutionizing our operational capabilities. Fundamental to our ethos, the robust security protocols of Horizen EON ensure an unwaveringly secure and trustworthy environment for our users. Embracing the shared values of decentralization and innovation, we join hands with the vibrant Horizen community, further enriching our community-centric approach. </p>



<p>This pivotal shift not only reflects our evolution but also embodies our commitment to exploring new horizons in decentralized finance, inviting our community to be a part of this exciting journey.”</p>
-Bones, Founding member of Ascent Exchange</blockquote>

  Partnering with Squint: Instructions for the Real World  <p>Devin and his team are bringing cutting-edge AR to the factory floor.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a>	 

Published November 29, 2023
  



Team Squint



 
<p>Every once in a while, technology brings us a magical moment of delight. I remember the first time I used an Apple AirTag. The navigational arrows, haptic feedback and “10 ft away” message created a simple, intuitive way to find my erstwhile keys—and effectively bridged the gap between my mobile device and the real world.&nbsp;</p>



Magic



<p>Squint brings that same Apple-like magic to industrial work. Much in the same way an AirTag can help you find your keys, Squint is a mobile app for the industrial floor—that shows workers step-by-step instructions for how to use machinery.</p>



More magic, on the factory floor



<p>Imagine you’re a worker in a high-stakes industrial setting, navigating a maze of complex equipment on a factory floor. You’ve just been asked to switch production lines because the factory is understaffed, but you’re not familiar with the new machine you need to use. Your options are: a) ask the worker who’s been at the factory for 10 years and knows how to use everything—but they’re super busy, b) read the paper manual—but it’s buried in a binder in the storage room and difficult to find, or c) just wing it—but that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Squint, you have a better option: simply point your mobile device at the equipment to get instant help. Teams can document and record every step of an important procedure, then the app guides workers through it in the real world, augmented with video and all the institutional knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. You can even use it to check logs, leave notes for the next shift and report maintenance issues. It’s the digital equivalent of the person who’s been at the factory for 10 years, hovering over your shoulder, helping you out.</p>







<p>As America faces an industrial labor shortage, Squint also offers a sorely needed boost in manufacturing productivity and worker retention. Manufacturing is the nation’s fifth largest employment category and growing, as more companies move operations to the U.S. from Asia. However, a quarter of industrial workers are older than 55 and will soon retire, leaving a widening skill gap behind. To bridge it, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Michelin, JTEKT, Siemens and Volvo are using Squint to train and retain employees, increase productivity and ensure safety. Colgate-Palmolive, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhGSvkapruc">found</a> procedures were completed 50% faster with Squint—regardless of a worker’s experience level with the equipment. They also saw greater accuracy and reduced training times, and unlocked new insights through Squint’s built-in analytics.</p>



<p>When I first met Squint founder and CEO Devin Bhushan in 2015, he was a 23-year-old software engineer at Yahoo, tasked with writing the Flurry mobile app all by himself. Despite having no prior iOS experience, he did just that—and helped Yahoo’s customers understand their product analytics. He later joined Splunk, where he led the mobile AR team that made data visible for industrial companies. There, he was inundated by requests from customers to see not just their Splunk data, but all their data—and thus Squint was born. Devin’s experience across mobile, AR and product analytics makes him uniquely suited to lead Squint and pioneer this new category of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia had the privilege of leading Squint’s $3.5M seed round earlier this year, and we got a front-row seat to the team’s incredible pace of progress when Devin and founding PM Dylan Conway joined us for Sequoia <a href="http://arc.sequoiacap.com">Arc</a>, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Over the last six months, Squint’s tremendous market pull gave us the conviction to lean in and lead the Series A.</p>



Squint Founding PM Dylan Conway and Founder and CEO Devin Bhushan at Sequoia Arc



<p>We’re thrilled to be in business with Devin and his team, and excited for the possibilities they’ll continue to unlock with AR and AI. While today Squint is focused on industrial use cases, we can imagine the app someday becoming the instruction manual for any device or place—from your new coffee maker or camera to your Airbnb stay. This is only the beginning for Squint, and we’re excited to be their partners for the journey ahead.</p>

Here’s a deep dive into stage 3 development:&nbsp;</p> Circuits <p>We’ve updated Stage 1 and Stage 2 circuits following general updates and have delivered the Balance checker unit test.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Core dApp UI is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts  <p>We’ve successfully completed all unit tests. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p> dApp <p>We've made significant progress on our dApp this week. Key achievements include the implementation of transaction tracking in the Wallet Engine and the development of a service function for Stealth Executor Address Calculation. Additionally, we have updated the PRP convert function signature and added zAsset encryption for message type 08. Our team is also on track to complete updates for Stages 1 and 2 by December 1st, enhancing our dApp's functionality and user experience.</p> UI/UX Design <p>On the UI/UX front, we have built a new History page to improve activity tracking. We've further approved and merged an enhanced visual layer for the deposit flow and implemented a logic to preset assets for deposit from the dashboard. The Split functionality for the zZKP special deposit flow has been completed, alongside the addition of new UI components and a Token select dialog. The zAsset page has also received significant updates, further refining the user experience.</p> Community Questions&nbsp; <p>What is the team building?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The team is working on building the V1 mainnet and all its components.</p><p><br>What happens after V1’s into production?</p><p>The product roadmap <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/roadmap?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> discusses the plan post-V1 release.&nbsp;</p><p></p> <p>About Panther</p><p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p></p><p></p>

<p>Multi-signature structures have been around for a while and are securing billions of euros in digital assets. But how do they work? And what are the main differences with a simple single-signature structure?</p>



<p>In this article we will discuss what multi-signature structures are, the use cases of multi-signature structures, and how multi-signature structures work.</p>



 What is a multi-signature structure? 



<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



 
 Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions. 



 Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance. 



 Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud. 



 Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval. 



 Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters. 



 Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings. 
 



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>







<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>







<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.

 ZenIP 42206 is open for voting. All ZEN holders have until 11/23/2023 00:00 AM UTC (11/22/2023 7:00 PM ET) to cast their vote via <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">Snapshot</a>. 
<br>
<p>We’ve noticed that regardless of the voting instructions and documentation that have been provided and positive sentiment towards this proposal, some of the community members may be still experiencing technical difficulties in the voting process. </p>
<p>We have identified four blockers that may be preventing some community members from being able to vote easily. </p>
<p>Here are the solutions for each of these blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1) Voting from a multi-sig wallet 
<p>If you have ZEN on a multi-sig wallet, you are not able to link it to Horizen EON as this is currently not supported. Multi-sig wallet users can still vote by proving the ownership of their wallet that contains ZEN. Follow these steps:</p>
<br>
 
 You have until the last block before 11/22/2023 08:00 PM UTC (11/22/2023 3:00 PM ET) to send a transaction of 100 zatoshi (0.00001 $ZEN) to this address znmJjX4QyLeZJFawTCP35T7tqfdhNQMNZEJ (Horizen faucet) with the multisignature address you’d like to link. 
 <a href="https://forms.gle/fC24DFkMjPZiZu3dA">Submit this form </a>to claim your multi-sig wallet address before 11/22/2023 09:00PM UTC (11/22/2023 4:00PM ET). 
 Right after that, we will collect, share and apply the allowlist of multi-sig wallets eligible to vote. 
 







 2) Voting from a non-Sphere wallet 



<p>If you have your ZEN in a wallet other than Sphere, such as Arizen or a hard wallet, you can sign a message right from the application/hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your wallet doesn’t support signing custom messages, you can paste your private key at <a href="https://getzen.cash/sign/">https://getzen.cash/sign/</a>, and produce the signature. The procedure is the following:</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your private key making sure you are in a private location.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your EON wallet address, and press on “Sign”.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Copy the signature you have generated.</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a>.</p>



<p>NOTE: Make sure no one can look at your screen, you may expose your private key. Do it at your own risk.</p>



 3) Voting with ZEN staked on a Horizen Node 



<p>If you have ZEN staked on a Horizen node, you can just sign the message with the command:</p>



<p>zen-cli signmessage %ZEN_ADDRESS% “%YOUR_EON_ACCOUNT%”</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a></p>



 4) Voting with ZEN stored on an exchange&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to vote using a ZEN balance that is stored on an exchange at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOTE: miners may experience a discrepancy between the balance available on the explorer and the one available as voting power. That’s because the new Coinbase output is not seen until it’s involved in the first transaction.</p>

<p></p><p>London, 20th November 2023 – The GBBC Digital Finance (GDF) team led engagements around the world last week. Whilst our policy team and Chair of the Board soft-launched GDF’s Digital Finance All-Party Parliamentary Group in London at Digital Assets Week, GDF CEO, Emma Joyce and GDF Head of Community, Madeleine Boys, made their way to Asia to join many industry leaders, regulators, and policymakers at Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF).</p>
<p>As a prelude to the Festival, Elevandi – a not-for-profit organisation set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – curated and hosted Elevandi Insights, a day of thoughtful roundtable discussions focused on digital finance. AI and Financial Inclusion were both important themes of the day, alongside tokenisation, payments, and digital financial market infrastructure as prevailing discussion topics which set the tone for SFF.</p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised money took the centre stage for the Festival’s payments discussions. Several panels mentioned the crucial role of interoperability in the evolution of CBDCs. Speakers also emphasised its broader application in asset tokenisation, which was highlighted from both the public and private sector – find out more from MAS’ recent <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/guardian/interlinking-networks-technical-paper-vfinal.pdf">“Interlinking Networks Technical Whitepaper</a>”.<br><br>Central banks examined the role of CBDCs as drivers of financial inclusion and vehicles to minimise prudential risks once the onset technological risks are overcome. Large financial institutions and private sector representatives highlighted the importance of tokenised money – whether it be in the form of a CBDC or other forms of tokenised money – as the key to settlement as well as the broader scalability of the industry.</p>
<p>Building on these discussions, MAS published the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/project-orchid/orchid-blueprint-final.pdf">Orchid Blueprint</a> outlining the necessary technological infrastructure for future digital currency transactions in Singapore. This blueprint, derived from insights gained during the Project Orchid industry trials, identifies four essential building blocks to support the effective use of digital money in Singapore:</p>
 
 Settlement Ledger: This component is designed to record digital money transfers, featuring native programmability and the atomic settlement of digital tokens. 
 Tokenisation Bridge: Serving as a vital link, this bridge connects existing account-based settlement systems with ledgers that are compatible with tokenised forms of digital money. 
 Programmability Protocol: The blueprint proposes a common protocol, known as Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling the specification of conditions for the use of digital money. 
 Name Service: To enhance accessibility and verification, a Name Service is recommended, translating between complex wallet addresses and alternative name identifiers that are readable and meaningful. 
 
<p>The importance of resilient digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) emerged as another theme in these discussions, emphasising its role as a key enabler to the broad adoption and growth of digital assets. The value of open and interoperable networks among global banks and regulators cannot be understated, and the SFF set the scene for another major announcement in this area.</p>
<p>MAS also unveiled a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiativeshttps:/www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives">Project Guardian</a>, which will delve into promising use cases of asset tokenisation on a public blockchain. The most significant aspect is the introduction of new initiative called Global Layer One (GL1), conceived as an open, digital infrastructure fostering cross-border transactions and global liquidity pools. Major institutions such as BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, DBS, and MUFG will participate. This marks a pivotal step toward integration across the entire capital markets value chain, encompassing listing, distribution, trading, settlement, and asset servicing. Key highlights include:</p>
 
 J.P. Morgan and Apollo are collaborating on leveraging digital assets to facilitate more seamless investment and management of discretionary portfolios and alternative assets. The collaboration also involves automated portfolio rebalancing and customization at scale, promising time savings and a reduction in manual processes related to asset servicing. 
 BNY Mellon and OCBC are engaged in a trial for a cross-border FX payment solution, aiming to facilitate secure and interoperable payment solutions across diverse networks. 
 
<p>GDF convened its members its members together on two distinct occasions, both characterised by the same positive atmosphere that resonated with the overall optimistic outlook of SFF.</p>
<p>Our dinner, which we hosted in partnership with Hogan Lovells, focused on the challenges to building digital trust, and facilitating tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), and the role regulators and policymakers have to play in balancing innovation with safe regulatory frameworks. Ken Coghill from the DFSA and Danny Russell from the Bank of England joined us and shared some opening remarks on behalf of their agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lunch, which we hosted in partnership with Clifford Chance, brought together technologists and policy experts for a comprehensive discussion on challenges and essential components for institutionalising digital assets, emphasising ongoing technical efforts to enable financial institutions to leverage public blockchain technology. Malcolm Wright, OKX and former VARA regulator, and John Ho, Standard Chartered, opened the lunch with some optimistic remarks about the&nbsp;direction of travel for industry, with a keen focus on the APAC region.</p>
<p>We could not be more grateful for the continued support of our association’s mission to promote best standards of practice for the digital asset ecosystem, and look forward to continuing to bring together and building our community in the APAC region.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to last week. Here's everything that transpired at Panther last week:</p> Marketing Updates  Extension of the Advanced Staking Program <p>Advanced Staking V4 is now live for the next four months and $ZKP holders can now stake their tokens again. This was made possible due to the successful approval of PIP-19 and the commendable efforts of our <a href="https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/pull/12/commits/eb1a943766befac076922ffd5f7d1d1ceac616fa?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community members</a> for updating related smart contracts and deploying a new frontend on IPFS. You can learn more about how to stake your $ZKP <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/staking/advanced-staking-v0.5?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at the European Blockchain Convention <p>Panther Protocol’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, joined a panel discussion on web3 privacy along with leaders from Secret Network and Zama at the European Blockchain Convention. This panel was part of the Secret Soiree side event on the final day of the convention. You can watch a recording of the session below.</p> Product Updates  Stage 2 Developments  Recharge Functionality <p>Making further advancements on Stage 2 of the protocol, the development of recharge functionality for Protocol Rewards has been completed and will be announced separately once the vesting of $tZKP is configured. The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about our reward structure <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a></p> Stage 3 Developments  Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3 and the team will perform the unit testing of the Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker this week. Panther Core dApp user interface is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts <p>The main transaction function of the Pool contract which is the foundation for the stage 3 development has been implemented. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p> UI/UX Design <p>A new version of Panther V1 Design is being worked on and the community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Community Questions <p>When will the team publish the updated roadmap?</p><p>The team plans to release an updated product roadmap this week. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

      The Next Billion Developers         
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 





Published November 15, 2023
        The developer revolution will be as important as the AI revolution.      



 
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is Silicon Valley’s latest obsession. Brilliant minds like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/elon-musk-reveals-xai-efforts-predicts-full-agi-by-2029/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman</a> believe achieving AGI is not just likely, but inevitable. Others disagree. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_i-think-the-phrase-agi-should-be-retired-activity-6889610518529613824-gl2F/">Yann LeCun</a>, one of the godfathers of machine learning, has said “there is no such thing as AGI.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea">Jack Clark</a> of Anthropic has described the “breathless enthusiasm” for AGI as a “misplaced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2DaQxTihc">religious impulse</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a lightning rod, AGI captures our imagination. AGI promises <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-altman-on-the-a-i-revolution-trillionaires/id1548604447?i=1000525043188">free education and housing</a>, the eradication of poverty with universal basic income, and a reallocation of human capital to science and art. These are worthwhile objectives.</p>



<p>But what if AGI is a distraction? What if there’s another path to this same future—one that does not require a technological leap of faith and is already underway?</p>



<p>There are more developers today than ever before. And the population is starting to snowball. Our thesis is that bringing 1B developers into the software economy could rival AGI in terms of its economic impact.1</p>



<p>Software engineering is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. If we can make it even more widely available—assisted and accelerated by AI—it could result in the automation of many non-tech industries, creating an economic surplus.</p>



<p>But is this target of 1B developers really achievable? Isn’t software engineering too hard to teach to so many people? And what would we do with all those developers?</p>



<p>Let’s start with the goal of 1B developers. This year, the developer population crossed <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">100M</a>, up from 24M when Github first started reporting the metric in 2017.2 In Github’s recently published <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">State of the Octoverse</a> report, they shared that the global developer population grew 26% in the last year. Github added 21M new accounts in 2022.</p>



<p>We have three reasons to believe hypergrowth in the developer population will persist.<br></p>



<p>First, it’s been getting much easier to become a developer, and we expect this flywheel to continue. In just the last decade, Cloud abstracted away the server. Databases like MongoDB and Postgres simplified the back-end. Vercel and React reshaped the front-end. The best software engineers continue to focus on improving the discipline itself. By iteratively building better and better abstractions, software engineers have created a flywheel that reduces complexity while increasing potency. As a result, a 12 year-old in India can now build a web app in a matter of days, something that would have taken a professional developer weeks before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, market forces continue to attract more and more young people to become software engineers. Already, the best and brightest are disproportionately learning to code. Rather than dampening as more talent has entered the field, the economic returns to software engineering only seem to be expanding. What this means is that the productivity of software engineers, and the applicability of their skills, is expanding faster than the supply.</p>



<p>Third, AI has been an unanticipated accelerator. Today, <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/">Github Copilot</a> is writing 46% of users’ code. <a href="https://zapier.com/ai">Zapier</a> enables developers to build automations with text descriptions. <a href="https://openinterpreter.com/">Open Interpreter</a> is turning the command line into a chat interface. With AI copilots, we may eventually be able to program computers using natural language alone.</p>



<p>Growth in the developer population enables the software economy to broaden its scope and impact. For example, companies like Stripe, Twilio and Plaid have created essential building blocks for payments, telecommunications and banking. Traditional companies in mature industries are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/despite-mass-layoffs-led-by-meta-its-still-hard-to-fill-tech-jobs.html">bringing on</a> more and more software engineers to drive internal digitization. Newer startups are also taking software and AI and applying these technologies to sectors like mining, robotics, construction, accounting and legal. The opportunity with 1B developers is to drive automation not just in the digital economy, but in the physical economy as well.</p>



<p>Unlike AGI, the promise of 1B developers is not about eliminating work altogether. Rather, it is about taking our resources—human resources—and leveraging them to have more and more impact. Thus, the story of the coming decades may be about the increased power of AI. But more quietly, the methodical march of the developer revolution will continue.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/replit-remix-the-internet">Amjad Masad</a> was one of the first visionaries to articulate this goal and has been at its forefront

      Finding Her Place in the Sun         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published November 14, 2023
        Lynn Jurich’s unwavering determination to unlock cleaner, greener energy powered the rise of Sunrun.      



 
<p>In March 2023, solar entrepreneur Lynn Jurich took the stage for the Stanford Graduate School of Business’s Climate, Business &amp; Innovation Summit. In the 15 years that had passed since she had attended the school herself, solar energy had come of age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in history, the cost of solar energy has fallen below that of fossil fuels, and Sunrun, which Jurich co-founded in 2007, is now the largest installer of residential solar panels in the U.S., with more than 800,000 customers in 20 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. Her unwavering determination to change energy infrastructure (and the world) is what brought Jurich back to GSB that day. But these achievements, and the survival of her company, were never a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich took her audience back to Sunrun’s early days, to a time when consumer solar was still the wheelhouse of “hippies and hobbyists,” and installation and hardware were expensive. Back then, Jurich and her co-founders had waded through the complexities of the green energy space without a clear sense for how to make their business model, much less the world, sustainable. And they were perilously close to burning through their venture capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our initial vision was that we would be pretty asset-light,” Jurich told the audience. “The existing solar installers out there would be doing the construction and selling to homeowners. We would raise the capital, and own and monitor the systems. So we’d only need a few employees. But we were wrong. Very, very wrong.”</p>



 



<p>The sun had already set, but the teenage Jurich refused to go back inside without sinking a few more shots. She wouldn’t feel content calling it a day until she was, according to her sister Tracy, “basically shooting NBA free-throw percentages.” Focus, which in this case earned Jurich a spot on the Pac-10 recruiting list for basketball by 8th grade, had been Jurich’s speciality since kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At five years old, Jurich had started writing to-do lists. “My list would be like, ‘invent something.’ Or, ‘make a scientific discovery,’” she remembers. At age six, reading biographies became her pastime of choice, an activity that suited her introverted nature. She’d go to the public library in her neighborhood near Point Defiance, a lush peninsula jutting into the Puget Sound, and work her way through their nonfiction section. She had lots of things she wanted to accomplish, and was looking for proofs of concept. “I was always attracted to people who mastered their craft,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her early favorites centered on strong women: Florence Nightingale, Betsy Ross, Anne Frank. But fittingly, no biography captivated her more than that of Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb (and 1,000 or so other things). In a prescient 1931 exchange between Edison and Henry Ford, Edison notes, “We should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind and tide.” (According to recent sources, the sun produces enough sunlight to power Earth’s electricity needs for a year every hour.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But truly mastering one’s craft was no easy feat—Jurich had internalized this from her biography obsession. It required resolve and concentration, which Jurich maintained through high school and then college at Stanford, where she earned top honors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating, Jurich landed a competitive role at a prestigious private equity firm. Her job was to get in front of entrepreneurs by any means necessary—cold-calling, attending the same conferences as them, befriending their assistants so that she could sit next to them on a plane—and evaluate them for potential investment opportunities. This was daunting for the self-described “strong introvert,” but once she worked up the nerve she found that pushing herself had an important upside. Like her biography kick on steroids, she got to observe dozens of highly accomplished individuals modeling potential paths to success, an experience that made it clear to her that “if there’s a good company out there, it’s going to get funded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After three years working on the investor side, she needed no further proof of concept. “It was just very clear to me that I wanted to be on the entrepreneur side,” says Jurich. This hard-earned clarity led her to return to Stanford for business school.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“How do we get people to give solar a shot?” It was January 2007, and this was the question Jurich, Ed Fenster, a Stanford GSB classmate, and Nat Kreamer, a childhood friend of Fenster’s, had been debating for weeks over pizza and Diet Coke in the living room of Fenster’s San Francisco apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’d filed the paperwork for their company Sunrun just a few days earlier, officially making this question of particular interest for the group. Jurich was fresh off a summer banking internship in Shanghai, where she had been struck by the density of construction and urban energy infrastructure. She couldn’t stop thinking about clean energy and how to make continued infrastructure development more sustainable. Kreamer was recently back from a tour in Afghanistan and motivated to seek energy independence after fighting in a war he’d concluded was mostly about fossil fuels. Fenster had connected the dots, uniting the team in his apartment to solve the challenge of solar expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fueled by cheesy carbohydrates and artificial sweetener, they concluded that the real opportunity lay not in developing cleantech, but in deploying it. “We saw that VC money was already being put toward making solar panels cheaper. We were quite certain that innovation was going to happen,” says Jurich. “So we thought, ‘Why don’t we solve the problem of convincing people to give solar panels a shot, and figuring out how to interface with the electric grid?’ That was gonna be the bigger challenge and the bigger area to add value.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer they settled on was to lower the barrier to solar adoption as much as possible for homeowners. Sunrun would offer ‘solar-as-a-service,’ leasing solar panels with a small upfront cost at a time when owning and installing one’s own solar panels was still logistically challenging, and prohibitively expensive for many. “The business model innovation was that we would put solar panels on your rooftop for very little money, and you would sign a 20-year contract to buy the electricity from us for X cents per kilowatt hour,” says Jurich. “So it was a long-term contract for us, the customer didn’t have to spend the money up front, and they could get cheaper power. Win-win all the way around.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going the consumer route, as opposed to leasing solar panels to corporations, was an added challenge, however. It meant figuring out how to install and operate panels on houses of all shapes and sizes in varying conditions around the country. But if they could manage all of that, Jurich believed this approach would ultimately make a more defensible business. “We believed costs would hit grid parity first at the consumer level because consumers pay the most money for power,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By narrowing their focus to homeowners, the founders were actually thinking bigger—not only would they be spreading clean energy, they could reduce inefficiencies in energy infrastructure. “What’s really innovative about solar is you can use an existing roof,” says Jurich. “You don’t have to acquire land. You don’t have to build big transmission lines. You don’t have to interrupt the ecosystem.” The value prop and climate impact seemed undeniable. They’d soon find out it wasn’t such an easy sell.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>Jurich’s voice was hoarse from hollering at passersby. This was her third county fair in as many days, dusty and hot, and a far cry from her time in private equity traveling on private jets (which, at least on an environmental level, felt like karmic justice). Again, Jurich had found herself in the challenging situation of having to talk to strangers. This time, Jurich was donning her company swag (an oversized white tee that read, “A penny for your watts?”) and standing next to an oversized pumpkin. She was desperate to make a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fenster, they decided early on, would take the role of CEO and focus on raising capital; Kreamer, as president, would take on installations, billing, and system monitoring; and it was up to Jurich as COO to build out their business pipeline (read: sales). She had deduced that the quickest way to sell consumers on solar panels was to go straight to the source. “This was 2007. There weren’t a lot of people online searching, you know, ‘I want a solar energy system,’” says Jurich. “So we were like, ‘Where do you find a homeowner who would be interested in Sunrun?’ I decided to go to places with lots of homes and lots of sun.”</p>



<p>From the rare fair-goer who agreed to chat, Jurich gleaned that “going green” still wasn’t enough—they were willing to consider solar only if it saved them money. Even after Sunrun’s upfront costs (initially about $10,000 for installs, still well below the cost of buying and installing one’s own panels), Sunrun would save them money, but only over the course of years—a commitment most consumers weren’t willing to make with a startup that had existed for just a few months. “What I always told them was, ‘If someone came to your house and said they would install a gasoline tank, and you could buy gas for $1 per gallon for the next 20 years, would you do it? That’s what we’re offering: Electricity at a fixed price for 20 years and it’s cheaper,’” says Jurich. “People thought it was too good to be true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After dozens of refusals, Jurich finally caught the attention of a woman named Sue who ran a trucking company. Jurich made her pitch, highlighting the fixed, long-term rate, which was much lower than traditional electrical costs. She told Sue that Sunrun would own, operate and maintain the solar panels on her roof, but that they outsourced sales and installation to existing solar installers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sue, excited to bet on a young female entrepreneur, was convinced. And Jurich, after months in the summer heat hawking her solar wares, made her third sale (Sunrun’s first sale was to Fenster, and the second was to his therapist). “Seeing that there was actually consumer interest in this helped me so much,” says Jurich, “It gave me the conviction that this was gonna work, that all the hustle was worth it. That conviction can get you through some pretty hard times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hard times turned out to be just around the corner, and she’d need all the conviction she could muster.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“We’re done for,” Jurich thought as she read the headlines announcing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Bank. It was September 2008, and Sunrun was desperately in need of funding—money that suddenly seemed entirely unattainable.</p>



<p>Sunrun’s early sales had put its business model to the test. Since the company was covering most of the upfront purchase and installation costs, its ability to sell was contingent upon its ability to raise money. But banks wanted proof of sales before lending. “We had a chicken and an egg problem,” says Jurich. The co-founders were forced to use their seed money—a few million they’d managed to raise from contacts in private equity and banking—to finance their earliest installs. But with dwindling funds and no guarantee that they could secure investments to stay afloat, “it made for an extremely stressful time,” Jurich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They had finally managed to raise $12 million in June 2008, a lifeline as sales were starting to take off—but nothing close to what they needed to scale. Just as new term sheets began to come their way, Lehman Brothers went under, signaling a complete collapse of the financing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, another bank pulled out of negotiations. Sunrun’s point of contact would be fired, or the entire financial institution would dissolve. But then, in November 2008, there came a flicker of hope. The Sunrun founders received a callback from U.S. Bank, the rare financial institution that hadn’t been decimated by the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this was likely their only shot, the founders negotiated a deal they hoped would be hard to refuse. “We were panicking,” Jurich says. “But at the same time, we were like ‘We are going to close this deal because we have no choice.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2008, Sunrun closed a $40 million debt financing round from U.S. Bank. “Looking back, we call this moment our big awakening,” Jurich says. Fenster agrees. “Had we not gotten that deal,” he says, “the company might not have made it another four months.”</p>



 



<p>Six years after bringing Sunrun back from the brink, Jurich’s sense of solar inevitability was feeling like less of a moonshot with every passing day. For one, Sequoia became a believer (and led Sunrun’s Series C), as did traditional energy giant, PG&amp;E, who had invested an additional $100 million to finance installations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which isn’t to say things were entirely sunny. Solar gaining traction threatened most other incumbent utilities, who did all they could to block Sunrun’s growth through lobbying. And then there were the government subsidies—hugely positive in the ways they pushed growth in a sustainable direction, but wildly destabilizing from a business perspective, with one subsidy or regulation unlocking a market one month, and an expiring subsidy making another disappear the next.</p>



<p>In 2009, the Obama stimulus package extended a solar tax credit to homeowners who bought their own system. This lowered the purchase price of solar panels overall, which made it harder for Sunrun to convince homeowners to buy into their leasing model, in particular paying for the company’s upfront installation costs. “That blew up our whole transaction model,” says Fenster. Jurich and Fenster, by then co-CEOs (Kreamer left the company in 2009), decided they needed to eliminate upfront costs entirely in order to remain competitive. To compensate, they increased their new customers’ monthly payments while still managing to stay below traditional utility rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their new no-upfront pricing structure made it easier than ever for homeowners to give solar a shot, but not enough to edge out their competition. Elon Musk’s SolarCity had just gone public and was starting to outpace Sunrun. And SolarCity had something crucial that Sunrun lacked: their own operations and installation capabilities. Seven years in, Sunrun was still essentially operating as a management and financing company, relying on third parties for construction, installation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they wanted to scale, Sunrun would have to take over the third-party labor themselves. This, of course, required a huge amount of capital that Sunrun didn’t have. But, no stranger to complex negotiations, Jurich and Fenster managed to secure a massive acquisition of their largest installations partner, REC Solar’s Residential Division (AEE Solar and SnapNrack), in an all-equity deal as a workaround. Overnight, Sunrun grew from 150 employees to 550. That same year, signaling just how much Jurich had grown as a leader since her days of reluctant cold-calling, Fenster stepped down as co-CEO of Sunrun, and Jurich stepped into the role. “Lynn was a better head for the company than I was,” he says. “There are really smart people who are excellent at making decisions but who aren’t great at managing people. Lynn’s unique in that she can do both.”</p>



<p>Poised for expansion, and in the wake of SolarCity’s IPO, the pressure was on for Sunrun to follow suit. “I knew we needed to go public,” Jurich says. “There were a handful of solar IPOs that had just happened that we didn’t believe in, and we thought they were gonna spook the market. So I didn’t really feel that I had the luxury to slow down at any point in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even when she learned she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich’s daughter Blythe was born just a few weeks before Sunrun’s IPO on August 5, 2015, and was in Jurich’s arms when she rang the Nasdaq bell. “I got on a conference call the day I got home from the hospital, and my mom moved in and helped me,” says Jurich. (While Jurich, who had her second child in 2018, didn’t take maternity leave, she expanded maternity leave benefits for the rest of the company, signaling that she didn’t expect others to make the same choice that she had.)</p>



<p>Sunrun’s share price dropped roughly 20% on its first day of trading, which only fed Jurich’s resolve to be as present at the company as possible. She started her investor roadshow when Blythe was just five weeks old, bringing her mother and a nurse along for support. “I was constantly pumping and shuttling milk back and forth between hotels and hedge fund offices,” Jurich says. “It was exhausting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2017, Sunrun had rebounded from its post-IPO dip to become the largest publicly traded rooftop solar company in the U.S. following Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. After years of fundraising, surviving a recession, battling incumbent utilities, navigating company altering climate legislation, IPOing and becoming a mother, Jurich felt like things were finally in a good place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s when the Wall Street Journal article came out.</p>

<p>In the May 2017 piece, former Sunrun employees claimed the company hadn’t reported order cancellations that may have affected sales data in financial disclosures leading up to the IPO. Jurich denied all wrongdoing, claiming the journalism was “not representative of the company and suspect.” Despite Sunrun’s assurances, the article triggered a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) of Sunrun and its competitor, SolarCity. Sunrun’s stock bottomed out. And shareholders filed a class action suit against Sunrun.</p>



<p>Jurich remembers this time, as her company’s reputation and her own integrity were called into question, as one dominated by a profound sense of grief and powerlessness. Ever since her days of writing her first to-do lists, she’d been laser focused on success. But suddenly, no amount of resolve, no degree of hustle could change the way the world perceived her and her company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, months after the initial article broke, Sunrun released a statement saying that after conducting an internal audit, the SEC didn’t find any evidence of manipulated sales data. Still, the company ended up making a $30 million settlement with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Sunrun’s name had technically been cleared, in the weeks following, Jurich continued to struggle emotionally from the toll the probe had taken. For the woman who had defined so much of her life by her achievements, this failure—which she certainly saw it as—felt existential. She faced a choice: “Your options are either to crumble because you can’t deal with it, or to figure out how to keep going and operate at a higher level,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time, she decided that “higher level” didn’t mean working harder. It meant “reflecting on my values, starting a meditation practice, keeping my fitness going, and not caring too much about what other people think,” says Jurich. She was able to let go, minding public perceptions less as her company slowly but surely regained its footing and earned back consumer trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, from their all-time low in share prices, something surprising happened. “The WSJ article was an interesting inflection point for the company,” says Fenster, “because after it caused the stock to bottom, momentum started to come back.” Over the next two years, Sunrun’s stock rose roughly 400%, signaling to the world that Sunrun had staying power.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Just before Thomas Edison’s death, in that same 1931 conversation with Henry Ford, he said, “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” Today, Jurich feels closer than ever to paying out her hero’s bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, Sunrun has deployed 5.7 gigawatts of total solar capacity, making it one of the world’s largest sources of networked solar energy. In 2019, Sunrun overtook Tesla’s SolarCity as the leading installer of residential rooftop solar panels in the U.S. “We’re at this inflection point where consumers have wrapped their minds around solar power, and they accept it,” says Jurich, who stepped down as CEO of Sunrun in 2021, but remains the company’s Co-Executive Chair.</p>



<p>Part of that acceptance comes from a greater understanding of climate urgency. It comes from legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other clean energy initiatives, reinstates generous tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels. And it comes from increasingly affordable solar hardware, a trend the founders predicted at Sunrun’s outset (today, solar panel prices are down nine times since 2006). An additional factor is technological advancement: “One of the challenges with solar was always that you couldn’t store it,” says Jurich, “but now, batteries have completely changed that. You can generate, store and distribute energy to the grid without building new plants, or even solar farms. You can just use existing roofs!” To that end, in 2020 Sunrun funded and helped found Lunar Energy, an independent company focused on building the next-generation home battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade and a half working in clean energy has made Jurich a realist about the magnitude of her company’s undertakings. Which is why, more than ever, she’s looking to others to share the burden, and in part why she returned to her alma mater in March 2023. This was a chance to speak to a new generation of potential clean energy leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do worry that the United States broadly has lost the skillset to develop large-scale infrastructure,” Jurich said toward the end of her keynote. “But I encourage all of you to help. I’ve already talked to a couple of you who have great business ideas around trying to make labor more efficient, making large-scale construction more efficient. And I do think we will get there.”</p>



<p>By “there,” Jurich means a sustainable future of clean energy abundance. And on a personal level, she hopes for a future with more balance, filled with more of the hard-earned equanimity on display at the GSB climate summit. “One of the things I’ve come to appreciate in life is that in order to be most effective, you need periods of both intensity and periods of rest and renewal,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest, as always with Jurich, is a relative concept. She’s Co-Executive Chair of Sunrun, Chair of Lunar Energy, and she’s launching a women’s health institute and writing a novel—imagining different worlds while working to improve our own. But at the very least, “I’m no longer trying to do it all at once,” she says. That simply wouldn’t be sustainable.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 4th December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-December the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis. </p>



<p>From January, Committee members will receive a nominal stipend of $650 per calendar month from ZF (paid as shielded ZEC). This stipend may be subject to review, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces.</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

 The Horizen DAO increases community involvement in decision-making for improvements to the protocol and ecosystem. 



<p>The Horizen community is excited to announce the Horizen DAO is now open for all $ZEN holders to participate in governance and take an active role in the direction of the project!</p>



<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. A strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is informed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/guiding_values">Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 How to Participate in Voting 



<p>Voting for the Horizen DAO is done on Horizen EON, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain including the $ZEN you have staked with the Horizen EON validators. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold,&nbsp; the more voting power you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.jpg"></a>



<p></p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours. For more information about the process of voting, please start <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing the Horizen DAO Special Council 



<p>What is the Horizen DAO Special Council?</p>



<p>The Special Council serves as a steward for the Horizen DAO and provides oversight of the Horizen Foundation with security of the Horizen DAO and ecosystem as its paramount focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What exactly does the Special Council do?</p>



<p>Special Council members serve as a DAO committee and function as a liaison between the Horizen community and the Horizen Foundation. In practical terms, this means providing review and oversight during the improvement proposal process, calling emergency operational meetings as needed to discuss and address security threats to the Horizen DAO, any protocol utilizing the Token, the Tokenholders, or the Foundation, and serving as signers on the Horizen community multi-signature wallet.</p>



<p>Who are the Special Council members?</p>



<p>Initially, the Special Council will be made up of 7 individuals initially appointed by the Foundation Director(s):</p>

DBCC regularly hosts a number of blockchain startups within Area 2071 and also conducts educational classes and seminars around blockchain use cases in the government and private sectors. Dr. Marwan is currently heading the Digital Asset Task Force (DATF), a research and advisory team that reports to the Dubai Future Council for Blockchain. The purpose of the task force is to conduct a comprehensive study to provide clear guidance on how digital assets can be encouraged and regulated. The council establishes Dubai as a global blockchain capital, offering a prominent platform for decision-makers from various local and international governments and private sector entities to explore futuristic, blockchain-based solutions.</p>

<p>Leading decentralised perpetual exchange, dYdX V4 recently migrated to Cosmos to build its own sovereign appchain, in order to provide its users a much better trading experience, while continuing to deliver DeFi innovations (e.g. permisionless markets). By having full control over the appchain’s parameters, the dYdX DAOs can shape the future of the protocol, starting from the very bedrock, ensuring proper distribution and incentives for the validator set. From early adopter of L2 zero knowledge proofs (STARKs), to building its own Cosmos appchain, dYdX has proven once again to be a trailblazer for new technologies.</p><p>We were joined by Charles d’Haussy, CEO of dYdX Foundation, to discuss dYdX V4’s recent migration to a Cosmos appchain and what challenges it solves in terms of: order book decentralisation, validator distribution and user experience.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Charles’ background, from Asia to CEO of dYdX  dYdX’s history and V4’s transition to a Cosmos appchain  How perpetual futures work  dYdX supported assets and permissionless markets  DeFi innovations vs. CEX UX  The current state of dYdX V4’s alpha mainnet  dYdX validator dynamics &amp; order book decentralisation  dYdX’s DAOs &amp; governance  Mitigating MEV (feat.

<p>Bootstrap Org, the nonprofit parent organization of Electric Coin Co., has added long-time Zcash community contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/michlai007">Michelle Lai</a> to its Board of Directors. Michelle joins members Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Zaki Manian, and Zooko Wilcox.</p>



<p>“Michelle has worked hard to support Zcash and the cause of financial freedom for years,” Fairless said. “We love her insight and imagination on tech product use cases.”</p>



<p>A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2007), Michelle has spent half her career in crypto and half in financial services, including stints at Anchorage Digital, Bitpay, Credit Suisse, a private equity buyout fund, and as a consultant to CEOs of large financial services companies. She’s performed a wide range of roles, including COO, BD and product roles, and says she most enjoys solving tricky business problems and managing high-stakes negotiations.</p>



<p>She is passionate about crypto-related technology as “a means of achieving a fairer and freer world.”</p>



<p>In Michelle’s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My journey with Zcash started in 2018 when I worked at a crypto asset custodian and we were looking to support $ZEC. Since then, I’ve fallen further down the privacy money rabbit hole, becoming a member of the first grant organization in 2021 (the Zcash Open Major Grants committee) and then staying involved as someone who actively advocates for privacy and freedom applications in crypto.</p>



<p>My vision of tomorrow’s Zcash is one that earns its place back as a leader of privacy tech in crypto so that we can keep supporting the universal values of privacy and freedom. We did it once with the best talent in ZK and engineering, and we can do it again.</p>



<p>Today, as the crypto privacy community faces several challenges, including market sentiment and regulatory onslaught, I join the Bootstrap team to navigate the turbulent waters we find ourselves in. I have had professional experience in turnaround situations and hope to bring that to bear in this new role on the board of Bootstrap.</p>



<p>The road ahead is strewn with both extremely difficult questions and compelling opportunities for all ZK and privacy projects, including us. It will take a grand effort for us to arrive at a new horizon, but this is the moment where we dig in, gear up, and keep marching on in service of humanity.</p>



<p>If you have ideas and opinions from anywhere in the crypto community, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.</p>

<p>The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

 Introducing PIVX Perspectives:<br>Engaging conversations with remarkable contributors to the PIVX community. Get ready for insightful dialogues about PIVX’s journey and future. Stay tuned for inspiring stories from various individuals who have played an important role in the PIVX ecosystem. <p>Our first guest is Jeffrey, PIVX Business Development Lead and a key driving force behind the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Can you tell us a little about yourself please?<br>Hey everyone, my name is Jeffrey, I currently live in South Africa but I have also lived in Indonesia and Singapore. I’m an extremely passionate and energetic person when it comes to digital finance and privacy, advocating for secure and efficient financial solutions in a digital age. My academic journey took me to Singapore where I completed my Bachelors in IT with Distinction. During this time is where I became deeply interested in the world of digital finance, as Singapore is a hub for&nbsp;fintech.</p><p>I’ve been a proud member of the PIVX family since early 2017, joining right around the time of the rebrand. It’s been a fortunate journey, allowing me to witness the remarkable growth of the project and actively contribute to its&nbsp;success.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?<br>My cryptocurrency journey goes quite far back and is actually thanks to a stranger, I was part of a social group where people share discounts or deals on servers. Someone wanted to pay on this particular website for a linux VPS but they wanted PayPal. So in return he sent me my first ever Bitcoin and I paid using PayPal. I believe this was back in late 2012 or early 2013. The wallet at the time I used was called MultiBit if I recall correctly. During this time I also experienced so many issues with online payment methods especially since I am from South Africa and many at the time did not provide their services or had lengthy and often privacy invading verification processes. Bitcoin was so fast, I remember being like wow I received this already and didn’t need to register or provide any of my information. My passion grew and I loved superior technology. Sadly I did end up using it as my main payment method for online goods and services lol so could not really enjoy the extreme growth over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>When and why did you choose to get involved with PIVX?<br>Cryptocurrency was starting to go really viral in 2017, It was at this time myself and some online friends were all looking to invest and buy more. The best way to find new cryptocurrencies to invest in at this time was to browse BitcoinTalk. I was lucky enough to find the PIVX post in 2017 on the forum. I read it was a coin dedicated to privacy which piqued my interest. The forum post also provided a Slack invitation link so PIVX ended up being the first cryptocurrency that I joined the official community for. So I guess initially my first finding out about PIVX was for investment purposes however the community was so helpful. I learned so much in just a week there amongst all the “Purple Rain” showers of PIVX tips flying out to everyone. I dedicated so much time that I ended up assisting with the support team by providing technical assistance as well as hosting calls to show people how to trade&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market?<br>For me it’s the human touch. PIVX is the only community where anyone can just join in and discuss openly and share ideas with developers, graphics designers, moderators and others from many backgrounds. PIVX may be a privacy coin but it’s extremely human-centric. What I love most is the aim to redefine privacy to its root. That privacy is not for criminals but simply a human right to protect oneself from malicious parties. PIVX makes this privacy option dubbed “SHIELD” completely optional therefore giving the user complete control over how they spend their PIV. PIVX also is a DAO with a treasury guaranteeing constant development and growth therefore PIVX in my opinion has a stable future and is here to secure your digital financial footprint.</p><p>How do you envision PIVX’s role in the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies?<br>PIVX has an ambassador program as well as community members that are introducing PIVX for the first time to many people, many of which will be their first ever crypto and therefore the beginning of their cryptocurrency journey. PIVX sets a benchmark through their meticulous development process that ensures the safety of their blockchain and privacy protocol.</p><p>This unwavering commitment to user safety and the protection of their assets sets a noteworthy example for other cryptocurrencies to follow almost like a benchmark. By establishing such high standards, PIVX contributes to the creation of a safer and more secure environment for newcomers, ultimately fostering increased adoption.</p><p>Can you share any success stories or notable achievements during your time at PIVX?<br>Honestly my biggest achievement in my cryptocurrency career with PIVX is getting feedback from our community on their experiences with PIVX and seeing how positive it is. I work as the lead of business development, I secure new listings and integrations. When I come across fellow Pivians enthusiastically sharing how they’ve started accepting PIVX through platforms like NowPayments, booked flights on Travala using PIVX, or found joy in trading on exchanges such as WhiteBit and LBank, it represents the pinnacle of success for me. More recently, learning how PIVX is enabling our community to make a difference by assisting families in need through the purchase of gift cards on Coinsbee is both humbling and inspiring. It’s not just about me, it’s about the collective impact my decisions make and how they can help others. I hope all my work and achievements combined empowers our community and fellow PIVX holders to explore new possibilities with&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>How do you approach building strong relationships with exchange platforms and integrating PIVX into their trading systems?<br>I begin this first with market research, identifying areas that we lack. For example an exchange that doesn’t require KYC or perhaps provides GBP withdraws to a bank, Once I establish a decent list of exchanges that provide our needs I proceed to contact&nbsp;them.</p><p>The most important thing is a mutual understanding of the objective. Once we establish that we would like a relationship that is more than just trading PIVX but actually engaging with both communities and building together then I can proceed to discuss listings. Exchanges and cryptocurrencies work hand in hand in securing the future of Crypto. Not everyone supports centralised exchanges however it is thanks to them that cryptocurrency is thriving and vice versa. If an exchange wants to foster a relationship that involves us potentially collaborating on future marketing events or conferences then this is a good sign. If an exchange simply wants a listing fee and nothing more then that is a red flag in my&nbsp;book.</p><p>Obviously I will always advise anyone to do their own research on the exchange before trading however if an exchange is positive and wants to highlight the growth of PIVX and be apart of it, I will do my part by making this known to our communities and giving them the thanks they deserve as well as collaboration on any marketing from our&nbsp;side.</p><p>Thank you for reading our PIVX perspectives, stay tuned for more exciting insights and future&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/introducing-pivx-perspectives-engaging-conversations-with-remarkable-contributors-to-the-pivx-bcc9f0698ed8">Introducing PIVX Perspectives:

<p>Introduction:<br>In the world of cryptocurrency, liquidity plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and efficient trading. PIVX has experienced significant improvements in liquidity thanks to the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on Binance. Over the past seven weeks, this program has not only enhanced trading opportunities but also increased the chances of reintroducing a USDT pair on the exchange.</p><p>Enhanced Liquidity on Binance:<br>Since the launch of the <a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/market/76?snapshotTimestamp=1698515760000&amp;interval=1">Hummingbot Liquidity Program, </a>PIVX has witnessed a notable improvement in liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance. The sufficient liquidity provided by HummingBot has allowed for a more stable market that meets the supply and demand of services such as payment gateways that use Binance as an exchange. Sufficient liquidity provides a better market for traders and service providers.</p><p>Positive Results and Future Prospects:<br>During the campaign, Hummingbot miners have traded over $1.5 million worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair. The campaign has consistently ranked among the top three in terms of performance, with an average of 15.5 active bots, $9.93k in open order volume, and $35.1k in daily filled order volume. These figures account for nearly 6% of the total traded volume for PIVX/BTC on&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>The success of the campaign has prompted a proposal to extend it for another eight weeks on the PIVX/BTC pair. If this extension proves fruitful, there are plans to introduce a longer campaign with increased rewards in both PIVX and HBOT tokens, the native crypto of Hummingbot.</p>First 8 weeks of Hummingbot Liquidity Program on&nbsp;Binance.<p>About Hummingbot:<br><a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/">Hummingbot</a>, developed by the Hummingbot Foundation, is an open-source market-making bot that aims to democratize high-frequency trading. It provides a platform for token projects, trading firms, and individual traders to own their liquidity and earn rewards through liquidity mining. Hummingbot has evolved from a simple market-making bot into a powerful platform that allows users to create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots running various trading strategies.</p><p>The Importance of Liquidity:<br>Liquidity is a crucial metric for financial assets and trading venues. Traditionally, market making, the provision of liquidity, has been limited to a few participants such as quantitative hedge funds and large financial institutions. However, the Hummingbot Liquidity Program enables anyone to become a market maker and contribute to liquidity provision in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>A Marketplace-Based Approach:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program takes a marketplace-based approach to promote consistent liquidity provision, improve matching efficiency, and mitigate the risk of manipulative practices. Inspired by successful two-sided digital marketplaces in other industries, this approach tackles the liquidity fragmentation problem in the crypto market, benefiting both exchanges and token&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program has proven to be highly beneficial for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX</a>, enhancing liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance and fostering increased trading opportunities. With impressive results and a positive outlook for the future, continuing the program will contribute to the long-term growth and success of PIVX. By leveraging the power of Hummingbot and its marketplace-based approach, PIVX can further strengthen its position in the crypto market and attract more liquidity providers, ultimately supporting a USDT pair too, perhaps with its own Hummingbot Liquidity Program, benefiting all stakeholders involved</p>Miners on Hummingbot have traded over 1.5 million dollars worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair during the first campaign. <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-beneficial-impact-of-the-hummingbot-liquidity-program-on-pivx-b2cd2734b75e">The Beneficial Impact of the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

 Noir comes to the&nbsp;browser! <p>Today we’re releasing NoirJS- a Javascript package for <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> developers who want to build real applications that generate zero knowledge proofs in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>Web development within the Noir ecosystem has historically been, uhm, complex. Practically, that meant Noir developers couldn’t really build applications that ran in the browser. And we want people to build applications with our software!</p> Y u no&nbsp;browser <p>A browser is an application used to access the World Wide Web and interact with Internet applications. It turns out most people like using browsers.</p><p>Before today, Noir didn’t really let you build applications that could run in-browser. Instead, developers were forced to run applications locally in a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>In simple terms, that meant Noir couldn’t actually support real applications.</p><p>But now Noir does support applications with&nbsp;NoirJS.</p><p>The goals of NoirJS are&nbsp;simple:</p>  Enable Noir applications to work in web&nbsp;browsers  Simplify package management  Improve DevEx from “oh God” to “oh&nbsp;good”   Reminder on what Noir&nbsp;is <p>Noir is a zero knowledge circuit-writing language that works with multiple crypto proving back-ends. That means the front-end (the language) remains the same but Noir can be modularized to support the latest and greatest in zero knowledge proving research.</p><p>We do this through the ACIR (abstract circuit intermediate representation). Learn more about the ACIR&nbsp;<a href="https://noir-lang.org/#whats-new-about-noir">here</a>.</p><p>NoirJS lets developers build around the core concept of client-side compute: the ability to harness user hardware-phones, laptops, tablets-through the browser in order to compute proofs of execution.</p><p>And client-side compute in turn allows for fully private and trustless blockchain systems.</p><p>…sound familiar??</p><p>That’s the core philosophy of Aztec-giving developers the tools to develop programs with private data and compute while remaining fully trustless.</p>  Users download encrypted data  They decrypt and manipulate the data locally (unbeknownst to anyone&nbsp;else)  They furnish a proof of computational correctness  They submit the&nbsp;proof  <p>In English: do blockchain things without anyone knowing! Cool,&nbsp;right?</p><p>And for developers’ convenience, NoirJS is packaged with Barretenberg-the same Plonkish backend used by <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Labs</a> in the Aztec rollup. No need to go shopping for a proving system unless you like, really want&nbsp;to.</p> Quality of Life Improvements <p>NoirJS does a lot of other things, too! Developers were previously burdened by the need to manage multiple components like `bb.js`, `acvm`, `noirc_abi`, and future components like `noir_wasm`.</p><p>But managing component libraries and balancing version compatibility is not our idea of&nbsp;fun.</p><p>To install NoirJS you simply run `npm i @noir-lang/noir_js` in your Javascript directory</p><p>Install your proving backend of choice (ahem, probably Barretenberg), and you’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>NoirJS handles all Noir dependencies, exposing them through one clean interface, allowing you to focus on building rather than fiddling with packages.</p><p>Here are some other advantages:</p><p>Immediate Access: Browser-based applications don’t require additional software, making it easier for developers to reach a wider audience.</p><p>Improved User Experience: By enabling Noir functionality in the browser, users can interact with applications in real-time. That means fast&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Enhanced Security: Operating in the browser allows for client-side cryptography, offering an additional layer of security for applications that require cryptographic proofs.</p><p>Developer Flexibility: NoirJS enables developers to build rich, client-side applications with cryptographic functions, providing a broader toolkit for web development.</p><p>Community Building: Browser-based Noir enables rapid prototyping and sharing among the developer community. This is especially useful for teams who focus on in-browser applications and use-cases.</p><p>In-Browser Tooling: NoirJS fits seamlessly with in-browser IDEs like VSCode for web, allowing for a streamlined development process in which Noir programs can be compiled and proven directly in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>So to summarize, by bringing Noir to the browser,&nbsp;we’re:</p>  simplifying development  expanding the scope and capabilities of what can be built with&nbsp;Noir  <p>Siiick.</p> Use-Cases and Applications <p>Less development pain means more time for building new applications. Here are some use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see:</p>  Pseudonymous identity web apps: Projects like <a href="https://www.noxx.xyz/">Noxx</a> are focused on building pseudonymous identity web&nbsp;apps.

<p>Recommitting to open-source security</p><p>Today we’re announcing that as a result of Aztec Labs’ full investigation into a vulnerability in <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, we have paid $450,000 to a whitehat independent security researcher through our Immunefi bug bounty&nbsp;program.</p><p>On September 12th, independent security researcher <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> discovered a vulnerability in Aztec Connect, Aztec Labs’ zkRollup system designed to enhance privacy in DeFi operations.</p><p>Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Aztec’s team moved swiftly to mitigate any potential damage, temporarily restricting public access to the affected workflow.</p><p>The team has conducted a full technical postmortem, the result of which you can view&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug">https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug</a></p><p>We remain extremely committed to open-source software development, and see the treatment of this vulnerability as further evidence of the robustness of the open source community.</p><p>As a reminder, Aztec Labs will no longer support its first-party front-end <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> after March, 2024. Users are reminded and urged to withdraw funds as soon as possible by navigating to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>.</p><blockquote>💸 Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Summary <p>At the heart of the issue was the computation related to determining a user’s output from an intended DeFi interaction-in other words, the funds a user gets back after initiating a transaction within Aztec Connect. Due to this oversight, a malicious sequencer-and only a malicious sequencer-could exploit this computation via Aztec Connect’s escape hatch, a mechanism for individuals to exit funds directly to L1 Ethereum.</p><p>The primary challenge emanated from the inherent complexities of executing integer arithmetic within ZK circuits. These circuits are designed to operate over finite fields, making integer operations particularly tricky.</p><p>The crux of the problem was tied to the system’s handling of integer division and the subsequent remainders. In the absence of proper constraints, a sequencer could manipulate the `user_output` value, adjusting the remainder to ensure the primary equation still held true. This opened up avenues for multiple valid decompositions for a single value, making it a target for exploitation.</p><p>The remedy involved introducing stringent constraints to ensure a consistent and direct mapping between the original values and their decomposed counterparts. Furthermore, to prevent any undue advantage to the sequencer, the remainder value was also carefully constrained.</p><p>This incident with Aztec Connect serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and potential pitfalls inherent in developing large-scale projects, even with extensive auditing. It underscores the necessity for continuous scrutiny, highlighting the invaluable role of bug bounty programs in maintaining the security and reliability of such&nbsp;systems.</p> Conclusion <p>Our $450,000 bug bounty payment to <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> is our largest ever, and a reiteration of our commitment to open source software development.</p><p>We appreciate him and the broader ZK community for maintaining a high degree of vigilance over complex crypto&nbsp;systems.</p><p>We strongly encourage all users of <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and third party Aztec Connect products to withdraw funds as soon as possible. Support for <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> will be sunset in March 2024, after which individuals will have to withdraw funds by running their own sequencers.</p>  Navigate to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> to withdraw&nbsp;funds  Read our full technical breakdown <a href="https://hackmd.io/OrsPExbWTJaJAX5A8dCvGw">here</a>  Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztec-connect-postmortem/">https://aztec.network</a> on October 24,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-labs-announces-our-largest-ever-bug-bounty-of-450-000-434ab2477b3a">Aztec Labs Announces Our Largest-Ever Bug Bounty Of $450,000</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
