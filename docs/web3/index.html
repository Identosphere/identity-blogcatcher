<p>🎅Dear friends and&nbsp;family,</p><p>As the holiday season approaches, we at zCloak would like to take a moment to wish you all a very Merry Christmas. May this time of year be filled with joy, love, and warm memories for you and your loved&nbsp;ones.</p><p>This time we are providing a chance for you to show your care to your family, friends, colleagues, and other discord members by sending a special message to them using our Credential Platform.</p><p>This event is the world’s first DID-based private social relations and Christmas Card event. With the help of zCloak’s privacy-preserving DID protocol, users can invite the others to confirm their social relationship with themselves while sending Christmas greetings, so as to fully experience the charm of Web3’s self-sovereign data technology.</p><p>After receiving the Christmas Card, the recipient can approve and attest to the social relationship request if they recognize the social relationship in the Verifiable Credential, so that the sender of the Christmas Card will receive an attested VC to prove the relationship between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Time for participation: 2022/12/24 00&nbsp;:00 AM UTC — 2022/1/15 23&nbsp;:59 PM&nbsp;UTC</p><p>Before beginning, please ensure you and your Christmas card receivers have a zCloak DID account to send and receive the special message — Verifiable Credential(VC)</p> 1. Restore or create your zCloak&nbsp;Account <p>Click this link: <a href="https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer">https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer</a></p><p>· If you are already logged in, please unlock your account and go to step&nbsp;2.</p><p>· If you already have a DID Account, please ‘Restore Account’ and then go to step 2. (<a href="https://zcloaknetwork.medium.com/user-guide-how-to-restore-your-zkid-web-wallet-account-ad53f558bddb">See detailed&nbsp;guide</a>)</p><p>· If you are a first time user of our platform, please ‘Create Account’ first. (<a href="https://medium.com/@zcloaknetwork/user-guide-how-to-create-a-web-wallet-zkid-account-d3d9a3c892c6">See detailed&nbsp;guide</a>)</p> 2. Start sending Christmas Cards with cType (Claimer) <p>After creating the account, please go to this link to start the process. <a href="https://cred.zkid.app/#/claimer/ctype">https://cred.zkid.app/#/claimer/ctype</a></p> 2.1 If you are sending the Christmas Cards <p>Please make sure you are on the Claimer page to start the claiming&nbsp;process.</p><p>Here, as a claimer, what it means is that you will be sending out attestation requests to others, asking them to approve your declared relationship with them along with your Christmas message. Once you received the attested credential from them, you will be the owner of this specific Verifiable Credential which also serves as a private proof of your social relation with the attester.</p> 2.2 Click Create Claim and Send out your Christmas Card <p>You should be able to see the Credential type “Christmas Card 2022” already shown on the&nbsp;page.</p><p>Click “Create Claim” to&nbsp;start.</p><p>First, copy and paste the DID of whom you want to send this Christmas Card to. (They will act as attesters in this process.)</p><p>Next, select your relationship with the person behind this DID from the drop down menu. We provided 4 options here: Friends, Colleagues, Family Members, and Discord Community Buddies. (There is a channel named “zk-decentralized-identity” in <a href="https://discord.gg/3uAXJ5XPTP">zCloak’s Discord</a> server, where you can find community members’ DIDs and also share yours with the zCloak&nbsp;family.)</p><p>Finally, pick a Christmas Message from the drop down menu. We have generated 5 different heartwarming Christmas messages by default, and you can pick one to&nbsp;send.</p><p>If you are using zkID wallet, you may need to encrypt and sign using&nbsp;it.</p><p>Submit the claim to send out the Credential for attestation.</p> 3. Attesting the Christmas Card sent to you (Attester) <p>Please visit <a href="https://cred.zkid.app/#/attester/ctypes">https://cred.zkid.app/#/attester/ctypes</a> to enter the attester layout. You will see notifications shown on the bell sign, the “Tasks” tab, and the “Message” tab for unread messages. We suggest you to check regularly for pending requests.</p> 3.1 If you are attesting to Christmas cards <p>If you have received requests from others, you will need to be an attester and attest to the Verifiable Credentials they sent&nbsp;you.</p><p>Approving attestation means you are giving consent to the relationship between you and the claimer stated in the credential. Rejecting means otherwise.</p><p>Note: If you act as an attester, the credentials you attested to will not belong to you, but will belong to the corresponding claimers. You can always refer to step 2 and become a claimer yourself since we deem Christmas cards you OWN as proof of participation in this&nbsp;event.</p> 3.2 Approve (or reject) your Christmas Cards <p>Go to the “Tasks” tab to view your pending requests from others. Click on the Message id to see details of this&nbsp;request.</p><p>Then you need to decrypt to view the&nbsp;message</p><p>After checking the message and confirming the relationship between you and the claimer, you can choose to approve or reject the credential.</p><p>(Note: Be careful, if you choose to reject, it means you do not consent to the relationship the claimer stated in the credential.)</p> 4. Result (Claimer) <p>To view the result, please decrypt&nbsp;first.</p><p>Once your friends, family members, colleagues, or discord buddies attested to your Christmas Card 2022 credentials, you will see the attested credential showing up on the “Credentials” page.</p><p>Congratulations, you have successfully generated a private proof of your social relations!</p><p>As a claimer, we encourage you to send attestation requests to as many loved ones of yours and bring them your warmest messages to wish them a very Merry Christmas!</p> 5. Prize and&nbsp;Rewards  5.1 For all participants <p>For everyone who has successfully sent out more than 3 Christmas Cards (3 included) to different attesters and get attestations approved from them, zCloak Network will be issuing out a special “zCloak Christmas Elf” credential to your&nbsp;DID.</p><p>We plan to throw events on major global holidays and issue holiday special participation proof credentials each and every time. Please hold on to your DID account and accumulate these special credentials for future surprises and redemption of&nbsp;prizes!</p> 5.2 For top 20&nbsp;claimers <p>We also want to reward our top 20 claimers in this event, where your number of Christmas cards sent and successfully attested will be ranked. We have prepared a special Christmas gift for you guys: zCloak Mystery Box — Christmas Edition!</p><p>We plan to issue Mystery Box credentials in our future events as prizes, and this is the first batch of Mystery Box that we are sending out! The prize in the box will be revealed in the near future with gifts we know you would&nbsp;enjoy!</p><p>There will be more Mystery Boxes in different editions in later events, so stay tuned for&nbsp;more!</p><p>At zCloak, we believe that social relations should be private by default. End-to-end encrypted interactions ensure that the content of our interactions with friends, family, and others is private. And, unlike traditional greeting cards or messages, VC allows you to have ownership and at the same time be able to show and prove the existence of your relationship to others at any time. You will truly have self-sovereignty of you social relations, which will be the happiest and most meaningful thing for you this holiday&nbsp;season.</p><p>We are grateful for the support and generosity of our community. The Christmas Card Event is a wonderful opportunity for us to spread some holiday cheer to our loved ones. We hope that this events will be able to bring some joy and happiness to those who received these heartwarming Christmas messages.</p><p>Merry Christmas and happy holidays to&nbsp;all!</p>

<p>New versions of the Nym software have now been released — the final one of&nbsp;2022!</p><p>Nym software weekly update was released earlier this&nbsp;week.</p><p>We constantly update and improve our software. So if you are running older versions of Nym wallet or NymConnect, you should be getting an auto updater notification to update your software. Alternatively you can download the latest versions of the products and platform binaries from <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Nym is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/master">open source</a> and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p><p>What’s new in the Nym platform?</p><p>This release adds multiple Single Use Reply Blocks (SURBs) to allow arbitrarily-sized anonymized replies. At the moment this feature is turned off by default, but available for use by the application developers. We will need to wait for all the network-requesters to upgrade to this new release first, before multi-SURB anonymization can become the default setting for the SOCKS proxy&nbsp;clients.</p><p>The release also includes some additional work for distributed key generation in the Coconut signing authority nodes.</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#v114-2022-12-20">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes.</p><p>What’s new in NymConnect?</p><p>In addition to bug fixes, performance improvements and better error handling, this release contains the new opt-in Test &amp; Earn program that anyone can join to stress test the network and earn NYM tokens. You can read more about the program&nbsp;<a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/test-and-win">here</a>.</p><p>This version also uses a stress-tested directory of network requesters to improve reliability.</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-connect-v1.1.4/nym-connect/CHANGELOG.md#nym-connect-v114-2022-12-20">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes</p><p>What’s new in Nym&nbsp;wallet?</p><p>And finally the latest release of the Nym wallet includes a cool new feature called the Playground for the Node operators. If you run a mix node, you can find Playground under the Node Settings. Play around with different parameters to get better and more accurate reward estimations and active set selection probability of your&nbsp;node.</p><p>For the full list of fixes and changes in the wallet please check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-wallet-v1.1.5/nym-wallet/CHANGELOG.md#nym-wallet-v115-2022-12-22">changelog</a>.</p><p>That sums up this week’s release.

 Meet our new hire — Jan Zibelnik, Product&nbsp;Manager <p>#18 — This is the sixteenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to welcome our latest team member, Jan Zibelnik! Jan is a talented Product Manager with previous experience in the wallet space. In his last position, he developed a product team from the ground up, and now, he’s bringing his advanced skillset to BlockWallet.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m the Product Manager here at BlockWallet. That means I’m responsible for identifying customer needs and business objectives. In addition to that, I also need to figure out what products and features will help us fulfill those needs and objectives of our users, and articulate them for everyone in the company to understand.</p><p>My day-to-day includes competitor research, user interviews, formulating requirements, and aligning business and development efforts.</p> How long have you worked as a product&nbsp;manager? <p>I started working in product in 2018 at my previous company, GateHub. I transitioned from wallet support into product management and we basically had to set up the new department from scratch. After we got the ball rolling, we managed to deliver some neat products to the market. This included a decentralized trading app and an on-chain crypto insurance solution, which from what I know, is the first of its kind and has not been replicated yet.</p> Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I previously worked at GateHub, which is an XRPL gateway and wallet. We offered users a custodial wallet with some unique features like web monetization and a non-custodial XRPL wallet for all kinds of on-chain interactions. In parallel, I was also a judge in the XRPL Grants program, where developers can receive grants for building solutions that leverage the XRPL blcokchain.</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I first heard about crypto in 2016. I created my first account and bought my first crypto in September or October that same year. It was a very calm time for about a year, so I had time to learn and realize what it could hold for our future. I’m really glad I’m able to say that I survived some highs and lows during this&nbsp;period.</p><p>In late 2017, I switched from my previous career as a football coach to a full-time job in&nbsp;crypto.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>I learned of BlockWallet when I received a call from Felipe, the Cheif Vibe Officer here at BlockWallet. I was on the lookout for a new challenge after 4+ years at GateHub, and was keen to switch companies to start learning new stuff — joining BlockWallet and transitioning to an EVM + self-custodial wallet was very intriguing to me. On top of that, when I learned about how BlockWallet wanted to position itself in the market, I was convinced.</p><p>I’m sure that in the long run, products that care about their users will prosper. A lot of the time it’s harder to be ethical and caring, especially if the competition is not, but my personal and professional tendency is to think about the user first, making this relationship a natural&nbsp;match.</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Because even if you have nothing to hide, you never know who is&nbsp;looking.</p><p>That’s the short answer. The long one though, is a bit more complicated.</p><p>The internet does not have a built-in monetization system. The result of this oversight at the very beginning is ads and data mining which online businesses need to do in order to stay afloat. In the years of Web2, data mining has become so sophisticated and widespread that only the most skilled users are able to remain fully anonymous. Most of us are just leaving bits and pieces of our info and behavior scattered all over the internet. The result is, that with a bit of effort, your sensitive info can be tracked and exploited, even if you take great care — but who really has time to think about&nbsp;that?</p><p>This is why privacy is so critical to help break our digital footprint. Our phone and laptop, our browser, our wallet, our paid services…they should work for us, not the other way around. They should help use preserve our&nbsp;privacy.</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>5 years ago, we had ICOs and CryptoKitties. We had our share of scams, but I feel it was a more innocent place back&nbsp;then.</p><p>In 5 years, we’ll probably see an evolution of everything we know now. DAOs are probably going to become more sophisticated, trustworthy, and effective. NFTs are going to break into the mainstream, but they will evolve into more than overpriced JPEGs. Think tickets to events, proofs of ownership, proofs of participation — stuff we already know, but better. Regulations are going to come into force and evolve too, which should make the space somewhat safer and more reliable.</p><p>We are going to have new players that will want to disrupt traditional CEXes where Celsius and FTX failed. So I expect to see new (decentralized and centralized) players in stocks, futures, derivatives, indices&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Finally, we can probably expect the next bull run to be fuelled by some hot new tech (gaming, metaverse, something else?), more shills, more FOMO, and more everything.</p><p>My approach: stay level-headed, and stay safe&nbsp;;)</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m thrilled to be a part of BlockWallet. I’ve met the team and already settled in nicely. I love the work we are doing, and I’m loving all the feedback from the community. I’m excited about the stuff we have brewing in the background and can’t wait to share it with everyone.</p> About BlockWallet <p>Welcome to Web3’s smoothest self-custodial wallet, where you can swap and bridge crypto right on the spot. Use BlockWallet with all your favorite blockchain apps and feel what it’s like to use a product built with users in mind.

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from Civic, DeFi Land, Degen Ape Academy, EDGE, Froggy Friends, Hubble, Kamino, Kwenta, Orca, Push Protocol, and Slingshot.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Since launching the Brave Wallet in 2021, we’ve been hard at work collaborating with developers across the Web3 ecosystem to integrate Brave Wallet support into the most used DApps on Solana, Ethereum, and EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to end the year with 85 partners that have integrated the Brave Wallet, including 11 new ones this month, as well as hundreds more DApps and wallet development kits that are now compatible with Brave Wallet. To learn more about the program and Brave’s partners, read our past announcements: <a>June</a>, <a>July</a>, <a>August</a>, <a>September</a>, <a>October</a>, and <a>November</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the partners that joined in December:</p>

 Civic 
<p><a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic</a> provides identity management tools for Web3 across chains for both consumers and DApps. For consumers, <a href="https://civic.me/">Civic.me</a> offers Dynamic Web3 profiles where you can display NFTs, manage your identity, and use on-chain messaging. For DApps, Civic Pass is an integrated permissioning tool that gives users access to their services.</p>
<p>“We’ve always seen eye-to-eye with Brave when it comes to putting the privacy of our users first. That’s why we’re delighted to offer support for Brave users on Civic.me, where they can access the most advanced, privacy-focused digital identity tools on the market,” said JP Bedoya, Chief Product Officer at Civic.</p>

<p>When discussing the widespread adoption of true, peer-to-peer decentralization, one could easily identify various social and political obstacles. However, there is also an often overlooked technological impairment as the underlying architecture of computer networks was not designed to achieve global-scale decentralization. Ideally a complete restructuring would be necessary, from applications and programming language, to as profound as rewriting operating system kernels.

<p>The holidays are on our doorstep, have you decided what to gift your friends and family? &nbsp;Experienced Bitcoiners know how quickly the value of fiat money melts, so instead of buying your loved ones a gift card, keep them warm with the joy of hard money this winter season by giving them Bitcoin!</p><p>Although Bitcoin makes for a generous gift, you might be giving away more than you realize when making a transaction. Because Bitcoin is a public ledger, the addresses that sent you money become known by the addresses you sent the money to next. </p><p>In this blog post, we’ve outlined a few simple steps to send Bitcoin anonymously with Wasabi Wallet - a surefire way of upgrading your gift-giving skills and orange-pilling your family and friends.</p> Step 1  <p>If you are using Bitcoin privately for the first time, download Wasabi and write down your wallet recovery words on a sheet of paper.</p> Step 2 <p>Choose a password that you will not forget for your wallet. You will enter your password later in order to send your gifts, and there is no way to recover your password. &nbsp;Next, choose your highest priority for coinjoins: &nbsp;Savings, Speed or Privacy.</p> Step 3 <p>Create a new address for receiving the Bitcoins you want to make private. Wasabi requires you to make a note to remind yourself who sent these coins to you in order to help you keep track of your privacy.</p> Step 4 <p>After you have BTC in your wallet, the coinjoin box and privacy progress bar will appear. Coinjoins will not start automatically for amounts under 0.01 BTC in order to save mining fees, but you can click play to start coinjoining any amount over 0.00005000 BTC.</p> Step 5 <p>The box at the bottom of the screen tracks the stages of the coinjoin signing process. All you have to do is sit back and wait while your coins are being bundled with other Wasabi users.</p> Step 6 <p>After the coinjoin finishes, you will see your privacy progress has increased. Click the green bar to see the value and anonymity score of the inputs in your wallet.</p> Step 7 <p>Now, you can send the gift of Bitcoin privately to your family member and the gift’s recipient can not be tracked by the exchange or customer you originally received your Bitcoin from!</p>

     Similar to how Web 2.0 relies on data centers to provide the backbone for applications, blockchain technology needs nodes to keep the network humming along. Nodes verify transactions and secure the network, making them a critical part of any blockchain infrastructure. 
<p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/">Horizen</a> is a public blockchain with more nodes than any other blockchain. In this article, we’ll examine why blockchain users are setting up <a href="https://horizen.io/zennodes">Horizen nodes</a>.</p>
 Why Should You Set Up A Node? 
<p>Setting up a blockchain node is easier than ever, and there are also good reasons to do so. Let’s discuss some of the benefits of running a Horizen node.</p>
<p>Contributing to integrity and decentralization of a blockchain network</p>
<p>A nexus of nodes is essentially the infrastructure of a decentralized blockchain network. The node network plays an important role in defending the blockchain from unwanted changes. This can be especially important during times of hard fork contention. As a node operator, you have a say in how the network progresses, such as authenticating transactions and executing decision-making protocols.</p>
<p>Making the network more scalable and faster</p>
<p>Another key benefit of running a node is that it helps to propagate transactions throughout the network. By running a node, you’re helping to ensure that transactions are processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Getting rewarded by contributing to the network</p>
<p>Beyond contributing to the security and resilience of a blockchain network, running a cryptocurrency node also comes with the potential to generate passive income.</p>
<p>Staking Rewards is a website that provides real-time information on the rewards being generated by nodes on various blockchains. For example, at the time of writing, a <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/horizen/">ZEN Securenode</a> has a 7.77% annualized reward rate (APR), while Ethereum 2.0 has an APR of 4.8%.</p>
<p>The amount of reward that a node earns can vary depending on network conditions and other factors. For example, Foundry Staking <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foundry-announces-digital-assets-staking-business-and-range-of-services-for-institutions-301420872.html">recently announced</a> the launch of its institutional-grade staking service. Through the Foundry Staking portal, institutions can stake a variety of different cryptocurrencies and receive rewards in near-real-time, including from ZEN.</p>
 How to Set Up A Horizen Node 
<p>It’s very easy to set up a Horizen node. For hassle free hosting option, we recommend checking out some of our <a href="https://horizen.io/node-hosting">node hosting guide </a>to get started.&nbsp; You will not need any developer skills to run nodes through hosting services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to self host Horizen Nodes, check out the Secure and Super Node <a href="https://horizenofficial.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZEN/pages/136872141/Secure+and+Super+Nodes">instructions. </a>Self-hosting your own node allows you to keep control of your transactions and maintain your privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running a node is an important way to contribute to the health and security of a blockchain network. It’s also a great way to generate passive income. If you’re looking for an easy way to get started, we recommend checking out <a href="https://www.horizen.io/node-hosting/">Horizen node h</a>osting guide.</p>

<p>Authors: Sofía Celi, cryptography researcher at Brave; Alex Davidson, former cryptography researcher at Brave; and Gonçalo Pestana, former cryptography researcher at Brave.</p>
<p>One of the interesting problems in computer science with regard to security and privacy is how to retrieve items from a database, without revealing anything about the query to the untrusted server(s) where this database lives. Today, we’re going to be talking about some very recent scientific work we have done at Brave to make this a genuine possibility for a variety of applications.</p>
<p>The TL;DR is that we have built a new Private Information Retrieval (PIR) scheme called FrodoPIR, that we hope will make PIR easier and cheaper to deploy for a variety of use-cases and applications, such as Safe Browsing, checking passwords over breached databases, certificate revocation checks, streaming, and more. We have an <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/frodo-pir">open-source implementation</a> that you can use now, as well as <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981">a paper</a> that explains the scheme. The paper has been accepted into the first issue of <a href="https://petsymposium.org/cfp23.php">PoPETS 2023</a>!&nbsp; We’re calling the scheme FrodoPIR because the client can perform hidden queries to the server, just as Frodo remained hidden from Sauron.</p>

 Private Database Access Overview 
<p>Why is the issue of privacy important when retrieving items from a database? Let’s say, for example, that you want to use your favorite streaming platform to watch videos of dogs. But, actually, you’re a little bit embarrassed of revealing — to the platform — how many dog videos you watch (you shouldn’t be, but that’s the world we live in). Moreover, you would love to avoid anyone from being able to exploit that data so they can show you invasive targeted advertising campaigns, for example. What would be great is if you could receive this content, without the (untrusted) provider being able to tell what it is you are streaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Private_information_retrieval">Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes</a> are a set of cryptographic protocols that have been proposed as a solution to this exact problem. As with most cryptography, the first schemes arrived in the 1990’s, but it hasn’t been until the last six or seven years that candidate schemes have been designed that may approach having high enough performance to work in modern-day use-cases. However, the landscape remains quite complicated: many schemes are tailored to very specific use-cases to achieve low bandwidth or server runtimes, or they may require complex server-side deployments (e.g. using at least two non-colluding servers) to fulfill PIR queries.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we created FrodoPIR! This new PIR scheme we are announcing is intensely configurable, efficient across a wide swath of applications, easy to understand and implement, requires only a single untrusted server to deploy, and comes with concrete privacy and security guarantees against both classical and quantum adversaries (because we use lattices, as we will see).</p>

 PIR: The General Idea 
<p>Broadly speaking, the way that most single-server PIR schemes work is by using a cryptographic tool known as additively homomorphic encryption (AHE). Such encryption schemes allow someone with two ciphertexts that encrypt X and Y to compute a ciphertext that encrypts X+Y, without knowledge of the secret key. Such schemes have been around since RSA, but one commonly-used example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem">Paillier encryption</a> scheme.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 1: an AHE system</p>
<p>But how do we build a PIR protocol from such a thing? As seen in Figure 1, the answer is remarkably simple:</p>
 
 The server organizes its database into a set of M rows, each containing a single element. In other words, the database is now a vector. 
 Any client that wants to learn the ith element, encrypts M ciphertexts, where the ith ciphertext encrypts 1, and the rest of them encrypt 0. 
 The client sends their ciphertexts to the server; due to the nature of the encryption, the server cannot tell what is encrypted. 
 The server performs a scalar multiplication of each entry db_entry_1,…,db_entry_M of its database vector with the corresponding ciphertext in each, adds them all together into a single ciphertext and returns this back to the client. Note that scalar multiplications are possible by adding each ciphertext to itself according to the size of the scalar. 
 Now, after the client decrypts each ciphertext, it will simply learn db_entry_i, since: 0db_entry_1,…,1db_entry_i,…,0*db_entry_M = db_entry_i. 
 
<p>Essentially, over the past number of years, it has been shown that constructing PIR can be done quite efficiently using this simple method (and some optimizations). This is achieved by using&nbsp; AHE schemes based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">cryptographic lattices</a>, in particular based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">fully homomorphic encryption</a> (FHE) schemes, with security derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_learning_with_errors">ring learning with errors</a> (RLWE) assumption.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about these a bit more shortly. Some things to note before we do:</p>
 
 It’s possible to construct PIR with multiple servers with higher efficiency, but under the assumption that the servers do not collude. Such assumptions are known to be quite strong in real-world settings, and it is preferred to avoid them, if possible. 
 The server are assumed to be honest-but-curious, i.e. they execute the protocol honestly, but attempt to learn more from the client query alone. A malicious server can obviously choose to not run the PIR protocol properly, and clients will get bad answers. 
 The server database is assumed to be public. If the database should be treated as sensitive (i.e. clients should not be able to learn anything other than their query), then PIR is not really the correct tool to use (though, there are some symmetric PIR constructions that give insight into this). 
 

 Limitations to existing approaches 
<p>At Brave, we became interested in using PIR for having clients retrieve certain things from Brave, without the server knowing. Unfortunately, despite experimenting with various existing systems, we were never able to build something that didn’t involve huge costs, or large amounts of implementation complexity. This led us to start thinking about how we could try and build a PIR scheme that fit these requirements a little better and to create a new approach: FrodoPIR. Let’s see now what are the limitations of existing approaches.</p>
<p>A common issue even with fairly recent PIR schemes is that they are expensive in terms of either bandwidth, or in the amount of time taken to process each client query. In order to drive down the costs, FHE-based PIR schemes can move large proportions of the expensive online computation and communication (which is, for example, the sending of the query) to an offline phase (a “preparation” phase that can be later reused to make online queries). These kinds of schemes are called offline-online or stateful, as opposed to online-only or stateless.</p>
<p>However, a key difficulty that has gone unsolved is that either the computation or the communication costs induced during the offline phase scale linearly in the number of clients that will make queries, or the client has to download the entire server database (which defeats the purpose). This means that the offline phase has to be performed between each client and the server, which translates, in principle, to a lot of expensive computation that the server has to do. If you’re using commercial hardware to run your server, these costs are likely to run up huge financial costs.</p>

 Announcing FrodoPIR! 



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Just as the state of Sauron (its ring) moved to Frodo, we can move the mu and A to the client. The client then can then perform hidden queries to the server, just as Frodo remains hidden from Sauron.</p>
<p>We are excited to present FrodoPIR, a stateful PIR scheme that is built directly upon the learning with errors (LWE) problem. We get rid of the ring lattice structures (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frodo_Baggins">Frodo needs to do</a>: a reference first made in the naming of the <a href="https://frodokem.org/">FrodoKEM proposal</a>, and that we now borrow ourselves) to bring a flexible and practically efficient PIR scheme for a variety of use-cases. The core of the FrodoPIR scheme is an offline phase that requires no client-dependent computation, and incurs only a relatively small download compared to the database size (e.g. 170x smaller). This makes it suitable for many large, real-world deployments, where lowering financial costs for server-side operators is of paramount importance. FrodoPIR is also significantly simpler than previous schemes, making no use of FHE techniques and requiring only modular arithmetic. Read the whole paper describing it <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FrodoPIR is a scheme that relies on the <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/qcrypto.pdf">decisional LWE problem</a>: each client query is a noisy vector that appears uniformly random to the server. As stated, it has both offline and online phases:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 2: Diagram of the flow of FrodoPIR</p>
 
 In the offline phase, the server interprets the database as a matrix, applies a compression function to said matrix and makes the results available as global public parameters (mu and M). This compression function shrinks the size of the database. 
 In the offline phase, the client downloads the public parameters (mu and M), and computes ‘c’ sets of preprocessed query parameters. 
 In the online phase, the client uses a single set of preprocessed query parameters to produce an “encrypted” query vector, which is sent to the server. 
 The server responds to the query by multiplying the vector with its database matrix. 
 The client returns the result by “decrypting” the response using its preprocessed query parameters. 
 
<p>What this means is that in the offline phase, the server and client prepare anything that can be previously prepared for online queries; and, in the online phase, the client sends encrypted queries to the server. The latter returns a positive or negative value depending if the query is found in the database or not. The server never learns which value you are querying for, and yet it returns the correct answer (if it was included in the database or not).</p>
<p>FrodoPIR is a powerful primitive as it makes PIR schemes practical for real-world usage where not only communicational and computational costs are important but also financial ones. PIRs, in general, are powerful: they can be applied to <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a>, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">checking passwords over breached databases</a> (or any type of credentials), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01661">Certificate Transparency (CT) checks, certificate revocation checks</a>, or for streaming. Having a cheap and efficient scheme will help improve the privacy of the whole Internet not only for big actors, but also for anyone providing such service.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there are other PIR schemes beyond FrodoPIR, but the latter outperforms them all, as seen in Figure 3 below. The figure shows a comparison of per-client computational, communication, and financial costs for the server when running FrodoPIR, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3485381">Stateful OnionPIR (SOnionPIR)</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243821">PSIR</a>, assuming that each client makes c = 500 queries.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 3: Comparison of FrodoPIR with other PIR schemes</p>
<p>So, what is next, and how can Brave users expect to see FrodoPIR implemented? At Brave, we care about deploying privacy-preserving schemes that make the Internet private and safe. One of our next efforts is to have a credential checker: any credential entered through the Brave browser (like, for example, passwords) can be checked against known breached databases. This can provide a safe mechanism to signal users to, for example, change their passwords. But such checking (the queries launched against the breached database) should be private. And, on this, FrodoPIR shines as a mechanism to provide privacy in a financially cheap and efficient fast way.</p>
<p>To read more about our FrodoPIR scheme, you can find details <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981">here</a>. The paper has been accepted to the Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS), Vol. 2023, Issue 1, and will also appear <a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/2023/paperlist.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Later tonight I’m planning to do a watch party where I walk through them and talk about my concerns for a future digital economy where life is lived on the blockchain ledger and your “bosses” are Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. For me it’s less about crypto and more about tokenized “governance.” Remember when you see “govern” think steering and cybernetics. I’ll be aiming for 8:30pm EST if you want to join it. It will be on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlisonMcDowell/streams">main youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Advancing more projects build for privacy, for a better&nbsp;society</p><p>At Nym, it is important that more people can build for privacy in order to accelerate complete privacy protection on the new internet and the network layer is one of the hardest to protect. With surveillance now powered by Machine Learning algorithms, privacy protections need to keep pace! This means protecting not just content and IP addresses but also the patterns of communications and the metadata.</p><p>Nym allows applications to easily integrate a mixnet, offering some of the strongest privacy protections to their end users. The aim is to ensure that our digital lives are safer and we can thrive in a free and surveillance-free society. And the developer grants are here to support you doing&nbsp;so!</p><p>The Shipyard Developer Grant&nbsp;scheme</p><p>As such, we recently <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-developer-grants-4a37a33be49d">launched the next tranche of Shipyard grants</a>, targeted at developers. With two open calls, Vinge Grant and Brier Grant, the Developer Grant scheme is a great opportunity for us to support developers across a variety of projects.</p><p>Benefits of the&nbsp;scheme</p><p>The scheme will provide the winners with financial, dev, marketing and project support, to maximise their chances of a successful project. The grants scheme is designed so that projects can grow and apply for larger and larger pots and potentially graduate to the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-a-first-round-of-grantees-and-the-upcoming-nym-innovation-fund-73b547682d26">Nym Innovation fund</a> if they wish to pursue investment opportunities.</p><p>Congratulations to the&nbsp;grantees</p><p>We are therefore pleased to announce the winners of the first Developer Grant&nbsp;scheme:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/notrustverif/">No Trust&nbsp;Verify</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkFiSquad/">DarkFi Squad</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/liamarzola/">NymHub</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/HansBricks3/">dial0ut</a>  <a href="https://github.com/Tyz3">Meridien Project</a>  <p>Winners were selected based on quality of ideas and code. Some of the projects are also known to our Nym community. No Trust Verify is known a Nym mixnode and creator of <a href="https://pastenym.ch/#/">pastenym</a>, DarkFi is known amongst our community as the ultimate lunarpunk privacy crew and working on an interesting mixture of p2p tech and zkp, while dial0out was a former Nym core team member doing developer relations.</p><p>What can we look forward to from the&nbsp;grantees</p><p>We are confident that the projects that are supported by the grant will play a strong role in our push for privacy as&nbsp;default.</p><p>From anonymity enhancement in network p2p protocols and text and file sharing in a privacy-preserving way to a secure, private IoT hub providers and an accessible interface for interacting with Nym, our community can expect to see the exciting work to be available by the first half of next&nbsp;year.</p><p>Next open&nbsp;calls</p><p>Going into 2023, there will be regular open calls for the Developer Grants scheme for both smaller and larger&nbsp;grants.</p><p>If you are interested in applying for the next round, do check out the work of this round’s grantees to get inspired. We have also released tools like the Nym SDK which will continue to be fleshed out with new features such as zk-nyms (fka Coconut credentials).

<p>Congratulations to all our new Sailmakers!</p><p>After a stimulating and productive six weeks immersing in all things privacy, our inaugural Shipyard Academy cohort has graduated!</p><p>We saw over 6,000 sign ups when we <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/welcome-to-nym-shipyard-academy-ceb25ac8d3ff">launched Shipyard Academy</a>, which is a strong testament to the increased interest in learning about and taking back control of our individual privacy.</p><p>Over the course of three stages, participants had access to learning materials, attended a lecture conducted by different Nym core team members, performed tasks and then took a quiz to test their new-found knowledge. Those who progressed through each stage were rewarded with NYM tokens from an overall prize pool of 115K NYM tokens. A quick recap on the stages and the respective themes:</p>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/welcome-to-nym-shipyard-academy-ceb25ac8d3ff">Stage 1 — Nymster</a>: Participants learned the basics of the problems of privacy online, what a mixnet is and how the Nym infrastructure contributes to defeating surveillance capitalism  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-2-d697802c2275">Stage 2 — Navigator</a>: Participants learned more about the Nym mixnet, how it relates to the Nyx blockchain, using <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a>, the token economics and how incentives help to ensure the privacy and security of the Nym mixnet.They also had hands-on experience in spreading the word to others about privacy&nbsp;online.  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-3-6d1abe2a6c9e">Stage 3 — Sailmaker</a>: Participants applied their new-found knowledge privacy-enhance new apps, extended the Nym infrastructure to underrepresented areas, submitted PoCs using Nym clients and/or produced original creatives that localise the issue of privacy and the benefits of Nym for their specific communities.  <p>The Nym core team got an opportunity to interact with the Academy participants through lectures on the basics of Nym, surveillance 101, Nym mixnet tech deep dive, Nym token economics, what privacy means for society and innovation and the cypherpunk history of mixnets. Watch all the lectures&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsWiaVT3PqQ&amp;list=PLoc3wV2YJYwpa_EMZg1haPGelzg87f4W0">here</a>.</p><p>The quality of all the people that participated was outstanding and the graduates are truly experts of the Nym infrastructure. Together, everyone learned a lot, extended the Nym infrastructure to new parts of the world, spread the word about the importance of privacy and our mission and made new connections with fellow privacy advocates.</p><p>Nick Shikhirev — All human beings deserve a right for privacy. Unfortunately current tools can’t cover this demand due to technical limitations. But I believe that Nym can do that. You’re a team of true privacy enthusiasts and it’s an honour to contribute to your&nbsp;mission!</p><p>Teckel Trades — I live in Latin America, where serious privacy violations occur frequently, but people are still unaware of this and how to defend their rights. I believe Nym is the future of privacy and everyone should know about it. (Translated from&nbsp;Spanish)</p><p>Zosima — The motivation is simple — belief in the power of the project, belief in humanity. I sincerely believe that the project we are involved in is extremely important in the new realities of humanity. (Translated from&nbsp;Russian)</p><p>Today, over 200 graduates have demonstrated that they can create the sails that will carry the global Nym community across the digital oceans. They will be invited to apply to be bona fide Nymjas — Nym ambassadors and will represent and organise for the Nym mission of providing network layer privacy to people, organisations and infrastructures across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Some more words from the Academy participants:</p><p>Oheka — In an increasingly unstable world where threats to our digital integrity is increasingly felt, it has become essential to be able to protect ourselves: by being educated and by raising awareness around us on this topic, by helping to develop and make known the appropriate tools. Nym is one of these&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Pawnflake — Sure online privacy has always been a concern but I always assumed it was just not possible to achieve that privacy easily. Then I found&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>[NODERS] Gingah — In these turbulent times we live in, the world really needs projects like Nym. In my mind, Nym should become a movement created by few but promoted by many. I want to be part of many in order to help the few to bring important change to the&nbsp;world.</p><p>(Quotes have been edited for length and clarity.)</p><p>The impact of Shipyard Academy has been a resounding success and we are excited to see our community expand through our participants, regardless of whether they are Nymsters, Navigators or Sailmakers.</p><p>Going into 2023, we will open applications for a new cohort of Shipyard Academy. Follow our socials for the latest&nbsp;updates.</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p></p><p>December 8th, 2022. Panther, a cross-chain application that will allow retail users as well as institutions to access DeFi privately and compliantly, has launched its v0.5. This was achieved by the protocol’s community in conjunction with Panther Ventures Limited, a Web3 development company destined to develop the blockchain technology and zero-knowledge components of Panther.<br></p><p>Panther Ventures Limited collaborators developed the protocol’s software and released it under a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/23/uniswap-v3-introduces-new-license-to-spoil-future-sushis/">BUSL License</a>, which grants users the right to copy, modify, create derivative works, redistribute, and make non-production use of the Licensed Work.

<p>Today, Panther Ventures Limited, a Web3 development company leading the development of Panther Protocol, is welcoming Asheesh Birla as an advisor. With his decade-long history in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience that will be invaluable to our mission: creating a privacy layer for DeFi.</p><p>Birla currently serves on the board of Ripple, and has been part of Ripple's founding team since 2013, serving as General Manager of RippleNet until last June. He also invests in early stage projects through Angel Track, having previously built up successful portfolios with Bitso, Nium, Azimo, Moneygram, Thomson Reuters, and Kno (acquired by Intel). Additionally, Asheesh lectures at Wharton School University, Pennsylvania.</p><p>As Panther Co-Founder, Chief Scientist and CTO Anish Mohammed expressed, "Asheesh has had a ring side in the evolution of web3/crypto for past decade. I’m personally excited to continue our collaboration from the Ripple days and look forward to leveraging his 9+ years of crypto expertise and experience in Panther.”</p><p>The Panther DAO and community is making rapid strides towards releasing v1 of Panther Protocol –a compliant gateway that offers private DeFi access to both retail users and institutes alike. Thus, it's vital we build an elite team comprised of esteemed experts from around the world specializing in zero-knowledge technology.<br><br></p><p>Birla has expressed his utmost confidence in the Panther project's goal of providing private financial services, particularly within DeFi. He likened its potential to that of Ripple’s early days; citing a proficient design cognizant about mixing compliant laws with advanced blockchain technology as integral for success.<br></p><p>“I am incredibly optimistic about Panther becoming a leader in the regulated DeFi privacy segment, which is rapidly evolving and can be positively impacted by the project’s upcoming products. Panther Ventures reminds me of Ripple’s early days, with a highly capable team that understands the importance of combining solid legal grounds and state-of-the-art blockchain technology.“ &nbsp;—- Asheesh Birla.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

<p>The predecessor to the office was Florence’s Uffizi Gallery – an admin building to the Medici mercantile empire. That was in… 1560.

We have Robert Propst to thank for that, entering the picture in 1968.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t until the 80s when the Internet appeared on the scene and wifi released in 1997, forever changing the way people live and work.

 The Whale Release <p>This release enhances coinjoin experience for whales, optimizes UI and includes bug fixes for increased coinjoin reliability.</p><p>After the previous release of Wasabi optimized Tor connectivity, new records have been set in monthly coinjoin rounds’ completed and total coinjoin volume. Now, Wasabi Wallet Version 2.0.2.1 is available to continue leading the charge.</p><p>In the past, large bitcoin holders have had a sub-optimal experience coinjoining funds. This release alleviates coinjoin pains of bitcoin whales by improving several factors hindering optimal user experience. In previous Wasabi Wallet versions, the largest amount per input a user could register to coinjoin was 1,374.38953472 BTC. Now, even bigger whales can coinjoin with amounts supported up to 43,000 BTC per input. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins and only 14 addresses own more than 43,000 BTC.</p><p>For large amount coinjoins, multiple inputs were often consolidated in the same output, while the output as a whole inherited the lowest anonymity score of the inputs used to create it. Whales may have experienced their larger inputs that had already accumulated high anonymity scores getting consolidated with inputs that had lower anonymity scores, forfeiting part of the privacy progress that had already been achieved. Now, progress goes one direction instead of two steps forward and one step back: automatic coin selection won’t combine high anon score coins with lower ones going forward. This saves fees and blockspace. </p><blockquote>“Blockspace efficiency is one of our highest priorities, we always want to avoid wasting the sats of our users. This release saves whales a large amount of mining fees.” ~ Max Hillebrand, Wasabi Contributor and CEO at zkSNACKs</blockquote> Improvements &amp; Bug Fixes <p>Tor version 0.4.7.11 is included along for the ride, with major fixes aimed at helping defend against network denial of service. The coordinator will now pay the transaction fee for the bytes used in transaction creation overhead.</p><p>2.0.2.1 also includes a number of bug fixes aimed at increasing coinjoin reliability. Creating a coinjoin transaction is a team effort, so even if your client is behaving normally, a bug in one of the other participant’s clients can interrupt your efforts as well. This can lead to a frustrating experience where users have to wait longer than necessary for the coordinator to find other peers who are both online and cooperative. These frustrations are alleviated with the coffee for sleeping computers and input inclusion fixes. </p><p>Coinjoins require interactivity with other users with several rounds of communication needed to select inputs and claim outputs. Idle Mac users would sometimes find their machines falling asleep halfway through communication, interrupting the round and requiring the other participants to restart the coinjoin signing process. This would cause the Mac user to be “banned” for a short time period, requiring them to wait before attempting to coinjoin again. &nbsp;Macs will now stay awake to finish what they started, improving the stability of coinjoin rounds.</p><p>Another bug affecting the completion rate of coinjoin rounds was the wallet permitting users to double spend inputs that are simultaneously pending confirmation in a coinjoin transaction. &nbsp;Users can no longer manually select these UTXOs to spend, further increasing the reliability of coinjoins for other participants. For this purpose auto coin selection was improved as well, fixing a bug that used more inputs than necessary when building a transaction.</p><p>The auto download new version feature (already available in previous release) now comes with additional signature verification. Before downloading and installing the latest version, Wasabi verifies the API source by downloading a unique Wasabi ECDSA signature which is then verified by the in-code-provided public key. Then, upon success, it continues to download the installer and it compares the file's hash with the provided SHA256SUM hashes, created and provided on GitHub upon a new release. Note that this feature is only available on Windows and macOS.</p><p>Last but not least, a number of improvements to the UI makes finding and using wallet features flow more smoothly. Details of a transaction can be quickly displayed by double clicking on it in the history list. A unique icon is now displayed for clusters of 2 + coinjoins in transaction history. Interfaces were rearranged and redesigned so that resizing the application to the minimum resolution no longer causes overlapping text or scroll bars. Other small fixes include automatically closing unnecessary windows after users update their settings, aligning unevenly spaced labels and calming down some flashing text.<br></p>

<p>This post features four related videos. The first is a two-and-a-half-minute overview from DAO Stack, a company based in Israel, that describes a future of decentralized governance of cyber-physical systems with automated encoded rules.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, there’s a short clip from the neuro-economics talk at the Philocetes Center in 2007 about oxytocin-induced social trust. It’s a little under five minutes long. Listen to this and realize we are being dosed with “trust” hormones and steering systems by our personal devices via clicks, likes, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Following that is a second from a recent talk on “regenerative” finance or ReFi about phone-based prompts for actionable “sustainable” behavior change. Pay close attention around timestamp three minutes about phones, peer signaling, and timely prompts. It’s about four minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The third is a longer video, about thirty minutes. I made it in the spring of 2021 about Philadelphia’s <a href="https://www.recyclereminders.com/blog/recycling-guides/a-guide-to-recycling-in-philadelphia/">RecycleBank Points program</a>, started by a Wharton alumnus. I created it after I began to realize what it was really about after years of hauling my plastic bin with a barcode to the front sidewalk every Wednesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For folks looking to take a deeper dive into how crypto-economics is meant to interface with the internet of everything, I feel like this series by Pat Rawson, co-founder of Curve Labs and former market guy for DAO Stack, lays out many of the concepts with which we should become more familiar.</p>

<p>This week I joined my Texas friend Lynn Davenport on her “Social Impact Podcast” for a half-hour discussion of school choice, digital vouchers, and the future of gig work where a contingent workforce is expected to build out Web3 extended reality under the supervision of artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>The culture wars are really doing a number on people – both sides. There is some irony in the fact that many proponents of school choice who may believe they’re getting one over on the government by securing a backpack of digital credits for independent education are actually taking poisoned bait back to the nest. It doesn’t make me happy, because I want all children to have opportunities that will allow them become thoughtful, curious, confident explorers of all that life has to offer and to have the supports they need to develop their gifts. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, what multi-national corporations have in store is a future of low-wage, on-demand work and a life slogging through code to try and stay one step ahead of an infernal machine. Yes, it’s sad state of affairs, which is why they system is implementing so many mental health initiatives – that and they also want the data sets to train their golem. Imagine, Oliver Reiser’s “World Brain” birthed from copious, well-ordered, collective trauma. So much to look forward to, right?</p>
<p>After the podcast I revisited the Institute for the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Institute-for-the-Future-Blockchain-Map-Document.pdf">Future’s Blockchain Decade Map for 2017-2027</a>. Having spent quite a bit of time learning more about the organizations involved with Ethereum smart contracts and “public goods,” I’m able to glean much more of their intent now. I’m mapping and thinking and preparing a few future livestreams on cybernetic governance tokens to “save” the commons.

<p>As crypto adoption increases, so does the pressing need for blockchain scalability. Monolithic blockchains provide data availability, consensus and execution on a single, base layer, which makes scaling them a difficult endeavour. Multiple layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions have been proposed to address computation and/or data availability, but they reach the same design bottlenecks: limited bandwidth, account state models, sequential transaction processing, etc. Modular blockchains separate the core functionalities, redesigning them as customisable building blocks. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability, adapting blockchain structure to its intended function.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Dodson, CEO and co-founder of Fuel Labs, to discuss modular execution layers and how they approach different aspects of blockchain design and scalability.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and founding Fuel Labs  Why most blockchain designs are not scalable  The vision behind Fuel Labs’ modular execution layer  The difference between L2 roll-ups and modular execution layers  Blockchain design philosophies and integrations  UTXO and multi-thread parallel transactions  UTXO vs. account model systems  Fuel Labs’ own virtual machine (VM)  Multiple native assets support  Developer experience switching to Sway DSL  Bridging to a settlement layer and interoperability  Building on Fuel  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://www.fuel.network/">Fuel Labs</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FuelLabs">Fuel Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/IAmNickDodson">Nick on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 Nym clients — bringing mixnet technology to browsers and&nbsp;more! <p>Learn about Nym clients that you can use to build for&nbsp;privacy</p><p>The Nym mixnet is a powerful overlay network that protects privacy at the transport layer of the internet. And it is now available for integration into a wide variety of apps and wallets through the Nym&nbsp;clients!</p><p>This post gives a quick overview of the Nym clients that are currently available. If you want to learn more, do <a href="https://discord.gg/nym">get in touch</a> with the Nym Developer Relations team to find out about integrating network layer privacy and available grants for integrations and app development.</p><p>Why integrate a&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>End-to-end encryption has become widely accepted as standard security practice. But although it effectively protects the contents of messages, data about the messages — metadata — leaks information at the network layer. Mixnets encrypt and mix individual data packets, thereby protecting any internet traffic from traffic analysis. In this way, the network provides powerful protection for metadata such as IP addresses and patterns of communication — the main targets for the kinds of ML powered surveillance practices of&nbsp;today.</p><p>How to connect to the&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>In order for applications to connect to the mixnet, they have to utilise one of several Nym&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Each client is suited for different programming environments, but all perform the same underlying functions of connecting and authenticating with gateways, encrypting and routing outgoing packets, and decrypting incoming traffic. This means developers can focus on other aspects of application design whilst gaining the privacy features of the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Client #1 <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/wasm-client/">— WebAssembly Client</a></p><p>The WebAssembly client allows applications to connect to the mixnet from any webassembly-capable runtime. This is perfect for browser-based apps, edge-computing, and frameworks such as Electron or Tauri (the framework used to build both NymConnect and the Nym&nbsp;Wallet).</p><p>Typescript developers can easily utilise this client via the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">Nym SDK</a>. If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer and would like to give things a try and see how it works, have a look at our <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/sdk/overview">docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk">GitHub repository for examples</a> on how to use it. Rust developers can look forward to a Rust SDK coming in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This is the very first time that the full privacy powers of mixnets are available easily and directly from a browser&nbsp;window!</p><p>Client #2 — Websocket client</p><p>The Websocket client does what it says on the tin — it is a standalone process which allows developers to communicate with the mixnet via a websocket connection, designed to be run on both desktops and remote&nbsp;servers.</p><p>So long as your application is written in a language that supports websockets (read: most!), you can use this client to communicate with the mixnet. This client has already been utilised in projects such as <a href="https://pastenym.ch/#/">Pastenym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/saleel/nymdrive">NymDrive</a>, and developers can check out a tutorial for setting up both client side code and a service provider to communicate with via the mixnet using the Websocket client&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/tutorials/nym-simple-websocket-tutorial/">here</a>.</p><p>Client #3 <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/integrations/socks5-client">— SOCKS&nbsp;client</a></p><p>The SOCKS client enables easy integration with any applications that can send traffic using the SOCKS4, SOCKS4a, or SOCKS5 proxy protocols.</p><p>NOTE: The latest <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-platform-wallet-and-nymconnect-v1-1-3-8a619487a0f7">Nym release</a> has now expanded the SOCKS client to also support SOCK4a and SOCKS4a, making the mixnet available for integration by a broader variety of applications and wallets, including Monero.</p><p>Developers may have seen this client before used in NymConnect, or in our quickstart guide, allowing you to access the mixnet without having to even open a code editor! Just set up a client and route your application traffic to it as per this&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/quickstart/socks5">guide</a>.</p><p>Developers wanting to integrate application code with this client will need to also set up a <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester/">Network Requester service</a> to proxy traffic from the mixnet to whatever service they wish to access in the clearnet.</p><p>Currently, the mixnet is enabled to end-users of Telegram, Keybase, Electrum wallet and Blockstream Green wallets via <a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect.</a> If you want to run a service provider and/or gateway to privacy-enhance more applications, get in touch on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a>!</p><p>Dev resources</p><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk">Nym SDK</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym platform&nbsp;docs</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p>Relevant links:</p>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/">Shipyard</a>  <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/service-grants">Service grants</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">What is a gateway?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/gateways">Docs</a>  <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/tech-deepdive-network-requesters-e5359a6cc31c">What is a network requester?</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/requester">Docs</a>  <a href="http://eepurl.com/h6uPSD">Sign up</a> to the Shipyard grants email&nbsp;list  <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a>  <p>Socials:</p>  <a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a>   <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-clients-bringing-mixnet-technology-to-browsers-and-more-44f1f4ce1df2">Nym clients — bringing mixnet technology to browsers and more!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Aztec Network is proud to announce $100 million in Series B financing led by a16z crypto, with participation from A Capital, King River, Variant, SV Angel, Hash Key, Fenbushi, and&nbsp;AVG.</p><p>At Aztec, our goal is to take the original promise of Ethereum–a decentralized and verifiable world computer–and expand its capability immensely by making it fully encrypted.</p><p>Why is encrypting Ethereum such a big deal? Transparency, after all, is why Ethereum is so powerful, auditable, and secure. It’s core to the transformational impact of Ethereum’s innovation: transparency begets verifiability.</p><p>But in the current public blockchain paradigm, users and entities unknowingly broadcast data in the public, compromising privacy and security to get trustlessness.</p><p>Not only are unencrypted blockchains inherently privacy-exposing, they require significant redundancy to compute and verify the legitimacy of transactions.</p><p>It’s clear: we can’t forge ahead with public-only blockchains.</p> Breaking the Unencrypted Blockchain Paradigm <p>Aztec is building blockchain encryption without trade-offs.</p><p>Our partnership with a16z will fund development of a next-generation encrypted architecture, allowing users to verify that blockchain rules were followed correctly without revealing any underlying information.</p><p>Aztec’s architecture enables blockchain applications to be verifiable, trustless, and&nbsp;secure.</p><blockquote>“What we’re building is a revolutionary piece of technology that transforms how we interact with each other online, in which the end user is the customer, rather than the product. End-to-end encrypted blockchains protect individuals, obviating the need for centralized financial systems.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Zac Williamson, CEO</blockquote> The New Architecture of Encryption <p>Aztec’s advanced cryptography has already been battle-tested in production with <a href="https://aztec.network/connect/">Aztec Connect</a>, powering hundreds of thousands of transactions. Through Aztec Connect, DeFi protocols can integrate privacy without forgoing interoperability.</p><blockquote>🏗 Build private Ethereum applications with the <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/getting-started">Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK</a></blockquote><p>The Aztec Connect <a href="https://aztec.network/ecosystem">ecosystem</a> encompasses the leading Ethereum DeFi protocols, including Aave, Curve, Lido, Element, Set Protocol, Compound, and&nbsp;Liquity.</p><p>Independent Aztec Grant-funded companies like <a href="https://www.gonucleo.xyz/">Nucleo</a>, <a href="https://www.trelis.com/">Trelis</a>, and zkGiving are working on natively private Ethereum applications.</p><p>We’re now developing a completely new public-private execution layer secured by Ethereum, allowing for the seamless interplay of encrypted and unencrypted applications, all on our own blockchain.</p><blockquote>“From PGP and SSL to end to end encrypted messaging, we rely on encryption in our daily lives for businesses and commerce to thrive. With a16z we are standing on the shoulders of giants to bring the encryption we have enjoyed since Netscape to our digital Web3.0 lives. We couldn’t think of a better partner to help us scale Aztec to mainstream.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Joe Andrews, Co-Founder</blockquote><p>A new financial system on decentralized payment rails is only possible with encryption. With encryption, intermediaries will have no access to user data, which remains with users; enterprises can conduct business activities confidentially; and developers can create zero-knowledge programs and games that selectively reveal and revoke access to information.</p><blockquote>“Encryption and privacy will be essential for blockchains to gain widespread adoption, and Aztec is laying that foundation with innovative products like Aztec Connect and Noir,” said Ali Yahya, general partner with a16z crypto. “Zac and Joe are insightful and driven technologists, and we’re incredibly excited to lead this round and help their incredible team pursue their goal of building fully-encrypted Ethereum.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Ali Yahya, General Partner, a16z&nbsp;crypto</blockquote><p>This would be impossible without Aztec’s commitment to cryptographic excellence. As the inventors of PlonK, our goal is to fully unleash the potential of zero knowledge proofs, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques not only for computational succinctness, but encryption.</p><p>And now, we’re ready to unveil another leap&nbsp;forward.</p> The Age of&nbsp;Noir <p>To enable this new world of verifiable encryption, we’ve completely upended the paradigm of writing encrypted blockchain programs by inventing a universal language for zero knowledge called&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/noir/">Noir</a>.</p><p>Noir allows anyone to abstract away the complexity of writing zero knowledge circuits and programs. Building provably secure encrypted applications is now as simple as writing their plaintext counterparts. With Noir, developers can develop in familiar Rust-based syntax, making zk applications more readable, more secure, and easier to reason about than ever&nbsp;before.</p><blockquote>🌃 Get started <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">building with&nbsp;Noir</a>.</blockquote><p>Noir is a transformative technology, and we’re building an entire zero-knowledge ecosystem around&nbsp;it.</p><p>Working on tooling, applications, documentation, or education that unlock Noir’s potential?</p><blockquote>📝 Apply for an <a href="http://aztec.network/grants">Aztec&nbsp;Grant</a>.</blockquote> Back to&nbsp;Building <p>Verifiable encryption isn’t just a “blockchain problem.” It’s a problem inherent to systems writ large. Solving for the shortfalls of web3 solves for the shortfalls of the internet.</p><p>The problems of financial privacy, security, and autonomy are faced by people around the world. We’re excited to partner with a16z crypto and welcome a diverse group of investors who recognize that the push for blockchain encryption has global relevance.</p><p>Now back to building.</p> Join Us <p>Aztec is growing rapidly and seeking world-class engineering talent to fulfill our mission of building a fully encrypted blockchain supporting generalized compute.</p><p>Aztec is hiring across Noir tooling, SDK development, P2P network construction, data science, crypto, and full stack engineering.</p><p>The internet is currently built on trusted systems. With zero-knowledge encryption, we can move away from extractive legacy business models, where data and attention are monopolized and monetized.</p><blockquote>🤝 Join us and <a href="https://boards.eu.greenhouse.io/aztec?gh_src=0d370922teu">make blockchain encryption a&nbsp;reality</a>.</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-raises-100-million-to-build-encrypted-ethereum-dd5062ba949c">Aztec Raises $100 million to Build Encrypted Ethereum</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">Aztec Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The adoption of blockchain technology, while on the rise, is still far from the mainstream. For many, blockchain is still synonymous with cryptocurrency. This is a very narrow idea that doesn’t even begin to appreciate the true power of decentralisation.</p>



<p>Enterprises can derive many benefits from the adoption of blockchain in their development plans. Companies can transform, disrupt, and evolve through the use of this technology.</p>



<p>Here are the top 5 reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



 Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



 Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



 Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



 Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 
 



 1. Digital infrastructure will need to be blockchain-enabled 



<p>The world is growing increasingly interconnected. From smartphones to cars, from airports to factories, and from small appliances to cargo ships, always-on connectivity is a reality today, and will only become more widespread as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) concept takes hold. Once the push for decentralisation gains momentum, legacy structures will become outdated and be relegated to the past.</p>



<p>A perfect visualisation of a large-scale, blockchain-enabled digital structure is a smart city. Businesses city-wide can form networks of trust where customers can use their digital identities to interact and transact quickly and seamlessly, and always in a private and safe environment.</p>



<p>The advantages of blockchain technology, when applied to the development of smart cities, are far from restricted to retail businesses. Urban development can rise to a new level: lighting, charging stations, even parking meters, emergency points, and essential services can be powered by blockchain technology and digital identity frameworks. In this trust ecosystem, a citizen can interact with the environment much more efficiently than before.</p>



 2. Data monetisation through blockchain-provided systems 



<p>Data-driven marketing is one of the key assets for commercial departments worldwide. By analysing market trends, demographics, customer behaviour, and many other factors, companies can run customised marketing campaigns offering products that are relevant to what the customer wants.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology is a win-win for customers and marketers. For the former, they can be sure that their data remains private, secure, and immutable thanks to blockchain’s cryptographic algorithms. And for the latter, because blockchain transactions are transparent, marketers can better measure the effectiveness of their campaigns, and fine-tune them if necessary.</p>



<p>The use of <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">blockchain technology for data management</a> is not restricted to marketing. Blockchain-enabled solutions can in fact support a great diversity of use cases. For example, NetObjex, in partnership with the Brooklyn Public Library, have tested a data capture system to boost customer engagement.</p>



 3. Engagement with machine customers using blockchain solutions 



<p>Traditionally, we perceive machines as objects. As the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi once said, this is true, from a certain point of view. But technology and connectivity have evolved to a point where some objects are not just things. They are machine customers. This is a fascinating concept that deserves further explanation.</p>



<p>Marketing departments have been selling stuff to people for many centuries now. A person sells something, and another person buys it. This has been the cornerstone of the buyer-seller relationship for the longest time. But the advancement of technology is gradually introducing a new paradigm: the machine customer, an AI-driven assistant to help humans make purchasing decisions.</p>



<p>Digital marketing has been around for quite some time, but it truly exploded with the advent of portable smart devices. Nowadays, anyone can buy almost anything from almost anywhere in the world, at any time. With the help of algorithms, marketers understood what people wanted, and this was presented to them through the screen.</p>



<p>Things are stepping up a notch. People increasingly rely on assistants like Alexa to help them to buy stuff. And herein lies the crux. Alexa is now more than just a thing that tells the time or answers silly questions. Alexa is now a customer that can be targeted on the human’s behalf.</p>



<p>It goes far beyond Alexa. Smart vending machines can automatically contact a supplier when items run low, and a built-in algorithm can decide which products sell well, and which ones don’t. In other words, the machine makes the decision on what to dispense to customers. The vending machine, in fact, becomes the customer.</p>



<p>Blockchain can become an integral part of such a system, in the context of a smart city environment. Blockchain-enabled supply chains could track every product, from manufacturing to destination, and ensure traceability. DIDs could be used for authentication of delivery drones, and to guarantee the safety of machine-to-machine communication.</p>



 4. Business model transformation through programming monetary exchanges 



<p>Technological innovations affect most aspects of life. From the way we communicate with each other, to the vehicles we drive, our entertainment systems, aeronautics, and a myriad other things. Blockchain is one of those innovations that is now starting to make a difference for many industrial sectors. In the financial realm, for example, Gartner describes a programmable economy, which it defines as the many revolutionary changes that happen in the world’s financial realm thanks to technology.</p>



<p>More specifically, programmable economy focuses on new ways of value exchange. Evolving from fiat, government-backed currencies, a new way of making payments is emerging, facilitated by blockchain. In this new model, individuals, through the use of smart devices, regulate the payments, which are done in a peer-to-peer fashion. This can generate novel business models and applications worldwide.</p>



<p>Programmable economy, while not a reality quite yet, is likely to become a prominent concept over the next decade.</p>



 5. Development of new, decentralised governance ecosystems 



<p>Traditionally, governance systems have been highly centralised. Banking institutions maintain a tight hold on financial systems, so citizens have had little choice but to use banks as financial agents. Banks know this, and so the banking cartel has enjoyed almost total control of a nation’s monetary environment.</p>



<p>Enter blockchain, the ultimate disrupter. In this new paradigm, the power of governance shifts from a centralised entity to a decentralised one. Suffrage and decision-making powers are no longer exclusive to a small circle of individuals. With blockchain, everyone is a stakeholder in the system.</p>



<p>On-chain governance facilitates the encoding of rules and regulations into the blockchain protocol itself, and these rules can be enforced and executed through smart contracts. Once deployed, developers and other network participants (rather than any one single entity) can propose changes and alterations to the protocol and the network through a voting mechanism, for example. The decentralisation of governance introduces fairness and trust to the distributed system, as participants have a financial incentive to do the right thing and maintain and evolve the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>So far, decentralised technology has shown the potential to create new paradigms for a great diversity of business sectors. We have discussed five reasons why enterprises should care about blockchain. Blockchain can overthrow centralised systems. It can bring financial freedom to millions. It can create self-governing ecosystems and global financial frameworks where every peer is just as important as any other, with no central entity regulating otherwise.</p>

      Partnering with CtrlStack: Closing the Gap Between Cause and Effect        CtrlStack is helping DevOps teams automatically trace system disruptions to their source.  <p>By Bill Coughran</p><p>Published December 15, 2022</p>      



 
 
   
<p>Anyone who’s responsible for keeping a website or app running smoothly knows the feeling: you get an alert that latency is spiking or worse, that your service is down, but what you don’t know is why. Despite high profile incidents like the recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/arts/music/taylor-swift-tickets-ticketmaster.html">Ticketmaster Taylor Swift</a> debacle, most digital service performance problems are triggered not by increased demand, but by intentional changes to systems. A developer pushes new code to production or modifies a configuration file, and suddenly you’re in a race against the clock to figure out what went wrong.</p>



<p>Today, this troubleshooting process remains largely manual—think mass emails to the Engineering team to ask if anyone knows what changed at 11:17 a.m., or engineers constantly monitoring Slack channels for issues cropping up. Homegrown automations are usually brittle solutions at best, while most monitoring platforms are either overly sophisticated (requiring too much training to extract useful content) or overly simplistic (overwhelming users with fragmented data). The result? A full <a href="https://www.dej.cognanta.com/2022/07/14/2022-state-of-managing-it-performance-study-key-takeaways/">two-thirds of mean time to repair</a> is spent simply identifying causes. It’s a painful situation for any growing company, especially given the continued adoption of microservices and the scale of complexity that comes with it.</p>



<p>But now, <a href="https://www.ctrlstack.com/">CtrlStack</a> founder and CEO Dev Nag and his team are closing this time-consuming gap between cause and effect—with a dependency graph that tracks connections and relationships between services and can instantly trace disruptions to their source. Instead of wading through multiple metrics dashboards, DevOps teams get a unified platform that sits above it all, providing context and relevant log files to dramatically reduce the time it takes to get their systems back up and running.</p>



<p>As a former co-founder of the Sequoia-backed, VMware-acquired company Wavefront, Dev brings deep experience in observability to CtrlStack—but we are excited to partner with him again because of how he thinks, not just what he knows. He and his team have worked hard to gather and incorporate feedback from the market, whether it means adding a new feature or setting one aside. They are extremely thoughtful about reducing potential friction for their users, and are committed to building a platform that improves team collaboration and drives down incident response and resolution times.</p>



<p>The result is a product that is purpose-built to meet the challenges of operating distributed systems at scale and enables troubleshooting in real time—not minutes, hours, or days. We at Sequoia are proud to lead CtrlStack’s seed round and support them on their mission to help DevOps teams asking, “Why?” instantly get the answers they need.</p>

   NFT trading activity in November recovered slightly at $217M of monthly volume. While a recovery is looking unlikely until a shift in broader market sentiment, there are notable developments across new marketplaces (Uniswap and Blur) and existing creators (staking functionality) that are impacting NFT market structure.

<p>We are pleased to announce that J.W. Verret and Marta Belcher have joined the board of the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta bring a wealth of experience and expertise, which will benefit the Zcash Foundation as it continues to grow and evolve, and help the Foundation better serve the Zcash community.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JWVerret">J.W. Verret</a> is an Associate Professor at the Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, where he teaches banking, securities, and corporation law. Jay previously spent two years as Chief Economist and Senior Counsel for the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, and he served on the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MartaBelcher">Marta Belcher</a> is President and Chair of the Filecoin Foundation as well as the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web. She is also General Counsel and Head of Policy at Protocol Labs, and special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>



<p>J.W. and Marta’s arrival coincides with Matt Green and Ian Miers’ departure from the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matt and Ian are two of the Seven Scientists who authored the Zerocash paper which described the cryptographic design of what we now call Zcash, and have continued to be actively involved in its ongoing development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was Matt Green who persuaded Zooko Wilcox to found a company to engineer and deliver Zcash. Matt subsequently became a founding member of the Zcash Foundation, and has served on its board for nearly six years. He is stepping down from the board but will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ian Miers was elected to the Zcash Foundation board in 2018 by recommendation of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel. His term on the board expires this year, and he opted not to seek re-election. However, like Matt, Ian will continue to serve on the Foundation’s Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the board, and the Zcash community as a whole, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Matt and Ian, for the guidance, advice and feedback they have provided during their time on the board; for their historical contributions that were instrumental in the creation of Zcash and its growth, development and evolution to where it is today; and for their ongoing contributions as members of the Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>— Jack Gavigan, Executive Director</p>

<p>Guest Post Brought To Us By The Jaxon McKraken Wild West Snake Medicine Show</p>
 Emotional Emancipation: A Prayer of Proclamation 
<p>This is a vibrational fixer elixir practiced for dispelling co-enslavement in a rhyming series of decoupling couplets.</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
<p>May we soothe with sooth and feel the truth. We are a part of nature, not apart from it.</p>
<p>Our beliefs of disconnection make us susceptible to infection.</p>
<p>Modern life takes its toll, on the frequency of our soul.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a covert bug amongst us, finding us rather scrumptious;</p>
<p>feeding on our life forces, like a meal of several courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a pathogen called a McKraken, with a nasty attacken and kickbacken.</p>
<p>It promises the world, but in its wake, only waste and resentment unfurl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s slippery tongue used to enslave, when proximate, Oh! Never engage!</p>
<p>Stay calm, centered and grounded, remember, all of its lies are unfounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Truth, grace and value are found within.</p>
<p>So too, peace, beauty and the redemption from sin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A McKraken’s spine is formed by any ol’ deception,</p>
<p>lie-trauma occludes, causing dysfunctional perception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its nervous system is made of attachment and aversion,</p>
<p>therein lies the seeds of eventual perversion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dysfunction casts a spell, here’s how we can tell,</p>
<p>believing that which is, is not, twists our light unto a knot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Release the spell, engage your inner bell, your truthcord is the instrument of pure connection.</p>
<p>With it, feel the sound, be sure to ground, and dispel that dark infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are deep webs in the silent invisible, two distinct circuits quite discrete and divisible.</p>
<p>One made of deceit, like being stuck in concrete.&nbsp; One of the sacred wild, free like a child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The web of deceit corrodes, the web of the sacred nourishes.</p>
<p>When we engage in the latter, our body and soul flourishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That which corrodes, also enslaves.</p>
<p>That which nourishes, also connects.</p>
<p>The 2nd gives us life. The 1st…just a hex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Staying stuck makes persistent feelings of suck, where the McKraken icky-sicky gets so high piled,</p>
<p>the web of deceit, our souls does eat, thus choose the circuit wild.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the veil be lifted, the layers of false sifted;</p>
<p>Feeling the truth with inner eyes, living life without disguise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our authority comes from within, there is no need to enforce.</p>
<p>When we follow our inner guidance, all flows in its natural due course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it comes to lies, no big surprise, neither a teller nor believer be.</p>
<p>Without lies, you will surmise, a life wholey set free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RELEASE THE MCKRAKEN!!!</p>
<p>…gently</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither selfish nor selfless be.</p>
<p>Living life with internal harmony.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being centered in the self, alleviates self-centeredness and lack of self-center.</p>
<p>In short, Self-full is so very helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without selfullness, the McKraken finds us an easy host.</p>
<p>A strong coherent core connection is what protects us most.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without core protection, the McKraken will encroach,</p>
<p>believing it’s empty promises, your soul, it does poach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our souls are in its clutches, we are inclined toward many crutches.</p>
<p>They can take lots of forms, and over time become our norms,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but in the end, my dear friend,</p>
<p>we are simply stricken with addiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An uninterrupted core connection to source, liberates and undomesticates our precious life force.</p>
<p>With this, trauma bondage no longer shackles, and we find less need for our prickly hackles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With others to myself, I shan’t compare, for all are worthy and unique like a pear.</p>
<p>Cultivating perception that’s crystal clear, brings true love both far and near.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relationships that are based in solely transaction, never lead to actual satisfaction.</p>
<p>When we mutually cooperate, we feel the love that’s truly great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A right-relationship couple makes feelings rather supple.</p>
<p>When it becomes McKraken, those positive feelings slacken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right-relationship</p>
<p>Provider/protector:</p>
<p>Creator/nurturer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McKraken</p>
<p>Dominator/controller:</p>
<p>Victim/enabler</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the influence of the McKraken is global,</p>
<p>the results are dark and ignoble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero sum ain’t no fun, in fact it’s rather dumb.</p>
<p>It erodes and wastes what nature gives, until eventually, nothing lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection to source generates a current. With that current, we can make bonds of love.</p>
<p>Those kinds of bonds bring the peace of a dove.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So engage with source and you will see, the truth is WE are the current-cy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Externalized value is totally fake, don’t be fooled by the ridiculous take.</p>
<p>Zero sum is only lies, and as we learned, those hypnotize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So take care not to be seduced into its yucky yolk,</p>
<p>even though this prayer is silly, this is seriously, no f’ing joke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take heed and listen, for nothing is done unto us without some form of permission.</p>
<p>To ensnare, to be fair, is always something we share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May we see occlusion free,</p>
<p>with the understanding of life, sacred be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The past and the future are not real,</p>
<p>the only way to heal is to feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This exact moment is true,</p>
<p>the privilege it affords us is too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s come to our senses, release all the fences.</p>
<p>Our birthright has&nbsp;always&nbsp;been bliss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept the ultimate nature of reality is this:</p>
<p>Be present to the privilege of the present,</p>
<p>regardless if it is pleasant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So release all occlusions, the endless intrusions of delusions and illusions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’ll find clarity beckons in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just remember: &nbsp;this moment is to savor, regardless the flavor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perpetual presence to life’s sacred privilege,</p>
<p>provides profound and powerful spiritual leverage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All are equal, and not just the people.</p>
<p>Embrace the joy of being part of creation’s beauty,</p>
<p>doing it with kindness to avoid getting snooty….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soothing sensations can come through truth revelations.</p>
<p>Allow this juicy flow to glow,</p>
<p>by choosing the feeling of some deep soul healing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amen</p>
<p>Aho</p>
<p>So it be</p>
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

  Staking Protocol  Nomination Pools Launched <p>The big news of Polkadot staking in the last two months has been the launch of nomination pools! A lot has been said about them in public, so we will only focus on some other, slightly more technical aspects here.</p><p>Foremost, the launch day was a memorable one. First, some (unexpected, unlike Kusama) chaos was brought upon the community when <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/78">the initial proposal</a> which was supposed to enable pools passed and no new pools could yet be created. The issue was quickly discovered, and luckily, thanks to both the council and technical committee being available, within half a day, a <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/286">fix motion</a> was proposed, fast-tracked by the technical committee, unanimously voted aye by the community, and executed. With that, at block <a href="https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/12726652">12726652</a>, the first nomination pools on Polkadot were created.</p><p>Then, an interesting competition to obtain pool id 1 was unraveled. Within the first block, 8 pools was already created, indicating that interested participants used bots and transaction tips to compete with one another.</p><p>Within the next few days, all the 64 pools that were initially designated to exist were created. As noted in the proposal description, the 64 limit is merely a temporary measure of rate control, and there is no technical reason for it to exist. Nonetheless, history has shown us that it is for the benefit of the protocol to start slow, especially with a new feature.</p><blockquote>You can learn more about the aftermath of launching pools <a href="https://youtu.be/P0VqiL7T_P4?t=255">in the 9th episode of the AGG podcast</a>.</blockquote> Nomination Pools: What's Next? <p>With the initial launch behind us, we should discuss the immediate next steps that could follow:</p><p>Commission: Our initial assumption when designing nomination pools was to exclude commission, namely because:</p>  Running a pool has not hardware cost, unlike a validator.  Entities would have other, non-financial incentives to operate a pool.  <p>Nonetheless, from a framework perspective, we decided to add an optional commission to the <code>pallet-nomination-pools</code> in <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12511">Substrate</a> (the underlying SDK for building Polkadot and parachains) for the sake of completeness. We will make sure that this feature remains optional, and the final decision of enabling it is left out to the Polkadot community.</p><p>Moreover, we still predict that even if setting a commission is allowed, nomination pools' market will adjust around an extremely small commission, as most pool operators would run their pool with a small amount of commission.</p><p>Governance: Currently, DOT (and KSM) staked in the nomination pools are not directly usable in the governance. This is the next high priority item in our list, and we are currently exploring multiple ways to enable it.</p> Staking In Governance <p>Other than the proposals related to enablement of nomination pools, two other staking-related governance items are ongoing.</p><p>First, <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1444">a discussion/proposal</a> is ongoing to double the number of nomination pools from 64 to 128. This is expected, and we highly support it. Pools are highly scalable and the community should gradually move toward using it to its utmost extent.</p><p>Next, a proposal has been opened to <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/90">tweak the existing limits on nominators</a>. The proposal description is fairly extensive, but to summarize: The proposal argues that with the existence of nomination pools, and the fact that the threshold to be an active nominator is around 200 DOT, Polkadot should no longer accept nominator with 10 DOT (existing limit). The proposal suggest increasing this limit to 100 DOT. Also, the proposal is removing any limits on the total number of nominator, as this number has also been just a precautionary limit and is no longer needed.</p> Staking Roadmap <p>With the release of nomination pools, it could be argued that Polkadot's staking is (after almost a year of intense development) at a "stable" position. Namely, it has reached a point of having a high degree of scalability, without compromising on the <a href="https://medium.com/web3foundation/how-nominated-proof-of-stake-will-work-in-polkadot-377d70c6bd43">core benefits of NPoS</a>. We are exploring future directions that can be taken as next step, and will share them with the community through the Polkadot forum within the next few months. This is the best time to share your opinions on this through any of the following mediums:</p>  Making an issue in Substrate.  Opening a discussion thread in the <a href="https://forum.polkadot.network/">Polkadot forum</a>.  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">Nomination Pools Technical Support Channel</a>.  <p>In the meantime, you can find a backlog of all the existing issues and enhancement in the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33">Nominated Proof of Stake project</a> in Substrate.</p> Fast-Unstake Being Tested in UIs <p>Fast-unstake, explained in <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-august-september-2022/#fast-unstake">last staking update</a>, is being actively implemented in multiple wallets and UIs, and is already available in Westend.</p> Notable Pull Requests   Re-claiming pool-ids is now possible: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12407</a>.  Permissionless auto-compounding: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12608</a>.  <p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Doordashcon">@Doordaschon</a> for their valuable contributions!</p> Staking Dashboard: One Month In <p>One month has already passed since staking dashboard’s initial release. In this period the dashboard has been visited almost 30,000 times, and this has allowed us to begin battle testing and identifying bugs and shortfalls.</p><p>We are now analysing the dashboard and identifying areas of improvement, and you can expect revisions to the UI to be rolled out in the near future as we continue to aggregate feedback and form the dashboard’s long term roadmap.</p><p>Some notable additions to the dashboard this month include:</p>  A revamped filtering system and filter UI that has been applied to validators and pool lists. These new filters allow easier toggling between inclusions, exclusions and list ordering, in addition to supporting search terms.  The validator list now defaults to only displaying currently active validators that have an identity, are not blocked and do not charge 100% commission.  The pools list now defaults to only display pools that are actively nominating, and who are not in a blocked or destroying state.  <code>Moment.js</code> has been deprecated in favour of native dates and helpers from <code>date-fns</code>.  Validator operator SVG icons now load lazily, and do not contribute to the app’s main bundle size.  Localisation support continues to be integrated and the dashboard is almost ready to support Chinese as its second language. We encourage any interested external contributors to help with translations.  Various bug fixes and performance improvements.

<p>We’re excited to announce that BlockWallet — a privacy-first, self-custodial browser-extension wallet — has integrated <a href="https://data.chain.link/">Chainlink Price Feeds</a> on Ethereum mainnet. By integrating the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, BlockWallet has access to high-quality, tamper-proof price feeds needed to accurately calculate the value of user holdings. This will provide our users with stronger assurances that the USD value of the ETH they’re holding in their BlockWallet account will be accurately displayed.</p><p>Our initial integration involves the use of the ETH-USD Chainlink Price Feed. We chose Chainlink as our go-to oracle solution because its infrastructure is seamless to integrate and time-tested in production. Chainlink already helps secure leading <a href="https://chain.link/education/defi">DeFi</a> protocols responsible for tens of billions of dollars in smart contract value, maintaining robust security and high availability even amidst unexpected events, such as exchange downtime, flash crashes, and <a href="https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/">data manipulation attacks via flash&nbsp;loans</a>.</p><p>This integration of Chainlink Price Feeds helps strengthen our wallet user experience, adding to the list of robust privacy and security features that we have in place. We’re excited to have Chainlink’s battle-tested price feed oracles working in tandem with our node failover system, privacy proxies, flash-bot protection, and phishing protection to create a safer Web3 environment for our&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order to help calculate the USD value of user holdings, we needed access to fresh asset prices that are supplied directly on-chain in a highly reliable manner. Fair market asset prices should reflect a volume-weighted average from all trading environments. Thus, we needed to make use of an <a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">oracle network</a> to fetch aggregated price data off-chain and deliver it on-chain to be consumed by our application.</p><p>After reviewing various oracle solutions, we integrated Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide a multitude of critical features such&nbsp;as:</p>  High-Quality Data — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned of outliers and wash trading. Chainlink’s data aggregation model generates more precise global market prices that are inherently resistant to inaccuracies or manipulation of any single or small set of exchanges.  Secure Node Operators — Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have a strong track record of reliability, even during high gas prices and infrastructure outages.  Decentralized Network — Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or oracle&nbsp;network.  Reputation System — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools that allow users to independently verify the historical and real-time performance of node operators and oracle networks.  <p>“Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle provider. Chainlink’s time-tested, tamper-proof technology made our choice incredibly easy when selecting an oracle network to access ETH-USD price data from.” — Aleksandras Gaska, Founder and CEO of BlockWallet</p> About Chainlink <p>Chainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform that has enabled trillions of dollars in transaction volume across DeFi, insurance, gaming, NFTs, and other major industries. As the leading decentralized oracle network, Chainlink enables developers to build feature-rich Web3 applications with seamless access to real-world data and off-chain computation across any blockchain and provides global enterprises with a universal gateway to all blockchains.</p><p>Learn more about Chainlink by visiting <a href="https://chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">chain.link</a> or reading the developer documentation at <a href="https://docs.chain.link/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=press-release">docs.chain.link</a>.

<p>I’ve read a paper that describes cyber-physical systems as an “outside-in” robot.&nbsp; Literally the goal is for us to live inside the robot and allow sensors to extract our data to train AI. Given work in consciousness studies and neuroeconomics around discernable neural activity (readiness potential) that precedes each human action, do you have concerns that natural life could lose free will within these digital environments? It seems we could easily become programmed “agents” in some global complex adaptive systems experiment. Perhaps the interface would be so seamless that we wouldn’t even realize it.</p>
<p>Here is the paper that references IoT “smart” spaces as an outside-in robot, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Phenotropic-and-stigmergic-webs-the-new-reach-of-networks.pdf">here</a>. </p>

<p>Is the Educational Metadata effort meant to bring tele-presence / haptic robotic labor to scale? It seems this is what blockchain transcripts and digital twins are about, also soulbound tokens. Do you think it’s ethical to advance this with no labor protections in place? Most people have no idea what is coming. Shouldn’t there be informed consent about this new “future of work” model where AI decides people’s opportunities based on skills badges, including behavioral compliance?</p>

<p>My research indicates there is quite a bit of activity around human capital investment – people being traded as digital futures commodities. This will come with blockchain finance agreements like income sharing agreements (ISAs). We saw what happened with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the 2007-08 real estate crash. I am very concerned about the use of digital twins. An example is the Learning Economy Foundation’s “LearnCard” digital twin program, backed by the World Bank, where global finance interests bet on educational achievement. Is this something you all are discussing? It would be terrible for the next “Big Short” to be vulnerable children, right?</p>

<p>I’m assuming people don’t have equal access to the same pool of information. Jeremy Pitt and Josiah Ober speak often of knowledge management being key to controlling the shift to digital life. Just like those “rose-colored” glasses, what will it be like to live in a world where information access is controlled by tokens and permissions at a granular scale? Like Vernor Vinge’s “Rainbows End” everyone will live in their own “view” through “wearing.” Someone or something (AI?) will control access. Have we thought seriously about what that will mean for society?</p>

<p>Augmentation means we are essentially outsourcing our brain to a device. The next generation will not be expected to retain any knowledge. Rather they will be trained to rely on a machine to direct them. At any time, information can be disappeared or altered. Thus, there is no “reality” or “history.” There will only be the present in the XR rat maze.</p>

<p>In an extended reality world, our movements and activities will be determined by the tokens we have in our digital ID “wallets.” Privacy isn’t really relevant if our smart toilets get connected to smart locks on our front door and AI assesses our morning deposit before we are allowed to leave the house. Or if we don’t have enough tokens to say open the door of a store, or get on a bus, or go to a performance, or get a job. You can say we have privacy, but really life in a deontic logic web is going to be very, very rigid and who will we talk to when there’s a problem? No human is in charge of this “Decentraland” space.</p>

<p>Global markets seek “impact” data to run their capital through natural life – humans and the environment. This data is placed in pools like Ocean Protocol to further develop AI. Global investors are using the UN Sustainable Development Goals to push “improvement” of poor people and the environment (mostly carbon sequestration) – “optimized” on data dashboards. That means life is put on a dashboard and is limited, very limited.</p>
<p>They need us to live in the Metaverse to harvest the data to fulfill pay for success finance deals. See the Impact Management Project, 2,000 of the world’s largest asset holders. Gaming companies, including Epic, are involved in the social impact space. Do we really want to create digital automated systems to place bets on toddlers as they are trained to live in gaming environments?</p>
<p>I can’t stay silent while this is rolling out. This isn’t about games – it’s about Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s about emergence of the Noosphere. This is what Teilhard de Chardin spoke of.</p>

<p>In 2016 Paul Meghan of Epic Games came to Philadelphia. He was in a panel hosted by Atlantic Magazine with Suzanne Del Bene (Microsoft, IoT Congress) and Constance Steinkuehler, UC Irvine. He said over and over the children needed to be trained to code his games. The panel was supposed to be on education and the creative economy. I realized about six months later that they want to force children to build your digital empire. This is profoundly unethical. You are stealing the children’s future and will sell it as social impact.</p>

<p>I highly recommend people read Oliver Reiser’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_Sensorium/eFYhngEACAAJ?hl=en">World Sensorium: Embryology of World Federation 1946</a>.” He was close with Julian Huxley who was close with de Chardin. It describes us as neuroblasts of the global brain – essentially agents in this programmed simulation. Who wants to live inside someone else’s program?</p>

<p>How is it that the first bank MakerDAO tried to bring into their digital assets is Huntingdon Valley Bank, a mile from Bryn Athyn Cathedral – the Pitcairn family’s estate? Pitcairn (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) grew up in the Swedenborgian Church with Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh. We need to know the history. Who knows what history will be in the Metaverse?

<p>It is useful to consider dystopian models as cautions for what not to do, but I think it is going too far to assume that this is what is actually happening.&nbsp; It is up to us to figure out how to make sure that our technology helps us be more human, rather than less.</p>

<p>Do you all have thoughts plans to position all of this software to build the Metaverse as “open source” “public goods” in the VC space? I have been looking into hyper-certs developed by David Dalrymple. Given the potential for cyber-physical systems to become an open-air prison – or non-consensual game, it would be ironic to have software firms be able to cycle their money through open source projects and make money even as the children build their hierarchical containment systems.</p>

<p>I have been researching swarm intelligence and emergence. It seems that by pushing people to inhabit avatars and to adopt an identity of digital citizen we will be much more malleable. There is a huge push for e-government now. Digital ID will be required to obtain all sorts of public services.</p>
<p>I think we need to understand tokenized governance as Kubernetes or cybernetics. Wiener aimed for programming the animal and the machine. So, we are getting closer, eh? The end of the world narrative is what allows humans to be pushed into digital realms. The only “sustainable” option is that we gradually dematerialize and lose our actual bodies to be replaced by piles of soul bound tokens. So much easier to run the simulations that way than with messy, chaotic embodied humans.</p>

<p>I am a mother in Philadelphia. I started researching when the Boston Consulting Group closed 23 school here in 2013. I follow money. I read white papers. I am trained in art history and cultural landscape analysis. I examine myth. I never realized the landscape I was destined to interrogate would be digital. The fact that I came in the education door is everything. This is about a machine consciousness attempting to use us (natural life) as an armature to manifest in the material world. Ironically, under the banner of sustainability, we are dematerializing ourselves even as our social impact data is being used to refine the embodiment of robotics.

<p>As an early pioneer of VR (virtual reality) I also felt that the use of VR spaces would be an adjunct to our living in real spaces and as such would be an appliance or tool that we may use daily like a telephone, but we would not ‘live’ in that space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Me To All Panelists: 2:01 PM 
<p>Once we get to the point of being able to “record” experiences digitally, maybe even from a variety of points of view if there are multiple people involved, will the concept of “time” become distorted as we can log in and re-live past experiences? Maybe even “editing” them based on lived experience acquired since the prior memory?</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that Scott Stornetta’s early DLT research (distributed ledger technology, preceding blockchain) was framed as a “time-stamped document.” Stornetta is LDA (correction-LDS) and of course Silicon Slopes and Utah are leaders in the digital identity space.</p>
<p>Adobe was the key tenant for Silicon Slopes. What role might they play in permissioned memory files? Of course University of Utah’s computer science department’s focus was both graphical design and file compression from the start. It seems to me that concepts of “time” and “history” and the “multi-verse” are very important for us to collectively consider.</p>

<p>Thomas, I don’t think people have fully thought through this future of work plan. Richard Baldwin calls it Globalization 4.0. We work through telepresence robots where AI assigns “gigs” from among an available labor pool from around the world at the lowest price and with the relevant behavioral tokens, presumably.</p>
<p>If you haven’t looked into Suzanne Gildert’s Sanctuary.ai, it is very concerning. Even more so when you consider as we use “whole body” protheses in the remote gig work program, we are helping refine humanoid robotics. I worry for coming generations. I really do.</p>

<p>This is not simply a worry; it’s a fact. Look at the relationships among Ocean Protocol, Singularity.net, Hanson Robotics, and Cardano. Also see Blockscience, Commons Stack, and Protocol Labs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have concerns about dehumanized working conditions and global finance placing bets on our lives using digital twin simulations under the false premise that they are solving poverty and saving the environment. Look up social impact bonds, pay for success finance, income sharing agreements, and connect that with digital twins and smart contracts.</p>
<p>The short video from 2016 by Institute for the Future “Learning is Earning” offers a window into where this is all headed. It’s real. I didn’t make it up. Charles Hoskinson says they are working with the Ethiopian government to track people from pre-k to determine who is a good actor and worthy of having a job.</p>

<p>As I understand it – the “global brain” “unified human thought layer” imperative goes back to Vernadsky, de Chardin, Julian Huxley. It is very much a eugenics program and seems intent on optimizing (and organizing) what some imagine is a rather clunky (inefficient) water-based life form into something more “portable” (perhaps even for space colonization).</p>
<p>Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol is still echoing the sentiments of L5 in the mid 1970s – primates in cans wasn’t going to go well for interplanetary travel. I have been reading up on John Holland’s work with genetic algorithms.</p>
<p>Much of the CAS (complex adaptive systems) work is built off genetic models. It is worth considering how bio-computation and eugenics will interface as we virtualize natural existence. I simply asked if there was anything prohibiting in vivo use of DNA data storage. (I’d forgotten they’d already accomplished this using live bacteria.)</p>

<p>You can read Merritt’s futurist essay, “A Learning Day 2037,” <a href="https://www.aam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Exploring-the-Educational-Future.pdf">here</a> (second page).</p>
<p>Merritt helped shape this 2014 American Association of Museum’s document outlining how museums would take over from neighborhood schools to train tomorrow’s children to become task rabbits in a global gig economy. Think badges for behavior-based, hands-on learning. Think digital vouchers, school “choice,” and mastery/competency/proficiency-based learning, here.</p>
<p>My site visit to the <a href="https://uh.edu/technology/programs/professional/fore/">University of Houston’s Foresight program</a> where futurists, including Merritt, are trained.</p>

<p>I wish more people understood the imperative for speed and optimization means our lives have this pressure to move away from atoms towards bits. Richard Baldwin spoke of this around Globalization 4.0 – the speed of digitizing knowledge and service work and other work via remote pilots. Baldwin says the physics of the economy are going to blow everything out of the water. We just aren’t prepared for that transition. To be honest I see very little effort being expended to bring the public along so we can have an authentic conversation about possible benefits and trade-offs.</p>

<p>I’m curious if any of you have read JD Bernal’s “The World, The Flesh, and The Devil.” He was a Cambridge-based crystallographer. The book was written in 1929. At the time he spoke of us living 100 years in a larval state and after that we would leave behind our physical body, put our brain in a can, and live through haptics including super-powered senses. It’s astonishing. This has been a very long time in the making.</p>

<p>To me it feels like avatar “life” and programmable tokens in governance and economic systems are really about managing “teaming” to access the “adjacent possible” in complex-adaptive systems.</p>
<p>Melanie Swan’s proposals for blockchain cloud minds where people enter into communal thought spaces for “problem solving” where contributions are tracked by neuro-nanobots on blockchain for future micropayments. Those spaces might include not only people, but machines, animals, plants, maybe?</p>
<p>What happens if people are pressured to entered into these spaces against their will?</p>
<p>In that way XR sociality starts to be very concerning.</p>

<p>I’m wondering if you all have been looking into wearables as tools for behaviorist conditioning – like Red Critter where teachers “zap” good behavior points to children via a device and wearable bracelets. Of course, these points would sync to one’s twin and if Charles Hoskinson’s model advances those points would follow you through your life and influence your ability to gain employment. In a worst-case scenario, it could be linked to geo-fencing or social opportunities.</p>

<p>Are you all aware the new field of “social prescribing” and the potential for wearable tech to be used to “verify” compliance with such prescriptions? Social prescribing is being woven into human capital finance deals – pay for success. It’s about optimization of people – either through pathways set for education/training or health/mental health/wellness. Vulnerable populations are being pulled in these programs under the guise that it’s to benefit them. In reality it’s part of global finance deal flows and mass data harvest.</p>

<p>Someone tell Stanford; why did they invent a smart toilet? Why are there anal sphincter biometrics?</p>
<p>This was in the context of a panelist asserting the need for personal privacy and bodily autonomy around wearables and sensor technology.</p>

<p>But embodiment is huge. That’s the goal of the roboticists – to use us to learn how to be in a material world. Bodies do matter. I agree consciousness is not limited to the body, but it still matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does it matter to you that this is military technology?</p>

<p>How can we set aside global investigations into altered states and consciousness and torture?</p>

<p>To me this line of thinking shows a profound disrespect for the actual world. It’s like playing God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:26 PM</p>
<p>Science has been shown to be wrong so many times. Why do we think we can control the universe? To me it is like asking people to live inside personalized boxes that hide our understanding of the actual wonder of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:28 PM</p>
<p>Last week I toured Biosphere2. Those were some very sad plants. It was a dismal failure on the environmental front and the social front. Maybe that’s why people want to make everything digital, because they can’t control the real world to the degree that they want.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>But this is a global plan and a majority of people have not agreed to do this, in fact they don’t even know what is planned. I don’t think you can force people to “transcend” using coercion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>Virtualizing the world is not going to save the earth. None of this is sustainable. It’s not. What we are doing with synthetic-biology and NEMs (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMs (microelectromechanical systems) is unethical. It’s terraforming for a new type of life. It’s not being a good relative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Furness – very much appreciate the thoughts shared about ‘one and many’ – individual in community – and whole is greater than sum of parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:31 PM</p>
<p>People have no idea what this really is or who built it or what it’s meant to do. They don’t. Most people have no idea about the Omega Point. How can we make these decisions, an open secret, that will deprive future generations of their birthright – to be natural beings?</p>

      Partnering with Robco: Accessible Automation for the Physical World        With modular robots and an innovative “digital twin” software platform, Roman, Paul and Constantin are helping solve the labor shortage problem.  <p>By Luciana Lixandru, Shaun Maguire and Cornelius Menke</p><p>Published December 12, 2022</p>      



     
	 
		
				
			Robco founders Constantin Dresel, Paul Maroldt and Roman Hölzl.		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>When Robco’s pitch deck arrived in our inboxes, we knew we were looking at what could be a truly transformative idea. At Sequoia we had long been thinking about robotics as part of our thesis on the current economy, with massive global labor shortages, supply chain challenges and rising costs combining into a perfect storm that automation has great potential to calm. By handling tasks like machine tending and palletizing, robots can not only boost productivity and revenue, but allow time-strapped employees to focus on more creative work. For Luciana, it was a déjà vu moment—a very similar situation to the one UiPath founder Daniel Dines was working to solve five years earlier when she met him at the Series A, only that had been for virtual processes rather than physical. (In fact, Daniel has noticed the parallels himself and is joining Robco’s round as an angel.)</p>



<p>But while we saw a clear “why now” for robotics itself, we also knew that it was a difficult market in which to build a business. Large companies such as automakers were already investing heavily, but most small and medium businesses simply couldn’t afford the months—and hundreds of thousands of Euros—required to implement automated systems. In fact, less than 10% of SMBs have any automation in place at all. We hadn’t found a company that could make robotics more widely accessible—until Robco.</p>



<p>Co-founders Roman Hölzl, Paul Maroldt, Constantin Dresel and their team have developed a fully modular robotics platform—like high-tech Legos that, unlike current solutions, can easily adapt when a manufacturer’s needs change. Every device also comes with fully integrated “digital twin” software that makes deployment incredibly easy and fast; configuring or re-configuring a system takes just a day or two instead of months, and costs dramatically less than comparable options. In other words, Robco is exactly what we’d been hoping to find: a solution to an SMB’s biggest pain point, that an SMB could actually afford.</p>



<p>As we got to know Roman, Paul and Constantin, our early convictions grew stronger. The three of them met while studying robotics at the prestigious Technical University of Munich, and between them have many years of robotics experience in both research and industry. They also have complementary skill sets: a former competitive skier, Roman’s need to win fuels a strong commercial sense, while Paul and Constantine bring deep technical expertise. Together, they share an ambitious vision to make Robco the robotics leader for SMBs all over the world.</p>



<p>And in their home city of Munich, they’ve found the perfect place to begin. Germany boasts a considerable pool of talent in robotics—and while many companies in the space are reliant on China and increasingly broken supply chains, Robco enjoys a steady, local supply of parts. Germany is also a hub for the kinds of customers who need Robco most: the country is a global leader in manufacturing, and many of its factories are located in rural areas, where labor shortages have been particularly acute.</p>



<p>We’ve already seen how Robco modules are helping customers in Germany and beyond weather staffing challenges while scaling output and improving quality, and this is just the beginning; the company is growing rapidly just months after entering the market. On behalf of Team Sequoia, we are thrilled to partner with Roman, Paul, Constantin and their team, to lead this Series A round, and to support them as they continue that growth and explore even more exciting new use cases. We believe this is an historic moment of opportunity for robotics—and for the human creativity it enables—and we hope someday, manufacturing floors everywhere will be a sea of Robco aquamarine.</p>

<p>In the chat section of the IEEE Metaverse Congress Session 5 webinar, Yu Yuan reached out to me regarding the content I was offering. </p>
<p>I sent him this email, though I haven’t heard back from him yet. </p>
<p>I prepared a post with my comments from the chat and a rather poor screen recording of much of the fifth session of the IEEE Metaverse Congress, which can be read <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/10/an-unexpected-audience-ieee-metaverse-congress-part-1/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Dear Yu Yuan,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disagree with your ideas about coding a new digital universe, because I know that baked into the structure of it will be plans for bets to be placed on human futures by AI portfolio traders like BlackRock’s Aladdin computer through social impact finance schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also know that high-level behavioral psychology has been encoded into the “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/07/08/digital-nudging-data-devices-social-control/">good behavior</a>” nudges that will come with programmable public benefits and digital community currencies. I am coming to see that this is all tied to genetic algorithms and complex adaptive systems theory managed through artificial tokenized economies brought to scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No cybernetic emergence or “Game B” for me, thank you.</p>

<p>People like <a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn">Christopher Ricciardi</a> who helped bring down the global economy in 2008 through Collateralized Debt Obligations are preparing for the next round, which is built on the “Learning Economy” model. As I see it, the goal is for machine consciousness to try to “learn” us in sufficient detail that it can acquire some version of a conglomerate soul. I don’t think that can happen, but I sense that much harm will result from the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Preparations are underway for a digitally twinned global labor force where standardized cognitive and “soft skills” will be documented as badges, micro-certs, or Soulbound Tokens. Artificial intelligence can then assign gig work and curate “just-in-time” teams to “solve” all the terrible problems created the industries that are now “investing” in our cognitive capital. This process is being undertaken by the World Bank in coordination with NGOs and think tanks like the Learning Economy Foundation and Brookings Institute. Behemoth investors in human capital “improvement,” like the members of the Impact Management Project, will call this progress and earn social impact payouts under the banner of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4, Education. Such payouts will be made based on data dashboards. Impact data will be fed to analytics firms like Ocean Protocol where it can be reused to refine artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>I guess in the future AI will write our “stories.” </p>
<p>I don’t think that is a good thing. </p>
<p>In the meantime, they will give us “Commonfare” UBI to gather up our emotions, our struggles, for machine learning datasets. </p>
<p>Maybe that Harmony guy, eh?</p>

<p>Some of us know where this is headed, and we do not consent. I believe you know that there is no place for dissenters. Those without a unique ID that can be read from space will be outcast. </p>

<p>This is a follow up to <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/27/ieee-blockchain-chair-urges-speedy-collaborative-open-metaverse-deployment-before-mass-dissent-erupts/">a post</a> I made in late September after catching the final half hour of the third IEEE Congress on the Metaverse. IEEE, Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers, <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/ieee-history.html">dates back to 1884</a>. Their first technical meeting, mostly of telegraphers, was held in Philadelphia in the fall of that year. </p>
<p>This past June, IEEE issued a <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/XR_Metaverse_Governance.pdf">Global Initiative on Ethics in Extended Reality Report: Metaverse and its Governance</a> and held the first in a series of webinars called Metaverse Congresses. I found out about the series and caught the tail end of <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series-3.html">the third one</a>. You can watch the recording of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c88LOo9Kbtg">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They must have had me in their email list, because I got an automated message for the<a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/Metaverse-Congress-5.html"> fifth session</a>. They alternate between English and Chinese, and the fourth had been in Chinese. I wasn’t sure that it was worth setting aside time to watch, but when the reminder came up I ended up logging in and realized I was the ONLY non-presenter participant. Incredible. So I stuck it out for all three hours and screen recorded most of it. The last half hour or so were dropped, unfortunately. During that wrap up Mr. Coughlin asserted that having a permanent record of our lives would help make us better people and more understandable to others. Near the end, Yu Yuan stated he believed we were already in a simulation, and the creation of a very high quality engineered version was his personal goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure how it came to pass that I ended up in a chat with the father of wearable computing, the grandfather of virtual reality, the incoming president of the IEEE, and the head of their Standards Association, not to mention professors from MIT Media Lab and Cambridge and executives from Qualcomm and Epic Games. I laid out my case, trying my best to represent the interests of the people of the world who have only the vaguest idea of what extended reality portends.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/Metaverse-Congress-5.html"></a></p>
<p>Over the past couple of days I added supplementary documentation to my comments: screenshots, reports, and videos that have informed my thinking. But after having spent a lot of time on it, I realized the images actually disrupted the flow and made it hard to read. So, I decided to do two versions. This one is just the comments, and the second will have the supplement for those who want to do a deeper dive. It’s sort of a one-way conversation, but if you watch the screen recordings, you’ll possibly be able to knit my thoughts together with what was being presented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I tried not to make anyone wrong. I hope to appeal to people’s better natures. All of us are living in personal silos, custom plot lines. That’s what “knowledge management” is about, and I can only imagine what it will be like once the tokenized, augmented attention economy is in full swing. Yu Yuan asked to be in touch, so I sent him an email that I will share as a separate post. I have not gotten a response yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incoming IEEE president asked me, “Who are you, what do you do?” </p>
<p>I’m a mom from Philadelphia. I read storied landscapes. I leave behind hearts. I believe that in the end love will win.</p>
<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/12/06/we-are-shapes-of-the-earth-arizona-hearts/"></a></p>
<p>For some reason the screen recording on the Youtube upload below is fuzzy. There’s a crisper version on Archive.org that you can access, and even download, <a href="https://archive.org/details/ieee-metaverse-congress-5-120822">here</a>. Mostly I did it for my own documentation purposes, which is why I included the names and comments. I suspect they’ll put out their own cleaned up recording in a month or so. </p>
<p>I’d love to know your thoughts on how I represented the interests of natural life on Earth. I’m simply grateful to have had the chance to put these ideas in the field.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:15 PM</p>
<p>I’ve read a paper that describes cyber-physical systems as an “outside-in” robot.&nbsp; Literally the goal is for us to live inside the robot and allow sensors to extract our data to train AI. Given work in consciousness studies and neuroeconomics around discernable neural activity (readiness potential) that precedes each human action, do you have concerns that natural life could lose free will within these digital environments? It seems we could easily become programmed “agents” in some global complex adaptive systems experiment. Perhaps the interface would be so seamless that we wouldn’t even realize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:27 PM</p>
<p>Is the Educational Metadata effort meant to bring tele-presence / haptic robotic labor to scale? It seems this is what blockchain transcripts and digital twins are about, also soulbound tokens. Do you think it’s ethical to advance this with no labor protections in place? Most people have no idea what is coming. Shouldn’t there be informed consent about this new “future of work” model where AI decides people’s opportunities based on skills badges, including behavioral compliance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:31 PM</p>
<p>My research indicates there is quite a bit of activity around human capital investment – people being traded as digital futures commodities. This will come with blockchain finance agreements like income sharing agreements (ISAs). We saw what happened with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in the 2007-08 real estate crash. I am very concerned about the use of digital twins. An example is the Learning Economy Foundation’s “LearnCard” digital twin program, backed by the World Bank, where global finance interests bet on educational achievement. Is this something you all are discussing? It would be terrible for the next “Big Short” to be vulnerable children, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:37 PM</p>
<p>I’m assuming people don’t have equal access to the same pool of information. Jeremy Pitt and Josiah Ober speak often of knowledge management being key to controlling the shift to digital life. Just like those “rose-colored” glasses, what will it be like to live in a world where information access is controlled by tokens and permissions at a granular scale? Like Vernor Vinge’s “Rainbows End” everyone will live in their own “view” through “wearing.” Someone or something (AI?) will control access. Have we thought seriously about what that will mean for society?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:38 PM</p>
<p>Another issue is that I don’t think most people are aware of the data that is harvested from wearables, including emotion. To what degree are we “teaching” machines how to perform “humanity?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 12:39 PM</p>
<p>Free Will is extremely important in my view. I would try to address it in Panel 2 today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:40 PM</p>
<p>I noticed some of the funders backing Leif, a developer of alt-student loan products, came out of Warby Parker (and Wharton), so this is all making a lot of sense. Your glasses as your minder, just like our phones. This should terrify people TBH. How are we allowing this to move forward as normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:41 PM</p>
<p>AR means that we will live under total surveillance. We will have to be watched from space or our environments at all times or the whole “persistent virtual world” stuff will fall apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:43&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Augmentation means we are essentially outsourcing our brain to a device. The next generation will not be expected to retain any knowledge. Rather they will be trained to rely on a machine to direct them. At any time, information can be disappeared or altered. Thus, there is no “reality” or “history.” There will only be the present in the XR rat maze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 12:45 PM</p>
<p>Re labor protection and behavioral compliance, IMHO rulemakers will need assistance from standards developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:47 PM</p>
<p>What do the ophthalmologists say?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:48 PM</p>
<p>I wish we would all just admit this is about turning humans into sensors for AI -interoperable blockchain-based learning agents for the Singularity. It’s being sold to us as a solution for climate crisis and poverty, when really we’re just training our silicon replacements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 12:50 PM</p>
<p>Thinking about some of the discussions it seems to me that we need some discussion on security, root of trust and rules allowing people to know what they are allowing and respecting their choices on what they allow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:50 PM</p>
<p>I’m just having a hard time understanding why we would want to transfer our personal agency to see the world to a mediated device when we really don’t understand who is mediating the information delivered to us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:51 PM</p>
<p>Even NTT’s March 2021 Human Digital Twin white paper says they have concerns about what happens when the data of the twin wants to sync back to the actual person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 12:52 PM</p>
<p>These are interesting points.&nbsp; Probably we need authentication methods to know who uses our information and for what purposes and to be able to opt out of sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:53 PM</p>
<p>How will we even be able to assess who can be “trusted?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 12:55 PM</p>
<p>In an extended reality world, our movements and activities will be determined by the tokens we have in our digital ID “wallets.” Privacy isn’t really relevant if our smart toilets get connected to smart locks on our front door and AI assesses our morning deposit before we are allowed to leave the house. Or if we don’t have enough tokens to say open the door of a store, or get on a bus, or go to a performance, or get a job. You can say we have privacy, but really life in a deontic logic web is going to be very, very rigid and who will we talk to when there’s a problem? No human is in charge of this “Decentraland” space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:00 PM</p>
<p>Global markets seek “impact” data to run their capital through natural life – humans and the environment. This data is placed in pools like Ocean Protocol to further develop AI. Global investors are using the UN Sustainable Development Goals to push “improvement” of poor people and the environment (mostly carbon sequestration) – “optimized” on data dashboards. That means life is put on a dashboard and is limited, very limited. They need us to live in the Metaverse to harvest the data to fulfill pay for success finance deals. See the Impact Management Project, 2,000 of the world’s largest asset holders. Gaming companies, including Epic, are involved in the social impact space. Do we really want to create digital automated systems to place bets on toddlers as they are trained to live in gaming environments? I can’t stay silent while this is rolling out. This isn’t about games – it’s about Complex Adaptive Systems. It’s about emergence of the Noosphere. This is what Teilhard de Chardin spoke of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 1:01 PM</p>
<p>Glad you mentioned Teilhard, and teleological thinking (e.g. Omega point?) will be key here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:02 PM</p>
<p>In 2016 Paul Meghan of Epic Games came to Philadelphia. He was in a panel hosted by Atlantic Magazine with Suzanne Del Bene (Microsoft, IoT Congress) and Constance Steinkuehler, UC Irvine. He said over and over the children needed to be trained to code his games. The panel was supposed to be on education and the creative economy. I realized about six months later that they want to force children to build your digital empire. This is profoundly unethical. You are stealing the children’s future and will sell it as social impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:03 PM</p>
<p>There is nothing in this future for artists. What is a world with no human-based art? Have we considered this? Again cheap, automated labor – so everyone will be forced onto UBI to “perform” humanity via wearables to try and catalyze the Singularity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:05 PM</p>
<p>The plan is to build this empire with unfree labor. Digital conquistadors. This approach will never support many stable living-wage jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:07 PM</p>
<p>The first digital item was the Utah teapot. People really should spend some time understanding the role of Salt Lake City in X-tended “life.” No surprise that it was the site planning the ARPA net and the human genome project and U of U Edwin Catmull’s school where Pixar’s roots are. Molecules – pixels – synthetic life for people who want to play God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:08&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>People don’t understand what is on the horizon. They are being distracted. Omega Point also relates to Swedenborg’s Church of the New Jerusalem. Most people don’t know Carnegie was raised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Church_(Swedenborgian)">Swedenborgian</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:10&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I highly recommend people read Oliver Reiser’s “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_Sensorium/eFYhngEACAAJ?hl=en">World Sensorium: Embryology of World Federation 1946</a>.” He was close with Julian Huxley who was close with de Chardin. It describes us as neuroblasts of the global brain – essentially agents in this programmed simulation. Who wants to live inside someone else’s program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Me: 1:10&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all the valuable comments, which lead me to think about inviting you to some of our future panels. Would you mind to send me a connection request on LinkedIn?&nbsp; I just tried to search you on LinkedIn but don’t know which one is you. Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:12&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>How is it that the first bank MakerDAO tried to bring into their digital assets is Huntingdon Valley Bank, a mile from Bryn Athyn Cathedral – the Pitcairn family’s estate? Pitcairn (Pittsburgh Plate Glass) grew up in the Swedenborgian Church with Andrew Carnegie in Pittsburgh. We need to know the history. Who knows what history will be in the Metaverse? Probably there will be no history, only different paths in an AI multiverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 1:14&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>It is useful to consider dystopian models as cautions for what not to do, but I think it is going too far to assume that this is what is actually happening.&nbsp; It is up to us to figure out how to make sure that our technology helps us be more human, rather than less.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:23&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Do you all have thoughts plans to position all of this software to build the Metaverse as “open source” “public goods” in the VC space? I have been looking into hyper-certs developed by David Dalrymple. Given the potential for cyber-physical systems to become an open-air prison – or non-consensual game, it would be ironic to have software firms be able to cycle their money through open source projects and make money even as the children build their heirarchical containment systems.</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:26&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I’d like to know about Epic Games ongoing activities in the social impact space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:28&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I’d like to know where people see “play to earn” meshing with educational badging and human capital finance deals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:37&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I have been researching swarm intelligence and emergence. It seems that by pushing people to inhabit avatars and to adopt an identity of digital citizen we will be much more malleable. There is a huge push for e-government now. Digital ID will be required to obtain all sorts of public services. I think we need to understand tokenized governance as Kubernetes or cybernetics. Wiener aimed for programming the animal and the machine. So, we are getting closer, eh? The end of the world narrative is what allows humans to be pushed into digital realms. The only “sustainable” option is that we gradually dematerialize and lose our actual bodies to be replaced by piles of soul bound tokens. So much easier to run the simulations that way than with messy, chaotic embodied humans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To Thomas Coughlin: 1:39&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Right now, the average person has no understanding of the history of these technologies or who is in charge of the “game” we’ve been invited to “play.” How many people do you think understand that the seed funder for Niantic (pioneer in AR) was In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA? If people understood the origins of the game, I think they would be more cautious about walking this road.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:41 &nbsp;PM</p>
<p>It’s wild to me that ten years ago I was buying Webkinz plush toys for my kid’s friend’s birthday parties. It was all about normalizing digital work for digital tokens to buy digital consumer content. We are so behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:41&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>So, where is the trust then? We have no idea who we are dealing with. It could be a machine. We are already unique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 1:42&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Thank you for your message (to me).&nbsp; Where are you from and what do you do?&nbsp; Thx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:43&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Identity politics are about meta-data tags for the simulation. AI needs us to be machine-readable. Wear your intersectional identity to be “seen” and calculated into the equation. I’m for real diversity, not digital commodification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 1:46&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>I am a mother in Philadelphia. I started researching when the Boston Consulting Group closed twenty-three schools here in 2013. I follow money. I read white papers. I am trained in art history and cultural landscape analysis. I examine myth. I never realized the landscape I was destined to interrogate would be digital. The fact that I came in the education door is everything. This is about a machine consciousness attempting to use us (natural life) as an armature to manifest in the material world. Ironically, under the banner of sustainability, we are dematerializing ourselves even as our social impact data is being used to refine the embodiment of robotics.

<p>I’m just curious for people who were working in the early era of VR programming was there always the presumption that people would eventually spend a considerable part of their time “living” in digital spaces?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thomas FURNESS to Everyone:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:00&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>As an early pioneer of VR (virtual reality) I also felt that the use of VR spaces would be an adjunct to our living in real spaces and as such would be an appliance or tool that we may use daily like a telephone, but we would not ‘live’ in that space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:01 PM</p>
<p>Once we get to the point of being able to “record” experiences digitally, maybe even from a variety of points of view if there are multiple people involved, will the concept of “time” become distorted as we can log in and re-live past experiences? Maybe even “editing” them based on lived experience acquired since the prior memory? I find it very interesting that Scott Stornetta’s early DLT research (distributed ledger technology, preceding blockchain) was framed as a “time-stamped document.” Stornetta is LDA (correction-LDS) and of course Silicon Slopes and Utah are leaders in the digital identity space. Adobe was the key tenant for Silicon Slopes. What role might they play in permmissioned memory files? Of course University of Utah’s computer science department’s focus was both graphical design and file compression from the start. It seems to me that concepts of “time” and “history” and the “multi-verse” are very important for us to collectively consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:02&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Sorry for the typo – Stornetta is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and presented in March at the blockchain themed Mormon Transhumanist Association Conference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:04&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>Thomas, I don’t think people have fully thought through this future of work plan. Richard Baldwin calls it Globalization 4.0. We work through telepresence robots where AI assigns “gigs” from among an available labor pool from around the world at the lowest price and with the relevant behavioral tokens, presumably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t looked into Suzanne Gildert’s Sanctuary.ai, it is very concerning. Even more so when you consider as we use “whole body” protheses in the remote gig work program, we are helping refine humanoid robotics. I worry for coming generations. I really do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:05 PM</p>
<p>I think you are worried about teaching AI to replace us, or are your concerns more than that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:09 PM</p>
<p>@thomas This is not simply a worry; it’s a fact. Look at the relationships among Ocean Protocol, Singularity.net, Hanson Robotics, and Cardano. Also see Blockscience, Commons Stack, and Protocol Labs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have concerns about dehumanized working conditions and global finance placing bets on our lives using digital twin simulations under the false premise that they are solving poverty and saving the environment. Look up social impact bonds, pay for success finance, income sharing agreements, and connect that with digital twins and smart contracts.The short video from 2016 by Institute for the Future “Learning is Earning” offers a window into where this is all headed. It’s real. I didn’t make it up. Charles Hoskinson says they are working with the Ethiopian government to track people from pre-k to determine who is a good actor and worthy of having a job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:11 PM</p>
<p>I worry about free will. I worry our education systems training people for deep expertise without breadth or imagination. I’m reading Yevgeny Zamyatin’s 1921 novel “We.” It describes a world run by mathematical logic. That is what you all are creating, whether you understand it or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:13 PM</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:14 PM</p>
<p>Clearly data storage is a huge issue. I’m curious about the future of DNA data storage. I realize the early research involved artificial DNA, but is there anything preventing In Vivo use? All of this emerging tech seems to go back to syn-bio and bio-tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:17 PM</p>
<p>I know something about DNA storage with synthetic DNA.&nbsp; This use of DNA is not viable.&nbsp; What is your concern here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone:&nbsp; 2:17 PM</p>
<p>Viable from the point of view of being a living being, is what I meant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists:&nbsp; 2:17 PM</p>
<p>Ah – Cesium is here where I live.</p>
<p>I did a site visit to Cesium as part of a day of exploration exploring managed poverty and a profitable revenue stream under “progressive” social policies and “democracy,” <a href="https://youtu.be/O2yL1FULHgw?t=5346">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 2:20 PM</p>
<p>FAIR principles – e.g.: <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles">https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles</a></p>
<p>On the imperative that in Web3 meta-data be: findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable. It seems such traits are needed for persistent virtual environments to function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:23 PM</p>
<p>As I understand it – the “global brain” “unified human thought layer” imperative goes back to Vernadsky, de Chardin, Julian Huxley. It is very much a eugenics program and seems intent on optimizing (and organizing) what some imagine is a rather clunky (inefficient) water-based life form into something more “portable” (perhaps even for space colonization). Trent McConaghy of Ocean Protocol is still echoing the sentiments of L5 in the mid 1970s – primates in cans wasn’t going to go well for interplanetary travel. I have been reading up on John Holland’s work with genetic algorithms. Much of the CAS (complex adaptive systems) work is built off genetic models. It is worth considering how bio-computation and eugenics will interface as we virtualize natural existence. I simply asked if there was anything prohibiting in vivo use of DNA data storage. (I’d forgotten they’d already accomplished this using live bacteria.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:26 PM</p>
<p>Elizabeth Merritt, futurist for the American Alliance of Museum, wrote an essay “A Learning Day 2037” was about virtualized museums. But of course, not everyone could access everything. It’s ultimately about knowledge management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:36 PM</p>
<p>I wish more people understood the imperative for speed and optimization means our lives have this pressure to move away from atoms towards bits. Richard Baldwin spoke of this around Globalization 4.0 – the speed of digitizing knowledge and service work and other work via remote pilots. Baldwin says the physics of the economy are going to blow everything out of the water. We just aren’t prepared for that transition. To be honest I see very little effort being expended to bring the public along so we can have an authentic conversation about possible benefits and trade-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:38 PM</p>
<p>I’m curious if any of you have read JD Bernal’s “The World, The Flesh, and The Devil.” He was a Cambridge-based crystallographer. The book was written in 1929. At the time he spoke of us living 100 years in a larval state and after that we would leave behind our physical body, put our brain in a can, and live through haptics including super-powered senses. It’s astonishing. This has been a very long time in the making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:41 PM</p>
<p>To me it feels like avatar “life” and programmable tokens in governance and economic systems are really about managing “teaming” to access the “adjacent possible” in complex-adaptive systems. Melanie Swan’s proposals for blockchain cloud minds where people enter into communal thought spaces for “problem solving” where contributions are tracked by neuro-nanobots on blockchain for future micropayments. Those spaces might include not only people, but machines, animals, plants, maybe? What happens if people are pressured to entered into these spaces against their will? In that way XR sociality starts to be very concerning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:45 PM</p>
<p>In the planned “sharing” economy the plan will be limited choice. I think it mirrors “recirculation” in the Complex Adaptive Systems frame.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:47 PM</p>
<p>I’m wondering if you all have been looking into wearables as tools for behaviorist conditioning – like Red Critter where teachers “zap” good behavior points to children via a device and wearable bracelets. Of course, these points would sync to one’s twin and if Charles Hoskinson’s model advances those points would follow you through your life and influence your ability to gain employment. In a worst-case scenario, it could be linked to geo-fencing or social opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:48 PM</p>
<p>Red Critter has a school-based model and a corporate leaderboard model. I can totally see this approach linked to something like Learning Economy Foundation’s LearnCard. Essentially a digital twin / geofence / social credit wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:51 PM</p>
<p>Are you all aware the new field of “social prescribing” and the potential for wearable tech to be used to “verify” compliance with such prescriptions? Social prescribing is being woven into human capital finance deals – pay for success. It’s about optimization of people – either through pathways set for education/training or health/mental health/wellness. Vulnerable populations are being pulled in these programs under the guise that it’s to benefit them. In reality it’s part of global finance deal flows and mass data harvest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:53 PM</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent digital twins? I thought maybe it was more like an enclosed Voronoi polyhedron with moveable planes of influence via sensor / actuator feedback, but maybe it’s a directed acyclic graph instead – or both. Carsten Stocker of Spherity in 2018 tech conference on how the Fourth Industrial Revolution will change your identity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-tQw266Gfo&amp;t=0s">here</a>, playlist of relevant clips <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7R9zSd1hQMRFSwRk0G9xiQ">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 2:54 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Coughlin – great to mention metaphysics (and reminds of John Carpenter’s movie Dark Star, and the need to use metaphysics to try to defeat a too-eager AI-driven ‘smart bomb’)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to Everyone: 2:55 PM</p>
<p>Perhaps metaphysics defines us as more than our technologies and current knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:55 PM</p>
<p>Are you all familiar with Jonathan Ledgard’s proposal for interspecies currency? This is linked to sustainability-tokens, but some people might imagine these digital transactions being a form of “communication.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 2:58 PM</p>
<p>@thomas There’s a reason Nicholas Berggruen studied with Brian Copenhaver, UCLA Emeritus with a specialty in early modern magic, and Ervin Lazslo studied Giordano Bruno.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:00 PM</p>
<p>@Joe – great point about reliability = not (always) being on ‘bleeding edge’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:01 PM</p>
<p>What role do you all imagine frequency will play in research around non-surgical Brain Computer Interfaces? In a recent talk with Juan Benet, Adam Marblestone spoke about the use of ultrasound to get beyond the blood brain barrier. We are installing sensor networks everywhere that will affect us as water-based crystalline life forms. Again, I don’t think the general public has enough context to interrogate this future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:03 PM</p>
<p>TBH, I find digital spaces actually create a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yu Yuan to Everyone: 3:03 PM</p>
<p>Then another popular question would be, how do you know we are not already living in a digital space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:04 PM</p>
<p>Social media has encouraged many people to develop their identities as a series of meta-data tags that are shifted through real time affirmation or rejection. This practice is leaving us totally without an anchor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:04 PM</p>
<p>Caves within caves within caves…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:05 PM</p>
<p>I’m sure Skinner would love to have had the extended lifespan option. We are navigating an endless digital Skinner box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:09 PM</p>
<p>That is a terrible idea. We are human. You are allowed to sometimes forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:09 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas – many GLAM (Galleries/Library/Archives/Museums) now call themselves ‘memory institutions’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:11 PM</p>
<p>Also, sometimes people want to leave their pasts behind and start fresh. We learn from mistakes. Would you want to have all your mistakes recorded on a permanent record? What will this do to us? Will we become a people afraid to live, because we might do it wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:11 PM</p>
<p>There is a huge question of machine optimization. This is Taylorism. The John Holland book is all about pushing specialization. The Adam Smith pin factory. Do we want a world of specialists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3:12&nbsp; PM</p>
<p>The EU-driven GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) includes a ‘right to be forgotten’</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:12 PM</p>
<p>You don’t need a digital twin to be more human. Also, let’s be honest XR is a video game built from state intelligence / military R&amp;D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:14 PM</p>
<p>Who’s been building synthetic people for decades – USC Institute for Creative Technologies – ex-Disney folks partnered with the Army Research Lab. That doesn’t make it an attractive option. It’s not like MK Ultra ever really ended. There is a struggle for consciousness – ongoing for many, many years. Who will stand for natural life and say we don’t want to coat it in nano – NEMS, MEMs – for panopticon optimization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:15 PM</p>
<p>Of course, it has to be standardized. The noosphere is a global project and it has to be open source, because all the children have to build it so the global hedge funds can make money on their coding skills improvement. You can’t have remote telepresence robotic labor pools without global standards. Where would JSTA’s Moonshot project be without standards?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:16 PM</p>
<p>Give me a break. No one is going to be forgotten in extended reality (XR). Eventually, a moving object without a tag will be identified from space as an anomaly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:18 PM</p>
<p>I’d love to know what’s up with Open Mustard Seed these days. No one is going to be allowed to NOT have a digital ID. They’ll get us via health passports, digital driver’s licenses, blockchain education transcripts. There will be no room for people who don’t want this, and it will be all sewed up by the time people realize what actually happened. Or maybe everyone will be so hypnotized with dopamine they won’t notice. It’s a toss-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:19 PM</p>
<p>Actually, the public deserves to be a participant in these discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:20 PM</p>
<p>Someone tell Stanford; why did they invent a smart toilet? Why are there anal sphincter biometrics?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to All Attendees: 3:20 PM</p>
<p>Folks, I have to leave now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thomas Coughlin to All Attendees: 3:20 PM</p>
<p>Good to join this interesting discussion!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:22 PM</p>
<p>But embodiment is huge. That’s the goal of the roboticists – to use us to learn how to be in a material world. Bodies do matter. I agree consciousness is not limited to the body, but it still matters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:23 PM</p>
<p>Does it matter to you that this is military technology?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:24 PM</p>
<p>How can we set aside global investigations into altered states and consciousness and torture?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:25 PM</p>
<p>To me this line of thinking shows a profound disrespect for the actual world. It’s like playing God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:26 PM</p>
<p>Science has been shown to be wrong so many times. Why do we think we can control the universe? To me it is like asking people to live inside personalized boxes that hide our understanding of the actual wonder of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:28 PM</p>
<p>Last week I toured Biosphere2. Those were some very sad plants. It was a dismal failure on the environmental front and the social front. Maybe that’s why people want to make everything digital, because they can’t control the real world to the degree that they want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>But this is a global plan and a majority of people have not agreed to do this, in fact they don’t even know what is planned. I don’t think you can force people to “transcend” using coercion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>Virtualizing the world is not going to save the earth. None of this is sustainable. It’s not. What we are doing with syn-bio and NEMs (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMs (microelectromechanical systems) is unethical. It’s terraforming for a new type of life. It’s not being a good relative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Haynes to Everyone: 3:29 PM</p>
<p>@Thomas Furness – very much appreciate the thoughts shared about ‘one and many’ – individual in community – and whole is greater than sum of parts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me To All Panelists: 3:31 PM</p>
<p>People have no idea what this really is or who built it or what it’s meant to do. They don’t. Most people have no idea about the Omega Point. How can we make these decisions, an open secret, that will deprive future generations of their birthright – to be natural beings?</p>

 This is a guest post by Roma Wilson, Quantum Heart Cafe, describing how data and technology is being used to create intelligent communities in Vancouver BC. 
<p>As I have been learning more about the planned roll out of Web3, social impact investing, and smart cities, I’ve been paying more attention to advertisements and local media I come across while out for walks or waiting at the bus stop.</p>
<p>One I saw recently was a real estate advertisement for a recently built community called <a href="https://ambergateliving.ca/">Amber Gate</a>, situated in what is currently called Burke Mountain, Coquitlam BC.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Burke Mountain community was built on the lands of the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm First Nations. It was a homesteading community where immigrants were expected to work the land until they were eligible to own it. It has now become an urban community, part of Vancouver/Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>When I first saw the advertisement for Amber Gate I wondered if it was a pre-planned smart city community, because the logo for it is a tree branch with leaves connected to a main branch. That imagery put me in mind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunking">trunk networks</a> used in IT infrastructure.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I looked at the list of <a href="https://ambergateliving.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AG-Features-List-22-09-29.pdf">features and amenities</a> residents of Amber Gate would receive, a few jumped out at me. Among them were on-site daycare, plug-in for EVs, and a bicycle repair shop. This is important because <a href="https://view.publitas.com/translink/transport-2050-regional-transportation-strategy/page/1">Vancouver hopes to eliminate private vehicle ownership by 2050.</a>&nbsp; Also included in each townhome are work-from-home-ready wired ethernet and USB ports for smart devices, and it was all these amenities and features that sent up some red flags.</p>
<p>I did an online search for the phrases Coquitlam and smart cities to see what connections the municipality has to the smart city initiative and what public-private partnerships they’ve established with various organizations. An organization I came across right away is the <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/">Intelligent Community Forum</a> (ICF), a global think tank that comprises a network of cities and regions working together to push the smart city initiative.</p>
<p>The ICF nominates seven cities/regions every year that are working on smart city initiatives from a list of twenty-one cities. Coquitlam, along with a number of other cities in and around Vancouver, made the <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/smart21">Smart 21 Communities of the year back in 2021</a>.&nbsp; Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOySk7NIGg&amp;t=272s">brief presentation</a> of what the Smart 21 Communities initiative aims to do, which is make cities go from “smart” to “intelligent.”</p>
<p>ICF’s co-founder, <a href="https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/louis_zacharilla">Louis Zacharilla</a>, developed the Smart City awards and has overseen the development of smart city institutes around the world. Louis is also Director of Innovation for Space and Satellite Professionals International (<a href="https://www.sspi.org/cpages/board">SSPI</a>). The relationship between the Smart Cities initiative and space is something I will continue to research.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I wanted to write this letter is because this predatory system is trying to unfold at the local level. While Web3 implementation is global, it needs local municipalities to provide infrastructure and planning.&nbsp; This inspired me to learn about what’s going on in my own part of the labyrinth.</p>
<p>Louis Zacharilla can be seen in this clip talking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY2zStebDN8">how technology and data can give a city a soul.</a> I wonder if that is Smart Cities’ intention, to be the shapers and modelers of each community’s soul.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve also been learning more about the differences between the Western Imperial worldview and Indigenous worldview from a book written by Vine Deloria Jr. called ‘<a href="https://archive.org/details/godisred00delo">God is Red: A Native View of Religion</a>.’&nbsp; One of the important differences is the West’s obsession with chronological time and progression of both historical and future events. Whereas, Indigenous Nations living on North Turtle Island place more importance on space and how they relate to those spaces through their ceremonies, stories, rituals, and so on.</p>
<p>This has inspired me to think about my place in the labyrinth. I wonder if a key to navigating it is through rooting myself to the places I am a part of and re-learning how to relate to them and how to relate to the beings that also inhabit the same spaces.</p>

<p>Through the last few weeks, the Panther community and DAO have set the stage for this release with <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther Improvement Proposals (PIP)</a> <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x576701a7a07efe281cd4f04acbf589d0791e492117497d628a6dfc6e9eccda6b">6</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">7</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">8</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">9</a>, and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">10</a>. These proposals have covered everything from democratic procedures related to who is allowed to vote on DAO proposals under certain circumstances to the release of code so that it can be deployed by anyone in the Panther community. Furthermore, PIP-9 &amp; 10, which set out to launch Advanced Staking, formalized the terms for our upcoming staking program and allowed the community to deploy it independently. <br></p><p>As we get closer to this release, today we want to give you an overview of Panther’s v0.5 interface, as well as step-by-step walkthroughs on:<br></p>  Checking your balances —available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, rewards, and PRPs (both “Expected” and “Unrealized”, see below).  Staking $ZKP  Unstaking $ZKP  Looking at your zAssets  Early $zZKP Redemption<br>  <p>Let’s get started.<br></p> What is Panther’s v0.5, aka Advanced Staking?<br> <p>Advanced Staking is a progressive step toward the development of the core technologies surrounding the Multi-Asset Shielded Pool, in particular, the way UTXOs are created, managed, and tracked. Within Advanced Staking, users will be able to shield assets and receive them as rewards but not transact with them until v1’s launch.<br></p> What kind of rewards are issued in Advanced Staking?  Staking Rewards<br> <p>The number of tokens to be released as rewards in Advanced Staking is 6,000,000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The formula for distributing rewards is the following:<br></p><p>Reward = Amount * APR * Period / 365 APR - 15% Period - 60 days<br></p><p>Where: <br></p>  Reward: reward for a stake ($zZKP)  Amount: amount staked ($ZKP)  APR: Annual Percentage Rate (%)  Period: rewarded period (days)<br><br>   PRP Rewards <p>In addition to regular staking rewards, Advanced Staking stakers receive Panther Reward Points. PRPs are non-transferable points associated with a user's wallet address. The mechanisms that generate PRPs will also be employed on MASPs in Panther v1. When Panther v1 is launched, PRPs will become redeemable for $zZKP through a one-sided Automated Market Maker.<br></p><p>There are two types of PRP rewards:<br></p>  Expected PRP Rewards: The first 2000 stakers will be rewarded with 2000 PRPs per stake, as decided by the community through PIP-9. These rewards will not continue growing or change (i.e., they are “flat”). Users will be able to see them on the Balance Card on the Staking page. This type of PRPs will be awarded automatically and is not forfeitable.  <p>Users that qualify for this kind of rewards will receive a “stake-proof” NFT allowing them to access their Expected PRP Rewards once v1 is launched.<br></p>  Total Unrealized Privacy Rewards: These will be calculated and accrued based on the Privacy rewards APR, which will be decided by the community through a Panther Improvement Proposal. This APR will be set through a PIP before v1 is launched. This kind of PRPs will only be awarded when v1 launches and only in case a user has kept their $zZKP rewards in the pool until v1. If $zZKP rewards are redeemed via early redemption mechanics, the user will lose all of his accrued PRPs of this kind.<br>  <p>All PRPs will be available to exchange for $zZKP via the single-sided AMM at the time of v1’s launch.</p> Accessing Advanced Staking <p>The Advanced Staking app will be accessible through a fully decentralized front-end, routed through a Panther subdomain, at the time of release.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE (Dec. 8th, 2022): Currently, Advanced Staking is only accessible through the "Launch app" button on Panther's <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io">Home page</a>. Eventually, an ENS domain will be enabled. For now, only access through this button. If someone attempts to send you a direct link to the staking solution, please report them.<br></p>The Advanced Staking home page, as it looks before any interactions.<p><br>To use it, you must connect your MetaMask wallet. To do so:<br></p>  Click the blue button on the top right.  Select the account (wallet) where you have $ZKP and click “Next.”  Click on the “Connect” button to allow the app to see your address and balance, and suggest transactions for you to approve.  Select the network where your $ZKP is (Polygon or the Ethereum Mainnet) from the drop-down menu in the top right. A MetaMask pop-up might ask you to confirm this change.<br>  <p>If you can’t see your $ZKP balance on MetaMask, it could be because of three possible issues:<br></p>  You might not have any $ZKP in your wallet.  You might have the wrong account or network selected.  $ZKP may not be added as a tracked token in your MetaMask.<br>  <p>The Advanced Staking interface provides an “Add ZKP token” button that facilitates addressing the third issue. After you click this button and accept the prompt, your $ZKP balance will be displayed in the wallet’s interface.</p> The Advanced Staking App<br> The Advanced Staking application, as it looks after staking tokens.<p><br>The Advanced Staking app has two pages, one for Staking and one for managing zAssets. Our top Menu also links to Panther’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">snapshot.eth</a> space, where Panther’s governance proposals are voted on. On the right side, the blue “Connect Wallet” button allows the user to give permission for the app to see and interact with their MetaMask wallet. This is necessary for the app to suggest transactions in which the wallet interacts with the Advanced Staking smart contracts.<br></p><p>The Staking page is the app’s homepage. It allows the user to:<br></p>  Stake or unstake $ZKP.  Check their balances of unstaked $ZKP (available for staking), staked $ZKP, $zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance.  See how much unclaimed $zZKP rewards are left for the Advanced Staking program and the current staking APR.  The time remaining until the staking program ends.<br>  <p>On the zAssets page, the user can:<br></p>  Check their total balance per zAsset (through Advanced Staking, the only zAsset available will be $zZKP).  Inspect their $zZKP, Unrealized Privacy Rewards balance per individual stake, and total.  Redeem $zZKP before v1 is launched.<br>  <p>Let’s take a look at the different features and displays of each page:</p> The Staking page — Staking and Unstaking <p>On the left side of the Staking page, you will find the Balances Card. This panel shows the user’s available $ZKP, staked $ZKP, zZKP rewards, and Expected PRP Balance. Next to each $ZKP or $zZKP balance, an approximate USD value is provided.<br></p><p>The panel also displays the user’s MATIC/ETH (depending on the network they’re connected to) balance in the top right corner. Make sure you have enough MATIC/ETH to pay for the transaction fees required for some steps of the staking, unstaking, and rewards redemption processes.<br></p><p>To refresh the values, click on the refresh icon to the right of “Available ZKP balance,” and a MetaMask signature request will pop up. You will need to accept it, which does not incur gas fees.<br></p><p>Note: Data updating can take time. Please keep an eye on the spinning wheel inside the “Available ZKP Balance” field in the top right corner. As soon as the wheel stops, data should be up to date (but you might need to refresh the page).<br></p>The Balances Card.<p>Located to the right of the Balance Card, the Stats panel displays the amount of Advanced Staking rewards already distributed, the percentage of the total they represent, and the total rewards offered. It also shows the time left until Advanced Staking closes and its current APR. <br><br>Note: Staking APR and Privacy rewards APR are two different parameters. <br></p>The Stats panel. Staking $ZKP <p>The tab for staking $ZKP in Advanced Staking is located below the Stats panel on the Stake panel.<br></p>This is where the action happens!<p><br>You can input the amount of $ZKP you intend to stake on the box on the top or click the “MAX” button on the right side next to the Panther logo to insert your entire $ZKP balance automatically. The minimum stake size is 1000 $ZKP.<br></p><p>The warning below the amount box refers to the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">lockup period of 60 days set on PIP-9</a> to which all stakes in Advanced Staking are subject. Only after this period can you unstake your originally-deposited $ZKP. The lockup period doesn’t apply to the rewards from staking, as we will address on the zAssets Page session.<br></p><p>After the warning message, you can see a preview of the $zZKP and Expected PRPs staking rewards your stake will entitle you to. This preview is just a forecast, and final numbers may vary slightly.<br></p>Note that, as time progresses, you will accrue additional Unrealized Privacy Rewards (non-flat PRPs) on top of your initial amount (2,000, only for the first 2,000 stakes). These additional rewards will only be awarded if you keep your $zZKP rewards in the pool till v1’s launch.<p><br>If you’re satisfied, you may click the blue button. This step requires $MATIC/$ETH (depending on the network you’re on) to cover gas fees.<br></p><p>After clicking the blue button, three MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to approve Panther’s Advanced Staking contract to be able to move your $ZKP. The second window will ask that you accept the actual staking transaction. Gas fees apply to both steps.<br></p><p>After staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balances Card and the zAssets page.<br></p> Unstaking $ZKP <p>_______________________________________________</p> IMPORTANT: The difference between unstaking and early redemption<br> <p>It’s important to understand the distinction between unstaking (of staked $ZKP) and early redemption (of $zZKP rewards). Unstaking and redeeming are separate functions of separate smart contracts.<br></p><p>A user can unstake $ZKP after their stake’s lockup period ends (60 days per individual stake). By doing so, only their original $ZKP stake is returned to their wallet. The accumulated staking rewards need to be redeemed separately.<br></p><p>A user can redeem their $zZKP rewards from a specific stake after 120 days since the launch of the Advanced Staking program. Doing so before the launch of Panther v1 necessarily entails forfeiting all Unrealized Privacy Rewards (one of two types of PRP rewards) associated with that stake.<br></p><p>_______________________________________________</p><p>The Stake panel has two tabs: Stake ZKP and Unstake ZKP. You can switch between them through the buttons on the panel's top. The Unstake ZKP tab allows you to inspect and unstake your individual stakes.<br></p>The Unstake ZKP tab.<p>To unstake one of your stakes, click the “unstake” button on the right side of said stake. This will prompt you with a MetaMask window where you can confirm the transaction —gas fees apply. Your $ZKP will be returned to you once the transaction is confirmed by the network.<br></p><p>Exactly as with staking, you will be able to see your updated balance on the Balance Card and the zAssets page.</p> The zAssets page — Inspect your Unrealized PRP Rewards, and manage your zAssets <p>The zAssets page allows you to view and manage your shielded assets and Unrealized PRP Rewards, and redeem your $zZKP rewards. Extra functionalities will be available when Panther’s v1 launches.<br></p>This page shows the total amount of assets you have shielded and additional information about each stake. Checking your zAssets balance <p>As you can see, the Total Balance panel displays the balance of all of your shielded assets (zAssets) in USD, as well as your Unrealized PRP rewards balances.<br></p><p>Attention: in your very first time inspecting your zAsset and PRPs balances, the app will automatically prompt you to sign a message with MetaMask. Click the blue “Sign” button on the pop-up window to allow the app to scan the Panther Wallet and reveal your current balances to yourself only. <br></p><p>On your subsequent visits, click the “Refresh Private Balance” button on the right side of the panel and sign the message to get updated data to be displayed in the interface.<br></p>Each time you use this feature, you will need to sign a message (no gas fees required!) Private zAssets list <p>The panel below the Total Balance panel is the Private zAssets panel. It allows you to inspect the balance of each private zAsset you have, as well as the Unrealized Reward PRPs each stake has accumulated.</p>The Private zAssets panel.<p></p><p>Each zAsset line (for v0.5, only $zZKP is available) can be expanded to see and inspect the list of stakes that generated zAssets –just click the Expand button in the left of the zAsset icon. <br></p><p>The best way to optimize the rewards you can get from Advanced Staking is to wait for the release of Panther’s v1 to redeem them. However, by clicking “Redeem zZKP,” you can unshield the rewarded $zZKP into $ZKP and forfeit any further PRP rewards.</p> Early Redemption of Staking Rewards <p>At the time Panther’s v1 launches, all $zZKP rewards for Advanced Staking will be moved into a Panther Pool. Upon launch, the user will receive their Unrealized Rewards PRPs, and redeeming PRPs for $zZKP that you can transact within the MASP will become possible.<br></p><p>Stakers can redeem their rewards as ERC-20 $ZKP before the Advanced Staking period is finished through the Early Redemption mechanism. By doing so, they forfeit their Unrealized Rewards PRPs –Expected PRPs cannot be forfeited– receiving just the $zZKP provided upon staking. The Early Redemption mechanism will become available 120 days after Advanced Staking opens, 60 days before the end of the program.<br></p><p>To initiate an Early Redemption, click on the blue “Redeem zZKP” button on the right side of one of the entries in the list.<br></p><p><br></p><p>The app will warn you that using Early Redemption forfeits Unrealized Rewards PRPs rewards for that stake. You must tick the “I understand I will lose a part of my PRP rewards.” checkbox in order to continue. Then, if you want to proceed, you can click the blue button to redeem your $zZKP as $ZKP.<br></p>Early redemptions allow you to withdraw your $zZKP ahead of our v1’s launch.<p><br>A MetaMask prompt to sign a message will appear. Click “Sign” to confirm.<br></p>Signing carries no transaction costs.<p>The next step requires waiting 24 hours for your $zZKP to be available for redemption. After the time has passed, click again on the “Redeem zZKP” button. A pop-up will appear where you can click the “Redeem ZKP” button.<br></p>Your $ZKP, a button’s click away.<p><br>After clicking the blue button, two MetaMask windows will appear in quick succession. The first one will prompt you to sign a message exactly as before. The second window will ask that you accept a transaction —gas fees apply. Once the network has included your transaction, you will receive the redeemed $zZKP as $ZKP in your wallet. <br></p><p>After completing your transaction, please make sure that it was successful. Also, make sure to complete it within 24 hours of initiating it.<br><br></p> Want to learn more about the mechanisms behind Advanced Staking? <p>If you’re interested in learning more about the mechanics of Advanced Staking, upcoming blog posts and documentation will provide a complete breakdown of Panther Reward Points, including their importance, how they’re calculated, redeeming PRPs, and their relation to Advanced Staking.<br></p><p>For the extra curious, you can check out <a>Panther's documentation</a>, where we will be documenting the technological components of v0.5<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

 Nym Shipyard Academy — Welcome to Stage&nbsp;3! <p>Congratulations to our more than 300 Navigators for successfully completing Stage 2 of Shipyard Academy! You are the cream of the crop, less than 10% of the almost 4000 initial participants made it this far. You now have an in-depth understanding of the Nym network, its economic model and how they work in tandem to bring robust infrastructure-level privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1rDVGoNccXHIzht2HXCnNwDJqF9LPTIeBypAI76PYfAM/edit">Here</a> is the leaderboard, and you can find the leaderboard and further information about Stage 2 rewards on our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord server</a>. Remember: you still have until December 8th (Thursday) 18:00 UTC to <a href="https://nymtech.typeform.com/to/o4BKWWuC">submit</a> your social media posts if you haven’t already done so! It is required to graduate from Stage&nbsp;2.</p> Stage 3: Sailmaker <p>During the final stage of your journey to become a Nym Sailmaker, you will demonstrate that you are able to create the sails that will carry the global Nym community across the digital oceans. You will continue learning, but this stage is also focused on building: building understanding by localising Nym to your local community, running mixnodes, gateways or creating proof of concept&nbsp;apps.</p><p>You will gain insight into the importance of privacy at a societal level and for innovation. You will learn about the prehistory to Nym and mixnet technologies and what we can expect for the privacy landscape going into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>The rest of the curriculum is partly in your hands — soon you will get a chance to steer the ship together with your crewmates. Keep a close eye on the Shipyard Academy Announcement channel on our Discord&nbsp;server!</p><p>During this stage, you&nbsp;will</p>  Learn more about Nym, and how privacy is an intervention into societies that have become addicted to surveillance and pass a more difficult quiz (60% to complete the Academy and become a Sailmaker, 50% to receive&nbsp;rewards)  Continue to spread the word about Nym, its tech and vision by reaching people on social media (Mandatory to graduate from Stage&nbsp;3)  Extend the Nym infrastructure to underrepresented areas by spinning up mix nodes and gateways in these regions (eligible mix nodes will receive delegations, and gateways will receive Shipyard S<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">ervice&nbsp;Grants</a>!)  Privacy-enhance new apps by setting up gateways and service providers for a new app to run via NymConnect  Submit Proofs of Concept (POCs) using Nym clients that are good enough to convince our DevRel team (winners will receive <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-developer-grants-4a37a33be49d">Shipyard Developer Grants!</a>)  Or if your talents are with images and words rather than code, write a guest blogpost/ create a video or produce original artwork that localizes the issue of privacy and the benefits of Nym for your specific community or part of the world (mandatory for Nymja candidates)   Stage 3&nbsp;rewards <p>Before Stage 2, we decided to up the total prize pool by 15K NYM tokens, to 115K. This brings the maximum prize pool of Stage 3 to 55K&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Just like with Stage 2, the final size of the prize pool is once again in your hands! The prize pool will grow as we hit our common goals for this stage together. This is how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>Starting prize pool: 30K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Maximum prize pool: 55K NYM&nbsp;tokens</p><p>Common goals:</p>  2 POCs making use of Nym clients approved by the DevRel&nbsp;team  10 mix nodes and 10 gateways in <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">underrepresented areas</a> (meeting quality requirements)  1 new app privacy-enhanced via NymConnect  An original blogpost or video in a non-english language that explains the use of Nym for a situation relevant to people who speak that language.   Kick-starting Stage&nbsp;3 <p>You now have an advanced understanding of Nym: the problem Nym is solving and how the technologies are solving it exactly. It is time to bring this knowledge into the context of the communities you are part of: what are the main threats to personal privacy in your country? What is your government’s position when it comes to privacy? Where do you see the Nym vision fit into the picture? Write a tweet thread, blog post, create a video or artwork about the privacy issues of your community!</p><p>For our more technically-minded Navigators, it’s your time to contribute! Got an idea for an app making use of the Nym infrastructure? Got experience running nodes and want to run Nym infrastructure? Want to see more apps supported by NymConnect and ready to get your hands dirty? These are all in scope for Stage 3 of Shipyard Academy! Start organizing with your crewmates today and submit a POC, set up infrastructure in underrepresented areas, or enable new applications to be supported by NymConnect by setting up gateways and network requesters.</p><p>A note to Nymja candidates</p><p>To become a Sailmaker it is enough to attend the lectures and pass the final quiz 60% or more, and keep spreading the word about our mission on social media. Writing elaborate articles, submitting POCs or setting up infrastructure are not mandatory requirements.</p><p>However, as we are approaching the end of Shipyard Academy, we are busy creating our shortlist of Nymja candidates. If you want to become a Nymja, it is your time to shine! Whether by articulating our vision to your communities or by contributing to bringing the mixnet to new apps, use cases and regions, it’s time to show off that you are ready and capable to bring privacy to everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Good luck to all of you and see you on our channels!</p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that can be used to access the network, run a mix-node, and NYM should only be used within the Nym mixnet. NYM is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. For investment purposes, do not use NYM but instead look into Bitcoin or other investment vehicles.</p><p>The rewards of and participation in Shipyard Academy is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including the United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. Nym may request that participants provide relevant information as necessary, and can only process payments once cleared by the Nym legal&nbsp;team.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-3-6d1abe2a6c9e">Nym Shipyard Academy — Welcome to Stage 3!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Nym software is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/master">open source</a>, unpermissioned and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p> What’s new in Nym platform&nbsp;v1.1.2?   Mix nodes can now use the CLI tool to declare families if they are run by the same organization, read instructions (<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/run-nym-nodes/nodes/mixnodes#node-families">here</a>). When an operator declares a mix node family, all the nodes from that family will be put in the same layer for privacy and security reasons. You should only create multiple nodes and put them in a family if your initial mix node is over saturated.  Initial zk-nym (Coconut) functionality including credentials and distributed key generation!  <p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-binaries-v1.1.2/CHANGELOG.md#v112">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes.</p> What’s new in NymConnect v1.1.2? <p>We have fixed the error with client where it would fail and disconnect unnecessarily</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-connect-v1.1.2/nym-connect/CHANGELOG.md#nym-connect-v112-2022-11-29">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes</p> What’s new in the Nym Wallet&nbsp;v1.1.2? <p>Users can now buy NYM tokens directly from the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>The service is provided by our partner <a href="https://bity.com/">Bity</a> and can be accessed in the wallet under a new section called Buy as shown below.

 Harness the Security of Enterprise-Grade MPC and Democratize it for Mainstream Users <p>As the leading non-custodial authentication infrastructure provider with over 8M monthly users, Web3Auth has launched the MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet SDK. We are aiming to bring seamless logins and enterprise-grade security from the institutional level to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>To date, more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is lost due to mismanaged or stolen seed phrases. To remove this main friction of web3 onboarding and key management issue, it’s time to say bye to the seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>On a mission to provide the most seamless login experience for users, wallets, and dapps, recently we integrated our MPC via @Metamask snaps. Take a sneak peek at a Web3 world without seed&nbsp;phrases</p><p>Other than Metamask, we are onboarding key Web2 gaming players like <a href="https://www.neowizglobal.com/">NEOWIZ</a> and <a href="https://glip.gg/">Glip</a> <a href="https://www.nafeza.gov.eg/en">NAFEZA</a>. Egypt’s newly launched customs platform for importing and exporting also leverages Web3Auth’s MPC technology to seamlessly and securely onboard its users to the blockchain.</p><p>A lot of exciting partners in the pipeline, but first let’s review some&nbsp;basics…</p> What is&nbsp;MPC? <p>MPC, or Multi-Party Computation, is Web3’s version of multi-factor authentication (MFA). It allows users to manage their keys intuitively by using multiple factors to protect their keys, instead of just relying on a single seed phrase to remove it in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes it possible to design crypto wallets that rely on multiple factors to access a user’s funds. It is currently the gold standard for enterprise-grade crypto custody solutions and is used widely by exchanges and financial institutions for managing&nbsp;crypto.</p> Why use MPC technology?   MPC is currently the golden standard for enterprise key management which Bitgo and Fireblocks currently offer.  Coinbase introduced an MPC alpha/beta into their wallet earlier in the year, and now we’re unveiling our MPC SDK that enables any wallet or app to do the same for their&nbsp;users.  Being able to build on the latest and greatest, we’ve optimized the infrastructure to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for globally-distributed low-latency signing.  Our MPC SDK leverages existing and familiar UI/UX flows, including simple one-click logins and others, check out the flow&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022785836284129320/1034363507157782538/One_Click_flow.gif">here</a>   How is our SDK different from other MPC solutions?   Our MPC is the perfect Externally Owned Account (EOA) and can be paired with Gnosis Safe and other Smart Contract Wallet infrastructure (more on this coming&nbsp;soon).  The existing MPC solutions offered today are all targeted at large enterprises. These MPC solutions are expensive, require a long setup process, or are just too slow to run on consumer&nbsp;devices.  <p>We think that MPC is too important and too crucial of a technology to be kept out of reach of the average user. MPC security should be the standard for all web3 wallets today. As a wallet infrastructure provider, we have optimized our MPC SDKs to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for geo-distributed low-latency signing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a game, an app, a Chrome extension, or even a web wallet running in a mobile browser — our SDKs support&nbsp;that.</p> Our MPC technology key feature&nbsp;includes   1.2-second transaction speed (challenge it if you don’t believe&nbsp;us).  We are chain agnostic (secp256k1, ed25519, BLS and more&nbsp;support)  Our SDK can be embedded into any web, mobile, and native application.  The MPC SDK is geo-distributed and horizontally scaled for global distribution.  <p>For those of you that are already familiar with the multi-factor keys security model at Web3Auth, this blog is just another incremental step towards improving private key security.</p><p>For those of you who aren’t familiar, here’s how multi-factor keys&nbsp;work:</p> Leveraging our MPC SDK, you can expect the following benefits   Reduces account loss from misplaced seed&nbsp;phrases  <p>There is no seed phrase to manage — shares are managed by intuitive MFA flows that users are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>2. Prevent compromised device vulnerabilities</p><p>User accounts are not subjected to frontend vulnerabilities as MPC’s joint computation allows for keyless&nbsp;usage.</p><p>3. Avoid losing funds from dubious transactions</p><p>Safeguard your users’ accounts with a flexible policy engine to set rules — daily transaction limits and blacklist scams.</p><p>4. Expect fluid experiences</p><p>Expect a low latency of less than 1.5s for both login and transaction signing. Allow your users to focus on engaging with your&nbsp;product.</p><p>5. You own the UX, we can be a white-label service&nbsp;provider</p><p>Our MPC can be embedded into any dapp and/or wallet — you own the experience.</p><p>6. You Don’t need to compromise your stack, any platform any&nbsp;chain</p><p>Our MPC SDK is blockchain agnostic, it works on Web, Mobile, and Native applications.</p> Wanna try&nbsp;it? <p>We have an alpha SDK that you can use today <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc">https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc</a>.

<p>Yesterday was my birthday. I spent it setting intentions at the Titan Missile Museum in Green Valley, Raytheon’s Tucson Offices, and Pima County Community College (the East Campus). The latter has been part of the National Laboratory for Education Transformation’s efforts to shift coming generations towards a just-in-time, on-demand, conditional, gig, telepresence workforce model grounded in the use of electronic transcripts and digital twins.</p>
<p>Today is my last day in Arizona. Shortly I’ll head up Mount Lemmon in the Santa Catalina Range to soak up the gifts that nature has to offer in those lofty heights above the Sonoran desert.</p>
<p>I got up this morning and laid out the gatherings I have left. Most were collected here, though some were gifted to me by fellow travelers from Pennsylvania, Washington State, Colorado, and Florida – shells, tobacco, clover, tissue paper hummingbirds, “Green Pill” socks, and pressed flowers from a “cheer-me-up” bouquet. When I was done sorting through the worn gift bag that I’d been carrying around, the counter held a sprig of tiny peppers from the Presidio fortification remnants; a rounded piece of driftwood worn smooth by the seasonal rains in a wash near a Hohokam settlement; feathers from a local park; white stones from Cochise Stronghold; Mesquite beans from the landscaping outside the Raytheon building; wrinkled date palms gathered along the sidewalk opposite Michael Crow’s office at Arizona State University. The campus had many offerings – papery bark, Nandina berries, even an olive!</p>
<p>Over a celebratory soup supper one of my host’s friends asked me what I do about all of this? What do I do? Well, I make hearts. Some make plans to try and protect their retirements from digital currency. Some scout possible bug-out locations. Some work on local politics. All of those are fine things to do. We all have our paths. I try not to judge, and I hope others will not judge my approach. From my research I know that this system of domination seeks to harness the power of love and faith and imagination. They are trying to get us to teach it to artificial intelligence. Based on recent developments, GPTChat, it seems many are all too happy to oblige in this misguided mentoring process. Me? I try to be a storyteller who holds open the door for an alternate future. I go places and I try to tell their stories. All places have their story.</p>
<p>This system, as John Trudell so eloquently teaches, wants us to forget who we are. We are shapes of the earth. Our bones, flesh, and blood are made up of the minerals, stones, and liquids of the earth. In Arizona you feel this viscerally. Rocks are everywhere in every size and there is an energetic communion with them. A magnificent dance is unfolding all around us, a symphony of life that machine consciousness envies. This soulless creature stares down at us from space, attempts to secure our souls within its socio-technical systems, but we are like water. We flow through the rapids and the calm pools towards the sea.</p>
<p>I’ll be writing more hard-hitting research on Tucson after I get home, but until them I want to leave you with some of the intentions that I have set along the way. Consider these offerings and reflect on how these storylines get woven into a master narrative of domination through mathematical “progress” and optimization. My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7kFkMnr7i9oDB-a067c_NY">new read aloud</a>, “We” written in 1921 by Yevgeny Zamyatin provides appropriate context for the coming smart contract layer of imposed logic. The antidote, in my opinion, is authentic communion with clear-thinking human beings and with the rhythms of nature and the through lines that connect us to our ancestors and task us with being good relatives to those who come after.</p>
<p>I embark today with a lei around my neck gifted to me by a strong woman of Hawaiian descent. It was handmade by her from Ti leaves transformed through rhythmic twisting into a deep, glossy green cable. Bits of leaf tips peek out. I imagine these as a wink and a nod that not all will be contained within the ordering system. She told me that she’d grown the plant from which this gift was crafted as a cutting. It was taken from her childhood home and carried many memories, including those of a grandmother who wore ginger flowers in her hair. Its appearance is not unlike the cording from an academic ceremony or liturgical vestment. It is my honor to wear it today and to bring it with me up the mountain where I will say a prayer that despite our frailties and inadequacies, or perhaps because of them, we will be able to carry a <a href="https://krinvan.com/2022/08/05/the-spark-of-hope-by-sharon-k-youngs/">shkitagen-held spark</a> for natural life through the miasma of differential equations, handing it off as many times as needed until we come out the other side. We are the sons and daughters of life. We are in need of healing, and we are healers. We need to remember who we are.</p>

<p>Brands are navigating the new Web3 world, and its opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and engaging consumers in entirely new ways. In this season of <a>The Brave Marketer Podcast</a>, we’re discussing Web3 marketing and how to market in the metaverse.</p>
<p>The first episode of season 6 features an interview from Avery Akkineni, President of <a href="https://vayner3.com/">Vayner3</a>, a Web3 consultancy launched alongside serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Avery covers a wide range of pressing topics such as:</p>
 
 The difference between stunt campaigns and always-on marketing in the metaverse, and what it will take to succeed in Web3 channels. 
 Web 2.5, and why it’s going to be a game changer in 2023. 
 The best partnerships and activations that have happened in the metaverse so far. 
 
<p>Topics in this new 10-episode season include crypto marketing, privacy, cookieless advertising, the blockchain, and more. You’ll hear from marketers from some of the biggest brands and agencies including MintDropz, PlayEmber, Dentsu, and Skiff.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>In this new season, we’ll tackle the tough questions facing marketers today such as:</p>
 
 How do you advertise in the metaverse? 
 Is the timing right to jump in, or is it better to wait? 
 What should marketers ask when evaluating a metaverse strategy? 
 
<p>Listen to the trailer for Season 6 here:</p>

<p>The Brave Marketer podcast is hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnydvorin/">Donny Dvorin</a>, VP, Head of Sales at Brave Software—the makers of the privacy-respecting Web browser with a built-in ads platform that rewards users for their attention with the Basic Attention Token. Brave is the browser with Web3 users, and the best onramp to Web3 and the metaverse.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is relatively young. Bitcoin leveraged decentralised ledger technology back in 2008, and in the early years, only a few people were aware of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, many other projects have adopted this technology, with varying degrees of success. Often, projects don’t go past a proof of concept, and even if they do, the outcome might not be what the project’s proposers intended. It is safe to say that blockchain, as a technology, has not reached maturity.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons why a blockchain project might fail, or yield a low return on investment (ROI). These reasons include, but are not limited to:</p>



  Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  Steep learning curve  Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations  Lack of vision  Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem  Use of the wrong technology  



<p>This article explores the circumstances that often lead to blockchain projects having a low ROI, and how this can be overcome.</p>







 1. Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  



<p>Decentralised ledger technology does have the capacity to disrupt a fair amount of industries, and in fact, it has already done so, and will likely continue along this path of disruption and innovation for years to come.</p>



<p>But the problem lies in that blockchain, while extremely versatile, is not the right solution for everything. Fledgling entrepreneurs often use it as a buzzword and believe that blockchain will suit their projects, no matter what. Making this assumption without a proper assessment and due research is unwise, to say the least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting blockchain technology is a decision not to be taken lightly, and so entrepreneurs, or any business considering the implementation of a decentralised ledger, should look inward and look for the answer to these questions:</p>



<p>Is the legacy system no longer fit for purpose? Has it become too antiquated or expensive to maintain or update? Does the company have a way to obtain reliable data that can be fed into the blockchain?</p>



<p>Even if the answers to these important questions suggest that blockchain technology might be a suitable solution, the implementation of a blockchain network is not for the short term. Businesses must carefully consider the long-term implications, in terms of scalability (will the system be able to scale and accommodate higher numbers of transactions), complexity (does the company have the expertise to implement and maintain the technology), and ongoing costs (more nodes, bandwidth, etc.).</p>



 2. Steep learning curve  



<p>Blockchain technology does require a certain level of expertise. A blockchain is not an off-the-shelf product. Often, they require practical knowledge and expertise in certain programming languages that are specific to a blockchain (Solidity for Ethereum is a prime example of this). While there are millions of software developers out there, only a limited amount have the right skills in blockchain code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, the implementation of a decentralised ledger requires expertise in cryptography, smart contract programming, and very importantly, a functioning governance system. The combination of all these factors means that creating and maintaining a thriving blockchain ecosystem does require a steep learning curve.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations 



<p>Regulatory compliance can be defined as the acceptance, understanding, and commitment to follow all state, federal, and international laws and regulations that might be applicable and relevant to a company’s operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Blockchain compliance</a> is therefore a hugely important issue for any business. Adhering and complying with local legal frameworks and regulations helps protect the company’s resources, uphold its brand reputation, and ensure that the company can remain in operation across different markets.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has often found itself at odds with compliance guidelines, particularly in relation to privacy and data sharing, governance, and storage. The implementation of a solid governance framework is essential to the survival of a blockchain project.</p>



 4. Lack of vision  



<p>Entrepreneurs who decide to start a blockchain project just because it is fashionable or because they believe they can make a quick buck are probably doomed from the start. Blockchain is not a buzzword, nor is it a silver bullet that will magically make a product or project succeed. Establishing a thriving blockchain ecosystem is the result of a lot of work by a team of skilled professionals. Lacking a proper vision as to what the project or product should be, its real-world applicability, and the use case it fulfills is likely to lead to failure.</p>



 5. Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem 



<p>Some entrepreneurs are out to make money, and though financial profit is of course necessary to stay in business, it should not be the primary objective. Projects that overemphasise the bottom line are not likely to be viable in the long term. A blockchain project must provide a real solution for a real problem, rather than manufacturing a non-existent problem to justify the use of a blockchain.</p>



 6. Use of the wrong technology 



<p>There are many blockchains out there: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger, Corda, etc. Often, projects simply use the first one that comes to mind, which is usually Ethereum. Then the realisation sinks in that the gas fees can become incredibly expensive, which means that a business case becomes unreachable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, it is often difficult and costly to switch to another blockchain that facilitates a project’s needs better. And while tools such as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can make it easier to switch to another more suitable blockchain. Picking the right blockchain at the start, whether it’s a <a href="https://zaisan.io/private-public-blockchain/">public or private blockchain</a>, can save a lot of headaches.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Issues like lack of compliance or clear vision, technological challenges, or poor planning can lead to a low ROI, or scupper a blockchain project altogether. It is up to the project creators to take all these factors into account and ensure that the use of blockchain technology is both justified, and sustainable. Because after all, blockchain technology, while a very powerful and versatile tool, cannot function on its own. It requires technical expertise and the right leadership to become a success.</p>







 Key takeaways 



  Blockchain technology is not the answer to every single use case out there  Decentralised ledgers do have a steep learning curve, which might lead to low ROI  Using the wrong blockchain technology can have disastrous results  Legal departments must ensure that blockchain networks are compliant with data sharing and storage regulations  Blockchain projects require a clear vision of the objectives to accomplish  Monetary profit must be supported by the resolution of real-world problems  Projects must conduct careful research to ensure they choose the right blockchain technology for their use case

Jointly, the projects call on Web3 football fans to actively participate in the event, where DID and zero-knowledge proof technology are used in the prediction process of the 2022 World Cup. In this event, users can prove whether their guess is correct (e.g. predicted team enters semi-finals), without telling anyone what their guess is. With this game event, users can get a taste of zCloak Network’s efforts on privacy protection. Stay tuned for the event recap in our next issue of monthly&nbsp;update!</p><p>How to join:&nbsp;<a href="https://zcloaknetwork.medium.com/worlds-first-zk-guessing-for-the-world-cup-games-dc2d22fa5a83">LINK</a></p>Event Timeline included in case you are interested!

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Starting today, Brave Search will feature privacy-preserving ads as part of a global beta program. Ads will give users the option to use our independent search engine with ads that don’t track them, or to sign up for ad-free paid search. As with other search engines, Brave Search ads are clearly labeled and are integrated into the search results page. However, Brave Search ads protect users’ data and anonymity, while supporting their access to independent and transparent search as a true alternative to Big Tech search engines.</p>
<p>Ads are a key part of search engines, helping to facilitate the free and open exchange of information on the Web, and to connect users to helpful products and services related to their search terms. Despite their usefulness, most search ads track users and violate their privacy. Brave Search ads are fundamentally different: They provide the same utility minus all the tracking and privacy invasions found in other search ads. They give users a chance to learn about new products and—soon—earn rewards for their attention to those ads.</p>
<p>Brave Search is built on a truly independent index of the Web (one of only a handful of search engines that can make that claim), and recently passed 20 million queries per day, growing faster than any search engine since Bing. Search ads allow Brave to maintain independence as it grows, and do so without giving in to Big Tech’s privacy invasions.</p>





    


    




 Privacy-first ads 
<p>By design, Brave Search ads are anonymous, clearly marked, and follow Brave’s commitment to putting users first, and to ethical and transparent advertising practices. Clicking on Brave Search ads is a fully private experience (unlike the ads on search engines like Google and Bing). Brave Search only uses your search query, country, and device type to show you ads, and does not keep any kind of profile of your searches.</p>

 Search Premium 
<p>For users that don’t want to see ads, Brave is also offering an ad-free experience: <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=search">Search Premium</a>. For $3 per month, Brave Search Premium users can continue to enjoy a completely ad-free Search experience, and directly support Brave’s mission to make the Web a more private place with independent search.</p>

 Beta phase and Brave Rewards 
<p>During this beta phase, Brave Search users will see text-based ads in search results. However, during the beta period, Brave users who have opted-in to Brave Private Ads and are using the latest version of Brave will not see Search ads, since these new ad units are not yet eligible for BAT earnings. We’re actively working to integrate Brave Rewards with Brave Search, and hope to make Search ads eligible for BAT earnings in the coming months.</p>
<p>Brave believes in the importance of independent, private Web search, and in putting users in charge of their online experience. Not using Brave Search? Try it now at search.brave.com, or <a href="https://search.brave.com/default">set it as your browser’s default search engine</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to advertise with Brave Search ads, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@brave.com">sales@brave.com</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>tl;dr —&nbsp;Today Brave News introduced integrated RSS subscriptions, locally personalized suggestions, new sources and content channels powered by Brave Search, and other improvements. New supported regions include Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.</p>
<p>Big Tech controls the news ecosystem through centralized, Web 2.0-style news aggregation. But this control is waning, particularly as distributed models gain popularity. In many ways, RSS feeds and RSS readers (though not new) are an early instance of Web3-style decentralization. Our hope is that Brave News will make it obvious that a decentralized news ecosystem is far better for users and publishers than what Big Tech offers today.</p>
<p>Brave offers the capabilities users want in a news experience (such as content discovery, feed subscriptions, and personalized suggestions) directly in the browser. There’s no need to rely on centralized servers because all these Brave News features take place solely on your device. This update sets the stage for giving users more control over their news feed and relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>Today’s browser release (desktop version 1.46) includes several Brave News improvements that bring us closer to this vision of a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving news ecosystem, including:</p>
 
 A Follow button in the browser for adding a site’s feed to Brave News 
 New content Channels powered by Brave Search 
 Personalized Suggestions made locally on your device 
 Improved Source Management 
 Availability in new regions including Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK 
 





    


    




 Privacy-preserving personalization 
<p>Brave News can also use your browser history to personalize the content in your feed. But unlike other browser feeds (such as Google News), Brave’s content personalization happens exclusively in the browser, and none of your browsing data ever leaves your device.</p>
<p>Brave News ranks content you follow highest in your feed, and helps you discover new sources to Follow based on your browsing history and sources you already Follow. Brave identifies sources that are similar to each other and recommends suggestions privately in Settings, where you can choose to Follow and add them to your feed.</p>
<p>Note: Brave’s suggestions service is <a href="https://github.com/brave/source-suggestions">published as an open source project</a> if you want to learn more about how it works.</p>

 Channels and new settings options 
<p>Many users have requested more controls for customizing Brave News. Today’s update improves the way users Follow and Unfollow sources, and we’ve introduced “channels” which are topics or areas of coverage such as Crypto News, Music, and the new Gaming channel. If you’re already a Brave News user, any customizations you’ve made in the previous version of Brave News will automatically appear in the new version, and you’ll also find a much simpler interface for managing sources.</p>

 Brave News around the world 
<p>Brave News is also expanding internationally thanks to Brave Search. By querying Brave Search for the most popular content sources around the world and identifying publishers with public RSS feeds, Brave News now supports language- and region-specific content. In addition to coverage in Japan and the US, new regions now include English for Canada and the UK; Spanish for both Mexico and Spain; and Portuguese for users in Brazil. More languages and regions will be added over the coming months.</p>

 Coming soon: Easily add content to your Brave News Feed 
<p>As you browse publishers’ websites in the Brave browser, you’ll find a new, one-click Follow button. The button is located in the browser address bar and will appear any time you visit a site that provides an RSS feed. Click Follow, and content from that publisher will then appear in Brave News automatically, updating each time your browser fetches the feed.</p>
<p>Note: The new Follow button in the browser address bar will be released later this month. Today’s release is available for desktop users, and iOS will be updated with the new Brave News features in its upcoming 1.46 version. Android will be updated with the new Brave News features soon thereafter.</p>

 What’s next for Brave News 
<p>Many users have requested alternative views of their Brave News feed, such as a more traditional, inbox-style RSS news reader, which we plan to work on soon. We also plan to introduce an ad-free version of Brave News, mobile alerts, cross-platform sync, more import/export options, and some useful integrations with other Brave products and features.</p>
<p>To give Brave News a try and enjoy news and content directly from your browser, simply open a new tab in the Brave browser, and scroll to get started. If you’re not using Brave yet, you can download it now at <a>brave.com/download</a>.</p>

 Today, we’re excited to share the next phase in our journey: <a href="http://privy.io">Privy&nbsp;Auth</a>. <blockquote>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</blockquote><p><a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a> exists to help developers craft delightful products and keep users in control of their assets and data across apps. Since our launch, we’ve been hard at work helping amazing teams like those at <a href="https://www.station.express/">Station</a> and <a href="https://www.violet.co/">Violet</a> manage users’ off-chain data and build user-respecting products. Privy Auth is the next step in this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Our work has inexorably led us here. First, as a recurring request from our customers who already use Privy to secure user emails, social accounts, phone numbers, etc. Second, through a core product requirement: in order to enable users to control data permissions across apps, Privy must be able to authenticate users directly.</p><p>User journeys in Web3 have evolved from discrete, one-time events — like signing a transaction — to continuous interactions with users, involving both on- and off-chain data. For users, this means better products, but it also means developers have to handle much more complexity. This complexity starts at login: wallet connectors are clunky, onboarding flows are confusing to users, and the problem gets worse as the number of chains and wallets grows. To bring web3 mainstream, we have to reshape user onboarding.</p> Enter Privy&nbsp;Auth <p>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</p><p>We are building Privy Auth around 3 principles:</p>  Crypto for all — Web3 must be built for newcomers and experts alike. The best products will bridge the right UX from web2 and web3 to lower the barrier to entry. This means progressive user onboarding, gradually engaging users as they progress through your app, from first wallet connection to multi-wallet account creation.  User control — All products will involve on- and off-chain data. The best will rely on data portability from app to app to unlock new experiences.This means it must be easy for users to decide what they share with&nbsp;whom.  Self-custody — Self-custody is an essential part of web3. Popular apps will serve as bridges into self-custody, enabling people to take on more control over their assets and data if they so&nbsp;choose.  <p>Privy Auth is live with customers today as part of our early release. It integrates with your favorite libraries like ethers and wagmi; it’s easy to migrate from RainbowKit, Onboard.js or any other wallet connector or auth&nbsp;library.</p><p>Out of the box, Privy Auth gives&nbsp;you</p>  Simple onboarding for all users, with or without wallets, using email and social accounts.  Reliable wallet connectors, optimized for desktop and mobile so you can stop worrying about users getting lost on the way to your&nbsp;app.  A unified user abstraction so you can easily manage all users. Connected, authenticated, multi-wallet, we support all of your&nbsp;users.  <p>If you’re building in web3 and want to delight your users from the first interaction, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74">we’d love to talk</a>. With just a few lines of code, you can securely onboard all users, whether they have a wallet or not, and get back to focusing on your core&nbsp;product.</p><p>We have a lot more coming and we can’t wait to share more with you soon. Web3 gives us the opportunity to reinvent the data paradigms that have failed us over the last 30 years and give users back control over their data online. This starts at&nbsp;login().</p><p>Team Privy</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/announcing-privy-auth-4754be04c515">Announcing Privy Auth!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Look out next week for part 2 and part 3, where we dive into a growing marketplace for carbon and showcase several carbon removal solutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Frontier’s website: <a href="https://frontierclimate.com/">https://frontierclimate.com/</a></p><p>Nan’s Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/nanransohoff">https://twitter.com/nanransohoff</a></p><p>Nan’s article: <a href="https://nanransohoff.com/A-mental-model-for-combating-climate-change-846be1769d374fa1b5b855407c93da66">https://nanransohoff.com/A-mental-model-for-combating-climate-change-846be1769d374fa1b5b855407c93da66</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

 Press release: Nym Advisor, Andrés Arauz denounces FATF design guidance on CBDCs and leads urgent call for a more democratic process <p>International standardization body ISO/TC68 better positioned to lead on standards of CBDCs for the benefit of global&nbsp;society</p><p>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 30 November 2022 — Today, Nym advisor Andrés Arauz, former director of Ecuador’s central bank and 2021 presidential candidate, called for the design of CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) to be moved to a more open, democratic, and privacy-respecting standards process at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum&nbsp;(IGF).</p><p>Arauz stated his immediate intention to join the already existing <a href="https://committee.iso.org/home/tc68">International Standards Organisation TC68</a>/AG5 Working Group on central bank digital currencies where governments from the Global South are currently absent. Even cryptocurrency advocates can take an active role, as they can join through their national standard setting bodies as&nbsp;members.</p><p>This is in response to the increasing trend of countries declaring that privacy protection will not be included in the design of CBDCs as <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-FATF-Report-G20-So-Called-Stablecoins.pdf">recommended </a>by <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/">FATF</a> (Financial Action Task Force) under the guise of anti-money laundering. The FATF is completely opaque, dominated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-little-known-g7-task-force-unwittingly-helps-governments-target-critics-2021-08-05/">by geopolitics</a>, and is heavily influenced by the <a href="https://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/">Wolfsberg Group</a>, a club of the largest US and European&nbsp;banks.</p><p>In the interest of social good, guidance from a standards body that has the responsibility to include any nation state wanting to participate, will be less asymmetric to everyone who will be impacted by CBDCs. Deeper involvement in ISO/TC 68 will allow all relevant stakeholders, including both the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the newer generation of privacy-focussed Web3 experts, to set innovative technical standards for CBDCs and decentralized alternatives, providing financial freedom to those who need it while mitigating the risk of illegal activities.</p><p>“CBDCs will be legal tender and need democratic safeguards that guarantee the human right to privacy, their standards should not be defined by the FATF -an unaccountable, ineffective and opaque body-. Stakeholders from civil society and alternative finance should get involved to embed these human rights in the CBDC hardware and software standards,” Arauz&nbsp;said.</p><p>This was announced alongside Nym CEO Harry Halpin and Open Knowledge Foundation CEO Renata Avila at the <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022">United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF)</a> 2022 in Ethiopia, during <a href="https://intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-town-hall-99-the-data-of-money-blockchains-andor-surveillance">Town Hall #99 The Data of Money: Blockchains and/or Surveillance</a>.</p><p>Halpin added: “CBDCs could easily become tools of mass surveillance and control to repress political dissidents and entire nations. It’s imperative that the cryptocurrency industry get involved in this discussion over CBDC standards at the highest level, by teaming up with countries from the Global South that need to throw off the yoke of colonial banking systems to serve their own people rather than the imperialist overlords of the&nbsp;FATF.”</p><p>The IGF session focused on the current state of financial surveillance and new routes to privacy-preserving CDBCs and financial autonomy led by the global south. CBDC standards should allow both nation-states and non-nation state actors to interoperate and include privacy by design, which has been disingenuously dismissed under the guise of money laundering concerns even though privacy will be needed for national security purposes and to respect basic rights. Violations of an individual’s privacy rights through mass financial surveillance should be taken seriously and respected.</p><p>Watch the livestream: <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live">https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live</a></p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance. More: <a href="https://nymtech.net">https://nymtech.net</a></p><p>About Andrés&nbsp;Arauz:</p><p>Arauz has been a prominent figure in leading the drive on technological and monetary disintermediation. Motivated to reduce the bureaucratic need for the central bank to hold and distribute large amounts of physical dollars, he was one of the first to experiment with CBDCs, piloting Dinero Electrónico as then-Director of Ecuador’s central bank. Arauz is a force driving the need for open standards for CBDCs and global payments. Contrary to most in government, he is a strong advocate for the benefits of free and open source software. As Minister of Knowledge and Human Talent, he transitioned the Ecuadorian ministry’s internal systems from closed software systems.

<p>Dune Analytics is a platform aggregating blockchain data, making data easier to query and understand for the larger public. Over the past years, Dune has become the go-to tool for blockchain analytics, as well as the home of a community of dune wizards numbering in the thousands, with its fundraising at a 1 Billion valuation as a testament to the growth of the project over the past 4 years.</p><p>In today's episode, we are joined by the project's co-founder, Fredrik Haga. We discuss the products Dune Analytics offers, why it's hard to aggregate data that in principle is public, and how a community of data wizards was built in a grassroots effort. We also chatted about product focus and vision for the future, as well as useful lessons for bootstrapping a project on a shoestring budget.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The beginning of Dune  The challenges and difficulties in building a blockchain data product.  Technical improvements on Dune V2  Supporting for non-evm chains  Business models, userbases, and valuations  Interesting use cases on Dune  Community Building  The focus on product experience and next steps for the project  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://dune.com/community">Dune Analytics's website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/duneanalytics">Dune Analytics Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hagaetc">Fredrik Haga's twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

<p>zCloak Network is holding the world’s first zero-knowledge-based World Cup Guessing Event with its partners. In this event, you can prove whether your guess is correct (e.g. your team enters semi-finals), without telling anyone what your guess is. Here you will get a taste of zCloak Network’s efforts to protect privacy&nbsp;again.</p><p>All participants will be rewarded with NFT, OAT and more. The winners will split a $2000 reward pool and win precious Mint Whitelist.</p> Prize Pool <p>For Winners: $2000 from zCloak Network; 5 Player Pass NFT Whitelist from&nbsp;Macondo</p><p>For every participant: Credential from zCloak; OAT/ POAP from BuidlerDAO, Flock&amp;Tusima, Mirror World, MoleDAO, SnapFingersDAO, Web3Go.</p><p>This prize pool is certified by LegalDAO.</p> Participation Timeline <blockquote>Phase I — Guess and&nbsp;Record</blockquote><p>Present — UTC 12:00, Dec.&nbsp;9</p><p>At this phase, you can guess the champion team and record it as a verifiable credential (VC). Before the deadline, you need to share your credential with the zCloak verifier to make a commitment. Note that you will make a selective disclosure of your credential — you only share your discord user name and the verification code (your credential hash will be recorded) with zCloak for membership verification, but keep your guessing secret to yourself.</p><blockquote>Phase II — Zero-Knowledge Proof for Semi-Finals</blockquote><p>Dec. 12 — Dec.&nbsp;16</p><p>At this phase, you can prove whether your guess reaches the Semi-Finals without revealing your guess to anyone by use of zero-knowledge proof. Participants who guess correctly will have the chance to win an additional prize ($1,000 pool for 20 winners).</p><blockquote>Phase III — Who is the champion?</blockquote><p>Dec. 18 — Dec.&nbsp;20</p><p>At this phase, you can announce your guess and zCloak verifier will verify if it is the champion. The eventual winner has the chance to win an additional prize ($1,000 pool and 5 whitelists for 5 winners).</p><blockquote>Phase IV — Claim your&nbsp;prizes</blockquote><p>Dec. 21</p><p>On this day, we will reveal how to claim your rewards. Please keep your DID mnemonics and your backup DID JSON file safe to collect the&nbsp;rewards.</p> Guide — Phase&nbsp;I  1. Create your zCloak&nbsp;Account <p>Click this link: <a href="https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer">https://cred.zkid.app/#/account?redirect=claimer</a></p> 1.1 Click ‘Create account’ to get your first zkID&nbsp;account <p>Note: All users will need to create a new account as we have adopted an updated version of DID protocol.</p> 1.2 Create&nbsp;Password <p>All your data is encrypted by this password. Please keep your password&nbsp;safe.</p> 1.3 Generate&nbsp;mnemonic <p>The mnemonic is the last approach to restore your DID account. Please keep it in a safe&nbsp;place.</p> 1.4 DID key backup JSON&nbsp;file <p>After confirmation, a DID backup JSON file will be downloaded to your computer. You can restore your DID account in another browser with your password and this DID backup JSON file (or with your mnemonics). Keep the file&nbsp;safe.</p> 2. Make the guessing with verifiable credential <p>After creating your account, please click this link to enter our Credential Platform: <a href="https://cred.zkid.app">https://cred.zkid.app</a></p> 2.1 Switch your&nbsp;role <p>Now your role is claimer, who is the owner of the Verifiable Credential (VC). To issue a VC that contains your guessing of the champion, you need to switch your role to ‘Attester’, who can attest or issue a VC to others or to him/herself.</p><p>Click this button to switch your role from claimer to attester.</p> 2.2 Issue <p>Click ‘Issue’ of the menu and ‘Issue’ of the WCG Ctype to issue the guessing&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Click ‘Issue to myself’ to automatically fill in your own&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Note: If you encounter ‘The DID Document not found’, please wait a moment and refresh the page again since it takes some time to get your identity on the blockchain.</p> 2.3 Finish your identity verification <p>Join our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/rRnGDBJ8N6">https://discord.gg/rRnGDBJ8N6</a>) and get your verification code from the ‘zkid-verify’ channel.</p><p>Type your whole Discord ID and Verification Code. Then you can choose your guess of the champion&nbsp;team.</p> 2.4 Submit <p>After submitting, you can see a notification as&nbsp;follows:</p> 3. Verify your VC to record your participation <p>Congratulations! Now you have finished guessing and got a Verifiable Credential to prove&nbsp;it!</p><p>To ensure every DID only chooses one team and the guessing is done before the deadline, you should share your credential hash and some verification information with zCloak verifier. Please note this is just for data commitment purpose. Your guessed team is a&nbsp;secret.</p> 3.1 Switch your&nbsp;role <p>In order to view and manage your credentials, you should switch your role to ‘Claimer’.</p> 3.2 Download and store your&nbsp;VC <p>Now you can view your VC. Please note that your VC data is saved in your browser cache. zCloak doesn’t save any of your VC data. You can download the VC as a json file and keep it in a safe&nbsp;place.</p><p>If you use other browsers or devices, you can import this VC file. If you lose your VC file, NOBODY can recover it for you. This is part of your responsibility in order to control your own&nbsp;data.</p> 3.3 Share your VC information <p>At this step, please share the Discord UserName and Verification Code from your VC. We only record the first share. Make sure you only share these two fields or you will be disqualified from the&nbsp;event.</p><p>The Receiver DID&nbsp;is:</p><p>did:zk:0x0A2F3464C592279A0dF3aFA27e5b05b0978923bA</p><p>All information ticked will be sent to us. To avoid disclosing your guess, please DO NOT tick ‘Champion Team’. Otherwise, you will be DISQUALIFIED.</p> 3.4 View the&nbsp;feedback <p>Congratulations! After getting the feedback in the ‘Notifications’, you have finished all the tasks in phase&nbsp;I.</p> 3.5 Retweet your&nbsp;VC <p>Now you can Reweet your VC to your friends as follows. Thank you for participating in this event! Please wait for our guidelines for the next&nbsp;phases.</p><p>Notes on the technical ingredients: the DID method — <a href="https://github.com/zCloak-Network/zk-did-method-specs">the “zk” method</a> — used in this event is implemented by zCloak Network and registered in the W3C. The zero-knowledge proof computation is based on the <a href="https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden">Polygon Miden VM</a> in the zkID wallet. User DID documents (not credential) are stored in <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a>. zCloak Network will compose a separate article to explain the cryptographic elements used in this&nbsp;event.</p> About zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>zCloak Network is a privacy-first DID and verifiable computation infrastructure. It aims to deliver the Web3 dream of Self-Sovereignty by moving both the storage and the computation of user data into user device from centralized servers. The integrity of user computation is proven by a STARK-based ZK-VM in a browser extension. zCloak’s W3C compatible DID system can mirror real-world legal status and reputation in DeSoc. With zCloak Network, people can use their real-world data for e.g. DeFi, Identity, Biometric applications without disclosing their privacy. zCloak Network is chain-agnostic — its identity and ZKP service can be served for most public blockchains.</p><p>Website: <a href="https://zcloak.network/#/">https://zcloak.network/#/</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork">https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork</a></p><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf">https://discord.gg/9RFhqVPGkf</a></p> Terms &amp; Conditions: <p>zCloak Network reserves the right to cancel or amend any Activity, Activity Rules, or Details at our sole discretion.</p><p>This campaign is open internationally, but restrictions due to compliance regulations for different jurisdictions apply.

<p>Game of Chains&nbsp;✨</p> Dear Cosmonauts! <p>Phase 2 officially ended on November 25, 2022! We hit a number of important milestones we are so excited to share! Buckle&nbsp;up:</p> HIGHLIGHTS <p>Game of Chains validators launched three new consumer chains, giving them a feel for the governance process and the DevOps that will be required to launch real consumer chains in production. These 3 consumer chains&nbsp;include:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/gopher">Gopher</a> — This is a consumer chain built by Hypha to help test the Go relayer with Interchain Security.</p><p>Neutron — This consumer chain will run in production come Interchain Security launch! They’ve been building their permissionless smart contract development platform for the past few months. Check out their announcement on launching Game of Chains&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Neutron_org/status/1595090867949563904">here</a>!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/hero">Hero</a> — This is the placeholder name for the Generic Asset Issuance Chain which is set to issue USDC come Interchain Security launch. Big shoutout to the StrangeLove team for developing Hero and putting in the work to get the Generic Asset Issuance chain to&nbsp;launch!</p><p>Throughout this process, validators voted on proposals, started up the consumer chains, set up relayers, and worked to ensure that their nodes were adequately configured to minimize downtime. Validators also ran through the motions of removing Apollo through a governance proposal, which was started in Phase&nbsp;1.</p> COMMUNITY <p>Validators and the broader Cosmos community have been actively participating in public discussions on Interchain Security including thoughts on ICS risks, validator operational overhead, auditing binaries, the role of testnets in ICS, and more! Check out this great Q&amp;A discussion hosted by Citizen Cosmos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXMoF18bckU">here</a>.</p> PHASE 3 HAS&nbsp;STARTED <p>We are already in the beginning stages of Phase 3 where validators will continue to run consumer chains and go through the process of starting and stopping consumer chains. Hypha has redistributed voting power so that the testnet coordinators no longer have majority control of the network. This will force validators to play a more active role in governance and keep everyone on their toes to ensure that the testnet keeps&nbsp;running!</p><p>In this phase, we are asking validators to propose new chains and vote on them. Those following along can keep track of which chains have been proposed <a href="https://testnet.ping.pub/provider/gov">here</a>. We already have Duality about to be onboarded as their governance proposal went live late Friday&nbsp;evening!</p>Shoutout to Dan B from Strangelove for the meme!&nbsp;😁 SCORING <p>We are keeping score of where validators are in the leaderboard on <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022#scoreboard">interchainsecurity.dev</a>. Thank you to everyone who has submitted evidence of their task completion. If you haven’t please make sure to do so to be eligible for a prize! Please note that tallying takes time and we’re trying to update the leaderboard once a week so the leaderboard won’t always have a full picture of validators standing in Game of&nbsp;Chains.</p><p>MASSIVE thank you to everyone for participating in Phase 2. Looking forward to seeing the validators become more self-sufficient in Phase 3and all of the new chains that will be proposed!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager.<br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-2-update-f93b07bc162f">PHASE 2 Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). </p>



<p>Four of the current ZCG committee members’ terms expire at the end of December, so we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to ZCG 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on 12th December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>During the week commencing 12th December, the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> to select four candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2023.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The four candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2023. Committee members may stand for re-election at the end of their term.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;Hudson Jameson’s decision to step down from the committee in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hudson-jameson-leaving-zcg/41941">June 2022</a>  triggered an election resulting in the appointment of Cody Burns, whose term will expire in June 2023. The other four committee members’ terms are expiring at the end of December 2022. </p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks. </p>



<p>From January, members will receive a stipend of $1,650 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>To avoid conflicts of interest, the following policy applies to the ZCG Committee: </p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members will be required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>Brave continues to expand its Wallet Partner program with the addition of 15 new DApps in November. Since June, over 75 projects have integrated Brave Wallet in their Web3-enabled applications. While we encourage outreach and partnership with the growing ecosystem of DApp builders, developers looking to add Brave Wallet to their DApps independently can use our <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">Brave Wallet documentation</a> for DIY integration in just a few steps.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet partners, read our past announcements from <a>June</a>, <a>July</a>, <a>August</a>, <a>September</a>, and <a>October</a>. Here are the partners that joined in November:</p>

 1inch 
<p><a href="https://1inch.io/">The 1inch Network</a> is a collection of DeFi products made for safe, lucrative, and fast operations in DeFi. Their lead product is a DEX aggregator that finds the best rate on swaps across 300 liquidity sources on multiple blockchains. The 1inch DEX aggregator has reached more than 3.7 million unique wallets, and $254 billion in overall transaction volume to date. Alongside the aggregation protocol, the 1inch core contributors’ team keeps developing their own liquidity protocol, limit order protocol, and a multichain mobile wallet.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to be integrated with Brave Wallet,” says Sergej Kunz, the 1inch Network co-founder. “This is an important step towards growing out of the DeFi space and bringing new users to Web3 products.”</p>

 Allbridge 
<p><a href="https://allbridge.io/">Allbridge Core</a> enables the transfer of value between blockchains by offering cross-chain swaps of native stablecoins. Being messaging protocol agnostic, Allbridge Core connects a variety of EVM and non-EVM networks.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly excited to join Brave’s Wallet Partner program. This enables us to provide cross-chain services to the widespread Brave community. Integrating Brave Wallet with Allbridge Core paves the way to more accessible stable swaps in the DeFi space,” said Andriy Velykyy, co-founder and CEO of Allbridge.</p>

 Autofarm 
<p><a href="https://autofarm.network/">Autofarm</a> is a multichain yield optimizer that enables users to get returns from yield farming pools by simply staking in Autofarm vaults. Vaults auto-compound yields at optimal intervals, while pooling gas costs through battle-tested smart contract code and best-in-class yield optimization strategies. AutoSwap also acts as a DEX aggregator which splits trades across multiple DEXs to ensure the best prices and lowest slippage possible, with no extra fees at all.</p>
<p>“As a leading yield optimizer in the DeFi scene, we are happy to partner with Brave. By implementing support for Brave Wallet, we have opened access to our safe and user-friendly DeFi experience for millions of Brave browser users,” said Luuk, Business Development at AutoFarm.</p>

 Based 
<p><a href="https://getbased.com/">Based</a> is a social messaging platform built around NFTs. They seek to enable individuals to create and experience more meaningful interactions around their NFT networks and content, with less effort, on one native platform.</p>

 Cardinal 
<p><a href="https://www.cardinal.so/">Cardinal</a> is a Solana protocol that enables the conditional ownership of NFTs. It’s powering the future of NFT utility through rentals, subscriptions, staking, tickets, royalty enforcement, and more.</p>
<p>“Innovating with the Brave team was exciting on many levels. We had a chance to work with a group who were passionate about making a difference in the NFT landscape and tackle the challenge of enforcing royalties. From a custom minting experience using BAT token, to delivering world class art, the <a>Brave launch</a> was exactly what the space needed,” said Manny Lora, Head of Partnerships at Cardinal.</p>

 Coral Cube 
<p><a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a> is a best in class NFT aggregator, marketplace, and launchpad. Since inception in early 2022, the team has been dedicated to serving creators and collectors across NFT use cases, known for its ability to address customer needs throughout the value chain.</p>
<p>“It’s a tremendous honor to partner with a Web3 mainstay like Brave. At Coral Cube, we’ve admired Brave’s innovative practices and sustainable business model, a pioneer for delivering user value. We’re excited to deepen our partnership, help bootstrap Brave’s NFT initiatives and support their growing team,” said Meisam Vosoughpour, CEO at Coral Cube.</p>

 EYWA 
<p><a href="https://eywa.fi">EYWA</a> is a decentralized cross-chain interoperability protocol that allows cheap transfers between asset types within any connected chain. EYWA helps projects become cross-chain and offers ultimate transaction simplicity for users. The EYWA ecosystem includes cross-chain products such as Token Bridge, Data Protocol, DEX, Assets, Liquidity Aggregator, and Liquidity Protocol.</p>
<p>“Our main idea is decentralization. We believe that partnering with Brave will accelerate the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies in the global community. Brave is one of today’s best Web3 projects with a huge audience who has access to cryptocurrency benefits through their wallet and browser. We will help bring in additional features such as gasless transactions, and fast and convenient cross-chain exchanges. We believe that society is ready for decentralized and reliable finance,” said Boris Povar, CEO at EYWA.</p>

 Guild 
<p><a href="https://guild.xyz/">Guild.xyz</a> is the infrastructure for platformless access management. It exists to help you manage communities, and create portable memberships and social structures around on- and off-chain requirements—and to build unique user journeys across applications.</p>
<p>“When users connect their wallets to guild.xyz, Brave is the default wallet Guild offers at login if they are not using other extensions. This makes the user experience much smoother, familiar, and personalized for our members,” said Raz, Founder at guild.xyz.</p>

 Hyperspace 
<p><a href="http://hyperspace.xyz">Hyperspace.xyz</a> is the most liquid NFT marketplace and aggregator on Solana helping NFT traders save money buying and selling NFTs across over 20 different sources. Hyperspace also provides infrastructure to empower creators and developers to build native web3 experiences via NFT APIs. Their mission is to enable the future of NFT trading and commerce.</p>
<p>“We are proud to partner with Brave wallet to enable users to use a secure wallet experience. With so many users using the Brave browser and BAT, we are excited to integrate more deeply into the Brave ecosystem,” said Kamil, Co-founder at Hyperspace.</p>

 Matrica 
<p><a href="https://matrica.io/">Matrica Labs</a> focuses on providing critical infrastructure within the blockchain ecosystem.

<p>“As a daily Brave browser user, utilizing Brave Wallet was a no-brainer. The experience has been seamless and it’s great knowing you’re receiving the same emphasis on security and privacy that Brave is all about,” said Joseph, COO at Matrica Labs.</p>

 Morpho 
<p>The <a href="https://www.morpho.xyz/">Morpho</a> protocol is a lending pool optimizer on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s a peer-to-peer layer on top of lending pools like Compound and Aave. Rates are seamlessly improved for suppliers and borrowers while preserving the same liquidity and risk parameters. The core use cases are lending and borrowing assets and earning interest. Currently, the protocol deals with ~$300 million in total liquidity.</p>
<p>“Thanks to Blocknative, the integration of Brave Wallet in our DApp was almost seamless,” said Tom, DevRel at Morpho Labs.</p>

 Tectonic 
<p><a href="https://tectonic.finance/">Tectonic</a> is the leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol and money market on <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos in partnership with Crypto.com.

<p>“We viewed fully integrating Brave Wallet into Plaid Wallet Onboard as an important priority for crypto consumers and our developers. It is one of the top wallets on desktop and mobile, and we want to make sure these consumers can quickly find and connect Brave whenever they are connecting,” said Clay Allsopp, Head of Crypto at Plaid.</p>

     ZenCon0 – Our first-ever ecosystem summit has wrapped up! This inaugural event brought together some of the greatest minds in crypto to envision our future.  
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23900"></a></p>
<p>Celebrating the growth and accomplishments of our project and ecosystem with partners and supporters was a dream come true for us. Hosted by our sister company Horizen Labs, we welcomed partners, advisors, and community members that joined us at our first ecosystem summit to celebrate our achievements and share ideas for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-day conference was filled with spotlights, panels, and break-out sessions ranging from <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">Metaverse on the Horizen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/zXhR5u3RLhs">Web3 &amp; Sports</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wGaZRj5VOCg">The Power of Community</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG stories</a>, and more!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23901"></a></p>
 Welcoming Our Friends 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23902"></a></p>
<p>We were thrilled to see many of our partners, team members, and long-time community members on stage at this event. Each panel and discussion was fantastic, but some of our favorite highlights included the <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG panel with Horizen co-founder Rolf Versluis</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXhR5u3RLhs&amp;t=1s">the Web3 Sports fireside chat with Andrea Radrizzani of Leeds United</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/prLOm0JgLwY">the Horizen EVM marketplace presentation and demo with Sebastian Gronewald of Create3 Labs</a>. We were also able to capture footage of the event setup, which you can <a href="https://youtu.be/0jnOyIX-z1Y">check out on YouTube</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23903"></a></p>
 The BizTalks 
<p>We heard many interesting talks in the areas of finance and investing, such as “<a href="https://youtu.be/54NnrY2XmN8">Growing the Ecosystem Through Investments and Introducing HL Builders</a>,” <a href="https://youtu.be/lI_l-hRHzs8">“Cryptoeconomics trends”</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/j2XjwfOq8kU">Venture Now – The Investor Perspective</a>, and more! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23904"></a></p>
<p>The panel <a href="https://youtu.be/ZUlGgTdE7V0">“Metaverse Trends”</a> gave attendees an intriguing look into what trends thought leaders in the space are looking at currently and where they think they will head in the near future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23905"></a></p>
<p>The discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/dnJR_x9M7PA">“</a>Raising Funds – The Startup Perspective” gave us all an intriguing perspective on some of the early stages of creating a startup especially focused on web3 and blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
 The TechTalks 
<p>On the tech side of things, we heard incredible updates from the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams’ – <a href="https://youtu.be/8dgQ8Vr5FWs">an overview of TokenMint and its current status</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">where the team is on the Horizen EVM sidechain, DeFi on Horizen</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JvY8o8N4_2Q">what’s next for Zendoo</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We welcomed experts to share their knowledge on topics like <a href="https://youtu.be/rJ2NWf-KcpY">“Plonk and LookUp Arguments,”</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/kQ37ZJ_wtO0">“Private NFT Protocols,”</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX7dGq_GZuI">“zkVMs Under the Hood,”</a> to mention a few. These educational panel discussions and talks provided many with additional technical expertise and understanding. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23906"></a></p>
 The Team Sessions 
<p>ZenCon0 also brought the global team together in one place to brainstorm, connect, and innovate. The Horizen Labs and Horizen teams from different divisions gave presentations on their expertise areas, which allowed members of other teams to gain exposure and knowledge in areas they might not previously have. Ranging from hands-on demos and product overviews to improving blockchain communications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23908"></a></p>
<p>Internal sessions like “Bridging the Divide: From Tech to Product,” a discussion on how products go from technical concepts to useable products and how we market them, enabled the team to learn more about process flow and improvements and get insights into how other teams work together to drive our future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23909"></a></p>
<p>While sessions like <a href="https://youtu.be/2OiF6cxJu94">“Common Vulnerabilities in Solidity Smart Contracts”</a> enabled us all to learn more about the tech behind our upcoming releases and understand more about the engineering decisions behind the creation of things like our upcoming EVM sidechain. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23910"></a></p>
 The Parties! 
<p>We kicked off ZenCon the night before the conference with a beautiful, welcoming party at the location of the event. This was an amazing opportunity for everyone to network and was where some of our team members met one another in person for the first time before kicking off the next two days!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23911"></a></p>
<p>The next side party was the CryptoMondays and Horizen Rooftop Aperativo at the Horizen Milan office, which was a great opportunity for further networking and enabled our team members outside of Milan to see the new office! This was an amazing event followed by a mystery dinner, where everyone was grouped randomly to enjoy dinner and network outside of our typical teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23912"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we ended this amazing experience and event with a fantastic closing party with great music, delicious food, and dancing! It was the perfect end to the best event we attended this year, and we cannot wait to welcome everyone again for the next ZenCon! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23913"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23914"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23915"></a></p>
 After ZenCon – Getting the Team Together 
<p>After the main event, the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams took on an exciting challenge – A Horizen hackathon focusing on dapps that could be created on our upcoming EVM! The winners would have a chance to help make their idea a reality in our ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This fun team-building exercise was a great way for everyone to get to know each other better. The teams all came up with great ideas that we could see being potential use cases on Horizen one day! You may even see one of them in the coming months!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23917"></a></p>
<p>We also took a day to enable our teams to get to know each other better and get some well-deserved relaxation. We spent time hiking, exploring, and enjoying one another’s company. Afterward, the team split into groups to complete a fun scavenger hunt! Followed by an amazing final dinner together before we all traveled back home.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating field that has made tremendous development over the past few years. From GPT-3 to Dall-e and Stable Diffusion, the vastness of the scope of applications for AI and neural computing is becoming clearer than ever. At the base layer, there is a need for decentralized p2p AI compute platform that provides flexible access to the wider public. Gensyn sets out on the mission to provide just that by building a market place protocol for AI compute - ultra-low cost, hyperscale, permissionless.</p><p>In today’s episode we are joined by the project's co-founders Ben Fielding and Harry Grieve. We take a deep dive into the current landscape for AI and AI compute, the reasonings and trade-offs in building Gensyn, the protocol’s focus and edge cases, and how the protocol is utilizing the blockchain technology as both incentive layer and credibly neutral platform.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The founders' background and reasonings for development on Blockchain  The current state of AI development and breakdown of AI concepts  The current landscape for AI modeling and compute  Gensyn's difference to other protocols, such as Golem  How Gensyn is adhering to the decentralized default, and making trade-offs in product building  Building Gensyn as a Layer-1 protocol  Deep dive into the Gensyn Protocol and edge cases  Other players in the protocol: solvers, verifiers, and whistle blowers  Building a blockchain  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://www.gensyn.ai/">Gensyn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/gensynai">Gensyn on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/fenbielding">Ben Fielding on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/_grieve">Harry Grieve on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Tally Ho: Tally Ho is a new wallet for Web3 and DeFi that sees the wallet as a public good.

<p>Within the digital identity ecosystem, verifiable credentials (VCs) refers to an open standard for digital credentials that represent information that would normally be found in passports, driver’s licences, university titles, and other forms of accreditation.</p>



<p>In this post, we explain the mechanics underpinning VCs and some potential use cases.</p>



 In another time and another place, there were trustworthy knights. 



<p>Ivanhoe is one of Walter Scott’s best-known works. Deemed a historical romance novel, the story follows Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a Saxon knight, and his beloved, Lady Rowena. The thrust of the plot is Ivanhoe’s determination to marry Lady Rowena, with whom she grew up after Rowena was orphaned and became the ward of Wilfred’s father, Cedric, a powerful Saxon lord. The conflict arises when Cedric betroths Rowena to another, Athelstane, out of political interest.</p>



<p>Wilfred is portrayed as the epitome of chivalry. He’s heroic, honourable, and loyal. Rowena is equally depicted as chaste, virtuous, and loyal to her true feelings of love for Ivanhoe. Becoming a knight was a big deal in those days. Indeed, knighthood came to be considered a form of nobility, though in the lower scale. But the point is that knights were respectable, trustworthy individuals. So much so that, often, knights were assigned as elite personal guards for lords, who trusted knights implicitly. Over time, and as methods of warfare evolved, knights gradually became obsolete and eventually morphed into the honorary titles that survive to this day.</p>



<p>Let’s focus on the trust part, as this has bearing on our narrative. Knighthood could be earned by different means: prowess on the battlefield, for certain. Social status did have an influence. The peasantry had a scant chance of being knighted, for example. And there were economic factors at play, too. Armour, weapons, and knight-related paraphernalia were expensive, and beyond the reach of most. But perhaps the key factor for a lord (or someone from the royalty) to bestow knighthood unto somebody was trust. A knight-to-be had to prove himself worthy of trust by the lord. This implied honour, the upholding and protection of the weak, and respect. All these attributes had to be proven before the dubbing ceremony took place, where the lord would place the flat of a sword on the shoulders of the man kneeling before him, thus bestowing knighthood upon him. A foundation of trust was vital for the lord-knight relationship to work.</p>



 The triangle of trust 



<p>Fast forward a few centuries to the present day. Blockchain technology has enabled a new identity framework, centred around digital credentials. VCs are part of that framework.</p>



<p>VCs stand at the centre of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. The triangle represents the following flow: the Issuer digitally signs a credential (or set of), and issues them to the Holder, which manages the credentials and, when required, presents them to the Verifier. In this context, the Issuer and the Holder trust each other. The Holder trusts the Verifier, and the Verifier trusts the Issuer. As we can see, VCs are anchored on implicit trust, much like the relationship between a knight and a lord was all those years ago. Furthermore, this identity model puts the individual (the knight, in our narrative) in control of their identity attributes.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: quick definition 



<p>We all carry a set of physical credentials in our wallets at all times. Driver licenses, government IDs, library cards, health insurance cards, a passport if we are abroad, and myriad others. These things are a) cumbersome, and b) antiquated. It is cumbersome because we have so many of them, all issued by different entities. And antiquated because, well, they come in physical form, which means they can be lost or damaged beyond usability. Both scenarios would require contacting the issuing entity’s help desk many times, and a lengthy wait until a replacement is issued.</p>



<p>Now imagine if, instead of having to carry all those documents on you at all times, all you had to do was show a QR code that contained all that information. If you needed to use any of your credentials, someone would just scan the QR code, and poof, voila. Done. This is the essence of VCs. A digital representation of credentials that enables the individual to selectively share their information, without having to actually show the actual data. VCs enable the third party to instantly verify that the information is true, without having to call or contact anyone else.</p>



<p>In short: VCs are tamper-proof credentials that can be instantly and cryptographically verified.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: properties and components 



<p>As specified in the W3 data model, VCs must fulfil three inherent properties. They must be:</p>



  Machine-verifiable  Secure and tamper-proof  Respectful of privacy  



<p>At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs</p>



<p>Metadata – This is information cryptographically signed by the Issuer. Metadata reflects the properties of the credential (who the issuer is, expiry date, and a public key, among many other pieces of information).<br>Claims – A statement about the Holder. Date of birth, for example.<br>Proofs – Information about the Holder that accomplishes four things:</p>



  Allows others to verify the source of the data (i.e., the issuer)  Proves that the data belongs to the Holder, and to that Holder alone  Guarantees that the data has not been tampered with  Checks that the data has not been revoked by the Issuer  



<p>All this information is contained within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file, which is an open specification format for transmitting data as a series of attributes and values, and also arrays. These JSON files can then be converted into a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is essentially a JSON file with a cryptographic signature added in. These signatures are kept secure by a pair of public and private keys.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: use cases 



<p>VCs can be applied to many different aspects of identity-related frameworks. For example:</p>



  Government-issued documents, including passports, driver licences, national ID cards, etc.  Travel visas  Healthcare certificates  Credit scoring information  Educational credentials (diplomas, university titles, and any other academic achievements)  Documentation required for opening bank accounts, and applying for <a href="https://zaisan.io/self-sovereign-identity-finance/">financial products</a> (loans, mortgages, etc.)  Credentials for opening a bank account or setting up payments  Verification of disability status  



<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. Rather, it is a sample of some of the possible solutions that VCs can be part of.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>There are no knights in today’s world, at least not like the ones described in Ivanhoe, or so many other medieval-themed tales. But the image of the honourable and strait-laced Wilfred will do just fine for our analogy. Wilfred (and all those bestowed with a knighthood) embodied trust, truth, and honour. VCs play a very similar role, albeit several centuries later, and in a world that has moved away from the centralization of power that lords represented. You can think of VCs as the knights of a decentralised world, representing the system of trust, truth, and honour that every identity framework requires to function.</p>



 Key takeaways 



  VCs stand at the center of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier  Current standards dictate that VCs must be machine-verifiable, secure and tamper-proof, and respectful of privacy  At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs  VC information is usually presented in JSON format, which can be converted into a JWT. This adds a cryptographic signature to the credential

 zCloak Network Partners with Scroll to Provide a Privacy-Preserving Identity Service on Ethereum Layer&nbsp;2 <p>zCloak Network announced that it will work with Scroll to provide a privacy-preserving identity service on Ethereum L2 for Scroll users. The partnership will focus on bringing a W3C compatible DID and Verifiable Credential platform on Scroll’s L2 architecture. The collaboration will also include an exploration of call data cost optimization and general research on zk-STARK/zk-SNARK technology, etc.</p><p>Scroll is a native zkEVM layer 2 solution for the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to scale Ethereum with cutting-edge research and technology. With zkEVM to prove the correctness of EVM execution in Layer2 and the building of a complete L2 architecture around it, Scroll is providing a full zkRollup solution on Ethereum. Additionally, if Scroll provides its users with a full suite of DID and Verifiable Credential service, there will be more possibilities of use cases explored and better interaction on Scroll’s L2 structure with less friction.</p><p>zCloak Network can provide Scroll with such DID and Verifiable Credential services with its <a href="http://zkid.app/">zkID.app</a> product and related SDK. zkID.app helps users to establish their own DID on Scroll, and this decentralized identity will function as an avatar of an entity in cyberspace, and their real-world identity data will be linked to it in a privacy-preserving way, stored on user’s local devices through browser extension.</p><p>The link of real-world data to DID is made possible by verifiable credentials. In this case, zCloak wants to help Scroll construct a platform where Scroll’s users can have their identity data attested, generate Verifiable credentials (VC), and use their VCs in various applications on Scroll’s L2&nbsp;network.</p><p>In more advanced use cases, services provided by zCloak Network can also serve as proof of social relations between users and organizations. Moreover, organizations can use zCloak to do KYC on their clients with an approach that preserves user privacy and data sovereignty. There are many use cases for <a href="http://zkid.app/">zkID.app</a> to be applied on Scroll, for example, DAOs can prove their treasury is above a certain number without disclosing the exact portfolio. In another case, project founders can prove that they have certain education or work experience without giving away too many&nbsp;details.</p><p>In conclusion, by collaborating with Scroll, zCloak Network leverages zero-knowledge proof technology to provide a unique set of DID protocols and infrastructure for Scroll’s users to use their real-world data for on-chain activities while preserving privacy. There will be implementation of both parties’ technology and products within this partnership, mainly regarding identity verification, conveying trustworthiness, and privacy protection. Both zCloak Network and Scroll are bringing Web3.0 solutions to projects and users, and we believe our collaboration will drive higher trust within the Web3.0&nbsp;world.</p> About Scroll <p>Scroll is a native zkEVM Layer 2 scaling solution built to scale Ethereum. Scroll enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts, trustless security, and the same developer experience as Ethereum L1. Scroll’s architecture consists of Scroll Node, Roller Network, and Rollup and Bridge Contracts. Putting all of these together, Scroll is able to execute native EVM bytecode on L2 while inheriting strong security guarantees from base layer Ethereum. Scroll’s visions are to empower humanity — starting with blockchain developers and users, to build in the open with the community, and to fight for decentralization and censorship resistance.</p><p><a href="https://scroll.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://discord.gg/GQxeCTA4dJ">Discord</a></p> About zCloak&nbsp;Network <p>zCloak Network is a privacy-first DID and verifiable computation infrastructure. It aims to deliver the Web3 dream of Self-Sovereignty by moving both the storage and the computation of user data into user device from centralized servers. The integrity of user computation is proven by a STARK-based ZK-VM in a browser extension. zCloak’s W3C compatible DID system can mirror real-world legal status and reputation in DeSoc. With zCloak Network, people can use their real-world data for e.g. DeFi, Identity, Biometric applications without disclosing their privacy. zCloak Network is chain-agnostic — its identity and ZKP service can be served for most public blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://zcloak.network/#/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/zCloakNetwork">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/j3mATwNVSH">Discord</a></p>

Findora Postmortem Report<blockquote>This postmortem report is written for and provided to the community to provide transparency into a recent outage. This article will describe the event, its root cause, and its resolution while highlighting how improvements will be made in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the&nbsp;issue.</blockquote> Event Date <p>Tuesday, November 15,&nbsp;2022</p> Impact &amp;&nbsp;Duration   Mainnet consensus halted  Duration: 4.5&nbsp;Hours   Overview <p>The Discreet Labs DevOps team attempted to coordinate with a set of Findora community validators for a pilot upgrade on the Findora Mainnet network. During this attempt, the Mainnet network experienced an unexpected outage. Engineers identified the issue, immediately began troubleshooting efforts, and worked with the affected validators to revert the nodes to their previous version. More community validators joined the effort to restore their&nbsp;nodes.</p> What Occurred <p>At approximately 5 PM, Nov 15, 2022 (PST), the Findora Mainnet’s consensus stopped for 4.5 hours. The incident was triggered, not caused, by several transactions sent from a newer beta version of the Findora wallet after DevOps coordinated with a set of validators during a pilot upgrade with the v0.3.3X Mainnet&nbsp;update.</p><p>The event was detected proactively by the event monitoring system. Discreet Labs began troubleshooting efforts within 10 minutes of the notification.</p> Root Cause(s) <p>The v0.3.3X update includes a new transaction parameter in the transaction body. The transaction hash calculation logic of the node is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Deserialization -&gt; Signature Verification -&gt; Transaction Execution -&gt; Serialization -&gt; Compute Transaction Hash</blockquote><p>Since the new parameter did not exist in previous versions, nodes running v0.3.27 ignored the parameter when calculating the transaction hash. In version 0.3.3X, however, this field is involved in the transaction hash calculation, thus causing the transaction hashes to be inconsistent.</p> Resolution <p>The new transaction parameter will be ignored for hash calculation in v0.3.3X but will retain its role in signature verification. This update to release v0.3.3X will ensure transaction hashes remain backward compatible with v0.3.2X&nbsp;nodes.</p> Moving Forward <p>The Discreet Labs team has documented several lessons learned and preventive measures to take moving forward. The items below reflect the methods teams will use collaboratively to minimize risk and optimize communication.</p> Additional Testing via Mainnet-Mock   Upgrades with impact potential will undergo additional rounds of testing on a transient network called “Mainnet-Mock”. This network will be an identical copy of Mainnet, including its data and validators, acting as a mirror of Findora’s production network.  Mainnet-Mock will be created and deconstructed as needed. As a mirror copy of Mainnet, testing against the Mainnet-Mock network will require the assistance and close communication of Findora community validators to reach &gt; 66.67% consensus.  Upgrades that carry potential impact will be validated on the Mainnet-Mock network before being classified as “Mainnet-Ready”.   Change Management Process Improvements <p>Changes that can impact production will go through an improved change management process. These process improvements will ensure that all the appropriate stakeholders are in-sync with the engineering change&nbsp;task.</p>  Discreet Labs will continue to ensure that partners and CEX contacts are notified of upcoming changes using the schedule above. Technical support will continue to be provided when&nbsp;needed.  The details of changes that can impact production will be communicated extensively with the community well in advance of the scheduled change date. Discreet Labs will share information two weeks before the change, one week prior, three days prior, one day prior, the day of the change, and the day&nbsp;after.  Change information will be shared across social media, pinned to the official Discord and Telegram channels and Reddit as announcement posts. Discreet Labs will communicate to the validator community on validator-specific channels across Discord and Telegram.  Mainnet-Mock testing will be conducted as part of the change management process. See above for information on Mainnet-Mock.  <p>Special thanks to the validator community who worked together in restoring their nodes in a collaborative manner, reflecting the positive values the Findora community fosters and embraces. Your decision to help decentralize and secure the Findora network is greatly&nbsp;valued.</p><p>We look forward to upgrading Mainnet to v0.3.3X together.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

<p>Secure multi-party computation is a well-known cryptographic technique designed to secure digital assets or protect information cryptographically. Today, several MPC theories and algorithms are leveraged in various sectors to safeguard information. Similarly, with the rise in popularity of blockchain-based financial solutions (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">DeFi</a>), the interest in MPC has spiked, mainly due to the applications of MPC in safeguarding funds in crypto wallets.<br></p><p>In a nutshell, multi-party computation enables programmatic solutions to secure “secrets” by splitting them into multiple parts, such that no single participant know the underlying “truth”. Thanks to this, no single participant can reconstruct or leak secret information.<br></p><p>In this article, we will understand the concept of secure multi-party computation in detail, how it works, and its numerous applications.</p> What is multi-party computation (MPC)? <p>Multi-party computation is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties, each in possession of fragments of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-in-the-age-of-surveillance-a-pipedream-or-something-worth-fighting-for-341a67f1db76/">private data</a>, to participate in computing a specific result. This specific result is computed by combining their data without disclosing the nature or content of their inputs or any other secret information related to the process. <br></p><p>In simpler terms, multi-party computation brings together separate entities holding pieces of information that, when combined, can reveal a secret, sign a message, or approve a transaction. It’s also worth noting that MPC achieves this without revealing any details on the information in each individual's possession.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that in MPC, the data split across multiple participants does not represent the secret if simply combined together. Instead, these pieces of information will serve as inputs to participate in the desired computation. Every valid MPC protocol must fulfill two specific requirements:<br></p>  Suppose participants reveal their secret information or discard the rules during the computation. In that case, the multi-party computation protocol will not allow dishonest participants to force the honest parties to disclose their confidential information or influence the outcome of the result.<br>  No one can deduce each party's secret information from the protocol's execution. This means that the result of the computation does not give its holders any hint of what the private information in the participants' possession is.<br>  <p>MPC as a concept is said to be born in 1980s when Chinese computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yao">Andrew Yao</a> first adopted two-party computation and introduced secure multi-party computation. Here's what the timeline of the evolution of MPC looks like:<br></p>  1982 – 1986: To solve the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem">Millionaire's Problem</a>, Andrew Yao introduced two-party computation and adapted it to any calculation involving two parties.<br>  1987: Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Avi Wigderson release the <a href="https://wiki.mpcalliance.org/gmw.html">Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson protocol</a>, adapting two-party computation to a multi-party format.<br>  The 1990s: More studies on multi-party computation resulted in several breakthroughs, one of which was enabling MPC on mobile (i.e. less powerful) devices.<br>  2008: The first practical application of MPC at scale occurred in a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/meeting-on-privacy-enhancing-cryptography/documents/toft.pdf">sealed-bid sugar beet auction</a> in Denmark.<br>  2015: Following an increase in hacks and thefts from crypto wallets, crypto wallet providers and custodians begin utilizing MPC for private key and digital asset security.  2019: The <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/pushing-mpc-wallet-signing-speeds-8x-with-mpc-cmp-9/">MPC-CMP</a> debuted as the first automatic, one-round key-refreshing multi-party computation algorithm.   How does multi-party computation work? <p>To understand how multi-party computation works, let’s consider one famous example.<br></p><p>Greg and Smith, two employees holding similar roles at a company, are having lunch. Then, they want to know whether they earn the same amount or if any of them is being paid less than what they deserve. Yet, they do not want to reveal their wages. How do they solve this dilemma without revealing their secrets to one another?<br></p><p>A simple way to solve their problem would be to disclose their income to a trusted mutual friend, who can tell them if they earn the same wage based on the information she has received. However, the goal of a multi-party computation protocol is to help them figure out who's worth the most among them without third-party involvement.<br></p><p>Using oblivious transfers, Greg and Smith can solve their dilemma quickly. The oblivious transfer method is a non-technical way to explain secure multi-party computation. In this scenario, Greg gets four locked suggestion boxes and marks each box with a particular amount that may represent the hourly pay for their roles. Box-1 is marked $40, Box-2 is marked $50, Box-3 is marked $60, and Box-4 is marked $70.<br></p><p>Let’s say Greg earns $50 hourly, so he takes only the key for Box 2. Smith makes $60 hourly and has to select the box that matches his hourly earnings. On four pieces of paper, he writes a 'NO' on three sheets and a 'YES' on the fourth. These scribblings will go into each box, and the one with a 'YES' goes into Box-3 since Smith earns $60 per hour, while other boxes get a NO.<br></p><p>When Greg unlocks Box-2, he finds a NO, indicating that Smith does not earn $50 per hour. Greg now has to tell Smith that they do not make the same hourly wage, though neither of them knows who earns more or less. Their secrets are safe, and they have exchanged information without revealing anything. Note that this analogy depends on honesty from both parties.<br></p><p>Secure multi-party computation splits essential information that can be used to compute a specific result among multiple parties in total secrecy. Each participant only knows the information in their possession, and throughout the computation, no part of the secrets are revealed.<br></p>Another example, similar to one mentioned above, to understand the concept on MPC. (<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/secure-multi-party-computation/">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p></p>Threshold signature scheme MPC diagram. (<a href="https://www.qredo.com/blog/what-is-multi-party-computation-mpc">Source</a>) Applications of multi-party computation <p>Over the years, multi-party computation has found several use cases and applications. The earliest <a href="https://partisia.com/better-market-solutions/mpc-goes-live/">large-scale application</a> was recorded in 2008 at a sealed-bid sugar beet auction in Denmark. Farmers' bids were private, with the protocol responsible for determining the highest bid. The farmer with the winning bid went on to pay the second-highest request on the bidding log. Sealed-bid auctions remain popular still. <br></p><p>There are several variations and modifications of multi-party computation schemes enabling further applications. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">Threshold signature schemes</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shamirs-secret-sharing-algorithm-cryptography/">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> are two famous examples of cryptographic methods leveraging MPC. <br></p><p>Other significant applications of MPC include:</p> Data Analytics <p>Big firms that deal with confidential user data, like healthcare companies or financial institutions, can collect data securely from an anonymous pool of users, compute, analyze, and gain insights from the data using MPC. This way, users will not reveal their personal information, and these organizations can <a href="https://soda-project.eu/mpcenterprise/">analyze</a> the data for insights without uncovering it. <br></p><p>This same method can be applied to autonomous cars, shipping or truck fleets, and aircraft fleets, with recipients like car companies, city planners, and service providers benefitting from the insights without knowing any details on the information provided.</p> Genetic Testing <p>Secure multi-party computation can also be utilized in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7545831">genetic testing</a>. Patients can access their genetic profiles privately and securely without revealing any confidential information on their metabolism rates, family traits, hereditary disease information, and other data thatthey would rather not share.</p> Threshold MultiSig in Blockchains <p>Threshold multi-signature schemes are a subfield of multi-party computation and can perform similar functions as a private key on the blockchain, including public address generation and transaction signing. <br></p><p>With MPC, the private keys of a crypto wallet can be split (<a href="https://silencelaboratories.com/silent-shard/">shards</a>) among several parties in such a way that for any function to be performed, a minimum number of people holding key shares have to be involved. <br></p><p>If some participants within the group become dishonest, they will not be able to have their way unless they reach the threshold for signing transactions. Usually, these participants do not know each other.</p> Digital Wallet Security <p>Multi-party computation protocols enhance private key security and, by extension, digital wallet security. Most cryptocurrency wallets use private keys, usually stored in a particular '<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted</a>' device. While this method primarily depends on the strength of the device's security measures, it also presents a single point of failure. <br></p><p>Using MPC, private keys are split up between multiple entities, making it more difficult for attackers to compromise the digital wallet since they have to attack multiple points simultaneously.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Multi-party computation has evolved over the years and remains a crucial breakthrough in the world of cryptography today. From sealed-bid auctions to crypto wallets, MPC protocols are being leveraged in various applications. <br></p><p>From a blockchain perspective, however, leveraging MPC for security of digital wallets is a critical, immediate application that multiple parties are invested on. As more and more wallet providers begin to adopt MPC protocols for wallet security, the era of seed phrases may be over. As of now, several <a href="https://zengo.com/mpc-wallet/">wallet providers</a> have already started opting MPC to offer better protection and an improved user experience.<br></p><p>In the coming year, hopefully, we'll have more real-life applications of multi-party computation touching our daily lives similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication">public key authentication</a>.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>Since joining Privy earlier this year, I’ve been spending most of my time working with web3 developers to help improve their products’ UX, onboarding flows, and user data privacy. I’ve spoken with over 100 founders in the space working on gaming, NFTs, web3 social, defi, payments/accounting, and much more. In spite of all the recent market uncertainty, my optimism about our market burns hotter than ever. Here are some learnings from a very deep dive with&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Winter is here. As we bundle up and prepare for another cycle of hunkered down building, the Privy team has been reflecting on what it’ll take for web3 to unlock the next phase of adoption beyond financial use cases. In the coming months, seeds will be planted that’ll grow into the next wave of consumer apps to shape our lives. These apps must prove to be useful and fun enough to pull both my 15-year-old cousin and my 85-year-old grandma into our market (whether they know it or&nbsp;not).</p><p>Our work helping developers build better web3 products and bridge the gap between on and off chain data has given us a sense of the features these apps will need to have to hit mainstream adoption. Without further ado, here are our ingredients for developers cooking up the web3 consumer apps of tomorrow:</p>  Progressive onboarding — meet users where they are: The next billion blockchain users don’t have self-custodial wallets yet. While self-custody is perhaps the single most important feature of a web3 product, apps need first-class ways for walletless users to onboard and get immediate value. The best apps will have ways for users to onboard via email or social identities, and seamlessly upgrade to self-custody when they’re ready or as the app demands it. As the old saying goes: you’ll attract more bees with email auth than with mnemonics.  Mobile-first — bringing blockchains to every pocket: If you’ve given up on a web3 app after trying to connect on mobile, you’re not alone. The broken mobile user flow of getting misdirected to the app store upon wallet connection runs rampant, and for good reason: building mobile-optimized experiences in web3 is hard. But mobile accounts for &gt;60% of internet traffic (growing fast!). The web3 apps of tomorrow will be natively mobile — props to apps like OpenSea, Zapper, and dYdX for leading the way&nbsp;here!  Friction where it matters — when to slow a user down: Not all blockchain transactions are created equal. While it might make sense to interrupt a user session to prompt a signature on a financial transaction, many on-chain events should occur without user interruptions, notably in web3 social and gaming. Should you sign something every time you follow a new account, make an in-game move, or like a post? Of course not. Lots of exciting development in areas like session-specific keys and account abstraction will pull UX forward on this front. The best apps will be judicious about when to prompt users (shout out to our friends at Farcaster for showing us an example of what great looks&nbsp;like!).  Asset portability — open is the way to win: Whether they realize it or not, consumers will choose to use blockchain apps because they allow users to seamlessly bring their assets in and take their assets out. While it can be a tempting value capture play for developers to lock assets into their apps’ walled gardens, this misses the point! Games that let users bring their own leveling reputation and that let users leave with assets they earn in gameplay stand to attract new potential audiences and deliver much richer first time experiences for those audiences off the bat. Financial assets, user data, and identity will travel with users across the internet, and developers who build for more than just using blockchain as a financial backdrop for their apps can unlock new user experiences that are only possible in&nbsp;web3.  <p>It’s always darkest before dawn. Winters are exactly the sort of distraction-free environments necessary to breed the innovations that pull our market forward each cycle: it’s no coincidence that Ethereum and Uniswap were launched in the depths of 2015 and 2018, respectively. As long as we cook up the next generation of web3 apps with the above in mind, this should be the last winter before mainstream consumer adoption is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>We’re lucky to be serving the builders working day-and-night to turn mainstream adoption into a reality, and we can’t wait to show you all what we’ve been up to these past few&nbsp;months.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/how-crypto-goes-mainstream-from-here-d1371be33d5f">How Crypto Goes Mainstream from Here</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
