  Progress towards v1, participation in blockchain events, and the final strides towards Advanced Staking are just a little part of what happened in September. Here is our monthly recap.

<p><br>October is here, which means that it’s time to share our progress and achievements in the previous month. Let’s look at what happened in September and what we’re preparing for this one!</p> Tech and Product <p>Thanks to many advances on the contracts’ side, the front-end, and updated documentation, Advanced Staking’s launch is within an arm’s length. Throughout its development, we’ve defined several new ideas and strategies that will be crucial to Panther’s v1 functioning.<br></p><p>In the first week of September, we identified a potential DoS attack vector within the Advanced Staking redemption mechanisms. After iterating through a few solutions, we’ve settled on a design that left no window for attacks and approved by our auditors. This fix required a few UI/UX changes, which were promptly handled. We are preparing a document about this fix that also explains how Panther will deal with this and a specific type of front-running attack.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, we’ve expanded the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/staking/phase-2-advanced-staking">documentation on Advanced Staking and Panther Reward Points (PRPs)</a>, highlighting the difference between Advanced and Private Staking, the components that make Advanced Staking Panther’s v0.5, a straightforward explanation of the rewards involved, and more. Also, as hinted upon on last week’s weekly mini-update, we implemented a calculation feature that involves stakers minting an NFT to timestamp their stakes. This is purely a functional feature. Another article in the works will break down how PRP rewards will work.<br></p><p>Progress is simultaneously being made towards Panther’s v1. As protocol architects settled upon APIs, work on the front end progressed to the last stages of UI internal testing and bug-fixing. <br></p><p>On a minor note, our governance token $ZKP, formerly listed as "$ZKP Token", is now labeled "Panther" on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173">Etherscan</a>. $ZKP remains as its ticker symbol.</p> Community  AMA on Panther’s contribution to ZPrize <p>Back in May, we proudly <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-zprize-and-industry-leaders-to-further-the-zero-knowledge-industry-391a494a58d6/">announced our participation in ZPrize as a Silver Partner</a>, intending to contribute to the acceleration of zero-knowledge cryptography’s future. Panther embraced the task of architecting the challenge of “<a href="https://www.zprize.io/prizes/accelerating-the-poseidon-hash-function">accelerating the Poseidon hash function</a>.”<br></p><p>On September 8th, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed and Head of Product Saif Akhtar got together with team members of Aleo and Polychain Capital, the other ZPrize Partners collaborating towards the Poseidon hash function prize. <br></p><p>They held an AMA on the Poseidon hash function and the role of each partner in the challenge’s funding, design, and execution. <a href="https://youtu.be/IIkwHFSfwvs">The recording is available on YouTube</a> for those interested in learning more about this promising building block of zero-knowledge applications.</p> Shyft’s Office Hours <p>On September 13th, Panther's Co-Founder Oliver Gale joined Shyft Network’s Office Hours with Juan Aja and Thomas Borrel, the Co-Founder and COO of Shyft Network.<br></p><p>The conversation centered around the theme “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBStZNWjvig">Regulations on the Rise</a>,” touching on the recent regulatory moves, compliance’s role in Blockchain, and the ways Panther and Shyft are working together to address these issues without compromising trust.</p> Panther zTalks #4: Privacy Regulations in Blockchain &amp; Product Updates <p>The 4th episode of zTalks, published on September 19th, was hosted by Carlos Cano (Content Creation), Saif Akhtar (Head of Product), Natalie Cheng (regulatory SME), and Emile Josselin (Head of Community). <br></p><p>The status of privacy in blockchain in the face of the Tornado Cash crackdown, the middle ground between privacy and compliance, and updates about Advanced Staking development were a few topics discussed in this month’s episode. If you haven’t caught it yet, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmrtrAA7y9Y">zTalks #4</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PantherProtocol">Panther’s YouTube channel</a>.<br></p>Can't miss this episode!<p></p> Events <p>September 2nd, the last day of the <a href="https://cbr.stanford.edu/sbc22/">Stanford Blockchain Week</a>, had Anish joining <a href="https://republic.com/crypto">Republic Crypto</a> alongside other guests for a panel discussion on the economics of privacy.<br></p><p></p><p>On September 9th, Anish participated in a specialist panel by Tech Florida Advocates on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgyF5ok8JF8&amp;t=2s">Innovations in the Blockchain &amp; Cyber</a> as Panther’s Chief Scientist. At the Open Security Summit on September 15th, he joined their <a href="https://youtu.be/UhkMDyZy6RU">panel discussion on Blockchain and its security</a>.<br></p>Anish seriously got everyone thinking on this panel.<p></p><p>Our co-Founder delivered a 25-min talk on <a href="https://nearcon.org/">NEARCON</a> addressing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-qg7eRlLtE&amp;t=2417s">The Economics of ZK Proofs</a>.” Taking place on September 14th, the talk explored zero-knowledge proofs’ evolution and their computational and economic costs.<br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://www.zebulive.xyz/">Zebu Live</a> invited Oliver Gale to attend the conference on September 23rd as a speaker. There, he delivered a 15-minute long talk titled “<a href="https://youtu.be/t030nDaOPnA?t=26330">Arrested Development: The Risks and Opportunities in The Private DeFi Space</a>.”<br></p>Looking good!<p></p> Panther in the media <p>On the 9th, Oliver was invited to join <a href="https://twitter.com/TradeTalks/status/1568290870880833536">Nasdaq TradeTalks</a>, where he discussed blockchain interoperability’s pivotal role in the future of finance and privacy in the digital realm. We have published <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/oliver-gale-nasdaq-tv-privacy-and-zero-knowledge-proofs-will-save-the-financial-system/">a recap on our blog</a> that summarizes the main points brought up by our Co-Founder.<br></p><p>Due to his participation in <a href="https://nearcon.org/">NEARCON</a>, Anish and Coindesk’s CCO Michael J. Casey got together in Lisbon and exchanged thoughts and insights on the long-term effects of the Tornado Cash ban. Casey quoted some of Anish’s remarks in his September 16th editorial “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/09/16/tornado-cash-ban-will-aid-chinas-ai-goals/">Tornado Cash Ban Will Aid China’s AI Goals</a>,” an insightful view of how the U.S. Government’s crackdown on financial privacy could backfire.</p> Hirings <p>This month new hires joined us as Graphic Designer and Machine Learning Intern.

With recent regulatory crackdowns and market drops, many are reevaluating what innovations Web3 can truly offer. Privacy is top of this list, and firms like a16z are taking note of <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1575124707187347457?s=20&amp;t=m3JBGYohvsYrMniLDFN_xw">zero-knowledge cryptography</a>, as are other&nbsp;KOLs.</p> Warren Paul Anderson Speaks on Privacy at&nbsp;Mainnet Warren Paul Anderson, CEO of Discreet Labs, speaks on privacy at&nbsp;Mainnet.<p>Discreet Labs CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/warpaul">Warren Paul Anderson</a>, participated in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Kelly_NYC/status/1573343293353889797?s=20&amp;t=00McvRHubQ-SRWvMEjGsuQ">privacy panel</a> at Mainnet with Mina Labs and Quadrata Network. While some use anonymity to mask bad behavior, most anonymity in Web3 is actually pseudonymity and is used with good intentions.

<p>Fungai joined the Foundation at the beginning of this year, as our interim Engineering Project Manager, while our Engineering Manager was away on sabbatical. He quickly settled in, and began making a positive contribution, helping the team review and improve our engineering processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fungai shepherded the Zebra project through NU5 activation, and the implementation of support for lightwalletd. He also oversaw the beginning of the transition of the FROST from the research phase to implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Pili’s return from sabbatical, Fungai is leaving the Foundation. We are all sad to see him go, and wish him the best of luck in his future adventures!&nbsp;</p>

<p>While opinions about the actual impact of web3 are widespread, <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/web-3-0-blockchain-market-10746">web3 is certainly gaining traction</a> and will continue to do so in the coming years. Various web3 technologies have the ability to disrupt the status quo and have also highlighted new ways of managing data, while encouraging decentralisation. All in all, while the future for web3 is bright, more and more companies will have to adopt the technology in order for it to be the success it can be. Let’s take a deeper dive!</p>







 A brief overview of web1 and web2 



<p>To understand web3 and everything it is, and is not, it is important to first understand web1 and web2. As the name suggests, web1 and web2 are the technologies preceding web3. We will explain each of them below.</p>



 Web1: Simple, static, uninteractive 



<p>Web1 is an umbrella term for all the first web technologies. Unlike current web pages, pages in the web1 era, pages were simple, read only, and anything but interactive.</p>



<p>This era was the start of the world wide web, allowing everyone around the world with an internet connection to access all the available information online. In this period many people created their own websites which contained all kinds of information, from vacation pictures to encyclopaedias. These pages were maintained by the website owner, and they contained no such things as a social aspect, dynamic content, or smart features.</p>



 Web2: The social revolution 



<p>As technology moved forward, web pages started getting more and more advanced. This allowed developers to create more interesting and interactive web pages, which marked the start of the web2 era.</p>



<p>In the web2 era, people are not just reading pages, they are also interacting with them and with other people. Websites that embrace the social aspect of the web like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube were founded in this period and have become incredibly popular.</p>



<p>Another key part of web2 is ecommerce. While web1 pages occasionally offered products through awkward catalogue-like pages, web2 pages feature easy-to-navigate webshops with integrated payment methods. This led to online shops like Amazon gaining massive popularity.</p>



<p>All in all, the web2 era is characterised by interactivity.</p>







 What is web3? 



<p>Now you are familiar with the past and present, it is time to move on to the future. Web3 is a relatively new term, and there is no consensus on what it means exactly. However, it is universally agreed upon that web3 refers to the next generation of web technologies which will likely dictate what our digital future will look like. But what does this mean exactly?</p>



<p>One of the core values of web3 is decentralisation,&nbsp; and web3 has various key blockchain technologies that enable this vision of decentralisation, such as cryptocurrency, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">self-sovereign identity</a>, NFT, and more. In order to get a better understanding of what this means, let’s explain what each of these terms mean in the web3 context:</p>



  Blockchain: The underlying technology of many web3 applications. In essence, blockchains are nothing more than a constantly growing list of transactions that are linked together using cryptography, often being managed by a network of decentralised entities.  Cryptocurrency: The finance layer on top of blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies are tokens on top of a blockchain which can be exchanged between people using a blockchain. These kinds of cryptocurrencies are often managed in a decentralised way, meaning the network (and its participants) decide how the tokens are created and distributed.  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): The ability for individuals and organisations to own and control their identities, without intervention or interference from any third parties. In this context, ‘self-sovereignty’ refers to the ability of the individual or the organisation in control of the identity to share it and present it to other agencies with no intermediaries.  Non-Fungible Token (NFT): In short, a non-fungible token is a token which represents a unique object. An NFT is unique, meaning there is no 100% similar NFT. They are the opposite of regular/fungible tokens, which are all similar and interchangeable. Another key difference between regular tokens and NFTs is that NFTs are non-divisible. NFTs allow the tokenisation of both digital or physical objects.  



<p>In essence, web3 is nothing more than an umbrella term for the next generation of (web) technologies. And together, the technologies described above form the basis for web3. However, the definition of web3 and all the concepts and technologies associated with it are not set in stone, and as time and technology move forward the definition and impact of web3 will become more clear.</p>



 The technology of the future? 



<p>Technology is moving forward at a fast pace. The first smartphone with internet connectivity was introduced only a mere 20 years ago, yet a world without smartphones seems almost unimaginable these days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for web technologies. What started as a simple way for people to access information, has grown to become an integral part of our lives. Web technologies have evolved a lot over the years, with the latest and greatest technological advancements being referred to as web3. Only the future can tell whether it will actually be impactful. But one thing is certain, it is exciting to see technology moving forward!</p>

 Introduction <p>As Ethereum emerged to provide smart-contract functionalities that the Bitcoin network could not support, Ethereum competitors rose to provide alternatives to its lingering problems. <br></p><p>So-called “Ethereum killers” may pride themselves on being novel ideas but, until now, most of their success is largely attributed to the limitations of the second most valuable blockchain network in the world. As they attempt to outperform the smart contract giant, valuable trade-offs have enabled them to make unexpected progress.<br></p><p>We have lately seen developments that indicate that Ethereum competitors are on the verge of taking steps that will forever differentiate them. Even though Ethereum has a roadmap with upgrades and transitions that will address its current challenges in the future, its competitors have been able to make huge inroads at its expense.<br></p><p>In this article, we will look into Ethereum and its different issues. We will also explore how its competitors address these challenges while highlighting the tradeoffs they have had to make along the way.</p> Ethereum's challenges <p>In 2015, Ethereum emerged as an alternative to Bitcoin and its perceived simplicity as a general-purpose blockchain. Although <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">Bitcoin</a> was a breakthrough blockchain innovation, it was limited to payments and serving as a store of value. Ethereum changed the narrative of the crypto space when it introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications on its network. <br></p><p>After powering the 2017 ICO craze, Ethereum began to experience exponential growth. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">Decentralized</a> applications sprung up rapidly on the network, and the price of its native token, Ether, began a steady climb (although it isn’t immune to the crypto market’s characteristic swings). Since its early years, Ethereum has witnessed massive adoption, boasting a majority of the dApps in the ecosystem and powering the growth of DeFi.<br></p>Ethereum’s average transaction fees through hype cycles. (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/chart/txn-fee-avg">Source</a>)<p>Ethereum's widespread adoption has turned out to be a bittersweet occurrence. On the one hand, its growth drives innovation and users towards the crypto space, allowing ideas to become a reality. It is also the ideal framework for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-defi-privacy-suite-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary/">DeFi</a>, blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and other blockchain applications. On the other hand, the network’s first attempt at mass adoption exposed its frailties, as it struggled to remain scalable and economical due to the increased adoption.<br></p><p>Let’s take a look at Ethereum’s main challenges:</p> Scalability <p>The lack of scalability on Ethereum is probably the most talked-about problem the blockchain network faces, mostly because it is more evident than others. Through the ICO boom and DeFi summer, transaction volumes on Ethereum surged astronomically, as expected with widespread adoption. One small problem, however, arguably stopped further expansion: the network’s speed, or lack thereof.<br></p><p>Ethereum today can only process about 15-30 <a href="https://ethtps.info/">transactions per second</a>. With surging transaction volumes, slow TPS figures will lead to network congestion, resulting in delayed transaction finality and humongous transaction fees (see below). With dApps like games or decentralized exchanges needing instant transaction finality, Ethereum's processing power is a real challenge for applications built on the network, and arguably a reason many use cases haven’t found adoption on Ethereum.<br></p><p>Back when Ethereum first launched, many believed that it could increase its number of transactions per second by ramping up its node size (the amount of data a user needs to store to run a node). <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/">Nodes</a> are active participants that run the blockchain and store its data. Increasing node size to combat scalability challenges will lead to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-dev-addresses-node-centralization-concerns-in-runup-to-the-merge">centralization</a>, as only a few powerful entities can participate in a “huge node” system. <br></p><p>It’s worth noting here that increasing the block size to scale a network is a thing of the past. In recent years, the scalability conversations have moved on to Layer-2s and Rollups as solutions to scale the network without the challenge of centralization. However, centralization fears <a href="https://beincrypto-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/beincrypto.com/80-of-ethereum-blocks-were-relayed-by-flashbots/">still persist</a>, especially with the recent transition of the Ethereum network’s consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS.<br></p> Increasing Transaction Costs <p>Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/vitalik-buterin-says-transaction-fees-need-to-reduce-to-5-cents-to-remain-acceptable/75941/1">claims</a> that Ethereum's gas fees should be around $0.05, ideally. During the DeFi boom and the gas wars that followed, average gas fees on Ethereum <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/defi-boom-fueling-eth-gas-fees-threatens-viability-of-smart-contracts/">soared</a> to around $60-$70. Within the Ethereum ecosystem. gas fees are simply bids for including a set of transactions in the limited block space. In case of high demand, these bids go up as users attempt to fast-track their transactions to gain an edge. This results in extremely high transaction costs.<br></p><p>At such levels, interacting with applications on Ethereum is beyond the reach of the average Web3 user, making developers opt for cheaper blockchain networks like Solana and BSC.<br></p><p>It is important to note that <a href="https://blockchain.news/opinion/opinion-why-ethereum-merge-wont-lower-gas-fees">the Merge</a> has not solved Ethereum's gas fees challenges. However, recent upgrades and the crypto market mood have seen average gas <a href="https://thedefiant.io/ethereum-gas-fees-low-level">prices drop</a> from around $40 to $15.55 as of the second half of 2022.</p> Centralization Fears <p>When Ethereum existed as a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work</a> blockchain, some mining pools were considerably larger than others and, as such, had more consensus power. Of course, this model sparked talks of centralization, which defeats everything Ethereum represents: a secure, scalable, and decentralized blockchain network.<br></p><p>Today, Ethereum has completed its transition (known as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">The Merge</a>) to a proof-of-stake model after launching a Beacon chain in 2021 in preparation. The new arrangement has phased out the miners, replacing them with validators who staked ETH. More centralization fears have emerged as institutional capital and large exchanges vie for a large chunk of ETH staking power.<br></p> Privacy <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">Privacy</a> is almost non-existent on Ethereum and many other Layer-1 blockchains, which presents a problem. Ethereum is a fully transparent blockchain, which means that every interaction is not only stored on the ledger but accessible to the public. While transparency may be a good thing, it is extreme, especially for institutional players and DeFi traders.<br></p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">Zero-knowledge rollups</a> built on Ethereum have solved the privacy challenge to some extent, but these solutions cannot pass off as traditional blockchains. Many of them are limited and unable to support smart contract deployment. For example, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">zkEVMs</a> are still in a work-in-progress stage, and without EVM compatibility it would be impossible for Layer-2 privacy solutions to reach mass adoption.</p> MEV <p>MEV stands for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">Maximal Extractable Value</a>, a concept regularly associated with the Ethereum network (however, MEV is not Ethereum-specific). MEV represents the highest value that miners can extract from changing the position of transactions when creating an Ethereum block. MEV is <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/#the-good-side-of-mev">not exactly a bad thing</a>, although malicious attempts are now common. Protocols have used MEV to balance prices across decentralized exchanges.<br></p><p>While MEV was known as Miner Extraction Value in the proof-of-work era, Ethereum has since become a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain. Still, the network is susceptible to several kinds of tactics for extracting MEV, like sandwich attacks, liquidation, and front-running. Due to how profitable MEV is for validators, independent searchers, and other network participants (MEV extraction since 2021 was allegedly worth over $600 million), MEV is not going away anytime soon.<br></p> Ethereum competitors <p>So-called Ethereum killers have sprung up everywhere in the crypto space, each addressing one or more of Ethereum's lingering problems. Here are how the most prominent Ethereum competitors line up and the challenges they mitigate:<br></p> Ethereum competitors that aim for scalability (Solana, Polkadot, Near) <p>Ethereum averages 15 to 30 transactions per second, making it less scalable than several Ethereum competitors. Chief among Ethereum's competitors that prioritize scalability include Solana, Near, and Polkadot.<br></p><p>Solana uses a <a href="https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274">proof-of-history</a> mechanism, as opposed to Ethereum's proof-of-stake, to validate transactions. With an emphasis on scalability, Solana transacts at breakneck speed, boasting TPSs of up to 65,000 per second. It’s worth pointing out that Solana's claimed TPS numbers are vastly inflated due to consensus voting messages being included on-chain. As of a report in January 2022, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-data-shows-how-solana-transactions-compare-against-ethereum/">Solana’s actual TPS</a> stands at around 3000. <br></p><p>Gas fees on Solana are usually less than a fraction of a cent, making it a more scalable option than Ethereum. As a tradeoff, Solana has few validators and is a less decentralized network than Ethereum, and its speed and low transaction fees make it susceptible to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-hit-with-another-network-incident-causing-degraded-performance">DDOS attacks</a>. Solana Labs' Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko has repeatedly denied the network's susceptibility to DDOS attacks. Yakovenko blames Solana's network congestion and halts issues on its <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1478414400339939331">cost model</a> for computing which requires the transactions to specify all the resources they use up-front.<br></p><p><a href="https://near.org/">Near</a> is a Layer-1 blockchain solution that uses a proof-of-stake model and a powerful <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3336187/sharding-what-it-is-and-why-so-many-blockchain-protocols-rely-on-it.html">sharding</a> technology that ensures the network is never congested, even during peak periods. As a result, block finality on Near takes under two seconds, making it more scalable than Ethereum. As with Solana, Near trades decentralization for scalability, as it has fewer validators than Ethereum and Solana.<br></p><p><a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> is another highly scalable blockchain, although it employs a different approach than Solana, Near, and Ethereum. Polkadot's infrastructure connects multiple parallel blockchains, and it achieves transactional scalability by spreading the transactions across the parallel blockchains. When all <a href="https://www.prolitus.com/blog/what-are-parachain-and-parathread-in-the-polkadot-blockchain/">parachains and parathreads</a> on Polkadot go live, it is expected to achieve speeds of up to one million transactions per second (it’s always recommended to always take TPS estimation claims with a pinch of salt).</p> Aiming for interoperability (Cosmos, Cardano) <p>Interoperability means interactions between blockchains. Most traditional blockchains do not have infrastructure that allows them to speak to one another. Although Ethereum supports <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">cross-chain</a> bridges, the network's interoperability pales compared to Cosmos and Cardano.<br></p><p><a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> defines itself as "A decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by a BFT consensus algorithm like Tendermint consensus." This means that, unlike Ethereum or other Layer-1 competitors, Cosmos is not just a blockchain but a network of many of these blockchains operating in parallel with one another. <br></p><p>Cosmos typifies interoperability with its framework of Cosmos SDK, the <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/tendermint-explained-bringing-bft-based-pos-to-the-public-blockchain-domain-f22e274a0fdb">Tendermint</a> BFT (<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained">Byzantine fault-tolerant</a>) algorithm, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. <br></p><p>Since every blockchain in the Cosmos network is powered by the same BFT consensus mechanism called Tendermint, these blockchains can operate independently and yet interoperate with each other. That way, Cosmos network aims to create an internet of blockchains. Presently, blockchains built on Cosmos do not enjoy their underlying layer's security, although the introduction of <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035">interchain security</a> will solve this problem.<br></p>A diagram of Cosmos’s “Hub and Zone” model that lets Cosmos scale communication across all app-chains. (<a href="https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/how-does-cosmos-work-how-does-it-compare-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-part-2">Source</a>)<p><a href="https://cardano.org/">Cardano</a> is another blockchain network geared towards interoperability. While Ethereum's interoperability is valid within its ecosystem and based on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> standard, Cardano uses side chains to facilitate blockchain-to-blockchain communication. Currently, Cardano does not have any notable tradeoff for its interoperability functionality.</p> Aiming for security (MEV Mitigation) (Solana &amp; Osmosis) <p>MEV extraction threatens Ethereum's viability, and here's how Ethereum competitors have managed to combat MEV extraction on their networks.<br></p><p><a href="https://osmosis.zone/">Osmosis</a> is a decentralized exchange built on Cosmos, and it has introduced a threshold cryptography mechanism that effectively limits validators' ability to MEV. Using threshold cryptography, Osmosis encrypts trade values before they hit the mempool, ensuring that front-running is impossible.<br></p><p>Learn more about how Osmosis aims to leverage threshold cryptography to mitigate MEV in this video podcast of Osmosis Labs’ co-founder Sunny Aggarwal: </p><p>Solana's infrastructure also makes it <a href="https://chainstack.com/what-is-mev-and-how-does-solana-solves-its-mev-issues/">less susceptible</a> to MEV extraction techniques like front-running or the utilization of searchers, as there is no mempool. The lack of mempools also prevents sandwich attacks. On this network, front-running bots can be mitigated with taxes on invalid transactions and increasing the cost of sending spam requests. <br></p><p>Also, only leading validators in a cluster can access transaction information before finality. If any validator engages in malicious activities, they will be penalized. As said earlier, Solana trades decentralization for speed, MEV mitigation, and scalability. <br></p> Aiming for privacy (Secret Network, Oasis, Panther) <p>Privacy concerns on Ethereum are valid, seeing that Ethereum is a fully transparent network. Two blockchain networks that have made inroads into privacy are <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> and <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol</a>. <br></p><p>Secret Network has strong claims to be the first privacy-first Layer-1 blockchain solution. The network is built with the Cosmos SDK, and it leverages a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. <br></p><p>With encryption protocols, key management, and a Trusted Execution Environment, Secret Network provides a form of privacy known as <a href="https://scrt.network/blog/programmable-privacy/">Programmable Privacy</a>, which supports smart contract deployment. While Secret Network prides itself as a privacy-first blockchain, it does not improve on Ethereum's scalability challenges and has suffered <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/discuss-network-issues-w-shade-airdrop-2-21-22/5475">congestion</a> with even lesser transaction volumes than Ethereum.<br></p><p>Oasis is another privacy-first concept, and it uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and <a href="https://www.trustonic.com/technical-articles/what-is-a-trusted-execution-environment-tee/">Trusted Execution Environments</a> to achieve confidential computing. The privacy features on Oasis allow the network to support data tokenization and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">private DeFi</a>, protecting sensitive user information and allowing for reputation-based under-collateralization. While Oasis is also more scalable than Ethereum, it has fewer validators, making it somewhat susceptible to centralization.<br></p><p><a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">Panther protocol</a> is a cross-chain, privacy solution. It provides transactional privacy to DeFi users using a combination of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> and game theory, thus, programmatically protecting their alpha. Panther also supports <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC</a> and selective disclosures between trusted parties, enabling various services such as ID, authorization, and data verification services. <br></p>Blockchains in Trusted Execution Environments. (<a href="https://medium.com/@nadeem.bhati/blockchains-in-trusted-execution-environments-tees-9343b6c3f9e8">Source</a>) Ethereum competitors ain’t a threat… for now. <p>Ethereum's competitors have been around for a long while. While many can lay claim to fixing some of the lingering issues plaguing the Ethereum network, none has successfully wrested a significant portion of Ethereum's market share. <br></p><p>Ethereum has a loyal community, and the abundance of developer resources plus its popularity gives it a significant advantage compared to its competitors. However, some feel like the clock is ticking for Ethereum to solve its scalability issues before another blockchain eats a piece of its proverbial pie.<br></p><p>Solana, Near, and Polkadot are more scalable options, Secret Network and Oasis offer programmable privacy, Cosmos and Cardano support better interoperability, and MEV extraction is less of a worry on Solana and Osmosis. It’s certainly within the leading smart contract’s roadmap to fix some of these issues while on others (such as privacy), it’s practically a given that the network has forfeited them. <br></p><p>Over the next years, we should see how Ethereum performs as a Proof-of-Stake network with full sharding abilities. In the meantime, no one can discard the sudden emergence of a qualified player to (either temporarily or permanently) contend for the top spots in Layer-1 adoption.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Web3 game developers can access key functions to integrate assets on Findora into their games using Defungify. <p>Developers can now seamlessly connect their Web3 game to the Findora blockchain with Defungify, a middleware company focused on making Web3 game development as easy as possible.</p>Defungify Is Now on&nbsp;Findora<p>The integration will make life much easier for game developers building on the Findora network. They will have access to an easy-to-use system that integrates NFTs into games with functions like fetching NFT metadata, querying an NFT from the blockchain, and much&nbsp;more.</p><p>From Defungify:</p><blockquote>Every blockchain operates differently, and the technology isn’t trivial to integrate with. If a game developer decides to add a new chain, the game developer would be essentially starting from scratch. Once Defungify is installed, you’re instantly multichain for your game. It’s a way to futureproof the game so it has the best chance of success long&nbsp;term.</blockquote><p>💡Follow Findora on <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a> or join the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit Community</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>Defungify focuses on integrating with new blockchains so developers can focus on building a fun game. Its extensive toolkit includes NFT minting, a game launcher, testnet support, native cross-chain convertible NFTs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Findora offers a way for gaming platforms to work privacy into their games and protect player data. This can open a whole new realm of possibilities for game developers as players can hide what NFTs are in their wallets and what competitive advantage they may&nbsp;have.</p><p>But the innovation isn’t limited to GameFi. A leader in Web3 privacy, Findora is finding new ways to apply zero-knowledge proofs, including building a <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/adding-privacy-to-blockchain-identity-management-through-zkdid-6adb12a50a3f">zk-DID system</a> and adding <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/the-findora-improvement-proposal-that-could-bring-auditability-to-privacy-a21952ca4f55">auditability to confidential transactions</a> for institutional adoption. Findora is actively preparing its chain for GameFi activity.</p><p>Learn more about Defungify on their <a href="https://www2.defungify.app/">website</a> and follow their <a href="https://twitter.com/DefungifyApp">Twitter</a> for updates on their progress.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability. Developers can leverage either model as they build dApps with auditable privacy.</p><p>Interested in developing on Findora?

A PayNym Bot is a visual representation of a BIP47 Reusable Payment Code. A Bot is created by taking a BIP47 code and applying a hashing algorithm which produces a unique fingerprint used to create the Bot image. So each bot image is unique to each wallet. If you tap your PayNym bot image you will open the new toolbar&nbsp;menu.</p><p>In the Toolbar Menu you’ll notice some new options such as Collaborate and Tools. So let’s move on to the next major UI update we have made, Collaborative Transactions (Cahoots) has had a major UI&nbsp;rework.</p> Collaborate <p>The collaborative transaction has a long history in Samourai. In March 2019 we released our first iteration of collaborative transactions. It required users to manually scan and share at least 5 QR codes with their collaborator. It was just a start but we knew it would develop into a key&nbsp;feature.</p><p>In November 2020 <a href="https://medium.com/samourai-wallet/wallet-update-0-99-96-introducing-soroban-adc9a36a7ddb">we released our new open source app-agnostic, Tor based encrypted communication protocol called Soroban</a>. This allowed us to automate the coordination of small 2 person collaborative coinjoin transactions to make them much quicker than before and without using a centralised coordinator. These transactions, STONEWALLx2 and Stowaway enjoy heavy use among our user base and have even been implemented along with Soroban in third party wallets such as <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p><p>In this update we have created a brand new UI for both initiating and collaborating in STONEWALLx2 or Stowaway transaction.</p><p>Up until now the collaborative transaction workflow and UI were somewhat of an afterthought, and users needed to be pretty savvy in navigating around the app to make use of the&nbsp;feature.</p><p>This update should make it even easier for anyone to participate or initiate a new collaborative transaction. Both initiation and participation are located in one easy to reach location (before this update there could be 4 different places to go to initiate or participate in a transaction like&nbsp;this!)</p><p>For those that need a quick primer on STONEWALLx2:</p><blockquote>This type of transaction is a two person coinjoin that the sender and a third party collaborate to send to an external wallet. This is a great choice when sending to someone who doesn’t have Samourai Wallet, for instance a merchant using BTCPayServer. Using a STONEWALLx2 transaction to make your payments undermines the Common Input Ownership Heuristic — a bedrock of blockchain snoops and&nbsp;spies.</blockquote> Introducing JoinBot <p>One of the problems that remain with Collaborative Transactions in Samourai Wallet is that you need someone to collaborate with. This can be a problem for many users, especially new users. They may want to explore the feature, or benefit from the privacy enhancements that Collaborative Transactions offer but be unable to do so because they don’t have anyone they can collaborate with.</p><p>This is the perfect time to introduce our newest feature, JoinBot. For a small spam prevention fee you can have JoinBot act as the second participant in a STONEWALLx2 collaborative transaction</p><p>There are some benefits choosing to use JoinBot as your STONEWALLx2 collaborator.</p>  Joinbot is always online, so it is great for time sensitive payments where you might not have time to find a collaborator who is online and able to help&nbsp;you.  Joinbot only uses UTXOs directly from Whirlpool postmix, so you do not need to worry about the history of the collaborating UTXOs and how they have been handled by the collaborator.  Since JoinBot is online 24/7 it always has UTXOs registered for remixing, so there are very good odds that you collaborating with extremely well remixed&nbsp;UTXOs.   JoinBot fees <p>There is a small anti-spam fee in addition to the usual miner fees when using JoinBot. The service fee is set at 3.5% of the send amount or 0.01 BTC, whichever is&nbsp;less.</p><p>For example, if you are sending 0.1 BTC using JoinBot as a collaborator the fee would be 0.0035 BTC, meanwhile sending 1 BTC would use the capped maximum fee of 0.01&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>The fee is paid in a second transaction automatically using another type of collaborative transaction called Stowaway.</p><p>The fee transaction is not associated with the JoinBot transaction on the blockchain. This makes sure the STONEWALLx2 transaction made with JoinBot looks like every other STONEWALL transaction out there, you cannot tell any difference.</p> Some caveats   You will need to have at least two unrelated UTXOs available in your wallet in order to successfully perform a STONEWALLx2 with&nbsp;JoinBot.  STONEWALLx2 requires that both participants each pay half of the transaction miner fee. This is respected with JoinBot, but you will reimburse JoinBot for that half of the miner fee within the anti-spam fee transaction.  For this initial release we are only allowing a maximum transaction amount of 1.5 BTC using JoinBot as a collaborator. The minimum amount you can send is 546&nbsp;sats.   Tools <p>We’ve also introduced a new screen in the wallet activated from the new Toolbar Menu. This screen is called ‘Tools’ and contains new UI for sweeping private keys and calculating addresses for your wallet. Most casual users will not have much need to use this section of the wallet, but will be a big upgrade for our power&nbsp;users.</p>  Sweep Private key — You now have full control of the miner fee you pay for sweeping a private key, as well as what address derivation you wish to sweep to. The final big change here is you can now sweep Taproot addresses into your Samourai&nbsp;Wallet.  Sign Message — We moved this from where it was buried in the settings. You can now very easily sign a message using any address on any derivation within your&nbsp;wallet.  Wallet Address Calculator — Again, we moved this from buried deep in the settings. You can now derive address, redeem script and private key from any address in your wallet on any derivation path.   Authenticate using&nbsp;PayNym <p>A few years ago we came up with a specification for allowing users to login to websites/apps without needing to provide a username or password, just by using their PayNym. Sparrow Wallet has already added this specification into their wallet. Keep tuned for further announcements about this feature in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Thank you <p>Download Samourai Wallet 0.99.98f today.

<p>Data sells. A common notion out there. Yet it is oblivious to many of us, or we merely undermine the underlying value of our data.</p>



<p>The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data – <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">Economist</a></p>



<p>Many companies leverage the acquired data to make big bucks, while one on an individual level is left to wonder how he is shown advertisements that correspond to his intent or interests. Almost everyone is a victim of targeted advertisements, but targeted advertisements are merely the tip of the iceberg. Remember getting that loyalty card from your local supermarket to get reward points? Or how about signing up for the Starbucks loyalty program to get free coffee? All they took in return were some key credentials such as your name, phone number, email, date of birth, and address. Similarly, giving consent to a mobile application to access your contacts, location, messages, and gallery or enabling a website to access cookies. It leaves us with a simple question: should we be handing over all this data? A simple photography application might require access to your location and contacts. What could be the reason for that?</p>



<p>All these credentials are used to store data, which comprises personal, behavioral, and engagement information. This data helps in generating user profiles, which in turn are sold to companies ultimately generating revenue. Every offline and online transaction gives away data that holds a monetary value. Everyone is getting their fair share of the pie and the only person missing out from the whole equation is the one giving out his data voluntarily for a free coffee or some discounts. It is not the companies hacking into your data: you are providing it of your own volition.</p>



<p>Terming it as a “Faustian Bargain”, Jeff Wiles states that it is a tradeoff we have to make in the digital world, adding on to that he stated one cannot be an “online hermit” these days.</p>



<p>Most of our daily life transactions are either carried out online or offline through various identity instruments or credentials, which comprise physical — a national ID card, passport, college degree, bank details — and digital credentials — email logins, and social media accounts. These transactions are essential to carry out day-to-day activities. But by providing these details, one also shares information that is entirely irrelevant. People feel more in control using their physical credentials. But what if they go missing or become inaccessible? Certainly, disadvantageous, as it is time-consuming to get them made again, or to pay the delivery fee again in the case of sending the documents abroad. In some cases, missing identity credentials could also lead to fraudulent activities — identity theft or manipulation — geared towards malignant designs. In a transformative world where paperless means of communication are becoming more popular, physical means of information sharing pose a great hurdle</p>



<p>One might say digital credentials are much more secure. Think again.</p>



<p>In earlier times, signing in using your digital credentials was done in silos, which meant creating unique identities and passwords for every single domain or application. A rather cumbersome task. Managing all these credentials became even more arduous, with so many usernames to remember. This later changed to a centralised alliance between the companies and third-party identity — login with Google, log in with Facebook—with each party having bits of autonomy.</p>



 Data losses and the stolen identity dilemma 



<p>Digital onboarding undeniably helped with the issue of password management and identity management. But what many did not realise was that, in doing so, they were handing over the access to their data to third-party companies, entrusting them with even more data.</p>



<p>The problems pertain not only to an individual level. Enterprises suffered a huge number of losses owing to data breaches for more than a decade. Personally identifiable information — IDs, passports, names, addresses, credit cards — all had been compromised by hackers who mainly hacked into the central databases of not just enterprises, but government systems also.</p>



<p>The data of Equifax, the largest U.S-based credit bureau, was compromised in 2017. The data breach comprised personal credentials, including social security numbers, birth dates, and addresses. The initial figure quoted contained 143 million consumers; 209,000 consumers also had their credit card data exposed, which was later raised to 147.9 million. Dubsmash, a popular video app, had its data put up for sale by the hackers on Dream Market: a dark web market comprising 1162 million email addresses, usernames, and passwords stolen. Personal data of users of the Under Armour-owned fitness app MyFitnessPal was among the massive information dump on Dream Market as well, resulting in the leakage of 617 million customer accounts.</p>



<p>Even the hospitality industry was not spared. The biggest hotel chain, Marriott International, declared that data of 500 million customers had been stolen. The breach started in 2014, and it took the company 4 years to realise its data was compromised. Once again, the primary intent was to hack personal identifiers and credentials (credit card numbers and expiration dates).</p>



<p>The backlash that Uber had to face following a data breach sank the company’s stock. Uber had chosen to keep the breach secret, until it became publicly denounced. It later emerged that Uber had acceded to pay ransom money to hackers. If that is not enough, wait until you come across “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-yahoo/yahoo-in-new-117-5-million-data-breach-settlement-after-earlier-accord-rejected-idUSKCN1RL1H1">The biggest data breach</a>” of the decade: the popular search engine and webmail company, Yahoo, had its data breached too. The figures came down to 3 billion in 2016.</p>



<p>The average total cost of a data breach in the U.S. for the companies studied had grown from $3.54 million in 2006 to $8.19 million in 2019, a 130 percent increase over 14 years – IBM (2019)</p>



<p>Identifying the root cause of breaches, IBM reported malicious attacks to be a major contributor – 51 percent of data breaches were because of malicious attacks. The report conducted entailed 17 sectors from housing and entertainment, to the healthcare industry. The average total cost of a data breach in the healthcare industry was $6.45 million</p>



 GDPR to the rescue 



<p>To safeguard the individual’s data, the European Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into action. Companies with clients in the European Union were told to be prepared in advance to strengthen measures to keep data intact and to allow transparency to be in place – consumers should be aware of the data that is being acquired and the underlying reason behind the acquisition. Furthermore, they would gain the right for them to revoke their data.</p>



<p>Altruistic in its fundamental motive – to give control of an individual’s data to themselves and protect their data – the European GDPR regulations came into existence. The United States adopted a similar model and came up with the California Consumer Privacy Act. Companies started gearing up for GDPR compliance back in 2018.</p>



<p>According to the report published by IAPP, around 1.1 billion was spent on the preparation of GDPR alone in the UK — Forbes</p>



<p>The cost of continuous compliance reported for small and medium enterprises surpassed $100,000. A reported figure of $1 million was spent by 20% of the companies to be prepared for GDPR. Many companies had to dump their data and start from scratch, as the amount of capital for getting technical and legal expertise to remodel their existing system seemed inordinate and transcended their financial solvency.</p>



 Debunking the centralisation dilemma 



<p>Although driven by an altruistic cause, GDPR still operates on centralisation. With the introduction of GDPR, an idea of data security and data ownership was instilled amongst the masses, reaffirming our faith in enterprises, yet centralisation remains the biggest hurdle.</p>



<p>Centralisation itself is the biggest risk. No matter how secure you make it, or how much companies spend on cybersecurity measures regardless of the type of encryption level, hackers will find a way to break in.</p>



 Self-Sovereign Identity and Distributed Ledger Technology 



<p>If centralisation is the issue, would it be possible to make data more secure and increase personal data ownership using a decentralised solution? One of these possible decentralised solutions is <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI). SSI is essentially an identity base layer, which operates on blockchain technology, making it decentralised by nature.</p>



<p>A common question may arise, how does decentralisation avert security breaches and data hacks?</p>



<p>Decentralisation implies that data is being stored on distributed channels instead of one, meaning it is not stored in a centralised database. This makes it more secure, and data autonomy is not centralised. That means enterprises will not have to pay a hefty amount of money to cybersecurity companies to keep their data intact. While it sounds rather utopian, it is quite the contrary and it is very simplistic and attainable.</p>



<p>Imagine going to a car hire company and renting a car in another country. Now this company does not need to know about your date of birth or the expiry date of your licence. All it needs to know is that the permit is valid for the time duration the car is being hired for, is issued by a trusted authority (government of the country), and whether that issuing authority has legal credentials or strategic alliance with the country of the car hire company. As soon as the car is returned safely to the car hire company the information provided initially should be wiped out from their system unless there are security concerns.</p>



<p>To fully comprehend the alternative paradigm -SSI-, one must be familiar with the ecosystem in which it operates: blockchain. Before moving on to blockchain, one must be familiar with two key terms that the SSI incorporates:</p>



  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</a>  



<p>Now, it all appears to be very complicated with the technical jargon involved, but it is a very simple model to understand.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials imply that your personal information has been issued by an issuer, a governing body, an authority — say a government, an educational institute, or a bank.</p>



<p>Once you get a hold of these digital credentials, you become the subject or holder of these credentials. When you apply for something, these credentials need to be verified —Identity Interactions — hence the need for a verifier, be that a bank loan, a mortgage, or traveling abroad. These digital credentials can be verified across different companies.</p>



<p>Say you want to apply for an academic program in another country based on your qualifications. Your previous educational institute would be the issuer of the verified credential, once that credential has been issued to you it can be verified by the educational institute where you plan on studying, thus making them a verifier.</p>



<p>In the real world, our primary identifier is our face. The other ones are our national IDs, driving licences, or passports. Now think of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">DID</a> as a digital face. Each verifiable credential is attached to a unique DID, which is distributed, making it self-sovereign in nature. Think of DIDs as a mode of communication or the exchange of peer-to-peer information. It allows associating multiple claims to a single layer, can be accessed from any system, and the identity owner is in complete control to revoke them. The generated DID is always in pair with a public key and a private key. A DID can have many public keys. Everything is fragmented. A DID itself does not hold any information itself and merely resolves the issue of having an identifier linked to the credentials with public keys.</p>



<p>It should be noted that these verifiable credentials are not stored on the distributed ledger system. Think of blockchain as a giant spreadsheet where transactions are taking place, but that spreadsheet is not saved on a single database, in fact, it is an open-source spreadsheet, held within distributed storage, with information registries that correspond to transactions or exchange of public keys using DIDs.</p>



<p>The credentials are stored in a digital wallet that corresponds to a physical wallet. You only use the credentials that are required. What grants a user more power is the control of his/her identity. He does not have to reveal all the information present in his credential, only the information that obviates the need of providing additional information. In the SSI framework it is referred to as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs">zero-knowledge proof</a>: disclose information that is relevant – as mentioned earlier, a car hire company should not be concerned with your date of birth but should know that the permit you hold is valid. Furthermore, it gives you more control as you can revoke the information provided or allow it to be present in a system for a certain limit of time. For instance, an application wants to access your phone’s location. You allow it to do so for that time duration and then you simply revoke the access with the click of a button.</p>



 But are these digital wallets safe? 



<p>Yes, these digital wallets are created using an asymmetric coding technique, which usually helps in creating a pair of keys. One is the public key and the other one is a private key. The public keys, as the name implies are there to view anytime and are used for exchanging information and can be revoked, however, the private key is for the account holder himself, be that an issuer, a verifier, or a subject. It is only through a private key that one can pass on his credentials using his DID to an issuer who then validates the credentials and sends them to the verifier using his DID. In this way, a quick and efficient way of peer-peer information can be established.</p>



<p>It can be established that SSI gives complete control of public identity, safeguards personal data, and is accessible with the click of one button from anywhere in the world. Furthermore, it establishes trust between parties that guarantees the authenticity of the data being provided. It operates within the realm of ethical information sharing ultimately keeping your identity intact.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see what the future holds for SSI, but given the growing societal need for a secure SSI solution, it seems like it is only a matter of time before one of these solutions is widely adopted.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  Every offline and online transaction gives away data that holds a monetary value  Digital onboarding helps with credential management, but its downside is that, by using this method, the individual hands over the access to their data to third-party companies  Major data hacks have compromised the personal and financial data of millions of customers  GDPR aims to protect the right of an individual to safeguard their privacy. Yet, the GDPR framework is inherently centralised  SSI enables an individual to retain control of their data, and share only what’s relevant  SSI is based on Verifiable credentials (VCs) and Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) principles  Verifiable credentials imply that an individual’s personal information has been issued by an issuer, a governing body, an authority — say a government, an educational institute, or a bank.  You can think of a DID as a digital face that helps you identify yourself to others  Through the my.D product, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Zaisan offers a secure SSI solution</a>

<p>HOPR is a decentralized and incentivized peer-to-peer mixnet open to anyone who wants to join and run a node. The network allows people, companies, and devices to exchange information online with its metadata stripped. People who communicate and transact using HOPR — or apps and services which run on top of the platform — can be sure that no-one can find out what data is being shared, who is sending or receiving it, or even how much data is being sent. HOPR gets its name from the fact that it provides metadata privacy by sending data packets through multiple nodes - or “hops” – in the network. Decentralization ensures that the network is fully independent and there is no entity that can control it or intercept the traffic.</p><p>We were joined by HOPR founder Sebastian Bürgel, who chatted about the need for a platform such as this in the space, how it works by sending packets through nodes, the HOPR token, and The DecenGov DAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Sebastian's background  An overview of HOPR  Mixnet vs onion routing  Who is the HOPR user?  How packets move through the network  The distribution requirements for HOPR nodes  The costs involved  The HOPR token  The DecenGov DAO  Why privacy systems in crypto have such a hard time finding traction  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPR</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hoprnet">HOPR on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBuergel">Sebastian on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://careers.chorus.one/o/epicenter-community-manager">Join the Epicenter team!</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Tally Ho: Tally Ho is a new wallet for Web3 and DeFi that sees the wallet as a public good.

They can be read in the clip below if you watch and pause intermittently. Lee Stogner, head of the IEEE Blockchain Standards Working Group for Consumer Electronics, stated during the discussion something to the effect that he could see based on the chat that there were some people out there with “another agenda, their own agenda” and therefore it was important that the group come together quickly. My take is that militarized-pharma-debt finance interests intend to manifest their planned “open metaverse” mind game before people know what actually happened. There is no informed consent. This isn’t being done behind closed doors; it was a free event for which anyone could register. They want it that way, because the structure implies consent. I made it clear to them that they don’t have mine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My comments in the chat:</p>
<p>I was wondering if people are aware of the plans in ESG global finance to leverage “human capital” as a backing for “complementary currencies?” The “quality” of the human capital portfolio will relate to the blockchain twin avatar of the person and of the community. Optimization around mobility in poverty tied to tokenized behaviors in Internet of Bodies surveillance is not far off. Look at Learning Economy’s new proposal for Learn Card digital wallets working with World Bank and Brookings.</p>
<p>Also, what are your positions on the Japan Science and Technology Agency’s Moonshot Goal 1 – Society 5.0, Cyborg Avatar Capitalism? The US Department of Energy and the NSF and many tech companies are part of this effort to push us into “avatar” life. I don’t think people recognize that as a new empire built on military tech and steeped in behavioral psychology. Immersive reality is an open air prison / Skinner Box. If the story is good enough, they think we won’t resist it.</p>
<p>Augmented reality in my city, Philadelphia where Cesium is based, is advancing with support from Niantic. Niantic, of course, is a program of In-Q-Tel, the venture capital arm of the CIA. Do we want to live in the CIA’s video game of “good behavior” aligned to the UN SDGs – under satellite / drone surveillance with nano-tech?</p>
<p>In a tokenized world the data can be “private,” but with Ricardian contracts machine rules will govern how we interact with the built environment and other people. Think Black Mirror’s “Nosedive” episode – Intel and MIT’s Secret Network.</p>
<p>Look into the Impact Management Project – they are developing new forms of debt finance products tied to behavioral data in education, health, justice, food, housing, etc. Once those smart impact bonds are securitized vulnerable people will be pushed into a mixed reality “game.” Global hedge funds can literally bet on life outcomes – toddlers, people in addiction, those who are housing and food insecure. These funds can bet AGAINST people.</p>
<p>After they brought up NFTs…</p>
<p>Really, we should be talking about Soulbound Tokens. SBTs will be meta-data tags on digital identity linked to social impact programs. This is needed to deploy contracts with the Secret Network to assess real time impact data. Do we really want to be linking things to our souls?</p>
<p>Then they brought up “safety” and good governance.</p>
<p>What is coming is futarchy, liquid democracy, augmented democracy where you have a digital twin vote for you via radical participation using blockchain tokens.</p>
<p>Are you all thinking about what it will be like to live in the smart contract layer?</p>
<p>Living in mixed reality will require us to have a digital ID that is connected to satellites – the panopticon.</p>
<p>We will literally be the content of our digital wallet. Even NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) says they are concerned about what it will mean to have your digital twin impact the real world person.</p>
<p>Lee, your comment indicates that your intention is that people not know what is coming. There is no informed consent for any of this.</p>
<p>Digital twins will not be any kumbaya moment.</p>
<p>The most vulnerable people are being targeted as data commodities for human capital portfolios.</p>
<p>This was IEEE’s third webinar on the topic of the Metaverse roll out. The <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series.html">first session was July 2, 2022</a> and can be viewed below. The following week IEEE hosted <a href="https://engagestandards.ieee.org/IEEE-Metaverse-Congress-Series-2.html">a webinar for Chinese audiences</a>.</p>

<p>During the discussion, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavya-pearlman/">Kavya Pearlman</a> asserted the need for a “safe” decentralized Metaverse. Trained as a network cyber analyst, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavya-pearlman/details/experience/">Pearlman</a> imagines a future where all of us, including children, navigate a “safe” and diverse Metaverse where everyone feels “included.” She was credentialed this spring by the World Economic Forum as a global member of their global digital safety coalition.

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leestogner/details/experience/">Lee Stogner</a>, the gentlemen who responded to my queries in the chat by exhorting his fellow open Metaverse blockchainers to hurry up, is based in Greenville, SC and styles himself as a digital transformation expert with a focus on internet of things. Trained as an electrical engineer, Stogner worked in manufacturing efficiencies early in his career with stints at Fluor and Rockwell Automation. He did business development for Milliken, a pioneering South Carolina textile concern that expanded through research into synthetics for the military in WWII and is now advancing specialty chemicals and health-tech, in their Performance Solutions Division. In recent years Stogner became vice president of Chinese augmented reality firm Dreamerse and a partner in global alternative asset firm Liquidax. He launched Vincula Group consulting in 2008 shortly after becoming the chair of the Carolina Engineering cluster.</p>
<p>Vincula is the plural form of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vinculum">vinculum,</a> Latin for “bond,” vincire “to bind, fetter, chain.” Today the term can be used to refer to a ligament in the fingers or a mathematical expression – a bracket over a group numbers to which the same function is applied – think Soulbound Token drops and Ricardian contracts in Web 3 immersive reality. In popular culture vinculum is an operating system for Borg ships in Star Trek Voyager. It is the vinculum that assimilates individuals into a socially cohesive entity through transneural transmissions.</p>
<p>From the outlook of the Borg, I can see why my assertions of individual agency and refusal of the Metaverse may have been triggering for Mr. Stogner.</p>

<p>And it if wasn’t unsettling enough to face off against the DARPA MEMS-Borg duo, I ended the day being pulled into a Clubhouse “chat,” briefly. It’s not something I generally do, but there was a global finance <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Daniel-Matalon-Impact-Finance.pdf">impact investor</a> trolling the group and someone requested my presence. In short order I got worked into a fit of rage after this off-shore sustainable finance schemer claimed to not see any problem in putting toddlers on surveillance play tables to score their behaviors for pay for success deals. This is not normal people; toddler-backed complementary currencies are an abomination.</p>
<p>You can try and call it “beautiful” money, but we know these are the tentacles of the Borg.</p>
<p>Cling to your dandelions and feathers and cattail fluff. Hold on to the real and imagine beyond the material. Creativity and intuition will not be geofenced.</p>

  Recent versions of Brave on iOS include many new privacy features, ensuring that Brave iOS users have the strongest available protections of any iOS browser.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the twenty-first post in an <a>ongoing, regular series</a> describing new and upcoming privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by (in alphabetical order): Filter List Enginer Ryan Brown, Principal Engineer Brian Johnson, Android Engineering Manager Deep Pandya, Senior Product Designer Agustín Ruiz, and iOS Privacy Engineer Jacob Sikorski. This post was written by Senior Director of Privacy Peter Snyder.</p>
<p>





    


    
    







    


    
    
</p>
<p>Starting with the current Brave Nightly, and in version 1.45 when it releases in October, the Brave browser will block cookie consent notifications on Android and Desktop (and, soon after, on iOS). Cookie consent notifications are an infamous and near-constant annoyance on the Web. They break and disrupt one of the main benefits of the Web: the ability to browse content across many sites and publishers conveniently and easily. And, what is ironic, <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf">many cookie consent systems actually track users</a>, introducing the exact harm the consent systems were supposed to prevent.</p>
<p>New versions of Brave will hide—and, where possible, completely block—cookie consent notifications. Brave’s approach is distinct and more privacy-preserving than similar systems used in other browsers (such as the “auto-consent” systems used in other browsers), and helps keep the Web user-first.</p>

 Enabling and managing cookie banner blocking in Brave 





    


    


    
    

<p>On start up, the Brave browser will ask if you’d like to block cookie banners. If you choose to enable this feature, Brave will download <a href="https://secure.fanboy.co.nz/fanboy-cookiemonster.txt">a set of rules</a> designed to block and hide cookie consent notifications. The browser will start applying the rules as quickly as possible, within a minute or less of enabling the feature on most devices.</p>





    


    


    
    

<p>If you accidentally choose not to enable cookie banner blocking (or you enabled it but then changed your mind), you can update the setting at any time. Just visit brave://settings/shields/filters in the Brave browser and enable / disable the EasyList-Cookie List option.</p>
<p>Note: If you’re not prompted to block cookie dialogs, you may need to restart your browser and update to Brave version 1.45.</p>

 Comparison to other systems 
<p>There are several ways browsers and extensions try to block cookie banners. Brave’s method maximizes the privacy benefit to users, while still blocking as many banners and annoyances as possible.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there are two general ways to block cookie banners.</p>
<p>One approach (which Brave uses) is to block cookie banners, and to hide and to modify pages to remove any additional annoyance such systems include (such as overlays, preventing scrolling, etc.). Other Web-privacy tools (such as uBlock Origin) can be configured to use this same approach. This approach provides the strongest privacy guarantees: it doesn’t require trusting that the cookie consent systems will respect your choice, and prevents your browser from needing to communicate with consent-tracking systems at all.</p>
<p>The other approach is to trust and work with cookie banners. Instead of blocking these systems (as Brave does), this alternate approach automates the process of clicking “no” in cookie-banner systems. While this approach may reduce the number of cookies sent and the overall nuisance of banners, it still records your preference with the cookie banner providers. This creates a situation of requiring the browser or extension to repeatedly ask the cookie banner provider to leave you alone. Worse, researchers have found that <a href="https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Nataliia.Bielova/papers/Matt-etal-20-SP.pdf">many cookie-and-consent systems still track people</a>, even when users reject all cookies.</p>

 Google proposals will make it harder to block cookie banners 
<p>Brave’s approach to blocking cookie banners requires Brave to stay one step ahead of trackers and the companies that run the (nightmarishly titled) “consent-management systems.<a>1</a>” Brave keeps ahead of trackers in several ways, including <a>supporting crowd-sourced filter lists such as EasyList</a>, and conducting research to <a>help privacy activists stay one step ahead of trackers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google has been pushing changes to the Web that would make it more difficult to block cookie banners and, more generally, to filter out unwanted Web content (such as intrusive images, videos, ads, and tracking scripts). Google’s <a>WebBundles</a> proposal, for example, will make it easier for sites to evade content blockers. Their <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">Manifest v3</a> changes remove vital capabilities from privacy-protecting browser extensions. And many aspects of Google’s sprawling <a>Privacy Sandbox</a> proposal would generally give users less control–and sites more control–over how people use and experience the Web.</p>
<p>Ironically, cookie banners (a universally-despised Web annoyance) shows both i) the Web’s uniquely democratic, user-first platform, and ii) what will be lost if the Web continues in the direction Google is pushing it.</p>
<p>The Web is built to be open. On the one hand, that’s great: It means privacy-protecting Web tools like Brave can act on behalf of users, and protect them from Web abuses and annoyances. On the other hand, cookie banners highlight how much worse the Web will get if Google (and others) succeed in weakening users’ ability to block such annoyances.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Sometimes called “preference management systems”.&nbsp;<a>↩︎</a></p>

<p>Brave’s latest desktop release (version 1.44) is packed full of exciting updates in the integrated Brave Wallet for NFT collectors, crypto traders, and anyone who uses Brave Wallet. We’ve added a new fiat-crypto on-ramp for US users, enabled support for Solana token swaps, and added two new features in the wallet itself: an NFT gallery and a market tab with real-time price feeds. Initially rolling out on desktop, all four new features are planned for mobile in the near future as well.</p>

 Built-in NFT gallery 
<p>Brave’s exciting new NFT gallery feature is making its debut on Brave Wallet for desktop—giving you a simple and unified experience to view and manage NFT collections. Initially the gallery will support NFTs on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Keep an eye out for future updates when we bring the NFT gallery to mobile—and add support for more blockchains, so all you multi-chain NFT collectors can enjoy a one-stop view of your collections across ecosystems.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Solana swaps 
<p>Solana users rejoice! You can now seamlessly swap between SOL and your other favorite SPL tokens right from Brave Wallet on desktop. Using Jupiter, we aggregate trading liquidity from all of the major exchanges across Solana—offering a single endpoint for you to get the most depth, best fees, and up to date pricing in one convenient place. This update builds upon existing swap functionality for Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, and many other EVM-compatible chains.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 Sardine ACH 
<p>Brave Wallet on desktop now offers US-based users a new fiat-crypto on-ramp to make crypto purchases via ACH. Sardine joins our existing partners, Ramp and Wyre, to offer more flexible ways for Brave Wallet users to get crypto into their self-custodied wallets. Sardine ACH lets you purchase 40+ crypto assets directly from your bank account in just a short few steps, starting right in your wallet.</p>

 Market tab 
<p>Brave version 1.44 on desktop also includes a brand-new feature in the expanded Brave Wallet page—called “market”—which pulls market data from Coingecko for accurate, up-to-date price feeds for all your favorite crypto assets. The feature is designed to offer more value to Brave Wallet users, so you can be better informed on trends and activity in the crypto market. The market tab and the other new features in this release bring us closer to our vision of a one-stop shop—built right into the browser—to securely manage crypto assets and NFTs across all of the most active blockchains.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 
<p><a>Download Brave</a> today to try all of these new <a>Brave Wallet</a> features: show off your NFTs, swap on Solana, and more!</p>

 Your Decentralized ID Deserves&nbsp;Privacy Restoring data ownership to&nbsp;users<p>An innovative new technology, called decentralized ID (DID), stores sensitive information like your credit score or GPA on the blockchain, allowing you to own your personal data. But blockchain is known for transparency — so how can we ensure your personal data remains confidential?</p><p>Findora proposes a solution through <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-3.md">FIP-3</a>, allowing you to reveal your data on your&nbsp;terms.</p> The Power of Decentralized Identity Management <p>Traditional online platforms collect users’ personal data. When you hand over personal data to your favorite website, how can you be sure your personal information won’t be exploited and remains confidential?</p><p>Decentralized ID (DID) leverages encryption and decentralization to provide individuals with ownership of their personal data. Through DID, information such as date of birth, GPA, and credit score is owned and managed by the individual — Access to their personal information is controlled by the user, not the dApps it is shared with or the companies that store&nbsp;it.</p> Findora’s DID&nbsp;Proposal <p>Blockchain identity management is coming to the Findora ecosystem through <a href="https://github.com/FindoraNetwork/FIPs/blob/main/FIPs/fip-3.md">Findora Improvement Proposal 3&nbsp;(FIP-3)</a>.</p><p>FIP-3 is one of the first practical applications of zero-knowledge proofs to DID, allowing users to control who sees their data and how much gets revealed. It allows users to encrypt their data with their personal keys and issue proofs of that data to dApps and other third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Essentially, FIP-3 allows users to control what private data that Web3 applications can access by encrypting it inside a zero-knowledge proof. When a third party, like a dApp, requests private data, the user can create and share custom proofs of that data to share and, as a result, share as little or as much as they want. In layman’s terms, it is the difference between providing your date of birth and providing proof that you are over a certain age. This is done using zero-knowledge technology on&nbsp;Findora.</p> FIP-3 Use&nbsp;Cases <p>Findora’s DID system brings a wide range of practical use cases. Below are some examples of what this zero-knowledge technology brings to Web3&nbsp;users:</p> Credit Score Verification <p>Suppose <a href="https://aave.com/">Aave</a> is offering better loan rates depending on a user’s credit score. TransUnion has issued this user a score of 750, encrypted the information in a credential, which is then stored on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/#how">IPFS</a>, a decentralized blockchain for storing and managing&nbsp;files.</p><p>Using Findora’s DID solution, the user can qualify for the better rate without disclosing the actual score, all done using zero-knowledge technology. Instead of giving Aave complete access to their TransUnion credential, they can simply issue a proof to Aave that contains as much or as little data as they&nbsp;choose.</p> Age Verification <p>A Web3 gaming platform requires that users be above 21 in order to access their platform. Instead of revealing their actual date of birth, the user can issue a proof showing their age is above 21, giving the platform the needed information but in a zero-knowledge fashion.</p> GPA Verification <p>Universities can issue credentials containing a graduate’s GPA, certificate of graduation, and other data. Users could prove their qualifications to jobs and recruiters when they request it because the credential from the university has the university’s signature.</p> A Step Towards a Decentralized Data-Ownership <p>FIP-3 brings data ownership into the hands of individuals by relying on decentralized chains like Findora and IPFS for privacy and data storage. No internal team or external agency can arbitrarily delete, query, expose, or control your encrypted personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Similar zero-knowledge systems can be used to certify votes, verify supply chains, and reduce the burden of data storage on companies. Storing proof of data is easier and safer than storing the actual data — exploited platforms that received your proof would have no actual data to expose. FIP-3 is the first step toward restoring user control over their personal data and fulfilling the original Web3 promise of data ownership.</p><p>Share your thoughts and feedback with the Findora community on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/findora">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit</a>.</p> About Findora <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Findora</a> builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

<p>By Rob Habermeier, Polkadot founder</p><p>As the Polkadot Community comes into the last quarter of 2022, we at Parity Technologies would like to update the community on a number of important development topics we’ve been working on. These bridge a number of categories: parachain scalability, parachain development, relay-chain governance, cross-chain communication, common-good parachains, bridging to other ecosystems, and staking. We’ve been hard at work on delivering the code for these features and upgrades and look forward to having them accepted by the Polkadot community.</p> <br>Asynchronous Backing <p>Asynchronous Backing is the first set of major optimizations to Polkadot’s parachain consensus protocol since its launch on Polkadot in December 2021. Scalability is a huge topic in the blockchain ecosystem, and the goal of Parity and the Web3 Foundation as protocol designers is to meet the demand of parachains by providing each parachain with a large increase in block capacity. If Asynchronous Backing is enabled by the network, the block time of 12 seconds for parachains will be shortened to 6 seconds, which will mean lower latency and faster finality for transactions executed on parachains. Furthermore, the parachain blocks themselves will be allocated more time for execution, meaning that they get even more throughput.</p><p>Asynchronous Backing is a large upgrade spanning the runtime, the networking protocol, and the logic of collators which is designed to do 3 things: decrease the parachain block time to 6 seconds, increase the amount of block space available to each block by a factor of 5-10, and allow parachain blocks to be ‘reused’ when they don’t make it onto the relay chain in the first attempt. This is a major scalability improvement which will both increase the amount of work every parachain can do and will optimize network performance to allow for more parachains to be registered. We estimate that this update will bring the TPS capacity of the network in aggregate to between 100,000 and 1,000,000, without affecting the security guarantees made by the network.</p><p>We estimate that Asynchronous Backing will be ready for deployment on Kusama by EOY 2022 and then on Polkadot, pending the results of audits and testing.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/3779">GitHub Issue 3779: Asynchronous Backing Spec &amp; Tracking</a><br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5022">GitHub PR 5022: Asynchronous Backing MegaPR</a></p> Parathreads / Next-Generation Scheduling <p>One of the main goals we’ve set is to make it as easy as possible to build in the Polkadot ecosystem. While smart contract parachains have made it possible to easily build for the network and leverage its interoperability, we’re aiming to improve this developer experience at all levels of the stack. The early parachain auctions on Polkadot were significant events which gathered enormous amounts of community support. Each auction winner earned the right to launch a chain with guaranteed regular execution for the next 2 years. Over time, it’s become much cheaper to acquire a parachain slot as the supply has expanded, but the mechanics of building a community of supporters, waiting for the next auction, opening a crowdloan, and competing against other projects to win a slot still represent a significant barrier to entry for projects looking to join the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Parathreads are the solution to this issue. <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/parathreads-parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains/">Parathreads</a> are pay-as-you-go parachains. Parathreads give you the power of starting a blockchain with the ease of launching a smart contract. They can be launched and operated without waiting for the next auction or doing anything more than uploading their code to the relay chain and spinning up a few funded collator nodes. Parathreads are built for fast-iterating teams of committed professionals as well as tinkerers and hackathon participants, and are designed to be well-suited to the rapidly evolving blockchain developer ecosystem.</p><p>They represent a simple, easy, and accessible entry point for launching an L1 chain on top of Polkadot and Kusama. Parathread blocks are just as secure as parachain blocks. The parathread architecture is something that’s only possible on Polkadot and not on a solo-chain, because of Polkadot’s unique market mechanisms for allocating block space, data availability, and execution.</p><p>Parathreads also allow for a seamless upgrade path to become a full parachain with guaranteed capacity. While in operation, it’ll be possible for a parathread to participate in parachain auctions and upgrade to a full parachain.</p><p>We estimate that parathreads will be ready for launch in Q1/Q2 2023.</p><p>We are undertaking ongoing R&amp;D work to explore something we currently term Next-Generation Scheduling. Next-Generation Scheduling is something related to parathreads: the ability for parachains which have won slot auctions to ‘boost’ the amount of block space and execution time they have access to. This is a category of protocol changes intended to make Polkadot into the most efficient blockspace market by allowing both parachains and parathreads to adapt the amount of consensus resources they make use of based on their requirements. Parachains and parathreads should be able to save on consensus and security costs by avoiding paying for more than they need. Furthermore, this would ensure those resources are available for other chains to purchase, increasing the efficiency of the network in aggregate.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5492">GitHub Issue 5492: Parathreads: Take II</a></p> XCMv3 <p>As Polkadot’s core thesis of blockchain interoperability has become a reality over the past 2 years, we understand the impact and importance of <a href="https://polkadot.network/cross-chain-communication/">cross-chain communication</a> in the multichain future better than ever.</p><p>Polkadot’s XCM, short for Cross-Consensus Messaging, is having its third major release.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm">XCM</a> is a universal language for cross-chain communication that can be used inside or outside the Polkadot ecosystem. Combined with the transport protocol XCMP-Lite (aka HRMP) or other future transport protocols, it can be used to communicate securely and trustlessly between parachains.</p><p>XCM is already being used within the Polkadot ecosystem. With the release of XCMv3, parachains, as well as the contracts and applications deployed to them, would benefit from additional functionality. This includes support for bridging, e.g. to external networks, improved fee payments for operations, NFTs, and APIs for querying and invoking pallets on other chains.</p><p>XCMv3 depends on Weights V2, and we aim for it to be ready to deploy by EOY 2022</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/4097">GitHub PR 4097: XCM v3</a></p> FRAME: Weights V2 <p>Since the early days of Ethereum, there have been conversations about altering the notion of ‘gas’ payments to become multi-dimensional in order to accurately reflect the usage of different kinds of resources in order to set and adjust fees more accurately. Polkadot is now implementing these ideas with Weights V2.</p><p>Weights are the mechanism by which Substrate transactions and actions are measured against block capacity. The work on Weights V2 introduces a notion of multi-dimensional weights, which measure not only execution time but also the amount of state accessed by a particular operation. This is of particular interest to Polkadot, where the amount of data necessary to validate a particular parachain block is a key determining factor and must be limited to sizes accepted by the relay chain’s on-chain configuration. Essentially, Weights V2 makes Substrate runtimes more amenable to stateless client approaches and therefore marks a key step in making it easy to write parachains (and other kinds of rollups) using Substrate. This is also a precursor to XCMv3.</p><p>Weights V2 will be ready to use by mid-October 2022</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/12176">GitHub Issue 12176: The rest of the way to Weights v2</a></p> Governance Overhaul <p>Polkadot’s governance system is getting ready to evolve. We’ve been keeping an eye on the developments of the blockchain space and predict that the future will allow for projects which are either fully decentralized or which are not decentralized. Partial decentralization is a category which is fading quickly. To that end, <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/gov2-polkadots-next-generation-of-decentralised-governance/">Governance V2</a> has been designed as the next step in making the on-chain, binding decision-making processes of Polkadot as decentralized as possible.</p><p>Our novel governance system removes the council and technical committees, introduces the Polkadot Fellowship, and moves every decision in Polkadot to referendums by the community. Its agile delegation system allows for community leaders to gather delegations either for all decisions or for some specific area or areas of focus. The acts of voting in a referendum, submitting a referendum, or becoming a delegate are all totally permissionless. Governance V2 exemplifies the ability of Polkadot’s on-chain governance mechanisms to upgrade themselves, in what we refer to as the ‘meta-protocol’. To read more about the design considerations and mechanisms involved in this overhaul, refer to the long-form blog post by Gavin Wood, linked below.</p><p>The novel governance system is scheduled to be deployed on Kusama at the beginning of Q4 2022 (most likely with runtime upgrade v.0.9.30). The proposal to deploy the new model will be proposed to the community and needs to be voted on and approved in the referenda queue by token holders.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://youtu.be/EF93ZM_P_Oc">YouTube: Gavin Wood on Governance v2 at Polkadot Decoded 2022</a></p> Collectives Parachain <p>The Common Good Parachains team has been working on final testing for a new parachain, Polkadot Collectives. This parachain will be home to numerous collectives that form in the service of the Polkadot network, including the aforementioned Technical Fellowship after its incubation phase on the Kusama Relay Chain.</p><p>The first collective expected to launch is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXlVDDQj6v8kOTvbMXBmenBZ3Sfn5zZf0ipQbYvdipo/edit#">Polkadot Alliance</a>, a community initiative to create an on-chain body to defend fair use of the Polkadot brand and open source code.</p><p>Estimated launch is in late October.</p> Bridge Hub <p>Parity’s bridges team has been working on a Polkadot&lt;&gt;Kusama bridge for some time, and is preparing to start the launch process. Several other teams in the ecosystem also have bridge protocols, like Snowfork and Centrifuge. The Common Good Parachains team will work on launching parachains on both Kusama and Polkadot to serve as bridge hubs to each network.</p><p>The bridge hub will be a message routing service within each network. That is, it will not store much state about the bridged chains (e.g. wrapped assets), but rather forward messages to other parachains like Statemint to handle.</p><p>The launch plan is being worked on, with a planned launch by end of year.</p> Nomination Pools &amp; Fast Unstake <p>Polkadot is happy to lead the march toward a future full of proof-of-stake blockchains. We’ve been ahead of the curve and have already shifted our mindset from "getting to PoS" to "super scaling the PoS system”. Nomination pools will expand the reach of who can participate in Polkadot’s staking system to anyone and the staking dashboard (see below) will make it easy for everyone to learn how to do that.</p><p>Nomination pools are a major upgrade to Polkadot’s staking system. Nomination pools allow users to permissionlessly create “pools” of stake which others can join, and which will all be used together to nominate the same validators. The votes issued by the pool will automatically be balanced across the validators which were nominated for maximum effect. This enables more nominators, especially smaller ones, to join the staking system.</p><p>Pools have been <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5447">live on Kusama</a> since June, and they have indeed fulfilled the purpose of being the real-value experimental playground of Polkadot, with more than 64 pools being created.</p><p>Nomination pools <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5582">will be added</a> to Polkadot as of the 0.9.28 release, but with the default parameters, no pools can be created yet. Once this runtime is enacted, a governance proposal can set the initial configurations, such as how many pools can be created, how many members can join, etc. The pools are designed to be infinitely scalable, meaning that there is no technical limit on the number of pools and members that can participate therein. Soon afterwards, we are aiming to add a <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12129">fast-unstake feature</a> to the staking system, to facilitate the migration of nominators who are not earning rewards to nomination pools.</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10694">GitHub PR 10694: Nomination Pools</a><br><a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">YouTube: Nomination Pools &amp; Polkadot NPoS at Polkadot Decoded 2022</a><br><a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-august-september-2022/">Staking Updates: August-September 2022</a></p> Staking Dashboard <p>Alongside the work on extending the capabilities of the staking protocol itself, we also recognize the need to make staking maximally accessible to end users and regular people.</p><p>To that end, Parity Technologies has developed a <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/">Staking Dashboard</a>, which is currently in an open beta. This dashboard allows users to explore and nominate validators, and view metrics about their staking returns.</p><p>The Staking Dashboard also makes use of Polkadot’s <a href="https://substrate.io/developers/substrate-connect/">best-in-class light-client technology</a>, which allows users to interact with the blockchain without ever having to ‘phone home’ to a centralized service provider like Infura, which could either go down, restrict access, or collect data on users.</p><p>Parity’s approach to blockchain UI development is to allow the user to choose from a gradient of different options, so they can opt-in to using centralized services to augment the application with more features and data, while maintaining confidence that the application will continue working even if those centralized services stop working for them.</p><p>This is the first of many such products we are working on developing.</p><p>The Staking Dashboard will exit its open beta shortly, but is feature-complete and can be used already.</p> Disputes Slashing <p>The Polkadot parachains protocol went live in December 2021. Parity’s approach to software development is to ship early and often, and the initial version of the parachains protocol does not enable the slashing logic. This has given the validator community the chance to upgrade alongside the network and to make sure to configure their nodes in such a way that they won’t be slashed mistakenly once the slashing code goes live. Once disputes slashing is enabled, validators which submit invalid parachain blocks will be slashed for their entire stake, and validators which create faulty disputes will be slashed for a small amount to discourage spam. This greatly increases the economic security of the network as a whole.</p><p>We estimate that disputes slashing will be ready to go live by EOY 2022</p><p>Links:<br><a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-v1-0-sharding-and-economic-security/">Polkadot v1.0: Sharding and Economic Security</a><br><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5535">GitHub PR 5535: runtime/disputes: slashing</a></p> <p>Interested in building on Polkadot? <a href="https://info.polkadot.network/contact">Get in touch here</a>.</p>

 Index <p>See the full list of monthly staking updates <a href="https://polkadot.network/tag/staking-updates/">here</a>. These updates have been written by <a href="mailto:kian@parity.io">Kian Paimani</a> and <a href="mailto:ross@parity.io">Ross Bulat</a> from <a href="http://parity.io">Parity Technologies</a>.</p><p>Check out the new staking landing page at <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking">polkadot.network/staking</a>!</p> Democracy Proposals <p>A number of noteworthy governance proposals and runtime upgrades have been proposed and/or executed in the last two months in the world of staking.</p><p>First, the <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/261">motion to upgrade Polkadot to 9.28</a> is enacted and executed. This means that nomination pools code is live on Polkadot! However, no pools can be created yet and this will be up to the governance of the chain to decide.</p><p>This means that the nomination pools will be usable very soon on Polkadot! Those stakers who wish to join pools should consider starting the 28 day unbonding process.</p><p>That being said, we are preparing a new system to facilitate the migration of nominators to pools as well. Read more in the “Fast Unstake” section further down.</p><p>Next, <a href="https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/534">a proposal was made to Kusama</a> to increase the limits of the nomination pools deployment. Note that these limits were only set there in response to a number of bugs that were found earlier. Now, these limits can be removed as the aforementioned bug has been fixed in the 9.27 release.</p><p>Secondly, <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1224">a suggestion has been made to Polkadot governance</a> to slightly increase the limits of the nomination intention, namely to increase the minimum number of DOT needed from 10 to 50 DOT. The reason for this is twofold:</p>  Polkadot already has a lot of “inactive” nominators. <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-february-2022/#staking-terminology">Recall from our February update</a> that active nominators are those who end up backing a validator, both earning rewards and being exposed to slashes. Inactive nominators are exactly the opposite of that: those who have had enough DOT to set their intention, but don’t have enough DOT to actually become active. A slightly higher DOT limit for nomination intention will hopefully prevent too many inactive nominators from being created.  More importantly, now, with the enablement of nomination pools just around the corner, these inactive nominators can now join pools and actually participate in staking in a fruitful way. Therefore, it is sensible for Polkadot to adjust its staking parameters such that there is less incentive for inactive nominators to exist.   Fast Unstake <p>Speaking of inactive nominators wanting to migrate to pools, there is finally a PR that addresses a <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/8436">long anticipated feature</a> in Polkadot’s staking system: <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12129">Fast Unstake</a>.</p><p>Don’t let this fool you: Polkadot’s staking system is still strict (and therefore secure) regarding slashing: Any staker who wishes to unstake needs to wait for the full bonding duration, because a historical slash might be detected. The point of the fast-unstake feature is to allow “those stakers who are known to NOT have actively backed any validator (i.e. have not been exposed) in the previous bonding duration” unbond in a quick way.</p><p>A typical example of this would be someone that bonds, but immediately changes their mind. Such a staker would ideally no longer have to wait a full 28 days. More importantly, all of the aforementioned inactive nominators also fall into the same category: they are almost certainly not actively backing any validators, and are therefore free to unstake quickly.</p><p>The fast unstake process is therefore as follows: Any stakers who are certain that they are not exposed in the full bonding duration can register themselves for the fast-unstake process. The checking process is beyond what can fit in a single block and is scheduled to happen over multiple future blocks (No ordering guarantees such as FIFO are provided by the pallet in case of congestion, and all unstake requests are processed in random order). If the check is successful, the staker is unbonded, and if configured to do so, they are automatically added to a nomination pool. If the staker is proven to actually have been exposed, they lose part of their bond as slash.</p><p>The fast unstake PR is still ongoing and we hope to see it go live on Polkadot soon, at which point it will be supported in the staking dashboard and can provide a swift 1-click migration path for inactive nominators to join nomination pools.</p> Nomination pools resources <p>Here is a short recap on everything you need to know about nomination pools:</p>  <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">Polkadot Wiki page about nomination pools</a>  <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/">March Staking Update</a>: Contains extensive details about pools  <a href="https://youtu.be/ubs8ZDFCzLc?t=743">April Twitter space recording</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">Nomination Pools and The Story of The Polkadot's NPoS</a> at Polkadot Decoded  A lot of <a href="https://support.polkadot.network/support/search/solutions?term=Pools">support articles</a> around nomination pools  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T9WXuMmXIJ4UKdnl7sf8btE4MPfk0gGn-1C9FmgipmQ/edit?usp=sharing">Implementers' guide</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!pXhsIqCSnUniflVQbq:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&amp;via=matrix.org">Nomination Pools Discussion room</a> in Matrix   Notable contributors <p>The staking system of Polkadot, albeit being a critical system, has proudly been open to external contributors and has seen a lot of pull requests from the Polkadot community, many of which have been successfully reviewed and merged.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11831">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11831</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Szegoo">https://github.com/Szegoo</a>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12185">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12185</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12058">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12058</a> by <a href="https://github.com/NingLin-P">NingLin-P · GitHub</a>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12069">https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12069</a> by <a href="https://github.com/hzy1919">hzy1919 (ZhiYong) · GitHub</a>  <p>See <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33">Substrate (Nominated) Proof of Stake project board</a> to follow the development in more detail!</p> Staking dashboard updates <p>Additional functionality, advancements in existing modules and polished UX are the themes of this September update for the staking dashboard.</p><p>We’ll explore some of the notable updates including full nomination pool support, new nomination generation methods, and some nice UX updates to some key app components.</p> Nomination pools now fully supported The Pools page interface for a pool owner on Westend<p>Nomination pools are now fully supported in the staking dashboard, and users can now play with the feature on Westend and Kusama.</p><p>When pools are enabled on Polkadot, the staking dashboard will be ready and allow users to create and join pools, along with all the management options of running/participating in a pool.</p><p>All nomination pool logic is natively hosted on-chain. Polkadot does not rely on a third party network, bridging, or layer-2 mechanisms like rollups to get pools working. Pools are a part of the Polkadot runtime, making them upgradable, secure and fully embedded as part of the Relay Chain.</p><p>So what else is there beyond joining or creating a pool? Let’s break down exactly what you can do in a pool.</p> What you can do in a Pool <p><br>Anyone can claim rewards<br>Pool rewards are generated per era. In fact, each pool has a stash address that is assigned as a nominator in exactly the same way as nominators do in solo staking. Pools are nominators.</p><p>So once a pool receives payouts, they are immediately claimable by all pool members. When claiming rewards you can either:</p>  Withdraw them to your account’s free balance.  Re-bond the rewards back into the pool.  <p>Anyone can bond and unbond<br>Bond more funds to the pool, or unbond down to the minimum required deposit. This amount differs between pool members and pool owners.</p><p>Unbonding from a pool is still subject to the unbond period, so once your unbond chunk is unlocked, you’ll be able to withdraw that chunk. This is exactly how solo staking works.</p><p>Pool owner can rename the pool<br>Renaming a pool actually sets the pool’s metadata attribute on-chain. This value is used as the pool’s display name. It supports any utf8 character including emojis, so pool owners can be creative in naming their pool.</p><p>Pool owner and nominator can nominate<br>When we say pool owner we are referring to the account who created the pool. The pool owner inherits the root and depositor roles of a pool, and these cannot be changed.</p><p>By default, the owner will also have the nominate role too, unless configured to another account on pool creation.</p><p>So the pool owner and whoever has the nominate role is able to, as the name suggests, manage the pool’s nominations. The tools staking dashboard offers for nominating have been updated this month — we’ll explore these nominating options further down.</p><p>Pool owner and state toggler can manage pool state<br>The state toggler is able to change the pool state to locked or destroying.</p><p>New members are not able to join while a pool is locked. The pool owner can also permissionlessly unbond and withdraw other pool members in this locked state.</p><p>The destroying state of a pool is the state a pool is changed to when it is being closed down. While a pool is in destroying state, members can be permissionlessly unbonded and withdrawn from the pool (minus the pool owner).</p><p>Once all members have left the pool and the pool is no longer nominating, the pool owner can then unbond and withdraw their funds from the pool — at which point the pool will be deleted from chain state.</p><p>The entire process of destroying a pool is now supported in the staking dashboard.</p><p>Pool owners can change the nominator and state toggler pool roles<br>As the title suggests, the nominator and state toggler roles can also be updated within the dashboard.</p> Other noteworthy nomination pool support <p>Along with the above management functions, the staking dashboard attempts to make pool management intuitive and useful with dedicated UI, such as:</p>  A step-by-step pool creation process, similar to the nominator setup process for solo staking.  A pool stats module outlining the current state of the pool, featuring the total bond amount, total members, outstanding unclaimed rewards, and more.  A list of all pools along with their member count, bonded funds, and the pool’s nomination status. This is very useful for determining whether a pool is actively earning rewards at a glance.  Pools are searchable via a dedicated search bar alongside the pools list.  Once you join (or create) a pool, a dedicated pool members tab allows you to browse all pool members, along with the amount they have bonded in the pool.  The ability to delve into a pool’s nominations list and browse each of those nomination’s status, so users can view how many of the pool’s nominations are active.  The ability to add favorite pools, that are housed in a separate tab on the pools page.  <p>This is not an exhaustive list of nomination pool support within the dashboard, but hopefully communicates the attention and thought given to supporting pools as a 1st class citizen in the dashboard.</p><p>As always, nomination pool support will continue to improve and evolve with the rest of the dashboard.</p> Enhanced Methods of Generating Nominations <p>Staking dashboard attempts to make it easy to discover and nominate validators.</p><p>One of the problems of nominating on Polkadot is that of finding a balance between choosing a mix of active and inactive validators while maintaining a high probability of being an active nominator every era.</p><p>Economically, Polkadot rewards those who back less popular validators as the share of that validator will be larger than that of a popular validator. This is subject to a validator’s era points, but in general, the less nominators backing a validator, the greater your share of the payout.</p><p>So it makes sense to at least back some less active validators on Polkadot as part of your nomination strategy to maximize potential rewards. This was a consideration during this iteration of the nominate feature, with various options now present for generating and choosing validators.</p><p>Generation methods have now been expanded to 4 main methods:</p>Nomination generation methods in staking dashboard<p>Breaking down these methods:</p>  Optimal Selection selects a 75% share of currently active validators and a 25% share of currently inactive validators.  Active Low Commission selects a range of currently active validators prioritizing low commission.  From Favorites selects validators from your favorites list.  Manual Selection does not generate any nominations, allowing the user to fine-tune their selection manually.  <p>For validators to be a part of the generation process, they must have an on-chain identity, not be in blocked state, and not have 100% commission. Each generation method then adds additional requirements to be a part of the pool from which validators are randomly selected..</p><p>Once you have selected a generation method, you are then able to fine tune that selection. The following screenshot is what is presented after selecting the Optimal Selection method:</p>Interface for fine-tuning generated nominations<p>There are a few useful tools in this interface, most notably:</p>  The ability to re-generate the list using the same method, that totally replaces your nominations in one-click. This is done by the Re-Generate button above the validator list.  The ability to select and remove validators from the list, and add from favorites; these functions were already present prior to this update.  The ability to generate a single active parachain validator, a single active validator (non-parachain), or just a single random validator that could be active or inactive.  <p>These buttons give users more tooling to mix up their nomination set in the way they see fit. If the maximum number of validators are met (16 in Polkadot’s case), or if there are no more validators available in a particular subset, then the corresponding buttons will be disabled.</p><p>Users can also cancel and start again with a new generation method if they choose to do so.</p><p>UX Enhancements</p><p>Various improvements have also been made to the staking dashboard UI this month. This section lists the most notable of them:</p>  A redesigned help modal, that rethinks how the previously featured Assistant modal should be implemented. The new interface solves accessibility and readability issues that the previous iteration highlighted.  A redesigned full-screen help overlay now replaces the Assistant button.  A new Help icon that invokes the new help overlay is now present in the side menu.  A dedicated Accounts button is now always present in the top right corner of the app. The account bubbles beside the button are no longer interactive, and simply provide guidance to which accounts are actively staking (both nominating or via pools).  The “reserve amount” for transaction fees has been completely removed, and tx fees now dynamically adjust bond amounts and display warnings when tx fees cannot be fulfilled.  Animated icons are being rolled out, the first of which now live in the side menu.  The new <a href="https://unbounded.polkadot.network/">Unbounded Polkadot font</a> has been installed and applied to top page and modal headings.  The main app font has been changed to Inter, a more screen-friendly font and keeps consistency with the main Polkadot branding.  More border-radius and spacing consistency between the various button styles.  The Validators page is now searchable with a dedicated search bar.  The default validator list and pool list ordering is now shuffled on every page reload.  The Community page is now populated with over 20 validator entities, providing their bios, social media links and list of validators.

 Cosmos History — Part I — Inception to PreLaunch <p>The constellation of core Cosmos and Interchain development organizations has a complex history. Its details are scattered across the internet, in blog posts, news articles, tweets, github repositories, and even blockchains. What has emerged out of this history is a truly remarkable collection of smart, passionate, and thoughtful contributors that have together made manifest the vision of the Internet of Blockchains. This post outlines the origin story of Cosmos up until just before the launch of the Cosmos Hub. A subsequent post will outline the history since then. As the Cosmos ecosystem continues to expand and flourish, we believe it’s important to reflect on how we got here to remind us of where we want to go and how we bring the learning from the past into the opportunities of the&nbsp;future.</p> Pre History <p>One could say that blockchains became too big to ignore once Bitcoin crossed the $1B valuation mark in early 2013 during the Cypriot financial crisis. By the end of the year, Bitcoin’s market cap had 10x’d again, before famously crashing and collapsing the Mt Gox exchange shortly thereafter.</p><p>There were already adaptations of Bitcoin — like Litecoin, which launched in 2011, and Dogecoin, which launched by the end of 2013¹ — and there was a significant amount of protocol design activity and experiments. There were hundreds of cryptocurrencies, many of which never reached widespread adoption. But it was difficult, expensive, and unsustainable to continuously secure new networks using Proof of Work, and the early crypto community was researching alternatives. By 2012 and 2013 the idea of Proof of Stake was floating around, but the early Proof of Stake protocols — like those used by Peercoin and Nxt — had quite limited security guarantees because there was no cost to re-writing history. This came to be known as the <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/31/pos_faq.html#what-is-the-nothing-at-stake-problem-and-how-can-it-be-fixed">“Nothing at Stake”</a> attack and was considered a fundamental problem for Proof of Stake. The core problem remains, though it is now handled in practice by <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity">adjusting the security&nbsp;model</a>.²</p> 2014: Jae Kwon invents Tendermint <p>2014 was a formative year for Proof of Stake and blockchain more generally. By early 2014, Vitalik had invented Ethereum and the first implementations were being worked on. He was also publishing a lot about protocol design, and conceived an approach to handling the Nothing at Stake problem using security deposits — what he called <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/01/15/slasher-a-punitive-proof-of-stake-algorithm">“slasher”</a>. In this version of Proof of Stake, validators would “bond” their tokens in such a way that they could be “slashed” if they misbehaved (ie. tried to re-write history illegally).</p><p>Inspired by the ongoing research on Proof of Stake, by the spring of 2014, Jae Kwon invented <a href="https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf">Tendermint</a>. It was unique in that it was the first blockchain system&nbsp;to:</p>  Use a classical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm  Implement Security-Deposit-Based Proof-of-Stake (“slasher”)  <p>Both of these components are now staples of nearly every modern Proof of Stake&nbsp;system.</p><p>The original PoS systems, before Tendermint, didn’t actually solve the consensus problem securely. Tendermint was the first system to build on the decades of academic research in Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus, in particular by developing a variant of the <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/jacm88.pdf">1988 DLS algorithm</a> for partial synchrony that “upgraded” it to use blockchain data structures and a stake weighted voting power. By combining this approach to BFT with Vitalik’s “slasher” idea, Tendermint came to both epitomize a new model of Proof-of-Stake and provide the first serious implementation you could really start to build&nbsp;with.</p><p>By the end of 2014, a growing community of cryptocurrency researchers had come together online in the form of the CryptoCurrency Research Group (CCRG, now defunct)³, largely convinced that Proof of Stake cryptocurrencies were the future of blockchains. They set off to build that future. Among them were Vitalik Buterin, Vlad Zamfir, Ethan Buchman, Jae Kwon, Zaki Manian, Dominic Williams, Arthur Brietman, and others. Vitalik had invented Ethereum, and Vlad had been working as a leading researcher there. Ethan worked closely with Vlad and was contributing to go-ethereum. Jae Kwon had invented Tendermint. Dominic was working on the ideas that would become Dfinity. Arthur had invented Tezos. Zaki was running a supply-chain focused blockchain startup called SkuChain at the time, and was otherwise already everywhere.</p><p>Jae Kwon had begun an initial implementation of the Tendermint software in Go around spring 2014 under his company All in Bits Inc, which did business as Tendermint Inc. He chose Go because the language was gaining popularity, especially for distributed systems projects and blockchains. What would become the main Ethereum software was also being written in Go. At the same time, Ethan was working for Eris Industries (now <a href="https://monax.io/">Monax</a>) as the lead blockchain developer, with a mandate to bring Ethereum to enterprise, and was looking for a Proof of Stake solution to integrate with. Tendermint was the leading candidate.</p> 2015: Ethan Buchman&nbsp;Joins <p>In early 2015, the CCRG held a conference in Silicon Valley called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHRJAd29VhyhLVT5tEOvhIw">CryptoEconomicon</a> where much of this early R&amp;D community attended. It was here that Ethan and Jae, the founders of Cosmos, first met. They discussed possible attacks on Jae’s Tendermint algorithm, and shortly thereafter began closely collaborating on the Tendermint software.</p><p>Ethan and Jae spent the better part of 2015 working closely on the Tendermint software. They implemented the Ethereum Virtual Machine as part of the Tendermint application state (technically the first iteration of “Ethermint”), implemented various features to make Tendermint more useful, and made various improvements to the consensus algorithm.</p><p>Ethan was also completing a Masters Degree at the University of Guelph at the time. His thesis, <a href="https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/9769/Buchman_Ethan_201606_MAsc.pdf">Tendermint: Byzantine Fault Tolerance in the Age of Blockchains</a>, focused on Tendermint — its consensus algorithm, software architecture, and performance under test. The thesis is widely regarded as an essential introduction to the historical context of blockchains and Proof-of-Stake in the tradition of classical Byzantine Fault Tolerance.</p><p>In the second half of 2015, discussions between Jae and Eris Industries over copyright of the Tendermint codebase (which included an implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine), led Jae to introduce an abstraction between the Tendermint consensus engine and the application state machine it replicates, a programming interface we now know as the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI). This interface made it possible for application logic to be completely separated from the Tendermint consensus engine, to be run in a different process, and even written in a different programming language,⁴ making Tendermint the general purpose state-machine replication engine it has become today. This allowed the components related to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, and to any cryptocurrency elements at all, to be refactored out of the Tendermint code base. In particular, at the time, ownership over the Ethereum Virtual Machine components moved to Eris Industries, and that code evolved into what is now the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-burrow">Hyperledger Burrow&nbsp;Project</a>.</p><p>By the end of the year, Ethan decided to leave Eris Industries to build a company around the Tendermint codebase with Jae. He became a formal co-founder of All in Bits Inc and served as its&nbsp;CTO.⁵</p> 2016: Cosmos and&nbsp;Adoption <p>In early 2016, All in Bits (AiB) was trying to raise money from venture capitalists for Tendermint-based enterprise products and Proof-of-Stake application hosting. The VCs were only just starting to understand Bitcoin, and were certainly not ready for this. During this period, Ethan and Jae started working with Peng Zhong, a designer and web developer that Jae had worked with on a previous project. Peng started working on early blockchain explorers and wallet designs to support possible products. They realized after a few months that the timing was not right, and so Jae and Ethan revisited their original motivations: to solve a number of outstanding problems in the security, speed, flexibility, and usability of public cryptocurrency systems, to lay a foundation for a more sustainable approach to money and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>After iterating through a number of designs and debating different ways to raise capital, they hit on the concept of Cosmos and wrote the <a href="https://cosmos.network/resources/whitepaper">Cosmos whitepaper</a>, which proposed an “Internet of Blockchains’’, based on the Tendermint consensus engine, the ABCI application interface, and a TCP-like protocol for reliable communication between untrusting blockchain networks called the InterBlockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Jae had written the very first specification of the IBC protocol, which was included in the whitepaper. The first blockchain in the network was to be known as the Cosmos Hub; it would be a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency system with a native token called ATOM that would be allocated to participants in a future fundraising event held by a to-be-created non-profit.</p><p>The Cosmos Whitepaper was well received by the cryptocurrency community, and Tendermint was gaining adoption as a flexible and mature platform for building blockchain applications. By the end of summer 2016, Ethan and Jae received some initial funding to build&nbsp;Cosmos.</p><p>Meanwhile, All in Bits was engaged by Votem Inc to host the Rock N’ Roll Hall of Fame’s annual vote on a Tendermint blockchain, which it completed in the fall. That means the 2017 inductees into the Rock N’ Roll hall of fame (which included Tupac!) were actually voted for using a Tendermint blockchain, lending more credibility to the project and helping further boost adoption. (See the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210724065702/https://votem.com/news/press-releases/largest-ever-online-vote-using-blockchain/">Votem press release</a> for more details.)</p><p>The user base of Tendermint was growing considerably at the time, and the Cosmos project was gaining in recognition. Cosmos <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tendermint-wins-innovation-award-and-announces-cosmos-at-international-blockchain-week-1474657507">won an award for Most Innovative Project</a> at the International Blockchain Week in Shanghai, September 2016, which was co-hosted with Ethereum’s Devcon&nbsp;II.</p><p>By the end of the year, Jae and Ethan were hiring their first developers at All in Bits. A list of employees and when they joined can be found in the Appendix. The list is notably incomplete and will be updated over&nbsp;time!</p> 2017: Early&nbsp;Growth <p>By February 2017, with the initial funds raised for Cosmos, and following the model set by Ethereum, a non-profit was established in Switzerland called the Interchain Foundation (ICF). The ICF was governed by a Foundation Council (FC) consisting initially of Jae, Ethan and a local Swiss board member named Guido Schmitz-Krummacher. In the meantime, All in Bits was ramping up development of the Cosmos software — the team was already running testnets of Tendermint based chains with a simple account system sending tokens between each other with a prototype of&nbsp;IBC.</p><p>In April 2017, a fundraiser was conducted for the Cosmos project. The Cosmos and Tendermint projects had already developed significant grassroots reputation and adoption over the years among early blockchain developers. AiB grew to some ~20 people over 2017. They were working on wallets, an application framework, improving Tendermint, and designing proof of stake algorithms. They were iterating on early versions of the Cosmos-SDK and Cosmos Hub software. They were sketching designs for Ethereum bridges and Decentralized Exchanges and smart contract languages, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>A number of core team members joined AiB in 2017, many of whom are still active in the Cosmos ecosystem today. See the Appendix for more details on who joined in 2017 and what they’re up to now! These were the formative days of what would come to be known as the <a href="https://ali-the-curious.medium.com/the-tendermint-mafia-348bacd1c352">Tendermint Mafia</a>.</p> 2018: Cosmos-SDK and&nbsp;Testnets <p>By early 2018 the Cosmos-SDK really started to take shape and the early pieces of the Cosmos Hub started to make use of it. The Cosmos-SDK was aspiring to be the Ruby on Rails for blockchains — a “batteries included” application framework and toolkit for programming blockchains.</p><p>Around spring 2018, Zaki Manian officially joined AiB. Zaki had been around since the beginning of Cosmos — he worked through many of the early ideas with Ethan and Jae, he reviewed the whitepaper, was one of the firsts to fund the project, and was always around to provide advice and insight. Zaki would go on to lead the Cosmos testnet program, culminating in the Game of Stakes and the launch of the Cosmos Hub. He would later lead the major Stargate upgrade, and he continues to play a key role in Cosmos strategy and development today.</p><p>Over the course of 2018, the testnet program grew considerably and became increasingly decentralized. By Summer 2018, there were decentralized testnet launches with over 100 validators. The team was breaking ground in the deployment of large scale BFT consensus systems. Many of today’s top validators learned the ropes in the early Cosmos testnet program. The technology matured considerably during this period. A new business model — the Proof of Stake validator — was being&nbsp;born.</p><p>The team grew and lots of great people were joining (see the Appendix!). Everyone was united by a shared vision to build a sovereign interoperable future for blockchains, a vision that motivates them still, to continue innovating on the frontier.</p><p>At the ICF, Michael Niederer was hired to be the CFO, and took over operations in Switzerland. The ICF began an initiative to start funding research more broadly, especially on consensus systems, cryptography, and formal verification. The ICF helped found the <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/icf-supports-5-year-research-program-led-by-professor-dan-boneh-f0992c333129">Stanford Blockchain Research Center</a> and initiated collaborations with researchers in Switzerland and elsewhere. The ICF started to grow its broader funding program too, expanding the ecosystem by contributing to some early Cosmos-based <a href="https://interchain-io.medium.com/ecosystem-expansion-189e9534038">projects</a>.</p><p>By the end of 2018, serious preparations were being made for the imminent launch of the Cosmos Hub. Most notable of these was Game of Stakes, the first Proof-of-Stake, incentivized, decentralized tesnet which served as the culmination of the Cosmos tesnet program and which put the Cosmos software through its most <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/let-the-games-begin-21e66e34e2fd">rigorous test to date</a>. Game of Stakes set a new standard for incentivized and decentralized testnets whose legacy is felt across the ecosystem today.</p><p>Throughout most of 2018, the Cosmos Hub was famously “two months” away from launch. Chris Goes did offer a prophetic software estimation when in early summer 2018 he predicted that the Cosmos Hub would launch by the end of February 2019. He was off by about 2&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Stay tuned, for launch and the years that followed, in Part&nbsp;II.</p><p>Thanks to the many reviewers who contributed to this history. It has been reviewed and accepted by Jae, Ethan, and&nbsp;Zaki.</p> Endnotes   Fun piece of trivia: Jae Kwon (co-founder of Cosmos), and Jehan Tremback (Interchain Security lead, at Informal Systems) contributed to early debates about Dogecoin monetary policy in this <a href="https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/23">github&nbsp;issue</a>.  The security model for Tendermint (and its light client) is defined more formally in<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07031"> this paper</a> by Informal&nbsp;Systems.  A cryptoeconomics google group was created. Jae later created a second cryptofinance group to continue discussions.  See the <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/abci-the-application-blockchain-interface-f1bd8278cdd7">original blog post</a> announcing ABCI (which was originally called TMSP, the TenderMint Socket Protocol)  A third co-founder, Dustin Byington, was also brought on to All in Bits Inc to lead finance and operations, though he would part ways with the company soon after in&nbsp;2016.

 Meet our new hire — Martin Lecam, Front-End Developer <p>#16 — This is the sixteenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to our latest team member, Martin Lecam! Martin is a talented front-end developer that brings his versatile experience from working in various industries. And now, he’s bringing his expertise to BlockWallet — helping the team continuously improve our premium user experience.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m a Front-End developer that is helping construct the BlockWallet browser extension. My background consists of being a full-stack developer, but I wanted to focus on Front-End to improve my knowledge of blockchain technology — BlockWallet gives me this opportunity. I’m someone who seeks challenges which is why I decided to join BlockWallet!</p> How long have you worked as a developer? <p>I’ve been working as a developer for more than 8 years. I started as an intern and then became a full-stack developer. I also had the opportunity of working as an RPA developer for an oil company, we were asked to create automations for the finance team. These automations included copying human actions in the computer, downloading files, and making calculations. After those calculations were done our automations pushed that data back to the&nbsp;system.</p> Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I started as an intern in a SaaS company and worked there for 5 years. My role there was as a full-stack developer consisting of front-end/back-end work. It also gave me the opportunity of visiting customers and presenting our product — something that really helped my communication skills. In this company, I worked with a SaaS system and also contributed in the first offline product, designed for companies who have limited internet&nbsp;access.</p><p>After my full-stack developer position in the SaaS company, I worked as an RPA developer for an oil company. In this experience, I learned a lot about the oil business and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>My most recent position was at a bank working as a Python developer — I was assigned to create end-of-day reports that indicated profit and losses for traders. Overall, this was a really exciting job since it was my first time as a Python developer.</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I first got involved in crypto about a year ago, messing around with the basics. What really intrigued me with this space, was the fundamental concept of crypto. Particularly with decentralized finance, and how we could take ownership of our own financial assets. And after some time I started ‘playing’ with crypto to learn about it, which is what ultimately led me to get this&nbsp;job.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>The first thing that made me interested in BlockWallet was the idea of preserving privacy in a decentralized ecosystem. By simply having someone’s wallet address, you are able to track their entire Web3 footprint due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. And while there are certain levels of transparency we cannot avoid, BlockWallet provides the tools to help remain private on public&nbsp;chains.</p><p>The second thing was the team. After doing a couple of interviews, I quickly realized the quality of people that are working here and I knew it was going to be a great experience.</p><p>Accepting the offer was a no-brainer. Cutting-edge privacy technology, a fantastic team, and the opportunity to work in&nbsp;Web3.</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Privacy is vital in each aspect of our life, so why should be different in Web3? In fact, it should matter more because of how your entire financial history is accessible on the blockchain. If someone can link your wallet address to your actual identity, it’s equivalent to accessing your entire bank account&nbsp;history!</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>5 years from now, I believe crypto technology will be engrained into every part of our lives. Even for the ones that don’t believe in crypto or think it’s a scam. It’ll be similar to the internet where you don’t have a choice — everything will be built on blockchains.</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m really happy to be part of the BlockWallet team and the amazing community that we’ve built. I can’t wait to see what the future&nbsp;holds.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy often translates to security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature helps you combat phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet/meet-our-new-hire-martin-lecam-front-end-developer-43d7b87e5db7">Meet our new hire — Martin Lecam, Front-End Developer</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/blockwallet">BlockWallet</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

reddot winner 2022: interface design<p>Web2, even with all its problems, got a lot of things right. It set the tone for a high standard of User Experience (UX). For the masses to move over to Web3, we need to mirror what people have come to expect from online: smooth, stunning, enjoyable experiences.</p><p>Given the technical world of Web3 with its own language of acronyms, memes and slang, simplified design is more important than ever. <a href="https://www.excited.agency/works/verida">Excited</a>, Verida’s design agency, winning the Red Dot Award is a step forward in making Web3 more accessible and accepted.</p> The coveted Red&nbsp;Dot <p>The <a href="https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot">Red Dot Design Award</a> is an international design competition that best distinguishes business activities through excellent design. The award is judged on three disciplines: Product Design, Communication Design, and Design&nbsp;Concept.</p><p>Running since 1955, the award originally highlighted works in industrial design. As the design world has evolved, so has the award. Today, it celebrates new expertise such as UX and UI design. The esteemed winners are deemed the best in the business.</p>The Verida&nbsp;Vault The award-winning Verida Vault&nbsp;design <p><a href="https://www.excited.agency/">Excited</a>, a product design agency based in Ukraine, have worked with Verida since 2019. Their two main projects include designing the website and Verida Vault — the work that won them the coveted 2022 Red&nbsp;Dot.</p><p>“The judges look for work with consumer appeal — an interesting design approach, a problem worth solving or something that looks new and unique,” said Oleksandr Perelotov, Excited’s Design Director and Co-Founder.</p><p>Perelotov said there was a strong education piece involved in designing Web3 products.</p><blockquote>“This is still very new technology. It was different from designing an e-commerce project, where there’s an abundance of examples. What we found helpful was putting real-life examples to abstract ideas. For example, while envisioning the data requests or data sharing, we created a Covid vaccination certificate.”</blockquote><p>Designing to solve real-world problems and improve the lives of end users obviously worked. We share this sentiment at&nbsp;Verida.</p> Enjoyable, personalized online experiences <p>Our mission is to empower users to own and control their personal data. To transfer the power from institutions to individuals. It’s not just an era where data is consensual and self-sovereign.</p><p>We’re building on this to create new products and services to enhance our lives through wonderful, hyper-personalized digital experiences.</p><p>To achieve this, Web3 apps need to offer the standard of UX that people are used to today. Excited gets this — you can <a href="https://www.excited.agency/works/verida">see it in their&nbsp;designs</a>.</p><blockquote>“It’s an honor to have our name and blockchain data wallet attached to such a notable award. We hope Excited’s incredible design work sets the tone for bold, beautiful, yet friendly and non-threatening UX/UI in Web3,” said Verida CEO, Chris&nbsp;Were.</blockquote><p>This is the fourth Red Dot Award for Excited.

<p>An update on the tokenomics of the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Nym is a decentralised privacy mixnet. The Nym mixnet has an associated NYM utility token that grants usage rights to the privacy&nbsp;network.</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-cryptoecon-paper.pdf">tokenomics of the Nym mixnet</a> is intended to incentivise people to provide privacy, rather than surveillance.</p><p>Not only that, the tokenomics has been designed and engineered to incentivise good privacy protections: the better the service in terms of mixing packets, the better the reputation of a mix node in Nym will be in the overall infrastructure. In essence, Nym serves a ‘reputation’ token for mixnetworks.</p><p>Recap on token milestones</p><p>A total supply of one billion NYM tokens was generated on the decentralised mainnet Nyx chain in February 2022. The NYM token comes in two flavours: Native tokens on the Cosmos ecosystem (used within the privacy infra) and ERC20 tokens - as much software does not include support for Cosmos, so a bridge allows them to be ‘wrapped’ as ERC tokens. Transfer between the two versions is done via <a href="https://www.gravitybridge.net/">Gravity Bridge</a>. Currently 50M tokens are&nbsp;ERC20.</p><p>On 9 February 2022, 75M NYM was listed on <a href="https://coinlist.co/nym">CoinList</a> and the tokens were issued on 14 April&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The NYM token is now listed on several exchanges — <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nym/markets/">see full list&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Launch until&nbsp;now</p><p>The NYM mainnet was launched in January 2022 with a healthy 480 nodes operating as of now (240 nodes per epoch). Applications via Nym Connect are available <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/docs/nym-connect/">here</a>. Staking is enabled and approximately 40M tokens are currently staked.</p><p>Since the Mainnet release approximately 3M tokens have been distributed from the mixmining pool to our worldwide community of mix node operators (vs the budget of approximately 20M&nbsp;tokens).</p><p>The first tranche of team and investor tokens were distributed in August 2022. While we have seen a healthy increase in staking resulting from the release of liquid tokens, we have so far been able to keep the staking parameters the same, subject to weekly&nbsp;reviews.</p><p>Recent industry happenings</p>  Wintermute is one of the market-neutral market-makers that focus on NYM tokens. While there was an interruption to Wintermute services due to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/09/20/profanity-may-be-the-cause-of-crypto-trading-firm-wintermutes-160-million-hack/?sh=46b7fa6d57d9">a hack</a> that led to some real problems the last few days, as of 21 September, everything is back in order and stabilised.  The Ethereum Merge was successfully completed on 15 September. There was a short pause on Gravity Bridge where ERC20 NYM tokens were not able to be bridged to Cosmos SDK and vice&nbsp;versa.  <p>We understand that our community has asked for a regular update on the circulating supply. Please note that we are working on making an endpoint available to external service providers and will provide more&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Take note</p><p>No one should purchase NYM tokens for financial gain or speculation. NYM tokens should only be used within the Nym mixnet. Again, NYM is a utility token not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency. For investment purposes, do not use NYM tokens but instead look into other investment vehicles.</p><p>NYM tokens are required to use the mixnet or run a mix node. Check your delegations to see how the mix node is performing. If your nodes are over-saturated, you might want to redelegate!

         Sam Bankman-Fried Has a Savior Complex—And Maybe You Should Too                <p>By Adam Fisher</p><p>Photography: SASHA ARUTYUNOVA</p><p>Published September 22, 2022</p>            <p>The founder of FTX lives his life by a calculus of altruistic impact.</p>       



 
 
   
Listen to this article



<p></p>



<p>Every startup has a startup story. Apple was two hackers in a Los Altos garage. Google was two grad students in a Stanford dorm room. Alameda Research was just one guy in a Berkeley apartment, making a single cryptocurrency trade. That guy was Sam Bankman-Fried, or SBF to his friends. Yet the trade he made, which eventually led to the crypto-trading platform FTX, is far from the standard Silicon Valley creation tale. In 2017, when he was merely 25, SBF collapsed the so-called kimchi premium, an anomalous delta between the price of Bitcoin in much of Asia and its price in the rest of the world. It was a daring feat of arbitrage—SBF is the only trader known to have pulled this off in any meaningful way—one which quickly made him a billionaire and achieved the status of legend.</p>



<p>Among Wall Street’s financial elite, SBF’s Bitcoin arb is mentioned in the same hushed tones as Paul Tudor Jones’s 1987 shorting of the entire American economy, or George Soros’s 1992 raid on the Bank of England, or John Paulson’s 2008 bet against subprime mortgages. Alameda’s capture of the kimchi premium (and other trades like it) gave SBF the grubstake he needed for his next move: founding the crypto exchange FTX—a company that&nbsp; may very well end up creating the dominant all-in-one financial super-app of the future. Nothing is a sure bet in crypto, but just the possibility that FTX could join—or even eclipse—the big four of American banking (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citibank) means it’s already valued at $32 billion. SBF himself has amassed more wealth in a shorter period of time than anyone else, ever. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/">2022 Forbes Billionaires List</a> pegs SBF’s net worth at $24 billion. He’s now 30 years old. But we get ahead of ourselves.</p>



<p>SBF learned to trade at Jane Street, an under-the-radar high-frequency trading shop in New York’s financial district. The firm recruits from the smartest students in math and physics at MIT. SBF, a physics major at MIT, had interned at Jane Street in the summer of 2013 and was one of the few such recruits invited back for a full-time job. He was put to work as a market maker trading global ETFs—more difficult than simply making a market for a single stock, in the same way Tri-Dimensional Chess is more difficult than the bog-standard variety.</p>



<p>Not long before interning at Jane Street, SBF had a meeting with Will MacAskill, a young Oxford-educated philosopher who was then just completing his PhD. Over lunch at the Au Bon Pain outside Harvard Square, MacAskill laid out the principles of effective altruism (EA). The math, MacAskill argued, means that if one’s goal is to optimize one’s life for doing good, often most good can be done by choosing to make the most money possible—in order to give it all away. “Earn to give,” urged MacAskill.</p>



<p>EA traces its roots to philosopher Peter Singer, who reasons from the utilitarian point of view that the purpose of life is to maximize the well-being of others. Singer, in his eighth decade, may well be the most-read living philosopher. In the 1970s, Singer almost single-handedly created the animal rights movement, popularizing veganism as an ethical solution to the moral horror of meat. Today he’s best known for the drowning-child thought experiment. (What would you do if you came across a young child drowning in a pond?) Singer states the obvious—and then universalizes the underlying principle: “Few could stand by and watch a child drown; many can ignore the avoidable deaths of children in Africa or India. The question, however, is not what we usually do, but what we ought to do.” In a nutshell, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_You_Can_Save">Singer argues</a> that it’s a moral imperative of the world’s well-off to give as much as possible—10, 20, even 50 percent of all income—to better the lives of the world’s poor.</p>



<p>MacAskill’s contribution is to combine Singer’s moral logic with the logic of finance and investment. One not only has an obligation to give a significant percentage of income away, MacAskill argues, but to give it away as efficiently as possible. And, since every charity claiming to save lives has a budget, they can all be ranked by cost-effectiveness. So, how much does it cost for a charity to save a single life? The data says that controlling the spread of malaria and worms has the biggest bang for the buck, with a life saved per every $2,000 invested. Effective altruism prioritizes this low-hanging fruit—these are the drowning children we’re morally obligated to save first.</p>

Effective Altruism founder will macaskill

<p>Though EA originated at Oxford, it has found most of its traction in the Bay Area. Such fixtures in the Silicon Valley firmament as Dustin Moskovitz and Reid Hoffman have publicly endorsed the idea, as have tech oracles like Eric Drexler and Aubrey de Grey. The EA rank and file draws from the rationalist movement, a loose intellectual confederation of scruffy, young STEM-oriented freethinkers who typically (or, perhaps, stereotypically) blog about rationality and live gender-fluid, polycurious lifestyles in group houses in Berkeley and Oakland.</p>



<p>SBF is from the Bay Area—the eldest son of two Stanford law professors, Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried. His parents raised him and his siblings utilitarian—in the same way one might be brought up Unitarian—amid dinner-table debates about the greatest good for the greatest number. One of SBF’s formative moments came at age 12, when he was weighing arguments, pro and con, around the abortion debate. A rights-based theorist might argue that there aren’t really any discontinuous differences as a fetus becomes a child (and thus fetus murder is essentially child murder). The utilitarian argument compares the consequences of each. The loss of an actual child’s life—a life in which a great deal of parental and societal resources have been invested—is much more consequential than the loss of a potential life, in utero. And thus, to a utilitarian, abortion looks more like birth control than like murder. SBF’s application of utilitarianism helped him resolve some nagging doubts he had about the ethics of abortion. It made him comfortable being pro-choice—as his friends, family, and peers were. He saw the essential rightness of his philosophical faith.</p>



<p>Highly mathletic, SBF breezed through Crystal Springs Uplands, an elite prep school in Hillsborough, California. Though he earned top marks, he kept to himself, spending most of his free time playing computer games (StarCraft, League of Legends) and a trading card game, Magic: The Gathering. But at MIT he found his tribe: fellow pledges at Epsilon Theta, a coed fraternity of supergeeks similarly interested in Magic, and video games. Thetans are <a href="https://web.mit.edu/thetans/www/about.html">fond</a> of debating math, physics, computer science, linguistics, philosophy and logic problems—for fun—at alcohol-free parties.</p>



<p>It was his fellow Thetans who introduced SBF to EA and then to MacAskill, who was, at that point, still virtually unknown. MacAskill was visiting MIT in search of volunteers willing to sign on to his earn-to-give program. At a café table in Cambridge, Massachusetts, MacAskill laid out his idea as if it were a business plan: a strategic investment with a return measured in human lives. The opportunity was big, MacAskill argued, because, in the developing world, life was still unconscionably cheap. Just do the math: At $2,000 per life, a million dollars could save 500 people, a billion could save half a million, and, by extension, a trillion could theoretically save half a billion humans from a miserable death.</p>



<p>MacAskill couldn’t have hoped for a better recruit. Not only was SBF raised in the Bay Area as a utilitarian, but he’d already been inspired by Peter Singer to take moral action. During his freshman year, SBF went vegan and organized a campaign against factory farming. As a junior, he was wondering what to do with his life. And MacAskill—Singer’s philosophical heir—had the answer: The best way for him to maximize good in the world would be to maximize his wealth.</p>



<p>SBF listened, nodding, as MacAskill made his pitch. The earn-to-give logic was airtight. It was, SBF realized, applied utilitarianism. Knowing what he had to do, SBF simply said, “Yep. That makes sense.” But, right there, between a bright yellow sunshade and the crumb-strewn red-brick floor, SBF’s purpose in life was set: He was going to get filthy rich, for charity’s sake. All the rest was merely execution risk.</p>



<p>His course established, MacAskill gave SBF one last navigational nudge to set him on his way, suggesting that SBF get an internship at Jane Street that summer.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In 2017, everything was going great for SBF. He was killing it at Jane Street. He was a trader’s trader: so fluent with transactions that others would come watch him work, like one might watch an esports athlete streaming on Twitch. He was giving away 50 percent of his income to his preferred charities, with the biggest donations going to the Centre for Effective Altruism and 80,000 Hours. Both charities focus on building the earn-to-give idea into a movement. (And both had been founded by Will MacAskill a few years before.) He had good friends, mostly fellow EAs. Some were even colleagues. Jane Street was a great place to work, with an enviable corporate culture, plenty of perks, and some of the most generous pay packages in the industry. SBF had launched himself on a trajectory that would make him a very wealthy man. He was extremely happy at Jane Street—and content to stay there forever.</p>



<p>Still, when SBF analyzed the bright future that lay before him, something wasn’t right. He was, he realized, too secure. SBF’s mind had been trained almost from birth to calculate. As a schoolboy the hedonic calculous of utilitarianism had him trying to maximize the utility function (measured in “utils,” of course) for abortion. During his teenage gaming years, his mathematical abilities allowed him to sharpen his tactics—and win. And, of course, every trade SBF ever made at Jane was the subject of a risk/reward calculation. All of it boiled down to expected value. The formula is fairly simple. If the amount won multiplied by the probability of winning a bet is greater than the amount lost multiplied by the probability of losing a bet, then you go for it—irrespective of units. Utils, euros, dollars were all subject to the same reckoning.</p>



<p>But, at Jane, SBF osmosed another trading principle. He learned to be “risk-neutral”: In simple terms, a trader, given a choice between $50 and a 50 percent chance at $100, must be agnostic if they want to maximize the expected value of earnings over a lifetime. Those who prefer the sure win are “risk-averse,” and those who would rather gamble are “risk-lovers.” But both risk-lovers and the risk-averse are suckers, equally. Because, over the long run, they lose out to the risk-neutral, who take both deals without prejudice.</p>



<p>Here, SBF realized, was the rub: When he applied this principle to his own life, he came up short. There was little chance he’d get himself fired from Jane Street. Thus the decision to stick with Jane was a risk-averse preference. It was the logical equivalent of being offered a choice between $50 and 50 percent of $100, and saying, “Give me President Grant.” SBF was risk-neutral on behalf of Jane Street, but not, he realized, for his own life. To be fully rational about maximizing his income on behalf of the poor, he should apply his trading principles across the board. He had to find a risk-neutral career path—which, if we strip away the trader-jargon, actually means he felt he needed to take on a lot more risk in the hopes of becoming part of the global elite. The math couldn’t be clearer. Very high risk multiplied by dynastic wealth trumps low risk multiplied by mere rich-guy wealth. To do the most good for the world, SBF needed to find a path on which he’d be a coin toss away from going totally bust.</p>



<p>Pressed on how he justified the decision to gamble with his future, SBF turns the question around, imagining a world where operating this way is commonplace. In that world, “There’s a thousand of you. Some of you are going to do good, but the starving child doesn’t give a shit about which person it is who does that good. So why are you concerned about this little term in the equation?” To be clear: that “little term” in SBF’s equation is “you”—in other words, the specific person who saves the starving child. SBF is making a distinction between the selfish desire to be a savior and the selfless desire that children be saved—and choosing selflessness. “Obviously, I care about impact,” he says, and by “impact” he means “maximizing the overall chance that someone saves the child.” Thus, logically, it follows that “I am risk-neutral on overall impact.”</p>



<p>In the wake of this epiphany, SBF gave his notice. Caroline Ellison, a friend and colleague who was trading on the equities desk at Jane Street during that time, remembers the moment well. “It was unusual,” she says, “because he decided to quit—not to do anything in particular, but just under the premise that there were a lot of other options out there.”</p>



<p>SBF made a list of possible options, with some notes about each:</p>



  Journalism—low pay, but a massively outsized impact potential.  Running for office—or maybe just being an advisor?  Working for the movement—EA needs people!  Starting a startup—but what, exactly?  Bumming around the Bay Area for a month or so—just to see what happens.  



<p>“They all felt kind of compelling,” he remembers, “and I had no idea which was going to be the best.” But he also knew that the only losing choice was to not make a choice, so he closed his eyes and walked through door number five.</p>



<p>That’s when Caroline Ellison lost track of her friend.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Ellison is a freckle-faced redhead with a personality that splits the difference between bubbly and nerd-ball. She’s partial to a pair of designer frames that make her look a bit like Edna Mode, the superhero stylist in The Incredibles.</p>



<p>About six months after SBF dropped out, Jane Street sent Ellison on a recruiting trip to California, so she decided to call on her old friend. They’d been office buddies at Jane, but they’d also occasionally socialized outside of work, too, being fellow EA acolytes. Ellison wanted to catch up, but from the get-go, SBF was acting uncharacteristically shifty. There were several canceled coffee dates, and when the two finally did get together—at Jumpin’ Java, an old-school Berkeley coffeehouse with hand-painted murals on the wall and whimsical art in the windows—SBF evaded even the most innocuous of questions.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“So,” Ellison asked after joining SBF at a table, “what have you been up to in the&nbsp; last few months?” Ellison, it should be noted, was dressed as a sultry wood nymph—she was on her way to a LARP (Live Action Role Play) party.</p>



<p>“Oh,” SBF responded cryptically, “I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.”</p>



<p>“Okay, that’s fine,” Ellison said, sipping her tea.</p>



<p>Uncomfortable silence.</p>



<p>“Well, I guess I could tell you if you really want…” SBF offered after a moment.</p>



<p>“Nope. It’s okay.” Sip.</p>



<p>An awkward beat later, SBF broke, slayed by the silent force of Ellison’s four-eyed gaze.</p>



<p>“I’ll just tell you,” he said.</p>



<p>The story was pretty remarkable. After SBF quit Jane Street, he moved back home to the Bay Area, where Will MacAskill had offered him a job as director of business development at the Centre for Effective Altruism. He rented a modest apartment near CEA HQ in Berkeley, he still had a couple of weeks to just explore before his job started. This was his first vacation in, well, ever. In the years working at Jane, SBF had never taken any significant time off.</p>



<p>He spent his vacation just soaking everything in: It was his first time in the Bay Area as an adult, and he found his home turf unexpectedly thrilling. It was where all the new technology was. It was where all the startups were. It was where the bulk of the EA community was starting to congregate. SBF ended up hanging out a lot with his younger brother Gabe, who was living in an EA commune on nearby Stuart Street.</p>



<p>At that time, everyone in the tech world was talking about crypto. In the Bay Area, you couldn’t escape the chatter. The crypto community had been roiled by a “hard fork” earlier in the year, when what had been known simply as Bitcoin underwent a mitosis to become Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Cash. Later that year, Bitcoin (Classic) looked like it was going to cross the psychologically important $10,000 mark. Crypto was becoming a thing.</p>



<p>Curious, SBF had started looking into crypto—and almost immediately noticed something strange. Bitcoin was trading at a higher price in Japan and Korea than it was in the U.S. In theory, this should never happen because it represents a riskless profit opportunity—in other words, a free lunch. One simply buys Bitcoin at the lower price, sells it at the higher price, and pockets the difference. Jane Street built an empire on high-frequency trades that took advantage of fraction-of-a-cent price differences. But here was Bitcoin, trading at around $15,000 in South Korea: an unheard-of 50 percent price premium.</p>



<p>SBF was incredulous at the numbers he was seeing on his screen. This is probably not real. But then came the second thought: If it is real, then there’s $5,000 just lying on the ground. Instead of wasting time on internal debate, SBF decided to create some accounts on different exchanges and see if he could execute the trade. He couldn’t. But, interestingly, it wasn’t because the arbitrage opportunity wasn’t there—it was. But there was so much red tape with the banking system and currency controls that it was a difficult trade to execute.</p>



<p>Another day of work dealing with the red-tape problem netted SBF a single round-trip trade—to Asia and back—for a $20 profit. That was it: the proof of concept. There was an opportunity to be had. SBF immediately put $50,000 of his own money to work. The first job was just getting the money into the system. The operational challenges were huge. Not just anyone can walk into a foreign bank and start wiring money out of the country every day. There are know-your-customer rules, caps on withdrawals, citizenship requirements. Even worse, to any normal bank, the constant zeroing out, then maxing out, of a cash account—with the money coming and going overseas, to and from fly-by-night Bitcoin exchanges—raised every red flag in the book. It looked like laundering. It looked like drug money. There were even monetary policy concerns: The liquidity of the South Korean won is sharply limited by the country’s central bank.</p>



<p>Fortunately, SBF had a secret weapon: the EA community. There’s a loose worldwide network of like-minded people who do each other favors and sleep on each other’s couches simply because they all belong to the same tribe. Perhaps the most important of them was a Japanese grad student, who volunteered to do the legwork in Japan. As a Japanese citizen, he was able to open an account with the one (obscure, rural) Japanese bank that was willing, for a fee, to process the transactions that SBF—newly incorporated as Alameda Research—wanted to make. The spread between Bitcoin in Japan and Bitcoin in the U.S. was “only” 10 percent—but it was a trade Alameda found it could make every day. With SBF’s initial $50,000 compounding at 10 percent each day, the next step was to increase the amount of capital. At the time, the total daily volume of crypto trading was on the order of a billion dollars. Figuring he wanted to capture 5 percent of that, SBF went looking for a $50 million loan. Again, he reached out to the EA community. Jaan Tallinn, the cofounder of Skype, put up a good chunk of that initial $50 million.</p>

<p></p>



<p>With a goosed-up capital account, the money started piling up so fast that SBF placed what he refers to as “a market order for employees” to tend to the Rube Goldberg operation that kept the capital spinning. There were constant blowups with banks, which are wary of anything crypto. Crypto was so new that regulators in South Korea and elsewhere were constantly changing their mind about regulations—then making those changes retroactive. It was a swirling mess. Pulled into the vortex was Nishad Singh, a friend of SBF’s brother Gabe, and a fellow EA member. Singh is a bespectacled and baby-faced young man with an earnest mien. He often wears a T-shirt with the words “compassionate to the core” printed, in a diminutive all-lowercase font, over his heart. After just one conversation with SBF, Singh decided to leave Facebook to take on the more meaningful work of building FTX. Caroline Ellison came, too, quitting Jane Street and moving to California only weeks after SBF described the operation to her over tea. The first 15 people SBF hired, all from the EA pool, were packed together in a shabby, 600-square-foot walk-up, working around the clock. The kitchen was given over to stand-up desks, the closet was reserved for sleeping, and the entire space overrun with half-eaten take-out containers. It was a royal mess. But it was also the good old days, when Alameda was just kids on a high-stakes, big-money, earn-to-give commando operation. Fifty percent of Alameda’s profits were going to EA-approved charities.</p>



<p>“This thing couldn’t have taken off without EA,” reminisces Singh, running his hand through a shock of thick black hair. He removes his glasses to think. They’re broken: A chopstick has been Scotch taped to one of the frame’s sides, serving as a makeshift temple. “All the employees, all the funding—everything was EA to start with.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The Bitcoin arbitrage didn’t—and couldn’t—last forever. The Japanese appetite for overpriced Bitcoin withered (or, more likely, another shadowy arbitrage outfit also found its way to the trade and collapsed it). Either way, the spread narrowed to almost nothing. But there were other trades to be had. The simple fact that crypto was new, and that the tools traders needed to handle it were still under construction, meant that there were market inefficiencies all over the place. And behind every market inefficiency is an arbitrage opportunity.</p>



<p>The biggest headache for Alameda wasn’t finding the opportunities, but executing the trades. At that time, when it came to crypto exchanges, the choice basically boiled down to Coinbase or Binance. Coinbase makes a point of being regulated by authorities in the U.S., but as a consequence, didn’t offer the kinds of options contracts and derivatives professional traders need to hedge their bets. Binance, on the other hand, offered the kinds of derivatives SBF was familiar with when he traded for Jane Street—but as a company, it was continually moving from country to country in an attempt to evade all jurisdictional authority. Neither exchange was particularly good to trade on.</p>



<p>“Everything was rickety—there was no avoiding the ricketiness. Obviously, the line between rickety and shady is a little unclear at times, but the places that seemed like they were going to steal customer funds outright, we didn’t touch,” Singh says. “Even the best players in the space were having big problems.”</p>



<p>At this point, mid-2019, SBF decided to double down again—and scratch his own itch. He would bet Alameda’s multimillion-dollar trading profits on a new venture: a trading exchange called FTX. It would combine Coinbase’s stolid, regulation-loving approach with the kinds of derivatives being offered by Binance and others. He only gave himself a 20 percent chance of success, but, in his mind, SBF needed extreme risk to maximize the expected value of his lifetime earnings—and, therefore, the good his earn-to-give strategy could do. The fact that he was, by his own lights, overwhelmingly likely to fail was beside the point.</p>



<p>The point was this: When SBF multiplied out the billions of dollars a year a successful crypto-trading exchange could throw off by his self-assessed 20 percent chance of successfully building one, the number was still huge. That’s the expected value. And if you live your life according to the same principles by which you’d trade an asset, there’s only one way forward: You calculate the expected values, then aim for the largest one—because, in one (but just one) alternate future universe, everything works out fabulously. To maximize your expected value, you must aim for it and then march blindly forth, acting as if the fabulously lucky SBF of the future can reach into the other, parallel, universes and compensate the failson SBFs for their losses. It sounds crazy, or perhaps even selfish—but it’s not. It’s math. It follows from the principle of risk-neutrality.</p>



<p>“I think it’s hard to justify being risk-averse on your own personal impact,” SBF told me when I quizzed him about it—“unless you’re doing it for personal reasons.” In other words, it’s selfish not to go for broke—if you’re planning on giving it all away in the end anyway.</p>



<p>And, with that, he moved the nascent company to Hong Kong, a jurisdiction with a crypto-friendly regulatory regime. Hong Kong also happens to be conveniently located next door to the country that, at the time, had the largest and most enthusiastic crypto user base in the world: China.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>As Covid-19 descended, Michelle Bailhe, a young gun at Sequoia Capital, and veteran partner Alfred Lin were starting to closely examine the crypto space. Lin, a no-nonsense workaholic if there ever was one, had little patience for the kind of utopianism that motivated the first wave of cryptopians. Lin’s intellect was tempered in graduate school at Stanford, where he studied statistics and price options, swaps, and derivatives. And when he thought about crypto, the question he asked himself was: What is it good for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, crypto eventually could replace money, and, yes, it can eventually decentralize the web,” Lin says with a dismissive wave of his hand. “But all those things are not true today. And, so, what is the thing that people do today? They trade. And if people trade, and people like trading, what is the business model that will make tons of money? It would be an exchange.”</p>



<p>Bailhe spent months researching the space full time, focusing her energies on the exchanges. She met with every founder and every company that would have her. And she built a map—a landscape, as such a document is called at Sequoia—of the entire market.</p>



<p>“Of the exchanges that we had met and looked at, some of them had regulatory issues, some of them were already public,” Bailhe says. “And then there was Sam.” The exchange that SBF had started to build, FTX, was Goldilocks-perfect. There was no concerted effort to skirt the law, no Zuckerbergian diktat demanding that things be broken. And, yet, FTX wasn’t waiting to get permission to innovate. The company had based itself offshore precisely because it aspired to build an advanced risk engine that would support all sorts of hedging strategies. SBF himself seemed to be bred for the role of crypto exchange founder and CEO. Not only had he been a top trader at a top firm—and, thus, the ideal customer—but both his parents were lawyers. “And, so, he is committed to making the right chess moves for FTX to eventually be able to legally do everything they want to do in the U.S.,” Bailhe says—“not by asking forgiveness, but by asking permission.”</p>



<p>The problem, as Bailhe saw it, was that FTX didn’t appear to need any money. She was correct, but what she didn’t know was that SBF was starting to think about raising money anyway. Alameda had some unexpected losses due to so-called counterparty risk. Arbitrage is, in theory, riskless. But not when the rickety exchange you’re using to place your trades suddenly locks up and refuses to disburse your money. Or, worse yet, when two crypto exchanges can’t even agree on what a crypto transfer looks like, and so the act of sending crypto from one exchange to another results in tokens just disappearing into the ether. And don’t even ask about futures contracts that see their terms unilaterally changed mid-agreement: the dreaded “clawbacks.” Alameda was not immune to the exchange-level shenanigans that gave crypto as a whole its sleazy reputation. But FTX had an ambition to change that. It was built to be the exchange traders could count on. SBF needed to get the word out. He wanted FTX to be known as the respectable face of crypto. This required ad campaigns, sponsorship deals, a charitable wing—and a war chest to pay for it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX did need money, after all. And it needed that money from credible sources so it could continue to distinguish itself from the bottom-feeders who came to crypto to fleece the suckers. So, in the summer of 2021, when FTX started to raise its Series B from a who’s who of Silicon Valley VCs, Bailhe and Lin hit the “Don’t Panic” button. “Embarrassingly, we had never tried to reach out to Sam, because we figured he didn’t need us,” Bailhe admits. “I thought they were just minting money and had absolutely no need for investors.” Learning otherwise, they quickly contacted SBF and organized a last-minute Zoom call between him and the partners at Sequoia—at four California time on a hot July Friday afternoon. Bailhe was adamant, putting her reputation with the other partners on the line: “I’m like, ‘No, it’s worth it. Cancel your afternoon.’”</p>



<p>The Zoom went well for all concerned. SBF looked relaxed as he answered questions, talking, as he usually does, in complete paragraphs about topics of extreme complexity. Ramnik Arora, FTX’s head of product and another ex-Facebook engineer, remembers the meeting clearly: “We’re getting all these questions from Sequoia toward the end. He’s absolutely fantastic.” Arora locks eyes with me, and I am mesmerized. Arora is intense—calling to mind a Bollywood version of Adrian Brody. “Unbelievably fantastic,” he says, shaking his head.</p>



<p>Bailhe remembers it the same way: “We had a great meeting with Sam, but the last question, which I remember Alfred asking, was, ‘So, everything you’re building is great, but what is your long-term vision for FTX?’”</p>



<p>That’s when SBF told Sequoia about the so-called super-app: “I want FTX to be a place where you can do anything you want with your next dollar. You can buy bitcoin. You can send money in whatever currency to any friend anywhere in the world. You can buy a banana. You can do anything you want with your money from inside FTX.”</p>



<p>Suddenly, the chat window on Sequoia’s side of the Zoom lights up with partners freaking out.</p>



<p>“I LOVE THIS FOUNDER,” typed one partner.</p>



<p>“I am a 10 out of 10,” pinged another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“YES!!!” exclaimed a third.</p>



<p>What Sequoia was reacting to was the scale of SBF’s vision. It wasn’t a story about how we might use fintech in the future, or crypto, or a new kind of bank. It was a vision about the future of money itself—with a total addressable market of every person on the entire planet.</p>



<p>“I sit ten feet from him, and I walked over, thinking, Oh, shit, that was really good,” remembers Arora. “And it turns out that that fucker was playing League of Legends through the entire meeting.”</p>



<p>“We were incredibly impressed,” Bailhe says. “It was one of those your-hair-is-blown-back type of meetings.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not only that, Arora says, but League of Legends is the kind of multiplayer online battle arena video game where every four minutes or so of tactical maneuvering is punctuated by ten seconds of action known as a gank—gamer slang for “gang killing”—where you and your team gang up on an enemy. “There’s a fight that happens, basically,” says Arora, who was watching over SBF’s shoulder as he answered that final question from Sequoia, “and I’m like, This guy is fucking in a gank!”</p>



<p>The B round raised a billion dollars. Soon afterward came the “meme round”: $420.69 million from 69 investors.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>SBF took the money, and soon after moved FTX headquarters from Hong Kong to Nassau. Covid-19 was raging, and the city’s Beijing-inspired zero-Covid policy was making business in Hong Kong untenable. The Bahamas had more relaxed Covid rules and are only 20 minutes away by plane from the crypto industry that was starting to coalesce around Miami.</p>



<p>I fly out to see the company for myself in the spring of 2022. Walking through the terminal in Nassau, I happen to see a copy of The New York Times. The headline on the front page says it all: “As Cryptocurrencies Melt Down, $300 Billion Evaporates in Days.”</p>



<p>It’s a survey of what’s been happening in the crypto market. The price of Bitcoin had plunged to its lowest level since 2020. A so-called “stable coin” lost its peg and became worthless overnight. The price of Coinbase shares, a publicly traded rival of FTX’s, collapsed. The markets were in mayhem.</p>



<p>Next to the Times is a copy of The Nassau Guardian: Hurricane warnings, a record Omicron surge. This ought to be an interesting week, I think to myself.</p>

<p>The following Monday, I brave the flooded roads of New Providence to the FTX campus. It’s a Walmart-sized parking lot hacked out of the canebrake. FTX operations are housed in five 2,000-square-foot stucco-walled and steel-roofed pavilions: identical structures so new they look as if they’ve popped out of the parking lot like mushrooms after a rain.</p>



<p>The HQ building is distinguished by a reception desk in the microscopic lobby. The door is unlocked. There is no receptionist. I peek around the corner and into the FTX command center—29 desks in a room designed to hold 8, at most. Every desk touches two or three others. There are no aisles. To get across the room, you have to wade through (and, at times, climb over) a sea of office chairs. Walls of wide-screen monitors—two, four, even six per desk—stand in place of cubicle walls. The screens erupt like palm leaves from aluminum uprights and are oriented willy-nilly: up, down, sideways. Some screens are mounted so high they seem to hang down from the ceiling. It’s office environment as jungle, and the oddest thing about it is that no one seems to be home.</p>



<p>Then I hear a rustling. A nasal NorCal drawl rings out from the far corner of the room: “Yup… Yup… Yup…” Giggle. “Oh, totally.”</p>



<p>It’s SBF himself, working early—or late, as the case may be. I recognize the man because right beside his desk is a giant blue-velvet beanbag chair, which SBF famously uses as a napping spot during the weeks-long work binges when he doesn’t leave the office.</p>



<p>He’s on a Zoom call. And, from what I can overhear, he’s chatting with someone about acquiring shares of a competitor “How much do we have? How much can we buy? How much are we legally allowed to buy?”</p>



<p>It sounds like an important strategic conversation, and SBF’s questions come rat-a-tat with an overclocked diction I recognize from listening to too many podcasts at 2X. Yet, in the middle of it, he peers around his sheaf of liquid crystal to silently greet me with a big smile and an outstretched right hand while simultaneously making a wavy-pointy gesture with his left, which means “Have a seat over yonder.” He’s nothing if not efficient.</p>



<p>Over the next hour or so, people trickle in, and the room fills up. They’re all friendly, but also focused. They seem to be used to having a stranger in their midst. Word comes that there’s an all-hands meeting scheduled, and I’m invited. To my surprise, it turns out to be on Zoom—even though half the assembled audience is within ten feet of SBF. At the appointed hour, everyone switches on their screens and adjusts their cameras. SBF appears in the corner of the Zoom grid to talk about the situation at hand.</p>



<p>To sum up, much of the crypto world was panic-selling to try to get out ahead of the market, to make a margin call, or just out of plain old fear. And that volume hit FTX, since it’s a major exchange—the fifth-largest—in the crypto space. There’s really no good way to simulate such an event, but FTX’s trading platform held together under the strain. So SBF’s first order of business is to congratulate the dev crew for building a robust system: “Overall, I think the platform handled the crash relatively well, which is good. Thank you to everyone.”</p>



<p>There are some modest smiles in the Zoom windows, including one from Singh, FTX’s director of engineering. He knows firsthand, from his trading days at Alameda, how frustrating a rickety exchange can be. “As always, we have some changes to make going forward,” SBF says, “but nothing really huge.” The next order of business is a round of belt-tightening. “In general, money is going to be tighter for everyone in our industry and other industries too—it’s not super-crypto-specific,” SBF says. “So, if you are thinking about expenses that are, say, above $100 million, we should have a chat about that,” he continues. “That’s our new set of takeaways,” he says, wrapping up his portion of the meeting. “Oh, and yeah: Ten-second updates!”</p>



<p>With that, the floor is open. And indeed, various FTX execs take over the presenters’ mic, updating the company, in ten seconds or less, about what is going on.</p>



  FTX Stocks is now open for a private beta.  An independent FTX fan club has emerged: the FTT DAO.  Time-weighted average price functionality is being tested.  The sponsorship deals of the Met Gala and the amfAR Gala have been successful—so far.  The NBA Eastern Conference final starts tonight at the FTX Arena: the Miami Heat versus the Boston Celtics.  



<p>That last item is the only one that provokes any kind of comment from SBF: “Go, Heat!” he shouts.</p>



<p>All-hands adjourned. Total meeting time? Ten minutes.</p>



<p>I remark to the person sitting next to me that that was rather quick for an all-hands. “That was actually an unusually long one,” she says. “They’re usually five minutes.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I’m embedded in FTX headquarters—a reporter sitting at a desk ten feet away from SBF—for a full week. I interview people, take notes, hang out, and soak up the vibe. I was expecting pandemonium in the wake of the market collapse, but the atmosphere is almost relaxed—except for the fact that SBF just keeps working and working. He’s working when people arrive. He’s working when people leave. It’s Zoom after Zoom after Zoom, and, because SBF wears a headset, he’s literally plugged into his computer all day. The only time I ever see him unplug is to collapse on that supersized beanbag chair next to his desk for a catnap.&nbsp;</p>



SBF napping in Nassau



<p></p>



<p>At first blush, the scene is classic startup—the kitchen full of snacks and soda; the free catered breakfasts, lunches, and dinners; the company bathroom stocked with everything you’d need to actually live at the office: Q-tips, disposable razors, Kotex. In keeping with the fashion aesthetic of senior management, the dress code is marketing-swag-meets-utilitarian-merch: gift-bag T-shirts featuring the FTX logo, nylon athletic shorts, white-cotton gym socks.</p>



<p>But, as the week wears on, it’s the differences that start to stand out. FTX is not your ordinary startup. Most noticeable is the average age of the employees. Among senior management, SBF himself has just turned 30; Singh is 28; Arora is the old man of the group at 35. The company is also remarkably international. You hear the rapid-fire rhythm of Mandarin as often as English, but even that lingua franca comes in a wide variety of flavors—everything from a Bahamian lilt to the broken argot of ESL.</p>



<p>I often step out of the pressure cooker of FTX HQ and into the frying pan of the company parking lot—a macadam patch that fairly sizzles under the Bahamian sun—in order to stretch my legs. I meet a bunch of FTX employees that way. They’re taking walks, too. In general, the people I meet are overworked but happy. A few are overworked and unhappy—or at least too busy to be able to enjoy their good fortune. To a person, they’re unfailingly polite and helpful. FTX has a remarkable corporate culture, and, like the fashion choices on display, that comes right from the top. There’s a guilelessness, an openness, that makes for interesting conversations.</p>



<p>Can Sun, FTX’s in-house legal counsel, tells me that his main job is to cement the many deals SBF makes on a handshake. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, Sun says, the terms favor the other side. It’s another corporate policy derived from a rigorous logical argument: In an iterated prisoner’s dilemma, the best first move is always to cooperate. And, if the counterparty defects, “it’s better that I know this guy will screw me over now,” Sun says, “rather than later.”</p>



<p>A woman who helps run marketing for FTX (and who prefers to be anonymous), briefs me on the Crypto Bahamas event that took place the previous month. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton showed up, as did Michael Lewis, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom. Her mission is to try to broaden the brand’s appeal. “When I first joined, we had endorsement deals with Tom Brady, Steph Curry, Major League Baseball—it was like a frat house,” she says. “That’s why we signed the Naomi Osaka deal.”</p>



<p>Adam Jin, who’s in charge of strategic investments for FTX, tells me about one of his favorite Web3 projects, a health app called STEPN that comes with its own crypto wallet. “Once you download the app, you go to the marketplace and buy shoes,” Jin says, showing me his shoes—virtual sneakers—on the STEPN app. Jin must sense my confusion because he continues: “You can use the app without the shoes, but having the shoes will entitle you to earn tokens by walking around.”</p>



<p>STEPN is an example of the hottest new trend in crypto: the “play-to-earn” game. With STEPN, you have to make an upfront investment. Jin’s virtual shoes cost him $800 (although he paid in Sol, the cryptocurrency associated with the Solana network.) But Jin can get a return on his shoe investment by walking: STEPN will pay him back, in crypto naturally, for every kilometer he walks in them. The exact ROI depends on the ever-fluctuating rates between Sol and the STEPN in-game currency, as well as on shoe-maintenance costs. (I’m surprised to learn that virtual shoes do wear out and have to be replaced.) But focusing on what it takes to win the game is missing the point, according to Jin. “It changed my lifestyle,” he says, noting that he’s lost all of his pandemic weight since he started using the app: “I went five kilometers on my lunch break yesterday—just running around and being healthy.”</p>



<p>I kind of get it. STEPN adds motivation, in the form of money, to the usual boatload of reasons people have for getting fit. And, for some people, that’s the motivation they need to get out there and start exercising. Is this the killer app for crypto? I’m skeptical—until, several days later, the truth finally dawns on me. It’s not just Jin: Many—perhaps most—of the FTX employees I meet while walking around the parking lot are not simply on break, stretching their legs. They’re earning crypto, through their STEPN app.</p>



<p>At first I assumed that only the financial types who work in crypto could possibly be motivated by such convoluted carrots. But the FOMO hit me at about the same time that I realized that everyone except me was wearing invisible sneakers. I find myself—a non-financial type if there ever was one—getting drawn by the funny math of play-to-earn.</p>



<p>“Adam,” I say, intercepting Jin on one of his five-kilometer lunch walks, “since the STEPN app uses the GPS on your phone to track your movement, couldn’t I just give my phone to someone else to take my walks for me?”</p>



<p>Jin catches my drift without losing his stride. “Sure! You could pay someone 20 bucks to take your phone,” he says with a cheery agreeableness I now recognize as an FTX thing. “And then you would get paid for their steps.”</p>



<p>“It could be a good arb,” I observe.</p>



<p>“I’d get more healthy that way, too,” says Jin with a chuckle.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>I clock in at FTX HQ at nine and clock out at five for most of the week—until, one day, I’m invited to live in what amounts to the FTX dorms. Many employees take advantage of subsidized corporate housing at a nearby development called Albany. The heart of the development is a yacht basin and marina surrounded by half a dozen residential towers. The area is so new that several towers are still under construction. FTX owns a passel of the multi-bedroom apartments in the towers and rents them out as crash pads to employees. There’s a collegiate feel to the whole setup. Indeed, Albany could be mistaken for an institution of higher learning: Behind the gatehouse is everything you could ever ask for on a campus—restaurants, cafés, a health club, golf and tennis facilities and, of course, classrooms.</p>



<p>And what a campus! Albany is one of the most stunningly gorgeous places I’ve ever set foot in. The boat basin is filled with superyachts, megayachts, even a glittering gigayacht or two. The apartment towers that look down at the yachts below are, if it’s even possible, more immaculate than the boats. Befitting “serious architecture,” the buildings aren’t numbered but named: Squire, Tetris, Cube, Honeycomb, Lantern, Charles, Gemini, Orchid. Each was designed by a starchitect of note: Manhattan’s Morris Adjmi, the noted postmodernist, did two. The community markets itself as a second-home destination for wealthy young people—in other words, for pro athletes and pop stars. Cardi B has a place here, as does Steph Curry. Justin Timberlake and Tiger Woods are, nominally, the developers of the property. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the Albany amenity package includes a top-notch sports-training facility (with the only cryotherapy chamber in the Bahamas), as well as a state-of-the-art recording studio.</p>



<p>I’m quartered in an FTX-owned Tetris condo for a few nights. Each of the four bedrooms has an en suite bath, its own climate control and a stout panel door with its own lock and key—features that make each of the bedrooms feel like small hotel rooms. The common area is fronted with 26-foot-high glass walls that slide away to reveal a commanding balcony, complete with a sunken infinity edge pool. The kitchen is worthy of a private chef, and fully stocked (although, from the looks of it, no one has ever cooked a meal in it.)</p>



<p>As I fry up an omelet for myself—with an egg of uncertain age—my thoughts drift until they shoal in the lee of The Great Gatsby. The peerless American novel, written a century ago, seems especially relevant to the here and now: The Roaring Twenties are back, certainly. And I’ll be damned if Albany is not West Egg. But is crypto the new jazz? And, if it is, does that make Sam Bankman-Fried the new Jay Gatsby? Both are very young; both are self-made; in inflation-adjusted dollars, both are equally wealthy; and both are enigmatic in the extreme. On the other hand, the differences between Jay Gatsby and SBF are vast. Literary types still argue about just what motivates F. Scott Fitzgerald’s most memorable character—but one thing is certain: Altruism, effective or not, is not a factor. So, while SBF may be Gatsbian in some important ways, he’s no Gatsby. Still, I wonder if there isn’t a deeper resonance. A literary type myself, as I tuck into my solo meal, I find the novel’s closing lines tiptoeing into my consciousness:</p>



<p>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning—</p>



<p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</p>



<p>***</p>
   



   
meanwhile, FTX is hard at work…



<blockquote><p>I recognize the man because right beside his desk is a giant blue-velvet beanbag chair, which SBF famously uses as a napping spot during the weeks-long work binges when he doesn’t leave the office.</p></blockquote>



not as comfortable as a beanbag
   
 
 



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>The next day, I finally get a chance to interview Sam Bankman-Fried. We meet in a tiny conference room. I’m prepared with a mic and an MP3 recorder at the ready. SBF comes in with his laptop and opens it to start playing his new favorite computer game, Storybook Brawl, before he even sits down. It’s an obscure title, an “auto-battler”: an emerging genre that combines elements of trading card games (like Magic: The Gathering) with chesslike moves and strategy. The game was released only a few years ago by an equally obscure low-budget “indie” game company, Good Luck Games.</p>



<p>Though we’re face-to-face, SBF makes no eye contact at all—zero, not even a glance. His eyes are glued to his screen. His fingers are tapping on the keys, sometimes furiously, sometimes hardly at all. His right knee is bouncing at 100 bpm: a nervous tic, the result of a forgotten fidget spinner. The interview starts.</p>



<p>I open with a doozy: “Am I,” I ask, “talking to the world’s first trillionaire?”</p>



<p>Although it’s admittedly a stupid question, it’s not as stupid as it sounds. SBF has a net worth, as estimated by Forbes, that’s higher than the vast majority (80 percent) of the world’s billionaires—and, yet, he’s only gotten started. FTX is a company in its infancy.</p>



<p>I first tried out the trillionaire question on Michelle Bailhe, the Sequoia partner who, along with Lin, knows SBF and his company the best. “It’s a juicy question,” she said, wavering for a moment while calculating the odds. “I think he has a real chance at that.”</p>



<p>There’s no such hesitation from SBF. But he does quickly demur, making self-deprecating mouth noises questioning his own capacity to make such a pile, before he really starts to answer.</p>



<p>“Maybe let’s take a step back,” he says, only to launch into an explanation of his own, personal utility curve: “Which is to say, if you plot dollars-donated on the X axis, and Y is how-much-good-I-do-in-the-world, then what does that curve look like? It’s definitely not linear—it does tail off, but I think it tails off pretty slowly.”</p>



<p>His point seems to be that there is, out there somewhere, a diminishing return to charity. There’s a place where even effective altruism ceases to be effective. “But I think that, even at a trillion, there’s still really significant marginal utility to dollars donated.”</p>



<p>This interview has morphed into my own personal economics seminar, and Professor Bankman-Fried is my tutor. He’s as good at explaining the principles of macroeconomics as anyone out there in the world today—and I know this for a fact because I’ve subsequently watched YouTube’s best on the same subject. But SBF teaches me Macro while simultaneously playing round after round of Storybook Brawl.</p>



<p>Still, I’ve got my answer. And it turns out that I’ve aimed too low. A trillion isn’t enough money to fix the world’s problems, so SBF won’t stop at merely a trillion. It’s an answer that begs the next question, which SBF, ever helpful, has already anticipated: “So, is five trillion all you could ever use to help the world?”</p>



<p>SBF is now interviewing himself. He slows down for a moment, and I assume that’s because of the cognitive load of doing three things at once. He’s asking good questions (my job); he’s formulating answers (his job); and he’s playing Storybook Brawl (no one’s job). But then I hear the tap-tap-tapping from his fingers start to accelerate, and I realize he’s not slowing down under the load at all. Just the opposite, in fact: This guy is in the Storybook Brawl equivalent of a gank!</p>



<p>And, just like that, he’s back with an answer to his own question: “Okay, at that scale, I think the answer might be yes. Because, if your spending is on the scale of the U.S. government, it might have too weird and distortionary an impact on things.”</p>



<p>Now that we’ve explored the far end of SBF’s utility curve, the seminar moves to a discussion of discount rates. “The world is decaying at—we’re all making it up—but, say, 5 percent a year as a minimum bound,” he says. “And compare that to the effective interest rate which I’m working under—which you can think of as the rate we can turn more capital into more capital—which is more like 20 percent a year,” he continues, “and that’s likely true for a while, so it makes sense for me to keep working.”</p>



<p>All this is still with not even a glance at me—his true focus is on the screen. He’s playing the video game. But, to be fair, perhaps “playing” is the wrong word here. Perhaps he was play-testing: looking for ways to incorporate crypto into his favorite game because, unbeknownst to me at the time, as we were talking, Good Luck, the indie game company behind Storybook Brawl, was being absorbed into the FTX empire—the latest in a string of FTX acquisitions.</p>



<p>“But that doesn’t mean we can’t also be giving during that time,” he continues. “And we are starting to scale that up.”</p>



<p>This strikes me as typical SBF understatement. The scale of his giving, even now, before he has really started to divest, is massive. Alameda Research, the company that generated the FTX grubstake, still exists, and its purpose seems to be to generate profits—on the order of $100 million a year today, but potentially up to a billion—that can be stuffed into the brand-new FTX Foundation. Similarly, even now, 1 percent of net FTX fees are donated to that same foundation, and FTX handles nearly $5 billion dollars’ worth of trades per day. The foundation, in turn, gives to a diversified group of EA-approved charities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you might expect, having read this far, there’s a reason for doling out some cash now instead of doubling down in the expectation of giving more later, and the reason hinges on math. Simply put, there are aspects of the world, as SBF sees it, that are decaying faster than 20 percent a year—and, so, money spent now will be more effective at making the world a better place than money spent later. “I think there are some things that are pretty urgent,” SBF says. “There’s just a long series of crucial considerations, and all of them matter a lot—and you can’t fuck any of them up, or you miss most of the total value that you could ever get.”</p>



<p>To be clear, SBF is not talking about maximizing the total value of FTX—he’s talking about maximizing the total value of the universe. And his units are not dollars: In a kind of GDP for the universe, his units are the units of a utilitarian. He’s maximizing utils, units of happiness. And not just for every living soul, but also every soul—human and animal—that will ever live in the future. Maximizing the total happiness of the future—that’s SBF’s ultimate goal. FTX is just a means to that end.</p>



<p>But, back to the now-things you can’t fuck up—the tipping points. SBF ticks off his list:</p>



  “When we build super-powerful AI, it’s likely to be one of the points where, all of a sudden, what we do will matter a lot.”  “We should start thinking about how to prepare for the next pandemic now, before it comes—because, at some point, it’s just going to come.”  “I think we might be at a tipping point right now for U.S. politics. It matters a lot what we do over the next, say, two to ten years. Right?”  



<p>And, indeed, SBFputs his money where his mouth is. SBF is personally backing a slew of so-called AI alignment nonprofits and public-benefit corporations including Anthropic and Conjecture. He’s also the big money behind a new nonprofit called Guarding Against Pandemics, which, not coincidentally, is run by his brother Gabe. And SBF was the second-largest donor—behind only Mike Bloomberg—for Biden’s successful attempt to dethrone Trump.</p>



<p>With SBF doing the hard work of interviewing himself, I’m free to think. And, finally, just as the clock is running out on my allotted hour, I ask what might be the first non-stupid question of the entire interview.</p>



<p>“So,” I summarize, “you are young and vital and peaking at precisely the point where the world is at, as you see it, peak crisis.” SBF nods in agreement, deep in another round of Storybook Brawl. “Does that strike you as just a lucky coincidence, or does that strike you as perhaps a signal that your thinking is flawed and you have a savior complex?”</p>



<p>“It’s an interesting question,” he says, stalling.</p>



<p>I double down: “You just happen to be alive in the most important time in the history of the future race. The existential point! Really?”</p>



<p>SBF hedges: “It certainly would not be one’s prior—at least, not naively.”</p>



<p>“Prior”—that’s a term of art. There’s more math to explain (in this case, Bayes’ theorem), but in the interest of you, dear reader, I will skip it.</p>



<p>“But,” SBF continues, “if you want to really needle on that, there are some anthropic considerations by which that might not be as crazy as it sounds.” With the mention of “anthropic” we’ve reached conversational escape velocity and head into the nosebleed regions of modern metaphysics. Again, I’ll spare you the trouble. Suffice it to say that, while SBF is willing to consider the idea that he might be delusional, as a kind of thought experiment, he ultimately dismisses it.</p>



<p>Game over.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>After my interview with SBF, I was convinced: I was talking to a future trillionaire. Whatever mojo he worked on the partners at Sequoia—who fell for him after one Zoom—had worked on me, too. For me, it was simply a gut feeling. I’ve been talking to founders and doing deep dives into technology companies for decades. It’s been my entire professional life as a writer. And because of that experience, there must be a pattern-matching algorithm churning away somewhere in my subconscious. I don’t know how I know, I just do. SBF is a winner.</p>



<p>But that wasn’t even the main thing. There was something else I felt: something in my heart, not just my gut. After sitting ten feet from him for most of the week, studying him in the human musk of the startup grind and chatting in between beanbag naps, I couldn’t shake the feeling that this guy is actually as selfless as he claims to be.</p>



<p>So I find myself convinced that, if SBF can keep his wits about him in the years ahead, he’s going to slay—that, just as Alameda was a stepping stone to FTX, FTX will be to the super-app. Banking will be disrupted and transformed by crypto, just as media was transformed and disrupted by the web. Something of the sort must happen eventually, as the current system, with its layers upon layers of intermediaries, is antiquated and prone to crashing—the global financial crisis of 2008 was just the latest in a long line of failures that occurred because banks didn’t actually know what was on their balance sheets. Crypto is money that can audit itself, no accountant or bookkeeper needed, and thus a financial system with the blockchain built in can, in theory, cut out most of the financial middlemen, to the advantage of all. Of course, that’s the pitch of every crypto company out there. The FTX competitive advantage? Ethical behavior. SBF is a Peter Singer–inspired utilitarian in a sea of Robert Nozick–inspired libertarians. He’s an ethical maximalist in an industry that’s overwhelmingly populated with ethical minimalists. I’m a Nozick man myself, but I know who I’d rather trust my money with: SBF, hands-down. And if he does end up saving the world as a side effect of being my banker, all the better.</p>

<p>As the success of FTX seems like a foregone conclusion, my interest gravitates to SBF the person. He’s like no other billionaire I’ve ever met, and I’ve hung out with quite a few. It’s like the brain of Spock has been transplanted into the shambolic body of Fozzie Bear. He’s a bit of both: instantly lovable—with the guilelessness, kindness, and openness of a Muppet—and so abstract that he seems more like a super-advanced AI than flesh and blood. I want to know what makes SBF so unusual, so, as we both pack up in the conference room (me coiling up the long cord that leads to my lapel mic, him folding up his laptop), I decide to just ask him about his evident weirdness directly.</p>



<p>“So, you are obviously what they call ‘neurodiverse,’ but you are not spectrum-y or Asperger-y,” I observe.</p>



<p>“No,” he agrees.</p>



<p>“So—what’s your diagnosis, doctor?”</p>



<p>“There’s certainly some ADD there. I get distracted very easily if something is not engaging enough. And, so, I find myself doing things to occupy myself.”</p>



<p>It makes sense, yet it doesn’t—so I follow up with another question.</p>



<p>“I grew up kind of like you”—SBF and I went to rival high schools in Silicon Valley, albeit decades apart—“and while there were a lot of rich fuckups in high school, there were a lot of really smart kids, too. And, yet, no one was ever like this. ADD wasn’t a thing. But now it’s everywhere. What is your theory of why?”</p>



<p>“Part of it’s probably social media retraining our brains how to think and act,” he says. “But I think that some amount of boredom with things that are dumb or not productive or not very useful is healthy. And, along with this sort of move toward lower attention spans, people just become more productive. And that is important and good.”</p>



<p>I nod. Certainly that’s true in the case of FTX, I think, remembering the ten-minute all-hands meeting.</p>



<p>Sensing an opportunity for connection, I chip in with my own two satoshi: “I don’t pay any attention to social media—not because I have any moral case against it,” I say, “but because, for me, reading books is the highest-bandwidth way I know to get quality information into my brain, which just craves the stimulation. I’m addicted to reading, which explains how I ended up being a writer.”</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah?” says SBF. “I would never read a book.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m not sure what to say. I’ve read a book a week for my entire adult life and have written three of my own.</p>



<p>“I’m very skeptical of books. I don’t want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that,” explains SBF. “I think, if you wrote a book, you fucked up, and it should have been a six-paragraph blog post.”</p>



<p>So there you have it: Books are for losers.</p>



<p>Does he really believe it? Do I believe it? Is the price of SBF’s genius boredom in the face of literature, literary nonfiction—books in general?</p>



<p>Whatever the case, I find myself sad for the man. And it occurs to me that my reaction is exactly what might be expected from a beta in the brave new world crypto is creating.</p>



<p>So, I think again. What, I wonder, does he think I think? Wouldn’t someone with IQ points to spare realize that dismissing books—all books—as essentially worthless might rile a writer? Was he playing with me? Is this fun? Is this humor?</p>



<p>I’m satisfied with my meta-analysis until I realize that one can always increment the level of strategic play in this sort of game. It’s like poker. Level one is just thinking about how to strengthen your own hand. Level two is thinking about what your opponent’s hand is. Level three is thinking about what your opponent thinks your hand is. And so on. And, since SBF is obviously a genius, I should simply assume that, compared with me, SBF will always be playing at level N+1. Which makes my analysis of the intent behind SBF’s “books are for losers” idea spiral into infinity and crash, like a computer program stuck in a loop.</p>



<p>That evening, I spend some time sitting on a beautiful Bahamian beach, watching the sun set and interrogating my own confused thoughts and feelings. The answer comes to me like the final reel of a so-bad-it’s-good apocalyptic teen comedy from the ’80s:</p>



<p>GREETINGS PROFESSOR FALKEN</p>



<p>HELLO</p>



<p>A STRANGE GAME.</p>



<p>THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Near the end of a long week, I notice a party shaping up in Building 30, on the edge of FTX’s little corporate compound. I’m curious because even though Building 30 is kitted out as a lounge—filled with couches and big tables and board games—I’d never seen anyone actually lounging inside. I decide to check it out.</p>



<p>A cocktail party is in full swing, with about a dozen people I don’t recognize standing around. It turns out to be a mixer for the local EA community that’s been drawn to Nassau in the hopes that the FTX Foundation will fund its various altruistic ideas. The point of the party is to provide a friendly forum for the EAs who actually run EA-aligned nonprofits to meet the earn-to-give EAs at FTX who will fund them, and vice versa. The irony is that, while FTX hosts the weekly mixer—providing the venue and the beverages—it’s rare for an actual FTX employee to ever show up and mix. Presumably, they’re working too hard.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s the beer, but everyone I meet is smart, charismatic and funny. I end up mostly talking to Josh Morrison and Kat Woods, two OGs in the EA movement. Morrison is a serial nonprofit founder. Woods has a similar CV, but now she runs a meta-charity that incubates other charities. They tag-team as they try to explain the movement that drives them—and what drives them to the movement.</p>



<p>“Imagine nerds invented a religion or something,” says Woods, stabbing at my question with vigor, “where people get to argue all day.”</p>



<p>“It’s… an ideology,” counters Morrison. The argument has begun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Woods amiably disagrees: “EA is not an ideology, it’s a question: ‘How do I do the most good?’ And the cool thing about EA, compared to other cause areas, is that you can change your views constantly—and still be part of the movement.”</p>



<p>I can’t help but interrupt. I get the religion part. Morrison and Woods are nothing if not evangelists. But why nerds?</p>



<p>Woods serves up an answer to my question. (Fittingly, she’s wearing tennis whites.) “EA attracts people who really care, but who are also really smart,” she says. “If you are altruistic but not very smart, you just bounce off. And if you’re smart but not very altruistic,” she continues, “you can get nerd sniped!”</p>



<p>Nerd sniped? This is a new one to me. I’m intrigued.</p>



<p>“You can snipe a nerd by putting out an interesting puzzle in front of them, and they’re like, ’I love this,’ because not only is EA the most interesting puzzle in the world,” Woods says, “it’s also the most meaningful.”</p>



<p>Nerd sniping, I learn, is the practice of attracting brainpower by presenting problems as puzzles.</p>



<p>“This ties into the way FTX is doing its foundation,” Morrison says, helpfully knocking the ball back to my true interest. “The foundation wants to get a lot of money out there in order to try a lot of things quickly. And how can you do that effectively?” It’s a rhetorical question, a move worthy of a preppy debate champ who went to a certain finishing school in Cambridge—which is exactly what Morrison is. “Part of the answer is to give money to someone in the EA community.”</p>



<p>“Because EA is different from other communities,” Woods continues, picking up right where Morrison left off. “They’re like, ‘This is the ethical thing, and this is the truth.’ And we’re like, ‘What is the ethical thing? What is the truth?’”</p>



<p>Those are big questions, and I’ll leave them to SBF and his fellow travelers to answer—they’re too big for me. I resist the temptation to be nerd sniped. Besides, I have a different set of questions:</p>



<p>Who is SBF? And what is he made of?</p>



<p>Those are the questions that brought me to the Bahamas. And meeting him in person only deepened the mystery.</p>



<p>What makes him so different from anyone else I’ve ever met?</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>There’s no question that SBF was nerd sniped as a young man at MIT. Indeed, just before he got sniped, SBF had a personal blog where he wrote about his search for life’s meaning. In the blog, he declares his allegiance to utilitarianism over and over, carefully outlining his reasoning before concluding, “And so I am a total utilitarian.” Later writings refine that statement, making it clear that he’s a utilitarian in its purest—Benthamite—form, and that there will be no saving himself from the implications of the Benthamite Way. Every action since then has been a principled puzzling-through of the implications of that philosophy. Even now, even when directly challenged, SBF maintains that he brooks no limit in following the philosophical implications to their logical end: “If I did, I would want to have a long, hard look at myself.”</p>



<p>So when, that next summer, MacAskill sat with SBF in Harvard Square and carefully explained, in the way only an Oxford-educated philosopher can, that the practice of effective altruism boils down to “applied utilitarianism,” Snipe’s arrow hit SBF hard. He’d found his path. He would become a maximization engine. As he wrote in his blog, “If you’ve decided that some of your time—or money—can be better spent on others than on yourself, well, then, why not more of it? Why not all of it?”</p>



<p>Why not all of it, indeed: SBF was under my microscope for a full week. There was never a moment when he wasn’t actively involved in some sort of important meeting—with a key employee, a regulator, a business partner, a mentor—charting the future of FTX. I’ve seen SBF’s own parents queue for a moment of his time, only to give up because the wait was too long.</p>



<p>In devoting every waking moment of his life to work, SBF doesn’t feel he’s doing anything unusual or extraordinary. He’s doing what he feels every right-minded person should do—if they were big-hearted and clear-headed. He’s attempting to maximize the amount of good in the world. Yet the same could be said of Woods and Morrison and, indeed, of all the EAs I’ve met in the Bahamas. Like SBF, they’re all in love with the idea of saving the world in an efficient and rational manner —except they’re obviously having a great time doing it. As one of them said to me, “I came for the cause, I stayed for the people.” SBF, on the other hand, seems qualitatively different: He seems utterly driven, as if by a lash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s hard to see SBF in a clear light. The glitter of the self-made billions are blinding. His intellect is as awesome as it is intimidating. But, once I’d hacked past the piles of money and the IQ points to spare, I found something unexpected: impoverishment. In spending everything he has on others, SBF spends nothing, it would seem, pursuing his own pleasure.</p>



<p>It’s not just that great books aren’t worthwhile. The great movies aren’t worth watching. Citizen Kane, he asserts, is “an unwatchably empty film.” Food gets the same treatment. SBF favors bogus burgers and vegan fries. As for fine dining, he’s never seen the point: “I really don’t think of meals as that memorable.” There’s no pleasure taken in his own presentation—his affect—either. He didn’t own a suit until he had to buy one to testify before Congress. He drives a Corolla. He’s publicly sworn off ever owning a yacht. As for the more carnal pleasures (presumably SBF has a private life), he’s so private that even his own parents don’t even know who—or if—he’s dating. It’s a mystery.</p>



<p>SBF’s rejection of pleasure is so profound it got me wondering if that absence of pleasure—as opposed to his philosophy—was the key to understanding him. Is he so deep in his head that he’s incapable of feeling pleasure? Is SBF effectively being held hostage by his own frontal cortex, caught in a Stockholm syndrome of the mind? Or is he just anhedonic—at the sharp end of the normal human capacity-for-pleasure distribution? Is that what made SBF feel so different, so alien?</p>



<p>I don’t know. But I did ask the people closest to him.</p>



<p>Ramnik Arora is the closest thing to a number two that SBF has: they’ve worked side by side for years. “Do you think,” I ask Arora in a candid moment over lunch one day, “that SBF might actually be incapable of experiencing pleasure?”</p>



<p>Arora puts down his fork and thinks for a moment. “It’s a fair question,” he says, turning it over. “He’s happy playing games,” Arora says after a long pause, remembering a company padel tennis tournament a few weeks before. How did he do? I wonder. “Sam came in second,” Arora reports. “He hated that.”</p>



<p>Joe Bankman is a prominent tax lawyer who also happens to be a psychologist and therapist. He’s also SBF’s dad, and he’s very close to his son. I ask him about SBF’s capacity to experience pleasure.</p>



<p>Bankman rejects my theory, but not completely. “So, Sam doesn’t take pleasure in the things some other people take pleasure in,” Bankman concedes. “But I think Sam gets a lot of pleasure out of a lot of things—they’re just all work-related.” I push back. Satisfaction doesn’t count, I say. By “pleasure,” I mean something more primitive and hardwired: fleshly desires. “He wasn’t always vegan,” offers Bankman, “He loved a good steak as a kid, for example.”</p>



<p>Arguably, the person who knows SBF the best is George Lerner, the FTX company therapist. Lerner’s psychological services are available to everyone in the company, and he’s on speed dial for more than a few. Lerner strikes me as an excellent shrink, the kind I’d want in my head, so I ask him about SBF’s seeming rejection of earthly pleasures.</p>



<p>“It’s interesting,” Lerner says, “because I’ve spoken to Sam at length about this particular topic.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not some pathological thing,” he continues. “For some bizarre reason—and I don’t get it—they want to help.” We’re talking about EAs in general, but also about SBF in particular. “They want to make a difference, and they want to devote their lives to doing that,” says Lerner, who is definitely not an EA. “But that still doesn’t clarify why, or if, that somehow diminishes the pleasure drive.”</p>



<p>SBF is a mystery even to his own therapist.</p>

<p>It’s my last night in the Bahamas, and I spend it in Tetris, relaxing by the pool at the edge of the terrace, far above the marina below. The sun starts to set: a fiery ingot of gold, subsumed by the onrushing lip of the world. And as it does, my gaze is drawn to the tower closest to the water. Orchid is Albany’s flagship building, and its southern tip cuts toward the sandy beachfront like the prow of a ship through a wine-dark sea. Wraparound verandas provide views of both the harbor and the ocean. It’s a six-story layer cake, the entire mass wrapped with aluminum latticework, a sheath of laser-cut filigree, a historic facade but a modern building. The architect, Morris Adjmi, cites his upbringing in New Orleans, as well as sculptors like Rachel Whiteread and Do Ho Suh, as inspiration. The overall effect is nothing less than spectacular: a contemporary take on creole style.</p>



<p>The penthouse atop Orchid—Apartment V—is likely the most expensive condo in all of the Bahamas, and it’s the home of Sam Bankman-Fried. He lives there* with nine roommates: fellow travelers in the EA movement. It’s a dorm situation—but, to paraphrase Scott Fitzgerald, a billionaire’s dorm is different from the ones familiar to you and me. V is palatial—11,500 square feet—with six bedrooms and spectacular views out every window. Two elevators service the apartment, opening directly into the space. Every bedroom has an en suite bath and opens directly onto the veranda. The common areas include the lobby, media room, dining room and a party room at the tip of the building: Curved glass walls slide away, opening up the entire space to the world outside.</p>



<p>After the sun sinks below the horizon, Apartment V lights up. Dramatic wash lighting bathes the veranda in blues and purples. The wraparound porch becomes a rainbow, a beacon. A party is under way, and the entire penthouse glimmers.</p>



<p>I imagine the scene. Board games. Laughter. An intimate crew. It’s just SBF, his family (his mother, father and brother are all in town) and close friends. A small team dedicated to fixing the world—via the magic of quantitative reasoning and the overwhelming force of goodwill. All of them are united by the mission.</p>



<p>It’s odd: the roommates, the dormlike life at the age of 30—an age when many have married, bought houses, had children. But I also think that I’ve tunneled far enough into SBF’s head to understand it. I, like Fitzgerald, do think the very rich are different. Yes, because they have more money. But also, pace Hemingway, because they often have fewer friends. It’s not worth the salt in one’s tears to be sad for the plight of the oligarchy—but there is a downside to billions. Reciprocity becomes difficult between the post-economic and the merely civilian. What do you give a man who has everything and wants for nothing? What do you expect to get?</p>



<p>But within the inner circle at Apartment V—a community of family and friends united by a philosophy that’s almost Pythagorean in its rule—there’s no unit of account. Love is the currency. Love is infinite. And infinity is a problem.</p>



<p>I’ll leave it to SBF to unpack the math: “As soon as you say, ‘What are the odds that there’s a way to be infinitely happy? What if infinite utility is a possibility?’” he explains, “now, all of a sudden, we’re comparing hierarchies of infinity. Linearity breaks down.”</p>



<p>But infinity is also the solution, because it provides a shield from the spartan logic of utilitarianism. There’s no way to do an expected value calculation when one of the terms is infinite. The very incalculability of the love that exists in Apartment V makes it the one refuge from the whip that drives him. SBF can escape, if only for an evening. He can ditch the beanbag for an actual bed and fall blissfully asleep in the lap of superluxury.</p>



<p>Before I retreat to my own cloud nine, I take a long last look at Orchid’s Apartment V. A figure emerges and stands at the rail on the deck regarding the silver pepper of stars in the balmy Bahamian night. He stretches out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was from him, I could have sworn he was trembling.</p>



<p>Yet again, I’m reminded of a certain novel. In Fitzgerald’s day, there was the real-life character of John Pierpont Morgan, who steered the nation as it made the transition from the 19th to the 20th centuries—the transition from an agricultural economy, powered by horses, to an industrial economy, run on rails. Who is going to do the same for us, in this new century?</p>



<p>Awakening from my reverie, I look back at Orchid for the last time. The figure I saw had gone, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.</p>



<p>*&nbsp; SBF has since moved on, and currently lives without roommates.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Zcash Foundation SHOULD endeavor to use the Community Advisory Panel (or successor mechanism) as advisory input for future board elections.</p>— <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014">ZIP 1014</a></blockquote>



<p>The Zcash Foundation is governed by a six-person board of directors, consisting of five independent directors, and the executive director. While the board is self-electing, it seeks input from the Zcash community (represented by an advisory poll of ZCAP) regarding who should be elected to the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we announced during Zcon3, two of the Zcash Foundation (ZF) board members’ terms are expiring this year (Amber Baldet and Ian Miers). Concurrently, we are formalizing and expanding the ZF’s Technical Advisory Board, which has, to date, been an informal group, consisting of Andrew Miller, Ian Miers, and Matthew Green.</p>



<p>Ian Miers will not be seeking re-appointment, and Matthew Green will be resigning his seat on the ZF board. However, both will continue to contribute to the ZF mission as members of the Technical Advisory Board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the interest of continuity, and in recognition of her excellent advice and guidance, the board intends to re-appoint Amber. Additionally, the board intends to appoint a new board member who has appropriate expertise and experience that is relevant to ZF at this point in its growth and evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the recommendation of ZIP 1014, we will be soliciting nominations from the community, and consulting ZCAP regarding who should be appointed to the remaining seat.</p>



<p>We invite members of the Zcash community to nominate people they believe would be good candidates for the ZF board. Nominations should be made on the Zcash Community Forums, under the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/25">Governance category</a>, in the form of a new topic titled “X for the ZF Board”. People may nominate themselves.</p>



<p>Nominees must explicitly accept the nomination, and should post some information about themselves, and why they would be a good board member.</p>



<p>Community nominations must be submitted by 23:59 UTC on Monday 17th October 2022.</p>



<p>We plan to host one or more community calls, during which nominees can introduce themselves to the Zcash community, and answer questions from the community. If there are a large number of nominees, we may hold an initial “filtering” poll of ZCAP before these community calls, to reduce the field to a manageable number.</p>



<p>In due course, we will conduct an advisory poll of ZCAP, and the Board will take the results of that poll into account when deciding who to appoint to the board.&nbsp;</p>



 Being on the Zcash Foundation Board: Duties and Expectations 



<p>Members of the ZF board share fiduciary responsibility for ZF, acting as trustees of its assets, and ensuring that ZF is well-managed, and remains financially sound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In practise, these responsibilities can be summarized as:</p>



  hiring, firing and supervising the Executive Director (ED),&nbsp;  providing guidance and advice to the ED, and  having bold visions about the Foundation’s mission and future, and working with the ED to assist him execute on them.  



<p></p>



<p>Membership of the ZF Board is an unpaid position, as is the norm for 501(c)(3) boards. The expected time commitment is one 60-90 minute meeting (conducted by video call) each month, with occasional additional meetings, and sporadic email and Signal communication. Board members are also expected to attend our annual conference (Zcon), for which their expenses are covered by ZF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Board members must not be anonymous or pseudonymous. They are required to undergo the Foundation’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest declaration, and their name will be published as part of the ZF Form 990. Additionally, per ZIP 1014, members of the Foundation’s Board of Directors “MUST NOT hold equity in ECC or have current business or employment relationships with ECC”.</p>

<p>Consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement are said to be the four primary functions of a blockchain network. When a blockchain network executes all four of these functionalities in its base layer, it’s called a monolithic blockchain. Whereas, if a blockchain network handles only a few out of the four functionalities at the base layer while outsourcing the rest of its functionalities to other layers, it’s called a modular blockchain. <br></p><p>The pace of innovation in the blockchain scene makes it hard enough to keep track of developments. Despite its importance and relative novelty, the topic of the design of blockchains and their consensus mechanisms often lies behind the scenes. However, the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">transition</a> of the Ethereum network from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm put it right back on the map.<br></p><p>In this article, we’ll dive into modular vs. monolithic blockchains, the difference between these two blockchain architectures, how they work, and lastly, their benefits and tradeoffs.<br></p> The blockchain scalability trilemma<br> Tradeoffs of a monolithic blockchain architecture among the three core properties. (<a href="https://bitscrunch.com/blogs/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchain">Source</a>)<p>First of all, let’s have a look at the need for different blockchain architectures, such as modular and monolithic, a story that starts with the blockchain scalability trilemma. This trilemma points out that blockchains in the way we often think about them can only meet two out of the following three properties:<br></p><p> 1. &nbsp;Security<br></p><p>Security refers to the capacity of the network to survive an attack. This precept is a middle tenet of blockchains (no chain would advertise itself as unsafe!) and ought to in no way be compromised, so the real tradeoff is usually among scalability and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a>.<br></p><p> 2. &nbsp;Decentralization<br></p><p>Decentralization in the context of blockchain systems points to the level to which a single user (or entity, or group) can take over the network and enforce their will. For a blockchain to be decentralized, hardware necessities ought not to be a hindrance to participation, and the resource necessities of verifying the network need to be low. <br></p><p> 3. &nbsp;Scalability<br></p><p>Scalability refers to the potential of a blockchain to handle an increasing amount of transactions while keeping resource necessities for verification low. Even if you increase the block size and the potential of transactions that may be covered in a block, sadly, larger block sizes result in the centralization of the community as the hardware requirements of jogging complete <a href="https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/blockchain-nodes/">nodes</a> will increase in response to the need for better computational output. Scalability is often measured in how fast a network can process transactions while keeping costs low.<br></p><p>Now, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/04/07/sharding.html">scalability</a> has been a major challenge for blockchain systems. In essence, it’s practically impossible to optimize a single-layer monolithic blockchain network for all three core properties. The idea of using multiple layers instead of a single base layer to execute all four functions (consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement) emerged in answer to this. <br></p><p>Instead of optimizing for all three properties on a single layer, some proposed to design a system that optimized for one or two properties on one layer and optimized for the third property on another layer. This gave origin to the concept of monolithic vs. modular blockchains.</p> What is a monolithic blockchain? <p>In a monolithic blockchain, all key features or responsibilities of a blockchain system are addressed internally. A monolithic blockchain, in its base consensus layer, undertakes key features such as data availability, settlement, and execution. Usually, settlement and execution are tied together. <br></p><p>Every single task is carried out within a specific (limited) space, from data availability to transaction execution. Bitcoin and Ethereum (without considering layer-2 or rollups) can be said to be the two most prominent examples of monolithic blockchain architectures.<br></p><p>A monolithic blockchain is, therefore, a blockchain that possesses nodes for data availability, transaction execution, and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/">consensus</a>, all within a block. Let’s examine this architecture design along with some key features of a monolithic blockchain design.<br></p> Data availability <p>A monolithic blockchain usually has many transactions in the same block for high throughput and the expansion of block space. Once node service providers do not have the required storage space, a monolithic blockchain is designed to cut them off the network.</p> Execution <p>With a monolithic blockchain, it is very easy to bypass transactions with fewer nodes when all of them arrive at a consensus, as opposed to passing them to several random nodes in the network. <br></p><p>The higher the number of transaction validators made available within the system, the longer its transaction validation time is. However, the number of nodes in the network may be reduced to enhance throughput or the number of transactions carried out each second.</p> Consensus <p>In monolithic chains, consensus is achieved by nodes agreeing on what transactions to be processed for new blocks, including the order of transactions. This establishes a common state of the network at any given point in time.</p> Settlement <p>This characteristic of the monolithic blockchain guarantees the commitment of transactions to the chain’s history to guarantee the integrity of each block. In a proof-of-work blockchain, miner energy is expended on new blocks, while validators are needed in the case of a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain. <br></p> Benefits and drawbacks of monolithic chains <p>Let’s have a look at the benefits and drawbacks of monolithic chains.</p> Benefits  Protection/Security <p>Monolithic blockchains can put secure transactions in force on their own nodes. The nodes see transactions achieved on the blockchain and validate them after confirming a consensus. This additionally solves data issues when the blockchain data is saved in many nodes. <br></p> Usage <p>A monolithic blockchain can offer extra value in the long run, provided users continue to use the token. They are easy to recognize and relatively simpler to implement and design.</p> Drawbacks<br> <p>Some of the major disadvantages of using a monolithic blockchain include:<br></p>  Nodes on a monolithic chain may occasionally require re-executed transactions for verification of validity, leading to delays.<br>  Node source limits, including bandwidth and storage, can affect blockchain efficiency.<br>  They are inflexible in comparison to modular blockchains, affecting production quality. They do not allow for an outsourcing function even when there is downtime resulting from overload.<br>  If big block sizes are applied, high throughput becomes a trade-off for high hardware costs, decreasing the variety of validators on the chain. This will cause <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/why-centralized-crypto-mining-growing-problem/">centralization</a> (a great risk for most chains under this setting), considering that blockchain validation powers stay within the arms of a few users.<br>  When transactions are stored on chains, this can cause the exponential growth of the blockchain size in time, resulting in heavy hardware requirements on nodes besides disrupting the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">decentralization</a> function.<br>   What is a modular blockchain?<br> <p>As we established above, if you try to run all four functionalities (consensus, execution, data availability, and settlement) at a chain’s base layer, this ultimately limits the system's capacity and, subsequently, its total throughput. A modular chain separates the system into several possible parts or additives that are independently developed. <br></p><p>In a modular blockchain structure, the execution layer is independent of the bottom consensus and data availability layers, permitting nodes to execute transactions separately rather than performing all the transactions to test validity within a limited space or block. Cosmos and Celestia can be said to be the most prominent examples of modular blockchain architectures.<br></p>The transition from a monolithic to a modular structure. (<a href="https://celestia.org/learn/basics-of-modular-blockchains/">Source</a>)<p>Let’s examine the architecture design and some of the key features of a modular blockchain design. In modular chains, three core layers work independently to make its output easier and quicker:</p> Consensus layer <p>The consensus layer establishes the set of guidelines to be observed through nodes for verifying and validating blocks and reaching consensus. This ensures that there is an agreement among all of the nodes connected with the installed blocks and transactions, thereby guaranteeing true security and decentralization.</p> Data availability layer <p>The data availability layer manages the on-chain and stale-chain blockchain records, making sure that records are available and public for everybody to look at. Numerous blockchain tasks, including <a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-avail-launches-on-testnet-to-turn-monolithic-chains-modular/">Polygon Avail</a>, are presenting data availability solutions to convert conventional (monolithic) blockchain designs to modular ones.<br></p>Polygon’s Avail allows developers to turn monolithic chains into modular ones. Execution layer <p>The execution layer executes all of the transactions to supply top-rated records, which are then saved on the blockchain network.<br></p> Further breakdown of a modular blockchain <p>Modular blockchains consist of layers designed for a particular action. There is a division of labor for better results. Consequently, the main advantage of a modular blockchain is fixing the “scalability trilemma,” a major challenge with blockchain technology:</p> Scalability <p>Modular blockchains allow for decentralization, protection, and scalability. Within the real world, this translates into users being able to avoid <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">Bitcoin’s</a> long confirmation time or high Ethereum gas fees, for example. <br></p><p>Assigning each layer or section a single mission or task ensures security, speed, and efficiency.<br></p> Decentralization <p>Despite a modular blockchain being split into distinctive layers, it nevertheless ensures consensus and, as a result, security. No single server can solely manipulate the network even if overloaded. <br></p><p>Social consensus is used to make even essential selections regarding transactions, helping to grow an absolutely decentralized platform.</p> Efficiency <p>A developer can introduce Layer-2 answers to resolve the blockchain’s hassle. As an instance, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">Optimism &amp; ZK rollups</a> for Ethereum make use of robust security while lowering its fee and latency.<br></p> Different use cases for the modular blockchain architecture<br> <p>In a modular blockchain, every project is handled by a separate group of layers which might be closely-associated chains working at the identical layer. For example, each <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/dev-foundations/application-specific-blockchains">app-chain</a> in the Cosmos network leverages the read-made modules provided by the Cosmos Stack. The Cosmos Stack includes <a href="https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/tendermint/">Tendermint Core</a>, a pre-constructed consensus engine, <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>, a software development kit, and <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/deep-dive-how-will-ibc-create-value-for-the-cosmos-hub-eedefb83c7a0">IBC</a>, a network communication protocol. This enables developers to use these modules and easily build an application-specific chain in a modular-blockchain ecosystem.<br></p><p>The network of interconnected blockchains handles each transaction just like a typical blockchain would. Transactions are verified and delivered to the main (base) pool or dropped. <br></p><p>A miner/validator can broadcast a block to peers if they are successful in locating the unique identification for the candidate block as required through the proof-of-work/proof-of-stake requirements. Once all transactions are confirmed as authentic via the various nodes, the brand new block is added to the chain. Different miners retain this technique, steadily lengthening the chain by adding new blocks on top of the ones which have already been mined.<br></p> Benefits and drawbacks of a modular blockchain<br>  Benefits <p>The most noticeable benefits of the modular blockchain include scalability, ease of design, and flexibility.</p> Scalability <p>A monolithic blockchain allows a user to have all the expected functions of the blockchain in just a single layer called “<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-layer-1-in-blockchain">Layer-1</a>”. This makes blockchain creation uneasy to achieve because it tries to deal with all functions at a time within a single layer. With a modular blockchain, the functions are shared among different layers, improving scalability and preventing possible network disruption.<br></p> Blockchain Creation <p>To launch a brand new blockchain, miners must face several issues related to security and decentralization, which may equally prevent some from optimizing the out-of-network <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">hash</a> rate (opportunity). <br></p><p>When miners concentrate less on particular functions like consensus, it gives them the ability to leverage the layout and create new blockchains more quickly, regardless of the blockchain architecture.</p> Flexibility <p>In comparison to the monolithic blockchain, the modular blockchain layout is significantly more flexible. It is designed to provide miners with features they cannot find in the monolithic blockchain. <br></p><p>Every blockchain in cryptocurrency shares a few simple characteristics, like ensuring data availability, security, consensus, and transaction execution. Typically, blockchains manage this kind of function at the identical layer. Modular blockchains ensure more efficiency by offloading work to other layers.</p> Drawbacks <p>Even though modular blockchains solve various issues where monolithic blockchain lags behind, modular architecture comes with its own set of drawbacks. These are:<br></p> Security <p>Unlike monolithic blockchains, which execute each blockchain function in a single layer, modular chains may lack protection-related characteristics.</p> Complexity <p>It is often difficult to design without the involvement of expert operators due to their design’s complexity.</p> Implication on token value <p>Some modular chains may not be able to draw interest to their native tokens due to restrained use cases. For example, when compared to an execution layer, a layer dedicated to consensus and data availability will, in all likelihood, see much less use for its <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-a-utility-token/">utility token</a>. This makes it very difficult to attract users to these networks.</p> Conclusion Modular vs. monolithic blockchain landscape considering Ethereum’s different layers as part of a modular structure. (<a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x3DcB6592B35097Df3A98FDBf9e6ec9f05436Aeda/hRwo3A0fISmv5EbvjYPu6e0p5EYNwklKqo3-SudijsU">Source</a>)<p>As the blockchain industry witnesses improvement or updates to different existing solutions, efficiency is key to new development. Modular blockchain networks such as <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> or <a href="https://celestia.org/">Celestia</a> ensure that a network remains enormously scalable without tampering with security and decentralization. <br></p><p>Monolithic chains like Ethereum and Solana are already drifting to a modular design since blockchain developers now see the need for a seamless and cost-effective transaction arrangement. <br></p><p>However, in the recent past, we’ve witnessed the Ethereum ecosystem moving towards modular architecture with the development of Layer-2 and rollups.

  The problem  The two possible solutions  What is the ID and what can I use it&nbsp;for?  Why is it called the&nbsp;ID?  How does the ID&nbsp;work?  What is an&nbsp;asset?  What is a contract?  Summary   1) The&nbsp;problem <p>It is interesting to see that the concept of Web3 is all about data control and ownership. To understand the value of Web3, one should understand the problems of Web2. Let us have a look at the definition of centralisation first:</p><p>Centralisation is usually defined as “the concentration of control of an activity or organisation under a single authority”</p><p>In a Web2 context, the activity in question is control of data, and the problem lies in the concentration of control of data under a single organisation. The definition simply&nbsp;becomes:</p><p>Centralisation is the concentration of control of data under a single organisation.</p><p>Web2 has been built to put companies at the centre of all activities as they give users access to their data. These companies can use and misuse the data as they like. They can analyse it to increase their sales, they can sell the data and benefit from it, they keep it for themselves as their property, and the list goes&nbsp;on.</p> 2) The two possible solutions <p>Considering the definition above, we can examine two possible solutions to tackle the problem of “control of&nbsp;data”:</p> Decentralisation using Blockchain technology <p>Using blockchain, control is distributed amongst many organisations and servers, so the definition might&nbsp;read:</p><blockquote>Blockchain definition: <br>“Decentralisation is the lack of concentration of control of data under a single organisation.“</blockquote><p>A blockchain network is powered by many miners. In the case of NFT-based assets, the data is broken to small pieces using IPFS network, and is under the control of the user with the correct private key. In terms of hierarchy, there is no higher authority than the user who controls the data, hence the definition is&nbsp;valid.</p> Decentralisation in the ID Ecosystem <p>In the ID Ecosystem, a user’s data is in a secure and private place under his full control. This place is called the ID. The data is stored locally on the user’s device and on a remote server of his choice. In terms of hierarchy, there is no higher authority than the user who controls the data, hence the definition is&nbsp;valid.</p><blockquote>ID Ecosystem definition: <br>“the concentration of control of data under a single&nbsp;user.”</blockquote> 3) What is the ID and what can I use it&nbsp;for? <p>The cornerstone of the ID ecosystem is the “ID”. What is this&nbsp;ID?</p><p>The ID is a secure and private place that you fully&nbsp;control.</p><p>You can use it&nbsp;to:</p>  Create, store and share ALL kinds of&nbsp;data.  Empower you in ALL day-to-day transactions.   4) Why is it called the&nbsp;ID? <p>The ID has a metaphorical and practical meaning to&nbsp;it:</p>  An ID for you: you are your data. You are your photos and memories, the services you provide, the music you listen to, the communication you make, the assets you own, your choices when choosing a new car, your discretion when you access certain websites. All of this forms your digital self which should be under your complete&nbsp;control.  An ID for the world: you can use the ID or the assets inside it to empower you in the digital and real world. The ID, similar to your email and phone number, can help you register, log in and complete purchases in different apps and websites. As for the assets, a cinema ticket can be an asset you share when you want to access the cinema. A passport can be an asset you share when you go through border&nbsp;control.   5) How does the ID&nbsp;work? <p>Web2 is company centric. Meaning, companies give users access to the&nbsp;data.</p><p>With the ID, it is the opposite way around. It is user centric. Users give companies access to the data. A user’s data doesn’t leave the ID, and even when it is shared, it is always “stamped” with the user’s ID so it can’t be used elsewhere. All of this happens in a secure and private environment under the user’s full&nbsp;control.</p>  Secure: the ID operates in a zero knowledge environment, with end-to-end encryption where each asset has a unique key that sits solely with the&nbsp;user.  Private: unlike the public blockchain, all assets and contracts are private by nature in the ID ecosystem.  Full control: you decide who has access to what and when. You can terminate any unwanted access to your data immediately.   6) What is an&nbsp;asset? <p>Is it like a crypto asset? like&nbsp;Bitcoin?</p><p>No. In the ID, there is a new breed of assets. They are the building blocks of an&nbsp;ID.</p>  In the cinema example, you get the ticket as an asset when you book online (that asset has a known issuer which is the cinema). When you arrive at the cinema, you only need to “identify” to share that same asset to access the cinema. Not only that, when you identify, you share and receive ALL the required assets at once (e.g., ticket, loyalty card, money, get receipt).  Your house becomes an asset, and that same asset is used to unlock its&nbsp;doors.  Your 01 Watch is an asset, and that that same asset is used to activate it physical&nbsp;device.  <p>With the ID, the definition of an asset becomes much wider than what we know today. ANYTHING can be an asset. Users can create chats, contracts and products which they can store, share and sell privately and publicly. Businesses can create assets with different rights (e.g., mutable or immutable) which they share with&nbsp;users.</p><p>Due to the known asset structure and given that all assets sit in one place, assets can “communicate” with each other. So, if a bank issues a bank statement asset to a customer each month which shows the customer’s address, and given that banks usually rely on an address coming from utility providers, the customer only needs to update their address once with the utility provider (that issued their utility statement asset) for it to be updated elsewhere including their bank statement.</p> 7) What is a contract? <p>No code contracts are another substantial asset type that we see set to disrupt the legal sector. Any user can create any contract regardless of its complexity in&nbsp;seconds.</p>  Users can make use of simple-to-use models and formulas that regulate the contracts’ behaviour  User can benefit from key-value pair to insert variables into different agreements.  <p>Contracts can be many&nbsp;things:</p>  A simple bet agreement  A private or public sale agreement  A complicated employment agreement  Terms and conditions of a service that regulates users access to the&nbsp;service  A will  A contract that governs locking/unlocking a car or a&nbsp;house.  <p>With contracts, users don’t need to trust a lawyer or developer to draft an agreement or write a smart contract for them. They can do that by themselves and transform all activities to be peer to peer without the need of any external&nbsp;party.</p> 8) Summary <p>The ID ecosystem is the combination of different ID providers working in tandem with each other. Unlike blockchain, all ID clouds are compatible with each other, so if you decide to change your provider, you can take all your assets and migrate to a new provider as if nothing happened. Manufacturers can also build ID enabled devices that will increase the security of the ID. These devices can work with any ID&nbsp;cloud.</p><p>Data ownership and control promises of a new internet, sometimes referred to as Web3. We believe that the ID ecosystem resembles a paradigm shift that has the potential to disrupt all sectors and industries. EVERYTHING will be different with the&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Don’t forget to visit the website for more information and read the <a href="https://idz.com/downloads/comparison-blockchain-vs-the-ID-ecosystem.pdf">comparison between the ID ecosystem and blockchain</a>.</p>

<p></p><p>Oliver Gale, co-Founder of Panther, was a guest on the <a href="https://twitter.com/TradeTalks/status/1568290870880833536">Nasdaq Trade Talks</a> broadcast on September 9th. Topics covered included blockchain interoperability, privacy, and how compliance can co-exist with them, as well as Panther’s mission.<br></p><p>“Interoperability is crucial to have at a blockchain level”, explained Oliver. He outlined the fact that it is the key for the Web3 user not to be repeatedly “switching and swapping” when using different chains, which “would make Web3 really a pain to use on a daily basis.” <br></p><p>However, Oliver pointed out that there are a few trade-offs that come with interoperability. In fact, interoperable bridges will “reveal transaction data, in the same way the underlying blockchain might”.<br></p> Panther Protocol’s value proposition<br> <p>This is where <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-panther-protocol-and-why-it-exists-a3fd4470de55/">Panther’s value proposition</a> comes up. Panther aims to allow users to interact in this space while restoring their access to privacy.<br></p><p>However, especially in 2022, with every mention of privacy one needs to consider compliance. Oliver mentions that, in this regard, compliance is almost like a different type of interoperability. He illustrates this through the example of two financial institutions that are globally distributed but based in different countries. “If you want to have an account at both institutions, you have to do compliance at both”, explained Oliver, who pointed out the major costs it represents for the financial institutions “however, storing and replicating data means instantly doubling the risk of it being hacked”.</p> “You don’t need to know anything about me, all you need to know is that I am verified” <p></p>Oliver's interview with Nasdaq's Jill Malandrino showcased the balance between privacy and compliance that Panther aims to achieve. Watch it in full here!<p>As Oliver summed up, “privacy is actually a fantastic (compliance) tool using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a>” to ease the tracks left by the process on everyone’s side, while “proving you’ve been verified and that your transactions are legitimate”. He believes this solution will save the financial system from the rising costs of compliance processes.<br></p><p>When asked about everyday use cases for zero-knowledge technology, Panther’s CEO listed identity verification at airports, taxes, and credit scoring. “You don’t need to know who I am, you don’t need to know anything about me, all you need to know is that I am verified. It allows each of us as individuals to interact compliantly without giving data away.”<br></p><p>In such a landscape, Oliver depicts Panther as “a Privacy middleware for Web 3, enabling private bridging, and private DeFi transactions”. “What sets Panther apart is that we’ve really been working on this marriage between compliance and privacy” Oliver outlined.</p> <br>About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>A look into the pieces that comprise a private&nbsp;zkRollup</p><p>Aztec Network is a privacy-first zkRollup on Ethereum. Most people who are fans of Aztec understand the public nature of Ethereum and how Aztec serves to solve Ethereum’s drawbacks: privacy and scalability.</p><p>In this piece we want to underscore the elements of Aztec’s network architecture and offer a sense for how the different pieces work together to enable a privacy layer for Ethereum DeFi, DAOs, and&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>It complements our more basic piece about how Aztec’s UTXO-based privacy architecture works, which can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/fully-confidential-ethereum-transactions-aztec-networks-privacy-architecture-274f968b13d4">here</a>.</p><p>As a guide to the anatomy of a transaction traversing Aztec’s network, we’ve supplied a handy dandy&nbsp;diagram:</p> User Transactions <p>It all starts with the most important element in the whole flow — a user making a private transaction.</p><p>Typically the user interacts with a front-end (either the first-party maintained <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> or an Ethereum app which has integrated the Aztec Connect&nbsp;SDK).</p><p>User accounts are accessed and managed by the Aztec Connect SDK, and like Ethereum are comprised of public and private keys. Unlike Ethereum, however, Aztec accounts have a single public key but two types of private key: viewing keys and a spending&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The viewing key allows the holder to view a user’s owned encrypted notes think of this like a pair of decoder glasses that allows the holder to see a user’s note balances, but no one&nbsp;else’s:</p><p>The spending key on the other hand is like a key that allows the holder to unlock individual encrypted notes and spend them — either in a send, withdraw, or DeFi transaction.</p><p>You can register different spending keys to different devices, preventing the need to paste sensitive information across&nbsp;devices.</p> The Aztec&nbsp;SDK <p>The Aztec SDK manages all this through an easy-to-use API that allows developers to integrate account registration, recovery, and asset transfer functionality in a few&nbsp;lines.</p><p>The SDK retrieves encrypted state and presents it to the developer in a way that’s easy to serve to users, all while managing private information such that applications never have&nbsp;access.</p><p>When users grant applications access to their account, the SDK helps users spend funds, computing state updates with a proof of correctness. It manage state (what users own) and facilitates user transactions (updating state by constructing proofs).</p><p>In comparison, an Ethereum transaction is a request for a state update along with authorization from a private key (a signature). In Aztec, the SDK is itself computing the state update, and then sending the proof of correctness to an Aztec sequencer.</p><p>The sequencer is therefore not doing any real computation or state update but just offering a compression service — aggregating user proofs (“inner proofs”) into a larger single outer&nbsp;proof.</p><p>It’s worth noting also that the sequencer cannot reasonably discriminate between transactions, since all it receives is an encrypted proof of correctness for an underlying transaction, which is generated client-side in the user’s browser. This makes targeted censorship of specific transactions essentially impossible.</p><blockquote><a href="https://docs.aztec.network/category/sdk">📖 Learn more about building with Aztec with our SDK documentation</a></blockquote> Falafel: the Aztec&nbsp;Client <p>Once the transaction is created, it’s sent to Falafel. Falafel is a Typescript implementation of Aztec’s client — think of it like Go Ethereum (geth) or any other Ethereum client that forms an interface between the user and the actual blockchain.</p><p>Falafel is offchain software that accepts user proofs (encrypted transactions), aggregates them, creates a rollup proof, and then sends rollup proofs to the rollup contract for validation. This large proof comprised of many user transactions is what we call an “outer proof” (the inner proofs being the proofs containing each individual user transaction).</p><p>Falafel is just a batching mechanism that creates a big mega proof that adds all the inner proofs together proving that all the underlying state updates are&nbsp;valid.</p><p>Some note on privacy and censorship resistance in the network’s end state: the only reasonable censorship a sequencer can undertake is refusal to process blocks and attempting to interrupt network liveness.</p><p>If we analogize sequencers who run Falafel as mailmen, the only thing they can do is quit delivering the mail, but they can’t open specific letters and envelopes, nor can they reject letters in a targeted way because there is no revealing information.</p><p>Anyone can run the Falafel client and become a sequencer. The Aztec sequencer proposes blocks — sets of encrypted transactions.</p><p>Our goal is to have a network of sequencers run Falafel, processing and batching transactions for publication. Currently, though, Aztec serves as the sole network sequencer.</p><blockquote>🧆<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/tree/master/falafel"> Explore the Falafel repo&nbsp;here</a></blockquote> Rollup Contract <p>Once the outer proof is constructed, it’s sent to the on-chain rollup contract, a smart contract published on Ethereum (you can find it at <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xff1f2b4adb9df6fc8eafecdcbf96a2b351680455">this address</a>).</p><p>The outer proof sent to the rollup contract can contain a variety of encrypted user actions: withdrawals, deposits, new account registrations, or Aztec Connect bridge transactions.</p><p>The outer proof is sent to the rollup contract for validation and state updates. The rollup contract then runs through each user transaction and executes the necessary logic on Ethereum Layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>Deposit: Users move funds to the Aztec rollup contract, which locks funds and then credits the user with an L2 representation of those funds once the rollup is published to Ethereum.</p><p>Withdrawal: Users indicate they want to send funds out of Aztec, the rollup contract confirms the value of the singular note the user is spending, nullifies internal Aztec funds, and sends its L1 funds to the specified withdrawal address.</p><p>DeFi interaction: the rollup contract calls out to an Aztec Connect Bridge Contract, which serves as an interface to Layer 1 smart contracts.</p><p>Bridge contracts are all fundamentally structured as two-input, two-output swaps: the rollup contract sends 1–2 assets into an L1 protocol, and atomically receives 1–2 assets back (a synchronous bridge like a swap) or returns token assets back at a later date (an asynchronous bridge like a timed vault). In the next block, it subsequently generates a claim note for the user to claim the returned asset at a later&nbsp;date.</p><p>You can think of this structure like inputting A + B and getting C + D back, either now or&nbsp;later:</p><p>Virtual assets are an Aztec-specific representation of token positions that can’t immediately be returned to the rollup — think vault positions, fixed term positions, or anything else that is escrowed for redemption at a later&nbsp;date.</p><p>In all cases, smart contract logic stays on Layer 1. Users are interacting with Layer 1 liquidity and smart contracts — with no liquidity fragmentation or logic execution “on Aztec” whatsoever!</p><p>Aztec Connect serves as a privacy-and-batching layer for the battle-tested contracts and liquidity on Ethereum.</p> Subsidy Contract <p>We recently made an upgrade to Aztec that allows any party to fund subsidies for bridge transactions. Subsidies are an important part of bootstrapping bridges on Aztec while user volume gets to critical&nbsp;mass.</p><p>Take for an example a bridge that supports 50-unit transaction batches. Think of this like a bus with 50 seats, which only departs for its destination once the bus is&nbsp;full.</p><p>On any given day, three things could&nbsp;happen:</p>  All 50 “seats” get filled — yay!  Not all 50 seats get filled, and people wait for a whiiiile before the rest of the seats get&nbsp;filled  Someone at some point gets sick of waiting and pays for the whole batch to go down to Ethereum and&nbsp;execute  <p>The “someone” in scenario 3 could be an individual electing to pay for the number of seats remaining, OR it could be the bus service itself. Protocols who want the bridge to be performant even before bus seats are selling out can subsidize regular departures, ensuring timely performance.</p><p>Previously, Aztec offered these subsidies to our partners by managing a subsidy balance within Falafel, Aztec Network’s client. We would use the multisig to manually top up Falafel’s subsidy balance on a bridge-contract to bridge-contract basis.</p><p>Now, a contract has been deployed that allows any EOA or contract account to subsidize bridge contracts under a certain set of parameters:</p>  Bridge ID  Subsidy amount committed  Bridge contract backstop (how often to subsidize running of the bridge, e.g. “6 hour backstop” means if the bridge reaches 6 hours without inclusion in a block, it automatically calls the subsidy contract for funds and inclusion in the next&nbsp;block)  <p>When the subsidy amount runs out based on the given parameters, the subsidy contract simply stops returning a&nbsp;subsidy.</p><p>Previously, subsidy funding happened completely offchain (partner sends funds to our multisig, we then send it from the multisig to Falafel). Partners would have to trust us to use the funds wisely, do the appropriate accounting within Falafel, and hold the funds. It also required interaction with the Aztec Core&nbsp;Team.</p><p>Now, the subsidy contract allows anyone to permissionlessly fund bridge contracts, regardless of author or origin. The network owns the subsidy, and any sequencer running Falafel can claim it. It’s a step toward Aztec Network’s decentralization plan, making each part of the network stand on its own from the Aztec Core&nbsp;Team.</p><blockquote><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xABc30E831B5Cc173A9Ed5941714A7845c909e7fA">💰 Explore the subsidy contract&nbsp;here</a></blockquote> Conclusion <p>With Aztec, privacy is a feature you can now add to any Ethereum contract — and now you know exactly how it&nbsp;works!</p><p>We’re excited to see developers and users explore the full potential of Aztec’s privacy architecture.</p><p>If you’re a developer, check out the following resources:</p>  <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/category/sdk">SDK Documentation</a>  <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">Aztec Grants Application</a>  <p>And jump into our <a href="http://discord.gg/aztec">Discord</a> for questions on how Aztec&nbsp;works!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/explaining-the-network-in-aztec-network-166862b3ef7d">Explaining the “Network” in Aztec Network</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">Aztec Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         Partnering with JITX: Breaking the Bottleneck in Circuit Board Design            <p>Jonathan, Duncan and Patrick are leading a hardware revolution that’s long overdue.</p>  <p>By Bill Coughran</p><p>Published September 20, 2022</p>       



     
	 
		
				
			Designing a circuit board in JITX.		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>Look around the room you’re in right now. How many electronic devices can you see? From the smartwatch on your wrist to the microwave in your kitchen to the laptop you might be using to read this post, every one of these objects contains what’s called a printed circuit board (PCB)—an intricate, connected assembly of switches, terminals, semiconductors and other components arranged just so, to ensure the device does what it’s designed to do.</p>



<p>Today, the microchips on these boards are built using computer-aided design, which has enabled ever-smaller and increasingly complex configurations. But before the introduction of hardware design languages and other technologies in the 1980s, chips were laid out manually—and decades later, that’s still how most PCBs are largely made.</p>



<p>Because circuit board designs are highly variable and include more analog components compared to chips, they often require custom layouts. The majority of design work is done by hand, by electrical engineers—artisans in an otherwise automated world. But this manual approach comes with a high rate of failure, and high costs; if a board design is too big, too hot or too expensive, the components must be reevaluated and the wires redrawn, wasting time and precious parts that may be hard to come by due to shortages. It’s an unsustainable bottleneck, especially given rising demand for PCBs—and it’s exacerbated by a diminishing pool of talent as more students choose computer science over electrical engineering.</p>



<p>As critical and wide-reaching as this problem is, however, its persistence is hardly a surprise—because the solutions require a multidisciplinary marriage of electrical engineering, manufacturing, AI, programming language design and more. But fortunately for all of us, <a href="https://www.jitx.com/">JITX</a> co-founders Jonathan Bachrach, Duncan Haldane and Patrick Li are up to that challenge.</p>



<p>When Duncan first met Jonathan and Patrick at UC Berkeley, he was researching robotics and was fed up with designing hardware by hand. Jonathan and Patrick were building an automated hardware design framework called <a href="https://www.chisel-lang.org/">Chisel</a>. As the three of them began working together, they recognized that PCBs were ripe for the same kind of paradigm shift that had revolutionized chip production decades earlier. This is the idea behind JITX: an intuitive interface where hardware developers can write code to generate and optimize board designs, increasing speed, reducing waste and dramatically scaling their impact.</p>



<p>JITX has since produced circuit board designs for everything from <a href="https://www.jitx.com/examples">hazmat sensors to self-driving trucks</a>—and they do it exponentially faster than the traditional approach. Now, with the public launch of their product, they’re enabling everyone to create board schematics with less risk and cost. And PCBs are just the beginning; their plans include expansion into semiconductor packaging, electromechanical robotics designs and more—optimizing not just circuit boards, but entire systems.</p>



<p>Reaching those goals will require solving cutting-edge algorithm and design problems, and Jonathan, Duncan and Patrick are continuing to actively build the JITX team—if you’re interested in joining them, please <a href="https://www.jitx.com/careers">reach out</a>. We at Sequoia are proud to support them by leading this round of Series A funding, and to be their partners in this long-overdue revolution in circuit board design.&nbsp;</p>
   



   
Jitx Co-Founder and CEO DUncan Haldane.



Jonathan, Duncan, Patrick and the team.

         Generative AI: A Creative New World                <p>By Sonya Huang, Pat Grady and GPT-3  </p><p>Published September 19, 2022</p>            <p>A powerful new class of large language models is making it possible for machines to write, code, draw and create with credible and sometimes superhuman results. </p>       



 
 
   
<p>Humans are good at analyzing things. Machines are even better. Machines can analyze a set of data and find patterns in it for a multitude of use cases, whether it’s fraud or spam detection, forecasting the ETA of your delivery or predicting which TikTok video to show you next. They are getting smarter at these tasks. This is called “Analytical AI,” or traditional AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But humans are not only good at analyzing things—we are also good at creating. We write poetry, design products, make games and crank out code. Up until recently, machines had no chance of competing with humans at creative work—they were relegated to analysis and rote cognitive labor. But machines are just starting to get good at creating sensical and beautiful things. This new category is called “Generative AI,” meaning the machine is generating something new rather than analyzing something that already exists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI is well on the way to becoming not just faster and cheaper, but better in some cases than what humans create by hand. Every industry that requires humans to create original work—from social media to gaming, advertising to architecture, coding to graphic design, product design to law, marketing to sales—is up for reinvention. Certain functions may be completely replaced by generative AI, while others are more likely to thrive from a tight iterative creative cycle between human and machine—but generative AI should unlock better, faster and cheaper creation across a wide range of end markets. The dream is that generative AI brings the marginal cost of creation and knowledge work down towards zero, generating vast labor productivity and economic value—and commensurate market cap.</p>



<p>The fields that generative AI addresses—knowledge work and creative work—comprise billions of workers. Generative AI can make these workers at least 10% more efficient and/or creative: they become not only faster and more efficient, but more capable than before. Therefore, Generative AI has the potential to generate trillions of dollars of economic value.</p>



 Why Now?&nbsp; 



<p>Generative AI has the same “why now” as AI more broadly: better models, more data, more compute. The category is changing faster than we can capture, but it’s worth recounting recent history in broad strokes to put the current moment in context.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wave 1: Small models reign supreme (Pre-2015) 5+ years ago, small models are considered “state of the art” for understanding language. These small models excel at analytical tasks and become deployed for jobs from delivery time prediction to fraud classification. However, they are not expressive enough for general-purpose generative tasks. Generating human-level writing or code remains a pipe dream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wave 2: The race to scale (2015-Today) A landmark paper by Google Research (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Attention is All You Need</a>) describes a new neural network architecture for natural language understanding called transformers that can generate superior quality language models while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. These models are few-shot learners and can be customized to specific domains relatively easily.</p>



As AI models have gotten progressively larger they have begun to surpass major human performance benchmarks. Sources: © The Economist Newspaper Limited, London, June 11th 2022. All rights reserved; SCIENCE.ORG/CONTENT/ARTICLE/COMPUTERS-ACE-IQ-TESTS-STILL-MAKE-DUMB-MISTAKES-CAN-DIFFERENT-TESTS-HELP



<p></p>



<p>Sure enough, as the models get bigger and bigger, they begin to deliver human-level, and then superhuman results. Between 2015 and 2020, the compute used to train these models increases by 6 orders of magnitude and their results surpass human performance benchmarks in handwriting, speech and image recognition, reading comprehension and language understanding. OpenAI’s GPT-3 stands out: the model’s performance is a giant leap over GPT-2 and delivers tantalizing Twitter demos on tasks from code generation to snarky joke writing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite all the fundamental research progress, these models are not widespread. They are large and difficult to run (requiring GPU orchestration), not broadly accessible (unavailable or closed beta only), and expensive to use as a cloud service. Despite these limitations, the earliest Generative AI applications begin to enter the fray.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wave 3: Better, faster, cheaper (2022+) Compute gets cheaper. New techniques, like diffusion models, shrink down the costs required to train and run inference. The research community continues to develop better algorithms and larger models. Developer access expands from closed beta to open beta, or in some cases, open source.</p>



<p>For developers who had been starved of access to LLMs, the floodgates are now open for exploration and application development. Applications begin to bloom.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Wave 4: Killer apps emerge (Now) With the platform layer solidifying, models continuing to get better/faster/cheaper, and model access trending to free and open source, the application layer is ripe for an explosion of creativity.</p>



<p>Just as mobile unleashed new types of applications through new capabilities like GPS, cameras and on-the-go connectivity, we expect these large models to motivate a new wave of generative AI applications. And just as the inflection point of mobile created a market opening for a handful of killer apps a decade ago, we expect killer apps to emerge for Generative AI. The race is on.</p>



 Market Landscape&nbsp;

<p>Models</p>



  Text is the most advanced domain. However, natural language is hard to get right, and quality matters. Today, the models are decently good at generic short/medium-form writing (but even so, they are typically used for iteration or first drafts). Over time, as the models get better, we should expect to see higher quality outputs, longer-form content, and better vertical-specific tuning.  Code generation is likely to have a big impact on developer productivity in the near term as shown by GitHub CoPilot. It will also make the creative use of code more accessible to non developers.  Images are a more recent phenomenon, but they have gone viral: it’s much more fun to share generated images on Twitter than text! We are seeing the advent of image models with different aesthetic styles, and different techniques for editing and modifying generated images.  Speech synthesis has been around for a while (hello Siri!) but consumer and enterprise applications are just getting good. For high-end applications like film and podcasts the bar is quite high for one-shot human quality speech that doesn’t sound mechanical. But just like with images, today’s models provide a starting point for further refinement or final output for utilitarian applications.  Video and 3D models are coming up the curve quickly. People are excited about these models’ potential to unlock large creative markets like cinema, gaming, VR, architecture and physical product design. The research orgs are releasing foundational 3D and video models as we speak.&nbsp;  Other domains: There is fundamental model R&amp;D happening in many fields, from audio and music to biology and chemistry (generative proteins and molecules, anyone?).&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>The below chart illustrates a timeline for how we might expect to see fundamental models progress and the associated applications that become possible. 2025 and beyond is just a guess.</p>
   



     
 
 



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>Applications<br>Here are some of the applications we are excited about. There are far more than we have captured on this page, and we are enthralled by the creative applications that founders and developers are dreaming up.&nbsp;</p>



  Copywriting: The growing need for personalized web and email content to fuel sales and marketing strategies as well as customer support are perfect applications for language models. The short form and stylized nature of the verbiage combined with the time and cost pressures on these teams should drive demand for automated and augmented solutions.  Vertical specific writing assistants: Most writing assistants today are horizontal; we believe there is an opportunity to build much better generative applications for specific end markets, from legal contract writing to screenwriting. Product differentiation here is in the fine-tuning of the models and UX patterns for particular workflows.&nbsp;  Code generation: Current applications turbocharge developers and make them much more productive: GitHub Copilot is now generating nearly 40% of code in the projects where it is installed. But the even bigger opportunity may be opening up access to coding for consumers. Learning to prompt may become the ultimate high-level programming language.  Art generation: The entire world of art history and pop cultures is now encoded in these large models, allowing anyone to explore themes and styles at will that previously would have taken a lifetime to master.  Gaming: The dream is using natural language to create complex scenes or models that are riggable; that end state is probably a long way off, but there are more immediate options that are more actionable in the near term such as generating textures and skybox art.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Media/Advertising: Imagine the potential to automate agency work and optimize ad copy and creative on the fly for consumers. Great opportunities here for multi-modal generation that pairs sell messages with complementary visuals.  Design: Prototyping digital and physical products is a labor-intensive and iterative process. High-fidelity renderings from rough sketches and prompts are already a reality. As 3-D models become available the generative design process will extend up through manufacturing and production—text to object. Your next iPhone app or sneakers may be designed by a machine.  Social media and digital communities: Are there new ways of expressing ourselves using generative tools? New applications like Midjourney are creating new social experiences as consumers learn to create in public.

 Anatomy of a Generative AI Application&nbsp; 



<p>What will a generative AI application look like? Here are some predictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intelligence and model fine-tuning&nbsp;<br>Generative AI apps are built on top of large models like GPT-3 or Stable Diffusion. As these applications get more user data, they can fine-tune their models to: 1) improve model quality/performance for their specific problem space and; 2) decrease model size/costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can think of Generative AI apps as a UI layer and “little brain” that sits on top of the “big brain” that is the large general-purpose models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Form Factor&nbsp;<br>Today, Generative AI apps largely exist as plugins in existing software ecosystems. Code completions happen in your IDE; image generations happen in Figma or Photoshop; even Discord bots are the vessel to inject generative AI into digital/social communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are also a smaller number of standalone Generative AI web apps, such as Jasper and Copy.ai for copywriting, Runway for video editing, and Mem for note taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A plugin may be an effective wedge into bootstrapping your own application, and it may be a savvy way to surmount the chicken-and-egg problem of user data and model quality (you need distribution to get enough usage to improve your models; you need good models to attract users). We have seen this distribution strategy pay off in other market categories, like consumer/social.</p>



<p>Paradigm of Interaction&nbsp;<br>Today, most Generative AI demos are “one-and-done”: you offer an input, the machine spits out an output, and you can keep it or throw it away and try again. Increasingly, the models are becoming more iterative, where you can work with the outputs to modify, finesse, uplevel and generate variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Generative AI outputs are being used as prototypes or first drafts. Applications are great at spitting out multiple different ideas to get the creative process going (e.g. different options for a logo or architectural design), and they are great at suggesting first drafts that need to be finessed by a user to reach the final state (e.g. blog posts or code autocompletions). As the models get smarter, partially off the back of user data, we should expect these drafts to get better and better and better, until they are good enough to use as the final product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sustained Category Leadership<br>The best Generative AI companies can generate a sustainable competitive advantage by executing relentlessly on the flywheel between user engagement/data and model performance. To win, teams have to get this flywheel going by 1) having exceptional user engagement → 2) turning more user engagement into better model performance (prompt improvements, model fine-tuning, user choices as labeled training data) → 3) using great model performance to drive more user growth and engagement. They will likely go into specific problem spaces (e.g., code, design, gaming) rather than trying to be everything to everyone. They will likely first integrate deeply into applications for leverage and distribution and later attempt to replace the incumbent applications with AI-native workflows. It will take time to build these applications the right way to accumulate users and data, but we believe the best ones will be durable and have a chance to become massive.&nbsp;</p>



 Hurdles and Risks&nbsp; 



<p>Despite Generative AI’s potential, there are plenty of kinks around business models and technology to iron out. Questions over important issues like copyright, trust &amp; safety and costs are far from resolved.</p>



 Eyes Wide Open 



<p>Generative AI is still very early. The platform layer is just getting good, and the application space has barely gotten going.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be clear, we don’t need large language models to write a Tolstoy novel to make good use of Generative AI. These models are good enough today to write first drafts of blog posts and generate prototypes of logos and product interfaces. There is a wealth of value creation that will happen in the near-to-medium-term.</p>



<p>This first wave of Generative AI applications resembles the mobile application landscape when the iPhone first came out—somewhat gimmicky and thin, with unclear competitive differentiation and business models. However, some of these applications provide an interesting glimpse into what the future may hold. Once you see a machine produce complex functioning code or brilliant images, it’s hard to imagine a future where machines don’t play a fundamental role in how we work and create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If we allow ourselves to dream multiple decades out, then it’s easy to imagine a future where Generative AI is deeply embedded in how we work, create and play: memos that write themselves; 3D print anything you can imagine; go from text to Pixar film; Roblox-like gaming experiences that generate rich worlds as quickly as we can dream them up. While these experiences may seem like science fiction today, the rate of progress is incredibly high—we have gone from narrow language models to code auto-complete in several years—and if we continue along this rate of change and follow a “Large Model Moore’s Law,” then these far-fetched scenarios may just enter the realm of the possible.&nbsp;</p>



 Call for Startups 



<p>We are at the beginning of a platform shift in technology. We have already made a number of investments in this landscape and are galvanized by the ambitious founders building in this space.</p>



<p>If you are a founder and would like to meet, shoot us a note at <a href="mailto:sonya@sequoiacap.com">sonya@sequoiacap.com</a> and <a href="mailto:grady@sequoiacap.com">grady@sequoiacap.com</a>.</p>



<p>We can’t wait to hear your story.</p>



<p>PS: This piece was co-written with GPT-3. GPT-3 did not spit out the entire article, but it was responsible for combating writer’s block, generating entire sentences and paragraphs of text, and brainstorming different use cases for generative AI. Writing this piece with GPT-3 was a nice taste of the human-computer co-creation interactions that may form the new normal. We also generated illustrations for this post with Midjourney, which was SO MUCH FUN!</p>

 Successful completion of the Ethereum Merge enables the Zelcore team to switch back to adding Veil 

<p>Veil release 1.3.0.0 completes RingCT light-wallet API necessary for private use of Veil in the Zelcore Desktop light wallet. Completion of the Ethereum Merge enables the Zelcore team to switch back to adding Veil to their multi-currency light wallet.</p>

<p>This will enable users who do not want to maintain a full node to hold Veil in their own custody, with their own private keys, and to use it privately through RingCT anonymous transactions.</p>

 The ProgPoW DAG size reduction for proof of work miners is imminent 

<p>The DAG-size reduction had to wait until after the <a>1.3.0.0 Veil core release</a> to ensure that all of the popular ProgPoW mining software would support the reduction.</p>

<p>While the Veil mining community is eager to get started using mining GPUs with smaller memory before the existing code makes it impossible to mine, until we reach the deadline for the change those with larger GPUs, including former Ethereum miners are able to mine all the Veil they can possibly get!</p>

<p>The block height deadline for the 1.3.0.0 proof of work continuation is block two million, which should occur in the middle of November, maybe the 14th.</p>

<p>I suspect that we should give users another 100,000 blocks to install Veil core 1.4.0.0, making a deadline of block number 2,100,000. This, as well as the already released 1.3.0.0 is not only necessary for miners to upgrade, but for all users, exchanges, and services. If you still have Veil Core 1.2.4.1 before November, when you download 1.4.0.0, you will be able to skip 1.3.0.0. Just make sure to have updated to 1.3.0.0 or 1.4.0.0 by early November, and (assuming that we do give a later deadline for the next wallet) if you already have 1.3.0.0, then your 1.4.0.0 deadline will be about 9 weeks and 6 days later.</p>

<p>Have an opinion on this? Weigh in on <a href="http://discord.veil-project.com/">Veil’s Discord server!</a></p>

<p>Following these updates, we should only need a mandatory update when we are able to change staking from zerocoin to RingCT.</p>

 Finally, if you have any Veil balances on exchanges other than TradeOgre, please check with those exchanges 

<p>Please check our updated exchanges page for information regarding our existing and pending exchanges and some that are no longer working! These include Graviex and CREX24. You should have no trouble dealing with Graviex.</p>

<p>One factor that’s defined the tech world in the past half-decade is privacy reform. There’s been swift backlash to the unchecked era of ad tech, which went into hyperdrive with the advanced targeting capabilities of smartphones, starting around 2007 (read: iPhone).</p>



<p>The resulting privacy reform has been taxing for players in the media and mobile ecosystems (often rightly so), even those who already followed good practices. And the degree of pain they now feel is a function of switching cost in pivoting from existing paradigms and procedures.</p>



<p>This all leads up to the concept of getting it right from the beginning. That paradigm shift wouldn’t be necessary if best practices were standardized at the starting line. This is a key concept for spatial computing and XR (AR and VR) because that’s precisely where they now stand.</p>



<p>These principles drive the mission of the&nbsp;<a href="https://xrsi.org/">XR Safety Initiative</a>&nbsp;(XRSI). Founder Kavya Pearlman believes that pre-emptive action is needed to establish privacy and security standards. Because without them, we’re bound to repeat the mistakes of the smartphone era.</p>



<p>“It is not going to happen on its own,” said Pearlman. “The status quo will maintain itself, and get worse. We must make it happen […] XRSI exists to build standards, framework, and guidance so that the next generation of the Internet is open, equitable, and free from harm.”</p>

<p>"Short like bullets, yet offering bulletproof security assumptions". With these words, Shashank Agrawal's named the technology that played an essential role in stabilizing blockchain privacy solutions.<br>Although Agrawal's epic caption meant that this new technology earned the name bulletproofs, it does not explain why they’re safe, useful, and necessary for the blockchain industry. Let’s have a look at the concept of bulletproofs, how they work, and their applications.</p> Introduction: It all started with CTs and range proofs <p>During Bitcoin's early years, one of its selling points was a promise of anonymity to users. The popular belief, which was motivated both by the time’s misconception of Bitcoin’s capabilities and lack of chain analysis techniques, was that you could send and receive Bitcoin and interact with the network without leaving a digital footprint traceable to your <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">real-world identity</a>. Of course, many accepted the somewhat erroneous concept as a fact, but it all came undone as innovative efforts began to link people's real-world identities to their on-chain activity. Law enforcement agencies could suddenly trace transactions by uncovering the identities behind alphanumerical public keys.<br></p><p>As it became clear to all that <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">Bitcoin's transparency</a> meant that it could not offer absolute confidentiality, people began to devise ways to get around loopholes to achieve privacy. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">Coin mixers</a> or tumblers were one of the earliest endeavors, but one of the most successful series of attempts came under the name of <a href="https://elementsproject.org/features/confidential-transactions">Confidential Transactions</a> (CT).<br></p><p>In short, with Confidential Transactions, a user can send or receive funds without disclosing the values or addresses involved. However, due to the structural changes their implementation would imply, CTs never got integrated into the Bitcoin protocol. This is because they would prevent public validation of the blockchain. An observer could no longer verify that the number of Bitcoin arriving at one address equals the number of Bitcoin leaving another – one of the fundamental principles of the Bitcoin network.<br><br></p>Confidential Transactions obscure sender and receiver addresses. (<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-confidential-transactions">Source</a>) And so range proofs were invented <p>Range proofs are a type of zero-knowledge proof system that helps determine whether a number is negative or positive without revealing its value. In essence, a range proof could solve the problem of proving that within a Confidential Transaction, the number of Bitcoin being transacted are within a required range without actually revealing the amount.<br></p><p>Regardless of their efficacy, attaching range proofs to every transaction effectively increases their size and impairs the efficiency of the verification and storage processes. Larger transactions mean higher gas fees and lower throughput, which do not bode well for any blockchain network.<br></p><p>However, a proposal in an academic paper changed everything.</p> What are bulletproofs? <p>In December 2017, the Stanford Applied Cryptography Group proposed the concept of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf">bulletproofs</a>, defining them as a novel zero-knowledge argument of knowledge that can prove that a secret lies within a given range. Bulletproofs are short, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that can convince a verifier that an encrypted value lies within a stated range without disclosing any information about the number.<br><br></p>Oleg Andreev’s stylized illustration of the Bulletproofs range-proof protocol. (<a href="https://cathieyun.medium.com/building-on-bulletproofs-2faa58af0ba8">Source</a>)<p>Bulletproofs are a type of range proof that employs zero-knowledge proofing techniques similar to those seen in <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs</a>. Like zkSTARKs, bulletproofs do not require an <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">initial trusted setup ceremony</a> or procedure. Also, they are smaller than zkSTARKs and have significant efficiency and security. However, as stated in the academic paper, it takes longer to verify a bulletproof than a zkSNARK proof. <br></p><p>Bulletproofs attracted for the edge they provided to verifying commitments in Confidential Transactions. Privacy blockchains like Monero were quite public about their <a href="https://medium.com/digitalassetresearch/monero-becomes-bulletproof-f98c6408babf">switch to using bulletproofs</a>, and they recorded up to an 80% decrease in transaction size and fees after implementing them.<br></p> How do bulletproofs work? <p>As established earlier, bulletproofs are both secure and non-interactive, and they achieve this through a <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mrh/330tutor/ch06s02.html">discrete logarithm</a> problem and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%E2%80%93Shamir_heuristic">Fiat-Shamir heuristic</a>. A discrete logarithm problem is a type of one-way computation which makes it totally infeasible to compute an input given only the output. This makes bulletproofs unbreakable with limited computing power i.e., creates an infeasibility assumption. This last concept underlies the basis of much of modern cryptography.<br></p><p>On the other side, the Fiat-Shamir heuristic takes an interactive zero-knowledge proof and creates a digital signature based on that proof. With the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, bulletproofs can power confidential transactions by becoming the digital signature of a previously established interactive proof of knowledge. The Fiat-Shamir heuristic also converts the interactive zero-knowledge proof to a non-interactive form (bulletproofs).<br></p><p>Bulletproofs derive their security from the infeasibility assumption of discrete logarithm problem, as mentioned above. While regular range proofs increase linearly in proportion to the number of transactions bulletproofs increase logarithmically in proportion to the size of the data to be verified. This makes bulletproofs more succinct and smaller in size.<br></p><p>Bulletproofs rely on <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/pedersen-commitment.html">Pedersen commitments</a>, which allow zero-knowledge verification of values using a mathematical trick that reveals that the sum of the inputs is of a greater value than the sum of the outputs without disclosing any of the values. Pedersen commitments are cryptographic algorithms that allow a prover to commit to a certain value without revealing it or being able to change it.</p>Here's a long but great explainer video for bulletproofs What makes bulletproofs so secure? <p>Bulletproofs offered a breath of fresh air to <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">cryptographic</a> protocols that utilized range proofs through two of their most significant characteristics. <br></p><p>Firstly, bulletproofs are short, so they take up much less storage space than other range-proofing systems. If a regular transaction with a range proof occupies 10KB worth of space, a transaction with a bulletproof could save up to 80% of that size, taking up only 2KB instead.<br></p>Comparison of bulletproofs against zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs. (<a href="https://github.com/gluk64/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs">Source</a>)<p>Secondly, bulletproofs are non-interactive <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, requiring no interaction between prover and verifier. Their non-interactive nature means that they could be proved in a single exchange, unlike interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require constant back-and-forth communication between both parties. <br></p><p>Also, bulletproofs do not need trusted setups. Zero-knowledge proofs that depend on trusted setups are subject to lingering concerns from users. Everyone involved in them needs to trust the participants involved in creating the parameters to destroy the keys (toxic waste) after the event. Failure to trash the toxic waste could lead to the malicious creation of new tokens, inflating the total token supply and endangering the ecosystem. With bulletproofs, there is no such concern.<br></p><p>Furthermore, bulletproofs are storage-saving and scalable, occupying less block space and allowing faster verification times than the average range proof. However, zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs require less verification time than bulletproofs. <br></p><p>Bulletproofs require no trusted setup because they rely on publicly generated algorithms that take advantage of mathematical principles to obfuscate inputs.<br></p> Range proofs vs. bulletproofs <p>Earlier, we mentioned that bulletproofs are a type of range proof. Not only are they a variation of the latter, but bulletproofs are also a significant improvement upon range proofs. To understand how they measure up to one another, we must first explain the concept of range proofs.</p> Range proofs <p>Range proofs were the earliest forms of commitment validations applied in Confidential Transactions. They provided a way for an individual to prove that a specific commitment is a value within a given range while withholding any information about the value and its worth. For instance, using a simple range proof, you could validate that the late Queen Elizabeth was born after the first World War and before World War II without disclosing her actual birth year. <br></p><p>Range proofs were primarily adopted by privacy-enhancing cryptographic protocols and used to obfuscate transaction amounts on networks like <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">Monero</a>. It’s worth noting that Monero has implemented an even more efficient range-proving system called <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/2020/12/24/Bulletproofs+-in-Monero.html">Bulletproofs+</a>. When you transfer coins on the Monero blockchain, for instance, Bulletproofs+ proves that your payment is a positive number without revealing how much you paid.</p> How bulletproofs improved on range proofs? <p>Range proofs were effective in shielding transaction amounts and offering <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">privacy</a> on publicly distributed ledgers. Yet, they had one shortcoming that rendered them impractical in the long run. According to the Stanford paper, when it was published, all implementations of confidential transactions used range proofs, and the proof size was linear in n.<br></p><p>Range proofs contain the number of outputs and bits that make up the range; hence, they scale linearly. Their linear scalability resulted in increased size, especially when verifying multiple transactions. Furthermore, range proofs are attached to every confidential transaction, making them larger than regular, unshielded transactions and a less sustainable long-term option for any cryptographic protocol.<br></p><p>At the time, all blockchain networks had fixed block sizes. A larger transaction size meant that fewer transactions would fit into a block. With increased adoption, the blockchain size would increase at a faster rate, limiting the ability of regular people to participate as nodes due to storage constraints.<br></p><p>Bulletproofs solved the storage problem with their less-than-1KB size, reducing transaction costs and size without compromising security. Also, with bulletproofs, a prover could aggregate several transaction range proofs for their corresponding outputs as a single proof. Instead of having a range proof for every transaction and their outputs, you can aggregate them all into one short bulletproof, saving space immensely.</p> Applications of bulletproofs <p>We have established that bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that have shown tremendous promise towards reducing transaction size and costs, powering Confidential Transactions, and helping to aid blockchain privacy. Here are some applications of bulletproofs in cryptographic protocols:</p> Enabling confidential transactions <p>Perhaps the most popular application of bulletproofs is in confidential transactions. Notably, Monero uses bulletproofs to power its <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">RingCT</a> technology. They switched from using Schnorr signatures and Borromean ring signatures to lightweight bulletproofs. The initial ring signatures were effective, but they increased the size of an average RingCT exponentially.<br></p><p>After incorporating bulletproofs into the Monero network and deploying the rewritten version of the original, transaction sizes on Monero were reduced by at least 80%, along with transaction fees. Thus, bulletproofs have effectively replaced range proofs in confidential transactions. <br></p><p>Bulletproofs are also designed to enable Confidential Transactions on public blockchain networks like <a href="https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/confidential-transaction-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>. If implemented, they will reduce the blockchain size moving forward, and transaction fees may also drop.</p> Supporting multi-party computation protocols <p>Bulletproofs can be applied in <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation/">multi-party computation</a> protocols that allow several secret-holding entities to jointly generate a range proof for their secret values without disclosing them. <br></p><p>Sometimes, a transaction could be so complex that it requires inputs from multiple parties. With such an MPC protocol, instead of producing separate range proofs for each input, all the proofs can be aggregated as one short bulletproof. Bulletproofs are more efficient in cases like these than ordinary range proofs, saving time and space.</p> Enabling confidential smart contracts <p>Blockchains like Ethereum support smart contract deployment. Ethereum is a public blockchain solution, which means that the smart contracts are equally public including their parameters. The lack of privacy of the smart contract's parameters can expose users to several risks such as on-chain surveillance, exposure of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">MEV</a>, etc. <br></p><p>Several developers have proposed introducing privacy to smart contracts with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zkSNARKs</a>. While the former is possible but rather expensive, zkSNARKs require a trusted setup, which is not ideal for such measures.<br></p><p>Bulletproofs, with no trusted setup, fit the bill as a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system. However, using bulletproofs to power smart contract privacy may still be an expensive venture.</p> Shortening proof of solvency <p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges use the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1008.pdf">Provisions protocol</a> to prove their solvency without disclosing any other data or opening their books to the public. The Provisions protocol utilizes range proofs to prevent exchanges from padding their books with fake accounts and negative balances.<br></p><p>As with range proofs, the more customers an exchange has, the larger the range proof size. With bulletproofs, proofs of solvency can be much smaller, up to 300 times lesser, than regular range proofs. Bulletproofs have also been applied as a replacement for sigma protocols.</p> Closing thoughts <p>Bulletproofs have proven to be secure and reliable for their primary goals. They enable Confidential Transactions and bring privacy to solvency examinations, smart contracts, and multi-party computation protocols.<br></p><p>Bulletproofs offer privacy to public blockchains like Bitcoin, which can resolve the widespread privacy concerns associated with traditional blockchain networks.<br></p><p>However, several other types of ZK proofs, most importantly zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs, are able to surpass bulletproofs in terms of features. These other types are less resource-intensive and are cost-friendly. Because of this, recent developments of <a href="http://pantherprotocol.io">privacy-preserving protocols</a> and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">scaling solutions</a> have skewed towards zkSNARKs and zkSTARKs instead of bulletproofs.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Leveraging the flexibility of zk-SNARKs to make private DeFi transactions cheap and&nbsp;easy <p>Aztec has been working hard to make general purpose zero-knowledge transactions as easy as possible, and rapid advancements in zk cryptography are helping to make those transactions as cheap as they are easy. In this post we want to describe a fundamental technology that helps us get&nbsp;there.</p> Tradeoffs in the Design of Proving&nbsp;Systems <p>In a zero knowledge proving system, two parties engage each other so that one can convince the other that some statement is true. One party, which we call a prover, would like to convince another party, a verifier, that they have some particular kind of information while sharing as little of that information as possible. This often breaks down cleanly into two phases: proof generation, and proof verification. Ideally, both of these would be fast and computationally efficient, but the reality is one often has to accept tradeoffs between the two. (In an absolute computational sense, proof construction is generally more expensive than verification, thus when we talk about, for example, ‘fast’ construction, we mean relative to some meaningful baseline, not relative to verification).</p><p>In the setting of Aztec’s zk-rollup, there are actually three distinct parties engaging in the creation and verification of SNARK proofs, each with different computational powers and constraints:</p>  User: the user possesses secret information, such as their balances and their transaction history, which they would like to keep secret while still engaging in transactions and interactions with DeFi protocols. They generate proofs in a web browser, typically on a low-power device such as a&nbsp;phone.  Rollup Provider: the rollup provider batches together and compresses user transactions, a process that involves proof generation as well as proof verification, at least in a sense (see more on recursion below). They generally have access to commercial grade hardware.  Blockchain: the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a highly-constrained computational environment where every operation has a varying, but typically expensive, cost that must be paid by the users in transaction fees. The EVM is responsible for verifying one proof (which encapsulates many other&nbsp;proofs).  <p>To bring affordable, truly zero knowledge transactions to Aztec’s users, we blend together different proving systems (different, tasty flavors of PlonK, in particular) across recursion boundaries. For users, this means reduced computational cost during client-side proof generation, as well as reduced monetary cost through minimized computation on the&nbsp;EVM.</p> Recursion <p>Recursion is based on the following powerful observation: the verification of a zero knowledge proof is itself a computation that can be attested to by a zero knowledge proof. Said differently, there is nothing stopping us from replacing the action of verifying a SNARK proof p with a proof p* that p has been verified correctly. Of course, by doing this we have introduced p* which itself must be verified. But this starts to suggest a notion for how two different proving systems might be combined or ‘composed’.</p><p>Let’s view a proving system as a pair of algorithms (P, V), a prover and a verifier. Suppose we have one proving system, (P, V), which has cheap proof construction but expensive proof verification, and another, (P*, V*), which has expensive construction and cheap verification. Is there a way to compose them and reap the benefits of both? Consider the following process:</p>  Construct a proof 𝛑 under proving system&nbsp;P  Construct 𝛑* under proving system P*, where p* is a proof that attests to the correct verification of 𝛑 under&nbsp;V  Verify 𝛑*.  <p>Ultimately, the benefit here is derived from the fact that each of these three steps can be performed by parties with different computational capabilities. A version of this idea is exactly what enables Aztec Connect to make cheap, private transactions available to its users. The two proving systems in question there are PlonK and TurboPlonK, where the former has cheap verification and the latter has efficient proof construction. A simplified outline of how we use this composition technique in our rollup is as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The Client constructs a proof 𝛑-Client using TurboPlonK, a varietal of PlonK with custom gates (more on that below) to allow for efficient proof generation on constrained devices. They send 𝛑-Client to the Rollup Provider.  The Rollup Provider takes in 𝛑-Client and constructs a Standard (i.e. non-Turbo) PlonK proof 𝛑-Rollup that 𝛑-Client has been verified correctly. In this sense, the Rollup Provider has been constrained by the high cost of TurboPlonK verification and Standard PlonK proof construction. But the rollup provider is mighty, and can handle both while still making money and creating massive savings for users. The proof 𝛑-Rollup is sent to Ethereum.  The EVM verifies 𝛑-Rollup via a smart contract <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/blockchain/contracts/verifier/StandardVerifier.sol">StandardVerifier.sol</a> deployed to Ethereum.  <p>Note: to further optimize the compression process, an Aztec rollup provider actually engages in three steps of recursion, two Turbo-to-Turbo (using the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/specs/aztec-connect/src/rollup_circuit.md">rollup</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/specs/aztec-connect/src/root_rollup_circuit.md">root rollup</a> circuits, assembled in a way explained <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/privacy-for-pennies-scaling-aztecs-zkrollup-9f2b36615cc6">here</a>) and one Turbo-to-Standard (the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/blob/master/specs/aztec-connect/src/root_verifier_circuit.md">root verifier</a> circuit).</p> Interlude for Nerds: Custom&nbsp;Gates <p>We want to illustrate, in a contrived, baby case, where the tradeoffs between Turbo and Standard PlonK come from. Our goal is to blackbox cryptographic concepts as much as possible, but the reader is warned that we get just a bit technical here.</p><p>Scenario: you work as a protocol designer for a company called JazzTec. You have designed and implemented a zero knowledge proving system called PlunK that allows users to prove statements that include combinations of multiplication and addition like a + b = c, (a + b) · c = d, a · b · c = d, and so on. Your small proving system contains only one kind of gate, written symbolically as</p><p>Here the w represent “wires” with l = left, r = right, and o = output, and q is a “selector” that is used to switch between multiplication and addition. JazzTec’s circuit writers have made an app where a user (or prover) must show that they have found numbers a, b, c, and d such&nbsp;that</p><p>The circuit writers provide the users a template:</p><p>Schematically, the circuit looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>By filling in the template with values a, b, z, c and d like&nbsp;this:</p><p>the user can prove knowledge of values that satisfy the claim. (Well, almost. We’re ignoring the fact that a link must be enforced between the two instances of z. This relates to the notion of copy constraints, which is very important in general but not essential for making our present&nbsp;point).</p><p>After using PlunK for a while, JazzTec has decided to add a new feature which will require users to prove statements of the form x⁵ = y. (This is perhaps not such a made-up example. The recently developed <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/458.pdf">Poseidon hash</a>, for example, designed specifically for zero-knowledge proving systems, requires computation of fifth powers). How can we implement this type of operation using PlunK? Well, our expression can be decomposed into a series of multiplications and one addition&nbsp;as</p><p>Thus, the piece of the circuit designed to handle this operation might look like&nbsp;this:</p><p>With this new component added to the circuit template, an execution trace could look like&nbsp;this:</p><p>Now let’s consider an alternative approach. What if instead of using the more minimalistic setup of PlunK, we extend the proving system to one with native support for statements of the form x⁵ = y. The key idea here is that the circuit writer, who dictates to the prover the form of the statement to be proven, can add a new selector that introduces an additional interpretation for each row in the execution trace. Let’s flesh this&nbsp;out.</p><p>We’ll call our new, extended proving system TangoPlunK. It contains a new custom selector, and its generic gate has the&nbsp;form</p><p>We see that the new q-custom selector switches on or off the custom functionality; when q-custom is 1, we have our fifth-power equation, and when q-custom is 0, we have the old standard PlunK equation. The operations involved in x⁵ = y can now be encapsulated into a single gate that looks like&nbsp;this</p><p>Using TangoPlunK, the execution trace for our program would simply&nbsp;be</p><p>To summarize, what used to take 6 gates now takes 3, so we have realized a 50% reduction in circuit size by switching to TangoPlunK!</p> A Quick Caveat for TurboNerds <p>The experienced reader might have noticed that introducing a custom gate for handling fifth-power type operations also increases the degree of the identity to be proven. In general, this can mean an increase in computational work for the prover, potentially counteracting some of the benefit gained from a reduction in circuit size. In our toy example, the degree of the identity doubled (from 3 with PlunK to 6 with TangoPlunK) but the size of the full circuit was halved (coincidentally, from 6 to 3). If our program contained a smaller proportion of computations representable by our custom gate, we’d have to reconsider its utility. In practice, such tradeoffs have to be taken into&nbsp;account.</p><p>It’s also important to note that one can conceive of useful custom gates that do not increase the degree of the identity, or at least not to the point where the prover feels the effect. This is the case, for example, in the original <a href="https://docs.zkproof.org/pages/standards/accepted-workshop3/proposal-turbo_plonk.pdf">TurboPlonK</a> proving system, where the critical innovation is the introduction of custom gates that facilitate efficient elliptic curve scalar multiplications in the context of computing Pedersen&nbsp;hashes.</p> Prover and Verifier&nbsp;Costs <p>Our example of PlunK and TangoPlunK is meant to highlight how computational tradeoffs can be made in the design of a proving system based on the observation that (1) prover complexity is fundamentally tied to the number of gates in the circuit, and (2) verifier complexity is relatively independent of circuit size but increases with the complexity of the claim or identity being&nbsp;proven.</p><p>For our sample program, TangoPlunK proof construction is cheap because the introduction of our custom gate allows for a substantial reduction in circuit size. Verification is relatively expensive in TangoPlunk because not only does the verifier see no benefit from the reduced circuit size, it must contend with a an identity that has increased in complexity relative to&nbsp;PlunK.</p><p>More concretely, in proving systems such as PlonK, a large portion of the computational cost for both the prover and the verifier is incurred through the need to compute expensive elliptic curve scalar multiplications. For the prover, these operations arise from the need to compute polynomial commitments in the construction of a proof 𝛑. The number of scalar multiplications that need to be performed is proportional to the degree of the polynomials being committed to, which is in turn proportional to the number of gates in the circuit. (For those not familiar with the important role that polynomials play in SNARKs, we suggest <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html">this blog post</a> by Vitalik Buterin).</p><p>For the verifier, on the other hand, scalar multiplications are primarily required in reconstructing the original claim or identity using the commitments received from the prover in 𝛑. In particular, an additional selector in the identity directly results in an additional scalar multiplication during verification. Take a look, for example, at Step 9 from the Standard PlonK verification algorithm:</p><p>The q’s in this expression are the selectors of Standard PlonK, and the operation “·” represents elliptic curve scalar multiplication. With more selectors, this lovely expression gets even lovelier&nbsp;😍.</p><p>The example for nerds illustrates this tradeoff: In comparison with standard PlunK, TangoPlunK allows for a 50% reduction in the number of gates, lessening prover cost (at least in terms of commitments), while increasing the verifier complexity (via addition of the selector q-custom).</p><p>Of course, the reality we’re alluding to with this example is the similar tradeoff between the Standard PlonK proving system and TurboPlonK. That’s why in our applications at Aztec, like Aztec Connect, we arrange for the prover to use TurboPlonK and for the verifier to use Standard&nbsp;PlonK.</p> Going further <p>Zero knowledge cryptography has seen an explosion of activity in the past few years. At Aztec, we’re upgrading from TurboPlonK to what we call UltraPlonK, which is simply TurboPlonK + <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/315.pdf">Plookup</a>, a protocol we designed for using lookup tables to further speed up proof construction at additional cost to the verifier. At the opposite extreme, we’ve designed a protocol called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1167.pdf">Fflonk</a> that allows extremely efficient verification at additional cost to the prover. Fflonk, which harnesses the commitment scheme of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/081.pdf">this paper</a> (which we call SHPLONK), has the potential to reduce our EVM execution costs by&nbsp;35%.</p> Conclusion <p>Zero knowledge proofs are an extremely cool, cutting-edge concept with enormous technological potential. What we describe here will be considered baby steps in harnessing that potential to create a better internet. Thanks for joining us on the way&nbsp;there!</p><p>Thanks to Jon Wu, Ariel Gabizon, Suyash Bagad, Innokentii Sennovskii and Guillaume Drevon for helpful comments and discussion.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/proof-compression-a318f478d575">Proof Compression</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">Aztec Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A brand is the heart and soul of a company, guiding and supporting company culture and the driver of business growth. We are setting up Zaisan for long-term success. Aiming to be easy to mind and easy to find once web3 and blockchain mass adoption hits.</p>







<p>After changing the name from Europechain to Zaisan, the organisation also underwent significant changes. The perfect time for a rebrand.</p>



<p>The complete process took 8 months, starting with intensive brand strategy sessions with key stakeholders. From there we entered an extensive process with our branding agency, resulting in a 79-page Brand Guidelines document. The final stage was infusing the brand in all marketing communication, including our social channels, merchandising, and the revamped website.</p>



<p>We hope you will enjoy the brand as much as we do. We want to thank our partners, from communication strategists to graphic and UX designers and back-end developers for their hard work. An amazing result.</p>



<p>For those of you, that (like me) are fascinated about some of the reasoning behind the choices we made, below you find a more in-depth look.</p>



 Zaisan’s name 



<p>A clear link to blockchain and its impact on what (digital) ownership means and how it enables prosperity.</p>



<p>In Japanese, Zaisan means PROPERTY, ASSETS, ESTATE, FORTUNE.</p>



 Zaisan’s vision 



<p>Where we aim to be. Our aspirations and impact. A guiding beacon.</p>



<p>Zaisan wants to become a global leader in unleashing the power of next-gen tech solutions to improve and secure how people interact, transact, and live.</p>



 Zaisan’s brand voice 







<p>The personality and emotion infused into the company’s communications. It encompasses everything from the words and language we use, to the personality and image our marketing assets aim to invoke.</p>



  Dynamic  Knowledgeable  Confident  Revolutionary  Tasteful  Impactful  



 Zaisan’s core values 



<p>Our fundamental beliefs. They reflect what we value as an organisation. They dictate behaviour, support the vision, shape culture, and educate customers on what we are about.</p>



<p>Agility – Self-Leadership – Impact – Partnerships – High Energy and Drive – Enjoyment – Next-gen – Knowledge.</p>



 The Zaisan symbol 







<p>A simple yet distinctive geometric form showing two blocks linked together, literally expressing ‘blockchain’ but in a subtle, abstract way. Its abstraction enriches its symbolic potential by not tying it down. Among the images embedded within it are: chainlinks (connecting businesses and consumers to blockchain); DNA (suggesting Zaisan as a blueprint of future technological evolution); and even a handshake (forging new business communities).</p>



<p>Its simplicity means it’s easy to scale without losing clarity or distinctiveness. And while the ‘Z’ of Zaisan is not literally present, it is visible in the negative space at a 45-degree angle.</p>







<p>The lock-up brings together the dynamism of the logo with a bold, angular typeface expressing the future-facing, revolutionary ethos of the brand.</p>



 Zaisan’s colour palette 







<p>The Zaisan colour palette is grounded in black, white, and subtle shades of grey. All of these centre around its signature Electric Yellow, which is supported in turn by a dash of its inverse purple tone, functioning as an accent colour. Note that Cinematic Black is not a pure black but a slightly lighter variant.</p>



 Supporting graphic language 







<p>Zaisan’s graphic language builds on the geometry of the logo and extends it to facilitate the expression of the brand values and services across all touch points.</p>



<p>The graphic language plays a significant role in our brand coding and you will see it in basically all our visual communication.</p>

 Congratulations on The Merge — now prepare to cure the hangover with a strong dose of&nbsp;privacy! <p>The transition to a POS consensus algorithm has been an aim since the very beginning of the Ethereum network and is a major milestone for the community. So congratulations are in order! It was a long time&nbsp;coming.</p><p>In fact, the transition was so important to so many of you that you managed to achieve this fundamental adjustment to the core protocol affecting the hundreds of billions of $ worth tied up in this global decentralised infrastructure. This shows that when something really matters to a community it can lead to real change at a global&nbsp;scale.</p><p>We are convinced that it is necessary for a similar urgency and mobilisation to grow around the right to privacy and anonymity in our digital lives. If it is possible for POS, it is possible for&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>For many people, privacy in and of itself doesn’t mean a whole lot. What is more important are the things it enables: dignity, autonomy, the ability to make mistakes and learn and the ability to make independent decisions. And, importantly, privacy enables security.</p><p>Just last week, the Nym team was in Ukraine for the Kyiv Tech Summit, joined by none other than the Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov and Vitalik Buterin who arrived for the final day to show his&nbsp;support.</p><p>The relationship between privacy and security were major themes throughout the summit and included in discussions about The Merge. New risks of privacy, censorship resistance and MEV were raised at the Security Leaders panel by Nym panellist Jaya Klara Brekke, to fellow panellists were Dyma Budorin, Co-Founder of Hacken and Peter Robinson, Technical Director &amp; Applied Cryptographer at Consensys. Below we will go into more detail on what is at stake in the transition — nothing less than the security and censorship resistance of the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p> Validator privacy — why does it&nbsp;matter <p>Ethereum is transitioning to POS. In short, this means that instead of nodes all competing with each other in a race to compute the next block on the blockchain, validator nodes take turns doing so one by one, thereby radically reducing energy consumption and&nbsp;cost.</p><p>The way this works is that validators put up a stake in order to get a turn at computing a block. A validator is chosen at random and in order to make sure that validator does not misbehave, a ‘committee’ of other validators check the block and sign&nbsp;it.</p><p>This results in two&nbsp;things:</p>  Validators need to know in advance who is going to create the next&nbsp;block  there is a lot of resultant communication between validators  <p>Now add to that the fact that currently, network layer traffic is visible and IP addresses of validators can be linked and a number of problems crop up: knowing who is next in turn and their IP address means that the given validator becomes vulnerable to a number of attacks, from MEV Bots and DDoS attacks to targeted censorship.</p><p>We don’t think that burying your head in the sand is a good idea for such an important issue especially when you, the community will have to bear the dire consequences. Addressing the problem of privacy in Ethereum at a network level could solve not just the MEV problem, but also contribute to both censorship resistance and traffic analysis resistance of the network in general and provide you all the privacy protection that you deserve. Here is&nbsp;how…</p> Validator privacy — protecting against censorship at the network&nbsp;layer <p>It is possible to protect validator IP addresses and thereby radically improve the security of POS. IP addresses leak with every tx or message that is sent. And a good VPN is just not enough because traffic patterns can effectively be used to deanonymise communications.</p><p>Traffic analysis is one of the primary means through which people are de-anonymised in network infrastructures including blockchains. It has been known for a long time that despite the pseudonymity of wallet addresses, simple traffic analysis can reveal a person’s identity and much more. This is the case for Bitcoin, Ethereum as well as for privacy coins and traditional messaging apps. It is the case for communications between clients and nodes, as well as between validators.</p><p>Providing network layer privacy by default ensures that the patterns of communication cannot be analysed as peer-to-peer tx are broadcast across the network. Mixnets, that protect traffic at the network layer, solves this problem by encrypting packets, making them all uniform and mixing them through three layers of mix nodes, effectively obscuring metadata and patterns of communication.</p> Manipulation and censorship resistance <p>Validator privacy also contributes to censorship resistance. When an attacker knows in advance who is making the next block, that means it is vulnerable to an intervening authority who might censor a given block. Of course another validator could simply pick it up in the next turn, however it is important to emphasise that this requires a sufficient amount of validators, spread across jurisdictions and geographical areas to ensure enough network redundancy should a set of validators face pressure from censors in parts of the world. Validator privacy adds essential security by obscuring which validators are creating a given block, thereby protecting the network from pressures to manipulate or drop&nbsp;blocks.</p> Join the Universal Privacy&nbsp;Alliance <p>Nym is a mixnet that protects the network layer — key for validator privacy thereby contributing essential security to the Ethereum&nbsp;network.</p><p>The privacy problems in Web3 are major. In some senses even more so than in Web 2.0 due to the public nature of ledgers. There is however a new generation of projects that are working to solve privacy at all layers of the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Be part of making privacy the next major milestone. Not just on the Ethereum network but all new network infrastructures that are keen to build digital autonomy.</p><p>A new alliance is launching and will be open to those keen to take action — find out more and register your interest on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/congratulations-on-the-merge-now-to-cure-the-hangover-with-a-strong-dose-of-privacy-c4b0c8eb46ea">Congratulations on The Merge — now to cure the hangover with a strong dose of privacy!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

An unbounded bond uses SILK or SHD that is minted after the inception of the protocol. A treasury bond sells digital assets from the ShadeDAO (such as SCRT or ATOM) that were acquired from protocol revenue, bonded bonds, or unbounded bonds&nbsp;sales.</p> Collateral Types <p>There are four different types of collateral deposited by users into the bond contracts:</p>  Yield Bearing  Stablecoins  Store of&nbsp;Value  Liquidity Tokens  <p>Yield bearing asset are any sort of collateral that is capable of generating yield without experiencing the risk of impermanence loss. Examples of yield generating assets are tokens such as ATOM and SCRT which are all capable of being staked to generate&nbsp;yield.</p><p>Stablecoins are digital assets that hold a target price and are able to be redeemed or sold at the target peg regardless of market conditions. The quality of a stablecoin is based on six variables:</p>  Liquidity  Bridge risk  Smart contract&nbsp;risk  Degree of decentralization  Volatility  Stability mechanisms  <p>The higher the quality of stablecoin, the more likely the ShadeDAO will issue a bond to acquired said stablecoin. These stablecoins can be used to back Silk issuance, or to deepen liquidity on Shade Apps (such as ShadeSwap).</p><p>Scarce stores of value are non-yield bearing assets that are volatile, but with economic levers focused on value accrual due to a combination of long term scarcity and utility. Examples of this are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero — all of which have deep liquidity, scarcity mechanisms (such as halvenings), and have historical relevance.</p><p>Liquidity tokens are service providing and yield-bearing assets that incur the risk of potential impermanence loss. Liquidity tokens are mathematical claims on a portion of tokens tied to liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges such as ShadeSwap. The more liquidity tokens owned by the ShadeDAO, the better the user experience and service provided by ShadeSwap.</p> Collateral List <p>The following is the initial list of prioritized assets targeted by&nbsp;bonds:</p>  stkd-SCRT  stkd-SCRT / SHD&nbsp;LP  <p>Initially, the ShadeDAO will be heavily focused on acquiring yield bearing assets and liquidity tokens during the beginning of the protocol’s lifecycle. Overtime, there should be a steady shift towards holding more and more stablecoins and scarce stores of value as adoption of Silk and Shade Protocol primitives solidifies.</p> Conclusion <p>Bonds are a powerful DeFi primitive that will help bootstrap, scale, and grow the ShadeDAO. Governance carefully manages the issuance of ShadeBonds so as to not introduce damaging liquidity shocks into the market. If balanced properly, bonds can be Shade Protocol’s primary tool for gathering protocol owned liquidity and&nbsp;yield.</p><p>With more key primitives being funded and built, more community members getting involved with Shade Protocol, and more supporters and partners than ever helping to ensure our global growth, the future has never been brighter for Shade Protocol and&nbsp;Silk.</p> Join The Shade Protocol Community <p><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs">Medium</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/kBRQJRsP">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.shadeprotocol.io/shade-protocol/">Learn</a></p>

<p>As my friend Cliff says, when a person’s lashes out against another person the reverberation of the blow will resonate back into your own arm. Jeffrey Strahl, <a href="https://guymcpherson.com/resistance-is-the-only-ethical-response-to-near-term-extinction/">a UC Berkeley mathematics instructor who started out working for Bechtel on nuclear power plant construction</a>, has cultivated an extensive email list over the past two years. After Jason removed him from our Discourse board, Jeffrey appears to have taken it upon himself to misrepresent our work to his network. Jason told me this had happened previously, and he opted to remain a member of the group to monitor what Jeff was saying about us. It was really the only reason for him to stay, because the vast majority of the content Jeff shared was centered on the health freedom arena and clearly the problem is so much bigger than that.</p>
<p>I made my video to set the record straight after Jeffrey lied about me and to educate people about computational agents and game theory in digital artificial societies. I am sharing two emails Jason sent to Jeff’s list and another Jeff actively posts on. The truth ALWAYS shows itself. I imagine anyone who values the work Jason and I have been doing will see this for the petty, sour grapes that it is. The only person Jeff is hurting at this point is himself. If you care for his well being, it would be a kindness to tell him to put down his hammer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I must correct some things that Jeffrey has stated below about Alison and the Wrench in the Gears Working Group Discourse Forum.</p>
<p>First of all, the forum is my project, not Alison’s. Although it is based largely on her work and I do consult with her, it was my idea, I set it up, I wrote the guidelines and I administer and moderate it.</p>
<p>Alison&nbsp;did not&nbsp;call Jeff a PsyOp. Here is a post and video by Alison explain what happened and includes screen shots of the thread.&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/12/is-terrain-an-artificial-society-a-response-to-jeff-strahl-re-psy-ops">https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/09/12/is-terrain-an-artificial-society-a-response-to-jeff-strahl-re-psy-ops</a>&nbsp;Rather than just take Jeff’s word, please see for yourself.</p>
<p>I removed Jeff from the forum because it was clear to me (from the beginning actually) that he was not interested in participating in research the forum was specifically created for. Which actually include a wide range of subjects but with a common them and particular focus.&nbsp;<a href="https://discourse.wrenchinthegears.org/categories">https://discourse.wrenchinthegears.org/categories</a></p>
<p>By the way, I invited Jeff at the suggestion of Alison. She (and we) genuinely want more people to seriously engage with and add to the research we are doing. I reluctantly added Jeff even though I know he has misrepresented Alison’s work in the past. I now see that was a mistake based on his comments below.</p>
<p>On the Poornima Wagh situation, to me the whole thing appeared to be big boondoggle but I agree with Alison’s point that all this focus on credentials is way off and actually promotes “the experts” as well as “verified credentials”, which will be part of the digital ID system on blockchain. This not about whether or not you agree with or trust Wagh or not. That is missing the point.</p>
<p>Regarding Jeff’s comment, “Last i looked, there was an item listed there about the&nbsp;“Truther Community,” which had been deleted, but the headline was left behind.”</p>
<p>What is the point of Jeff pointing this out? What is he suggesting here? By the way, the&nbsp;full&nbsp;title&nbsp;was,”TRUST in the Truther Community? Vetting the Vetters, Authoritarian Fact Checkers, Blockchain Cults, Biostatistics, Voronoi in Radiobiology and Cancer, Voronoi in the Liver”. I don’t know what this article would have said as the person deleted it. The title has me curious though. I would likely agree with it based on the title. If Jeff’s suggestion is that we are against the “Truther Community” he would be wrong. I have been involved with 9/11 truth since 2002. I personally don’t like the term “Truther Community” and I certainly would have challenged the author on using that term but there is a very serious problem within these spaces around trust vetters, fact checkers and more. And I’m not talking about the official fact checkers either. I’m hoping this person posts what they are working on (preferably without the “Truther” tag, or at least with a qualifier about that label).</p>
<p>Jeff also writes:<br>
“Back in January and February, Alison included in her long videos segments&nbsp;regarding members of the&nbsp;“freedom” community such as RFK Jr, Steve&nbsp;Kirsch, and Doctors Malone, McCullough and Kory, &nbsp;who continue to push the idea that the virus exists, that there is a real pandemic, and that&nbsp;“alternative treatments” are needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sent those in Lockdown Times editions. By Spring, i sensed she was now saying (via for&nbsp;example Twitter) that she was through dealing with the virus matter at all, since anyone who still believed in it was not&nbsp;worth communicating to anyway.”</p>
<p>Here again Jeff appears to be misleading or implying something. Alison included those public figures in the conversation to talk explicitly about the cybernetic governance system, behavioral economics and weaponized narrative.&nbsp;Not the virus matter!&nbsp;Her position is the same now as it was then even though her understanding has expanded.</p>
<p>Here’s a clip of her talking about RFK, Jr. it’s about his roll in pushing early treatment, which directly connects to impact finance and cybernetic governance.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/UdBDebgIjjU">https://youtu.be/UdBDebgIjjU</a>&nbsp;She questions the framing “mismanaging a pandemic” within the understanding of what this narrative is serving.</p>
<p>Here’s a segment where Alison and I talk about Kirsch and Malone. Again, it is about narrative and impact finance, not the virus question.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/J_2sBImR9-A?t=7611">https://youtu.be/J_2sBImR9-A?t=7611</a></p>
<p>Jeff further writes:<br>
“By Spring, i sensed she was now saying (via for&nbsp;example Twitter) that she was through dealing with the virus matter at all, since anyone who still believed in it was not&nbsp;worth communicating to anyway.&nbsp; And now she seems to think anyone who discusses the matter is part o a PsyOp”</p>
<p>This another gross misrepresentation. Other than a few off comments early on, she’s never really dealt with “the virus matter”. Her discussions have always been in the context of digital governance, impact investing and hive mind/global brain/web3/etc..</p>
<p>Jeff:<br>
“Basically, she respects only those who focus on exactly what she focuses on.”</p>
<p>This isn’t about respecting people or not. She’s just focused on very specific threats we are facing from a specific lens and is looking for others to join in on this investigation. If someone like Jeff doesn’t agree that the issues she and the rest of us on the forum are focused on they do not have to engage with us or us with them. This is clearly the case with Jeff, which is why I removed Jeff from the forum. He has different concerns and commitments, which mostly deal with the virus and Russia apparently.</p>
<p>In the future if Jeff does promote items from Alison or others from our forum on his Lockdown Times,&nbsp; I hope he doesn’t lie or misrepresent them as he has done here.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Alright, one last time then I’m done. Here are my responses to Jeff’s Reader’s Digest of Alison, Lynn and I’s presentation below.</p>
<p>JEFFREY:&nbsp;“1:15:00 – Discussion back in 1946 (among those putting forth early visions of the global brain, etc) of “social unrest.” Alison thought it was weird to be discussing that topic in 1946. Say what?&nbsp;In fact, there was a very high level of social unrest that year“</p>
<p>Alison wasn’t saying that there wasn’t social unrest back then. What she was talking about was viewing social unrest within the context of creating a “world brain”. The quote she read from Reiser’s The World Sensorium book is, “Social unrest is inevitable so long as this process of differentiation continues for there can be no stability until embryonic maturity is reached.” This is early cybernetic thinking. I can’t imagine Jeff didn’t know what she was talking about. He’s obviously watching all her talks. His “reaction” is to a complete misrepresentation. He completely removed the context of the conversation. Why is that?</p>
<p>JEFFREY: “1:58:00 – People prominent in the Metaverse milieu, like Scott Stornetta just happened to be there at the time to participate in this project. Really?&nbsp;As if this entire “project” happening because … it is happening, just something which has been happening for a long time, which has a mind of its own.&nbsp;As if this process isn’t anchored in the needs and imperatives of the social/economic/political ruling system.“</p>
 This is blatant deception. Nowhere does Alison say or even suggest that this project is just happening because it is happening and has been happening for a long time. WTF? Or that this isn’t serving a ruling system. I honestly don’t even know how Jeff crafted this framing. It’s quite creative but is not representative. Please people, listen to the talk yourself.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/ddx4z6iTM6o">https://youtu.be/ddx4z6iTM6o</a>&nbsp;The point she was making in that segment was about how this system is actually being built by our friends, family and neighbors. And yes, it is anchored in the needs and imperatives of the ruling system (which does go back). We’ve always maintained that position so what is Jeff talking about here? We just think that not enough attention is paid to the everyday people actually building and managing this thing. That was the point of this segment, which was completely missed or ignored by Jeff. 
 &nbsp; 
 JEFFREY:&nbsp;“A recent interview by Alison and Jason of a Swiss psychologist named Arlette including her statement that&nbsp;she is not interested in systemic change, only in personal change, which is how she sees the world changing.&nbsp;I don’t know if Alison and Jason agree, but they did not express a different perspective.“ 
 &nbsp; 
 Arlette is not psychologist (at least that I’m aware of – unless I missed something). She was sharing her personal experiences as a patient within the Swiss mental health system. Her statement was that her personal process was through personal change. It was clear to me that she wants systemic change but doesn’t know how to make it happen. So her approach is to pull out and to work on herself. I agree that must be part of the process of change for all of us. I think it’s vital in fact but not the only thing. How can Jeff suggest that Alison or I are not interested in systemic change when we have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours putting out material exposing and speaking out against this system? The way he wrote that implies something he knows to be false. You can watch that actual interview here:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/arfNOiXB8CU">https://youtu.be/arfNOiXB8CU</a><br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 JEFFREY:&nbsp;2:28:00 – “It was the highly regarded president Eisenhower who in fact gave “birth” to ARPA, the forerunner of DARPA, in January ’58.“ 
 &nbsp; 
 Correct, it was originally called ARPA and later changed to DARPA and Eisenhower set it up. She initially misspoke when she said DARPA but then read off some text that had the corrected name in full, “Advanced Research Projects Agency”. What is the point or reasoning for you nit picking over such nonsense? It’s ridiculous.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 
 2:38:00 – “Comments about how everyone’s “right to have a job” is being taken away. Speaking personally, i do not regard having a job as a “human right.” It is an imposition upon the population of the world, unprecedented till the advent of capitalism,&nbsp;i.e. the Enclosures,&nbsp;when a population consisting largely of self-subsistence farmers working hereditary land, with access to the Commons, was pushed off their lands and enclosed from the Commons.&nbsp;These people are required for the first time to acquire money in order to buy their subsistence needs, which is why they needed jobs. The very idea of wage labor is&nbsp;part and parcel of the capitalist form of slavery.“ 
 &nbsp; 
 Alison made a short comment in response to me mentioning the Points of Light Foundation and the promotion of mandatory national (volunteer) service. She then said, “because they’re gonna take away everyone’s right to have a stable job.” In here extensive work over the past several years she has not advocated for people to simply have a job. We have both explicitly spoken about many of the problems with the jobs people are pushed into and I have often spoken about how the artificial demand or actually requirement for one to possess the legal fiction of “money” is manufactured in order to force people into labor. I give the example of Cecil Rhodes mining operation in southern Africa in the late 1800s. How the implementation of taxation played a significant role in coercing and forcing the locals into mining. We’ve also spoken about the Enclosures in the past but not in detail. They way you framed your comment suggest that Alison and I are advocating the “right to have a job” as a “human right”. I certainly don’t and I don’t think Alison does either. Leaving the word “right” aside, she is correct that they are taking away everyone’s ability to have a stable job. But Alison absolutely knows the problem is much much bigger than that. Jeff should she does after listening to so many of her talks.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 3:15:00 – Alison states that the Cold War was really just a cover for the creation of isotopes for shaping the future.&nbsp;Sorry, i have to disagree, there were numerous factors which led to the “Cold War,” particularly the consolidation of the US post-WWII global order.&nbsp;Reducing it to a single deception is not even Monday morning quarterbacking, more like Wed morning. 
 &nbsp; 
 Actually she said it was about weaponizing space and isotopes. I don’t know what to think about the Cold War but I do know that the narrative we have been indoctrinated with is wrong. I haven’t read all the stuff that Alison has that leads her to make that statement but so far she’s had a damn good batting average. Whether it was only about those things, I’m sure it was also very much about those things. And they are not being talked about.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 
 With all that said, please take me off this list Jeff. I don’t have the energy to correct all of your creative misleading interpretations and lies. It doesn’t appear you’re going to stop. How you can watch so much of Alison’s material and keep getting it so wrong does not sit well with me. I just hope people will go to the source and not rely on Jeff or anyone else to be their intermediary for information.<br>
 
 &nbsp; 
 Go to the source and think for yourself! 
 &nbsp; 
 And please don’t respond to me Jeff. I don’t want to hear it. You’re not being honest or acting in good faith.”

  Understanding the Merge  <p>A normie’s guide to one of the biggest changes in Ethereum’s history</p>  <p>By Dan Chen</p><p>Published September 13, 2022</p>  



 
<p>The Merge is set to be the biggest crypto event of the year. It’s the first time in history a top market cap cryptocurrency has changed its consensus model and is a key milestone in Ethereum’s long-term scalability roadmap. At Sequoia, we believe in the importance of deeply understanding major events that will be transformative to industries and crypto and the Merge is at the top of this list. As the deadline fast approaches, we’d love to share with the community a summary of our main considerations for the Merge. This is meant to be purely informational, and none of this should be treated as investment advice.</p>



 Background 



<p>The Merge is the planned upgrade of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Proof-of-Stake is a consensus model where network validators —that is, the nodes in the network responsible for maintaining the true transaction history of the Ethereum blockchain—vote on the next “correct” bundle of transactions and are fined if they are bad actors. In contrast, Proof-of-Work is a computational race to decide on the next “correct” bundle of transactions. Instead of being fined, the transactions of bad actors are ignored as the network collectively builds on the “correct” branch.</p>



<p>The Merge is an integral precursor to the Ethereum scalability roadmap and has been pushed back many times in the past. As has been repeated ad nauseam, it is important to note that the Merge does NOT scale Ethereum. It merely updates the consensus mechanism to something more akin to other modern blockchains that execute smart contracts. Solana, Avalanche and Cosmos all run PoS-based consensus. Bitcoin, on the other hand, runs PoW consensus. The Merge is a giant step in a three step process to scale Ethereum:</p>



  The first step was the launch of the Beacon Chain in December 2020. The Beacon Chain is a separate PoS-based chain running in parallel with the main PoW Ethereum blockchain.  The second step is the Merge. This is where we are now! This is the swapping of the main chain for the parallel PoS chain. The estimated date is around September 15 and is dependent on network hashrate.  The third step is Sharding. You can think of it as Ethereum going multi-threaded to scale the network. The estimated date is 2023-2024, but the community believes it won’t happen until much later due to Ethereum’s track record of significantly delaying both steps 1 and 2 (sorry EF!).  


  


<p>Vitalik estimates the network to be only <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/vitalik-buterin-says-ethereums-transition-has-been-long-and-complicated/">55% complete post-Merge</a>, implying that the third and final scaling step will be the largest of the three by far. The price of Ethereum has risen ~60% from July 1 to the time of writing (Sept. 13, 2022). Most of the price increase is attributed to positive sentiment around the Merge as the Merge date approaches. As the Ethereum Foundation loves to point out, if Ethereum is an airplane, it’s like swapping out the engine (or the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ethereum-merge-edition-part-2-moving-to-proof-of/id1460134454?i=1000579176370">whole plane</a>) mid-flight. It also changes the economics of all participants in the Ethereum ecosystem. While the first and second order effects have been public knowledge and have been debated in public forums since the beginning of the year, there has been a significant increase in market interest in the past two months as the timeline has been finalized and it is clear that the Merge will indeed happen.</p>



 First-order effects 



<p>Here are the first-order effects following the Merge, that is, the effects that are a direct consequence of the protocol upgrade:</p>



  Change in security model. Ethereum is moving from a model that is primarily reliant on miners running expensive rigs and performing computation to secure the network to a model reliant on economic voting and “fining” (slashing) to keep voters in check while decreasing energy usage by ~99.95%. Part of the reason the migration has taken so long is that, when it was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437">originally proposed</a> around 2016-2017, PoS was not known to have the same rigorous security guarantees versus PoW, which had been proven to secure a much larger network in Bitcoin. Since then, many other blockchains such as Solana have proven the robustness of PoS consensus in practice and the theoretical robustness is much better understood.  Decrease in supply and inflation. Ethereum supply will change from ~4.62% inflationary issuance to roughly net zero inflation or potentially slight deflation depending on gas. This is akin to Bitcoin’s halvings but on steroids. The way to think about it is: currently, Ethereum pays ~$26M/day (assuming $2k/ETH)* in rewards to miners to compensate them for running expensive hardware. Afterwards, Ethereum will pay ~$3.2M/day to validators to compensate them for running less expensive hardware. This compensation—called block rewards or validator rewards—happens via Ethereum minting new ETH. After the Merge, the amount of ETH minted will be ~90% less. Plus, there is a countervailing force to the minting of ETH: when paying for computation, a small amount of ETH gets burned (EIP-1559 base fee burns)—that is, removed from the circulating supply. Depending on network demand, this amount just so happens to be roughly equal to the amount that will be paid to validators post-Merge, netting out to roughly zero inflation. There is quite a bit of minutiae, described in more detail <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/">here</a>. Net, inflation would drop from ~4.62% to somewhere around 0%, which would correspond to a net decrease in supply of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/issuance/">~4.93M ETH/year</a> (~$9.86B).  


 Ethereum supply since the genesis block. Ethereum supply is expected to peak on the Merge date and then slowly decrease over time as fees burned to process transactions are expected to be slightly higher on average than new ETH issued via staking rewards. It will be the first and largest major cryptocurrency to be truly deflationary. Source: ultrasound.money 


  Energy efficiency. The Merge will get rid of PoW as the consensus mechanism for validating the Ethereum blockchain. Energy consumption is expected to reduce by <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more/">2000x</a> as hash races are very energy intensive. Total network energy consumption will decrease from <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/#:~:text=Digiconomist%20provides%20whole%2Dnetwork%20energy,(53%20MT%2Fyr).">~112TWh/yr to ~0.01TWh/yr</a>. This is comparable from going from the energy consumption of the country of the Netherlands to an energy consumption of ~1000 US homes, which would be a town ~4x smaller than Sausalito. While this will improve the eco-friendliness and brand perception of Ethereum, it should not impact the usability of the blockchain, though it might increase long-term institutional adoption as ESG compliance becomes increasingly important.  Faster block confirmation times, increased time to finality. Block times will go down from ~13.3s on average to a fixed 12s. This will speed up throughput a little. Finality—basically, settlement time—will increase from around 1.5 minutes to roughly 13 minutes, but with the benefit that finality is now guaranteed (instead of probabilistic, with increasingly high probability over longer periods of time). How this translates to the end user depends more on application developers, many of whom might accelerate time to finality with the tradeoff that they might have to revert the transactions later.  



<p>*&nbsp;We’ll assume an ETH price of $2k for the rest of writeup for easy math</p>



 Second-order effects 



<p>Second-order effects are effects to various ecosystem participants that are a consequence of changes related to the Merge. Here is a non-exhaustive list of second-order effects.</p>



  Increase in staking. As mentioned previously, there are over 400k validators staking ~13M ETH (~$26B) on the Beacon Chain. Their nominal staking yield is ~4% APY, but their real staking yield is ~0% due to ETH inflation mentioned previously. Post-Merge, real yields will match nominal yields as inflation goes to zero. In addition, miners will go away, so the fees they get paid directly to prioritize transactions (called “tips”) will now go to validators. This is expected to increase real staking yields from ~0% pre-Merge to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">~7% post-Merge</a>. We expect an immediate increase in staking. If history repeats itself, we will see providers artificially inflate APYs to compete for volume before yields ultimately compress to the ~6-7% steady state. This could play out over several years (remember DeFi summer?). Coinbase has already signaled <a href="https://twitter.com/panekkkk/status/1496586698179989504?s=20&amp;t=FmsLmaHGCdE9ZHIdiKdAcw">9-12% APY</a>, albeit during a time when demand for blockspace was much higher. One more data point to increased staking: Solana, a much more mature staking ecosystem, has staking participation at <a href="https://stakesolana.app/">~78%</a>. In contrast, ETH Beacon Chain staking is currently at ~11%. Finally, it seems well understood at this point but still worth noting that the ~1M ETH (~$2B) that has been paid out via rewards to validators since the Beacon chain launched December 2020 will be locked for 6-12 months after the Merge, and then will only be “unlocked” at a limited rate. TradFi bros can think of this as a post-IPO lockup period where the staking ETH and ETH rewards cannot be sold.  Miners become obsolete. Ethereum miners generated <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum/ethereum-miner-revenue-monthly">$19B</a> of revenue from mining rewards in 2021. This will be zero post-Merge. In addition, it is estimated that <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1552837630278385664">$5B of hardware</a> is dedicated to ETH mining across GPU miners and ASIC miners, which will need to be repurposed or sold. This is reflected by GPU prices in secondary markets, which <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpu-pricing-index#:~:text=GPU%20prices%20continued%20to%20drop,only%20fell%206%25%20in%20July.">decreased 14% in June and 6% in July</a>. Network hashrate peaked in May and saw a notable drop in June. In addition, the reduction of up to ~13k ETH/day of miner sell pressure to cover capex costs in a notoriously low-margin industry, though a small percentage of daily ETH volumes, still changes the supply/demand dynamics.

  Contentious hard fork. So where will the miners go? In response to the immediate evaporation of a $18B/yr industry, miners could move to an alternate PoW chain (e.g. ETC) depending on their hardware, or they might organize a revolt. They would continue mining the soon-to-be defunct PoW chain, which would result in a duplication of accounts and transactions histories across the main ETH chain. This would effectively create value as long as key stakeholders—exchanges, infrastructure, and applications—supported both networks. This has happened in a major way twice in the past: once in 2016 when Ethereum forked to ETH and ETC to revert the DAO hack and once in 2017 when Bitcoin forked to BTC and BCH as the community was split over the block size debate. Ultimately, the networks supported by the core developer community won out both times. This time, instead of the dynamic duo of Jihan and Roger Ver, we have Chinese mining kingpin and investor Chandler Guo at the helm. Chainlink, USDC, and USDT have all <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/markets/what-will-happen-to-my-ethereum-after-the-merge-7301497613864205089">signaled</a> that they would not support a hard fork as it would have massive negative ramifications: you would immediately duplicate all assets, including NFTs, stablecoins, and wrapped assets. Exchanges all give the boilerplate “we will treat and review this as any other asset” messaging. Compared to previous hard forks, this fork seems to have significantly less community support as virtually every major community figure acknowledges the Merge. Market sentiment reflects this. Justin Sun-backed exchange Poloniex listed an IOU for the forked chain with the ticker symbol ETHW. Since its listing on August 8, it has fallen 64%. The derivatives exchange BitMEX listed a similar perpetuals contract, which followed a similar trajectory (nb: both contracts are thinly traded). The crowded long spot/short futures trade puts the expected value of the forked asset at around ~7% (see next point).

  Increased speculation in perpetuals and futures markets. On August 1, for the first time, open interest on ETH options <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1554060039861989377">surpassed</a> BTC options at $5.6B notional vs. $4.3B notional, signaling increased speculation on this singularly important ETH event. In addition, the futures curve started experiencing backwardation (futures prices &lt; spot prices) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1557792345881513985?s=20&amp;t=IkI14K2s9Brsj7Mf52_Vfg">earlier this month</a> and <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/ether/ether.quotes.html">persists to date</a>. This is significant as your average futures market prices longer term contracts higher (contango). It’s also worth noting that this backwardation only affects ETH: the BTC futures curve is still in <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.quotes.html">contango</a>. The most common interpretation is there is a recent increase in demand as institutional investors go long ETH hedged by short futures, netting free forked PoW ETH.

  Other considerations. There will be new opportunities in MEV (maximal extractible value) as block proposers are now known in advance. Our rudimentary guess is that MEV will increase in the short term as new areas of MEV are figured out and PBS (proposer builder separation) works towards getting adopted, but might decrease in the long run post-PBS implementation and adoption of mev-boost. Other areas of technical or tail risk are likely overestimated as the Ethereum Foundation has committed to a TTD (terminal total difficulty), though we are reliant on developers to perform some <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer">updates</a> on their dApps. Finally, mainstream media coverage and general hype has picked up in the weeks preceding the Merge, and we can only expect this to increase and amplify the success or hiccups (if any) immediately following.  



 Short-Term 



<p>In the days immediately leading up to and following the Merge, we might see a lot of volatility as the market prepares for a rate hike following the September 13th CPI update. In addition, macro uncertainties around European oil prices, a potential re-escalation in Ukraine, China/Taiwan black swan events, domestic inflation concerns over student loan cancellations (though it will likely play out over a longer period of time) could be strong factors to the extent crypto blue chips become increasingly more correlated with the S&amp;P and global markets. There is a minimal chance that the Merge is a catastrophic failure—I’ve heard anywhere from 0.1% to 5%—and institutions seem to be pricing in this tail risk. If you were to decompose ETH/USD to ETH/BTC and BTC/USD components, there is a possibility that the BTC/USD side dominates in the near term. A hard fork might result in a rush to the exits similar to the ICO/IEO days as soon as there is a venue for PoW ETH liquidity; however, the long-term impact on the ecosystem will likely be negligible.</p>



 Medium-Term 



<p>Over a longer period of time, say 6-18 months, we expect the positive supply changes and the positive economics of staking versus mining to dominate. The shift of Ethereum from an inflationary currency to a potentially deflationary currency introduces supply reductions similar in structure to Bitcoin halvenings. And the shift of network participants from miners to validators reduces sell pressure in perpetuity and effectively decreases circulating supply. If you think of it from naive Econ 101 terms, the supply curve shifts aggressively left while the (unpredictable) demand curve should generally move right as staking demand increases.</p>



 Long-Term 



<p>Long term is anyone’s guess. Most importantly, after the Merge, Ethereum will have proven the ability to execute on their ambitious roadmap of Ethereum scalability. There are more upcoming structural changes to be aware of, notably the Shanghai upgrade where Beacon chain ETH will be unlocked, sharding and Verkle proof compressions. This is a strong signal to developers, especially new ones, and a good signal for the Ethereum community overall following the surge of alt L1 developer momentum towards the end of 2021. We don’t have strong opinions on the long term viability of individual ecosystems, though we acknowledge the underlying thesis of scaling at the base layer has its merits and will be eagerly tracking the progress of Solana, Cosmos appchains, Sui, Aptos and others as they launch and gain more adoption. In all of this, Bitcoin seems a little underappreciated since maximalism and perhaps a bit of hubris have isolated the community from broader crypto discourse. However, Bitcoin is and will continue to be Bitcoin—the most viable digital gold—and we will watch with interest as Lightning, Lightspark and Stacks, among others, work to push the narrative of a global state-free currency and programmable money.</p>

         Vision, Grit, Growth: Introducing the Next Arc Founders            <p>The second cohort of Sequoia’s seed-stage catalyst launches this week.</p>  <p>By Jess Lee and Alfred Lin</p><p>Published September 13, 2022</p>       



            



 
<p><br>Today, we are excited to welcome our newest cohort of outlier founders to Arc, Sequoia’s catalyst for seed-stage companies. This seven-week company building program will take exceptional founders from 13 companies (including 4 in stealth) through our bespoke <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/company-design/">Company Design</a> curriculum taught by Sequoia partners, operators and founders. The Arc experience seeks to arm founders with the mindset, community and foundations they need to build a company that will endure over decades.</p>



<p>In our search for Arc companies, we reviewed thousands of applications and met with hundreds of applicants. The result is a curated cohort and community of the most promising seed-stage founders spanning a variety of industries, from data infrastructure and e-commerce to telemedicine and crypto. We believe these seven weeks can be transformative for early-stage companies, and we’re excited to invite a few seed founders with whom we recently partnered with to this cohort. We can’t wait to see what this group will do. To learn more about each of them and the outlier ideas that got our attention, read on.</p>



 <a href="https://arcwise.app/">Arcwise</a> 



<p>As the use of data explodes in business, the talent to leverage it is increasingly hard to find. But without the resources to design more advanced platforms, analysts are stuck in the familiar-yet-constrained world of spreadsheets. During stints at Flexport and Meta, Rahul Bali and Hanson Wang wished for a robust but more user-friendly data science workbench—and that’s why they created Arcwise. Business and engineering teams can work together in one low-code environment to build powerful machine learning tools that streamline cost estimation, sales forecasting, inventory management and more.</p>



 <a href="https://www.beamo.co/">Beamo</a> 



<p>From New York to Hong Kong, Colombia to London, Millie Yang has lived all over the world—and felt the need for a global payment solution firsthand. Historically, merchants who want to accept crypto have been forced to contend with price volatility, cross-chain complexity and time-consuming implementations, but Millie and co-founder Peng Du found a better way with Beamo. Just one five-minute integration enables payments from wallets, exchanges and credit cards—complete with automated reconciliation and reporting, and everything settled in USDC.</p>



 <a href="http://constellate.team/">Constellate</a> 



<p>An early Stripe hire, Brie Wolfson left in 2019 but carried the culture with her, launching a research-project-turned-consultancy to help companies unite their teams. Now, as the shift to remote work exposes the gaps water coolers and office hallways once filled, she’s building Constellate to be the new connective tissue. Think of it as TikTok for the workplace: an algorithmically curated platform where employees can share what they’re up to, get work out of silos and collaborate more effectively.</p>



 <a href="https://joinhallway.com/">Hallway</a> 



<p>As a kid, Bryan Pratte convinced his teachers to let him bring home 38 school computers so he could run Pixar’s Renderman software in his bedroom. Now, he and co-founder Brett Koonce are combining their lifelong love for animation with their experience building consumer apps for Reddit, Houseparty, Eventbrite and Epic Games, and launching the avatar creation tool Hallway. Using cutting-edge machine learning, they’re unlocking professional-grade motion capture and animation for anyone with a webcam—and enabling identities that work across the digital world.&nbsp;</p>



 <a href="https://roon.care/">Roon</a> 



<p>When his father was diagnosed with a rare neurodegenerative disease, Vikram Bhaskaran discovered how much patients and their families need support outside of just the doctor’s office—and saw that web searches and social media support groups can be generic at best and inaccurate at worst. So together with co-founders Dr. Rohan Ramakrishna and Arun Ranganathan, he started Roon. Members get content and community spaces that are both medically vetted and empathetic—from the doctors, caregivers and patients who have been there.</p>



 <a href="https://safara.travel/">Safara</a> 



<p>As anyone who’s spent an afternoon scrolling through endless lists of hotel bookings can tell you, most online travel agencies leave a lot to be desired. The next generation of travelers still want low prices, but they’re also craving a more curated experience—and that’s where Safara comes in. Co-founded by Square and Resy veterans Doug Schuessler and Cody Rose and born from challenges they faced while traveling together, Safara is now disrupting this massive industry by offering customers a built-in community, fully carbon-offset bookings and 10% credits to use toward the next adventure.</p>



 <a href="https://www.summerhealth.com/">Summer Health</a> 



<p>Twenty doctor visits in the first two years alone, and a two-week wait each time. When Ellen DaSilva became a mother, she learned that’s the reality for the average U.S. parent. But as employee No. 4 at hims &amp; hers, she had also learned how to scale telemedicine—so she and co-founder Matthew Woo set out to revolutionize pediatric care with Summer Health. Customers can get in touch with a real doctor by text to discuss symptoms, ask questions, and get prescriptions, test orders, referrals and more—in 15 minutes or less.</p>



 <a href="http://vitrine.us/">Vitrine</a> 



<p>As Head of Instagram Ads Data Science, Youssef Ahres saw firsthand how stricter privacy policies have transformed advertising—especially for direct-to-customer and e-commerce brands. But he and co-founders Juhana Kangaspunta and Khalil Hajji recognized what others did not: content creators were the ones driving product discovery; they just weren’t getting the credit. Enter Vitrine, a platform that allows influencers to become the new retailers, curating their own stores and linking directly to brands to handle inventory and fulfillment—no cookie tracking required.</p>



 <a href="https://zeet.co/">Zeet</a> 



<p>At 16, Johnny Dallas made history as the youngest speaker at Amazon’s AWS re:Invent conference—and that was just the beginning. Today, he and co-founder Zihao Zhang are on a mission to simplify the cloud with Zeet, an all-in-one deployment platform that works across existing tooling and services. Instead of spending valuable time configuring infrastructure for an ever-growing menu of services, engineering teams can authorize their account and let Zeet handle the details—so their developers can get back to building.</p>

  Trusted setups are both fascinating and daunting. Here’s a simple breakdown of what they are, why they are relevant to zk-tech &amp; more.

<p>If you are familiar with cryptography, computational protocols, and distributed systems, you must surely have encountered the phrase 'trusted setups'. <br></p><p>Trusted setups are integral to the optimal performance of several cryptographic protocols like zero-knowledge proof systems. Yet, some users of these systems may have trouble understanding the complexities going on behind the scenes.<br></p><p>In this article, we will explain the concept of trusted setups in detail along with the need for them, their inner workings, and the different alternatives to trusted setups in cryptography.</p> What are trusted setups? <p>To understand the concept of trusted setups, let us consider both words in the phrase. <br></p><p>Trust comes into play because a group is involved in the setup process of a proof system. In contrast, the setup phase involves performing (the setup part) some computation that generates a piece of data (<a href="https://z.cash/technology/paramgen/">parameter generation</a>) called into use every time you run a specific cryptographic protocol. Trusted setups are exceptional cases of multi-party computation, that require randomness, multiple individuals, and at least one honest party.<br></p>A diagram showing the anatomy of a trusted setup. (<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html">Source</a>)<p><br>A trusted setup is a procedure that involves more than one party. Its aim is to produce the standard parameters that a proof system or similar <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ring-signatures-vs-zksnarks-comparing-privacy-technologies/">cryptographic</a> protocols rely on. During this setup, random numbers (secrets) are generated, encrypted, used to generate the data, and then deleted to ensure the protocol remains foulproof. People refer to these random values as toxic wastes because they need to be deleted forever. As the participants need to be trusted for the setup to fulfill its purpose, this process is called a trusted setup.<br></p><p>After generating the initial parameters and destroying their random values, the trusted setup participants have fulfilled their obligations, and no further action is required from them. Single-participant setups are also possible, requiring one person to generate secrets, use them to produce the parameters, and destroy them. However, single-participant setups have a gaping loophole: you need to trust the sole participant to destroy the secrets after the parameter generation event. Them failing to do so exposes the whole protocol.<br></p><p>During its trusted setup ceremony, Zcash famously attempted to turn this issue on its head by selecting an explicit group of both anonymous and ‘trusted’ figureheads to generate a set of random numbers. These numbers were then leveraged to function as the public parameters for creating private transactions on the network.<br></p><p>The entire event, from generating random values to creating a structured reference string (parameters), destroying them, etc. is known as a <a href="https://zkproof.org/2021/06/30/setup-ceremonies/">trusted setup ceremony</a>.</p> The need for trusted setup ceremonies <p>As of now, ZK technology has two main applications in the context of blockchains: privacy and scalability. When it comes to privacy-enhancing tools and protocols, non-interactive ZK proofs such as zkSNARKs are often leveraged to achieve on-chain privacy. Many of these protocols, especially in the areas of data availability sampling and zkSNARKs, depend on trusted setups to generate initial parameters also known as a <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/6582384">common reference string</a> (CRS). <br></p><p>A common reference string is required for non-interactive and short ZK-proofs that can be shared between the verifier and prover. Without a trusted setup ceremony that destroys the random number function used to create the commor reference string, a malicious actor can create a fake CSR and subsequently generate fake proofs, thereby breaking the proof system.<br></p><p>Several ZK cryptographic protocols rely on trusted setup ceremonies to collaboratively generate their cryptographic parameters. In these ceremonies, each participating party uses secret information, generated locally, to generate data that helps create these initial parameters. The finalized public parameteres determined by a group of participants during the trusted setup ceremony serve as the standard enabling users to trust the privacy assurance of the network.<br></p><p>In other words, trusted ceremonies generate random values and then use them to create a “source” for the system that protects users’ privacy (the common reference string). If at least one participant of this ceremony is fully honest and does not save their contribution, every future user’s privacy is safe.<br><br><br></p>Zooko Wilcox, one of the creators of Zcash, destroying his computer after Zcash’s trusted setup ceremony. (<a href="https://fortune.com/2017/12/18/jp-morgan-bitcoin-zcash-wilcox/">Source</a>) A simple analogy for trusted setups<br> <p>Let’s say you want to create a unique perfume that will be made only once and used by people forever. <br></p><p>However, you’re not supposed to share the recipe with anyone or even know it yourself. To make this perfume, you give a bunch of people the instruction to bring in a random amount of a random ingredient. Some bring in roses, other lilies, vanilla extract, etc. You also assign yourself an ingredient to bring a random amount of, and demand that no one, not even yourself, takes note of the amount of their ingredient they brought or its type. Everyone will, without meeting, or seeing the ingredients of others, enter theirs into a special blender that does not let anyone see what’s inside.<br></p><p>If this process is followed correctly, no one will be able to replicate your exact mix ever again with full certainty. The second-to-worst scenario in this case is that everyone but one person kept record of their values. However, even if the rest of the participants aims to replicate the perfume, no one will be completely sure about the missing ingredient (at least in a low-tech setting).</p><p>In the above analogy, the final recipe is the key and the perfume the zkSNARKs parameters. Once these initial parameters are set, the key is destroyed to ensure the parameters are never tempered by anyone.<br></p><p>This kind of event is quite popular in proof systems and privacy-enhancing protocols like <a href="https://z.cash/">Zcash</a>, <a href="https://loopring.org/#/">Loopring</a>, etc. These protocols needed a trusted setup ceremony to remain foulproof, especially from an economic point of view.<br></p><p>The story of Zcash’s trusted setup ceremony. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6dY-3x3teM">Zcash Ceremony</a><br><br></p> Additional information on trusted setups<br> <p>Since privacy-enhancing cryptographic protocols run on the data generated by the trusted setup ceremony, protecting these parameters remains key to keeping the network secure. After the parameter generation, the random values become toxic waste, which must be deleted forever. If these secrets –random values– fall into the hands of a malicious entity, they can create false proofs (in proof systems), threatening the network's integrity. In a network like Zcash, this equals creating fake <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">coins</a> at will, inflating its supply and crashing the entire protocol. To prevent these things from happening and to ensure the protocol performs as designed, generating proofs and verifying<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/"> transactions</a>, its trusted setup ceremony was necessary.<br></p><p>This need makes trusted setup ceremonies essential, as it ensures that secrets do not fall into the hands of untrusted parties. Furthermore, some trusted setups split up a secret between multiple parties. This makes it such that participants may not know anything besides the secret in their possession or may not even know what the secret is, only that they need to compute it, creating a kind of secure multi-party computation protocol. In some instances, the trusted setup may only require one participant to dispose of the secrets in their possession to secure the network.<br></p><p>Since parameter generation depends on different secret pieces, having at least one honest party is sufficient to prevent malicious activity. A shortcoming of this instance is that some multiparty computation protocols do not need all the pieces of the secret to generate proofs, but a minimum threshold amount. This challenge is easily countered when the participants are selected randomly within a large distributed set and when participants do not know one another (participation in anonymity).<br></p> Categories of trusted setups <p>There are several routes through which a trusted setup may run to achieve its desired result. <br></p><p>Trusted setups, in fact, have multiple phases. The setup phase is done only once, thereby enabling the main phase. Once the main phase is activated, this enables all participating parties to interact with a single trusted part repeatedly. Individuals send inputs to the trusted party, which’s job is to run certain functions, after which the trusted party sends the corresponding output to the respective particpating parties. <br></p><p>The main phase is usually repeated. This scenario assumes that all communication channels between individuals and trusted party are secure. Based on the different dynamics that can take place at this time, a typical trusted setup should fit into one of the following categories:</p> No setup <p>Ironically, the first category of trusted setups is <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bulletproofs-in-crypto-an-introduction-to-a-non-interactive-zk-proof/">“none at all”</a>. A protocol without a setup phase is easier to trust than those that rely on trusted setups, although it cannot provide features such as privacy. In a protocol with no trusted setup, there are no trusted entities. Instead, we assume that there communication between the parties involved. <br></p><p>There are two significant varieties of 'no setup' protocols:<br></p><p>The first is called an anonymous channel model, which assumes that the parties communicating are unknown entities. In contrast, the second draws relevance from the knowledge of the global identities of all participants. While the first type may not be readily acceptable in real-world applications, the second is, as it helps establish some measure of trust. It is easier to know whether to trust a protocol when you know the parties responsible for keeping it running. <br></p><p>Although it is easier to trust protocols without trusted setups, several limitations are associated with the “no setup” category, such as likeliness of <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/man-in-the-middle-attack-MitM">man-in-the-middle attacks</a> due to their non-authenticated communication channels.</p> Pairwise setups <p>While the “no setup” category suffers from non-authenticated communication channels, pairwise setups assume that the communication channels between any two of the set of initial parties are secure. The members of the initial set of parties are grouped in twos, with each pair having a secure line of communication. <br></p><p>For example, when Member-1 sends a message on the (1,2) channel, Member-2, who is the message's recipient, knows it came from Member-1 because they are the only two parties that share the channel. Depending on some conditions, this setup may fail, while with the right conditions, it can permit the full implementation of different <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.2968&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">functionalities,</a> such as contract signing, secret exchange, joint coin flipping, voting, and playing poker.</p><p>.</p> Broadcast setups <p>The broadcast setup category of trusted setups assumes a phase without secrets. Instead of secrets being split up and distributed across participants, the trusted entity chooses to be transparent by distributing all important components across all participants, making them public.<br></p><p>A typical example of a trusted setup in the broadcast category is seen in <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/faq/public-key-infrastructure-pki/what-public-key-infrastructure-pki#:~:text=The%20Public%20key%20infrastructure%20(PKI,digital%20certificates%20and%20public%2Dkeys.">public key infrastructure</a> (PKI) protocols. In a typical PKI scenario, a trusted entity broadcasts all the public key addresses of all parties to the public. Also, all the inputs and outputs received or sent are public knowledge, including its random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_reference_string_model">common reference string</a>. With broadcast setups, it is assumed that the protocol's security is not at risk, even if the trusted entity has to be transparent.<br></p><p>With public key infrastructure and broadcast setups, the chances of the protocol's ability to keep running even if some parties are compromised increase significantly. This process is relatively simple, and broadcast setups are less prone to computational attacks. However, a trusted entity distributing different keys to different parties may lead to the failure of a <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-27-defining-consensus/">broadcast setup</a>.</p> Partially public setups <p>In a partially public setup, some parts of the process are made public, like in broadcast setups, while others are withheld (deleted or kept a secret), like in a regular trusted setup. In this arrangement, the output from the trusted entity is made public, while the inputs from participants and the random values generated at the initial phase are kept secret. The partially public setup is also known as the Common Reference String model.<br></p><p>For example, the trusted entity may trigger a function that generates an encryption key pair and a puzzle that shields half of the key pair until a set time. Then, it sends the puzzle out to all parties with the other half of the encryption key pair. Since trusted setups are two-phase procedures, the second phase will see users encrypting their messages using the other half of the encryption key pair. Users will also subsequently broadcast the encrypted messages while trying to solve the puzzle to access all encrypted messages.<br></p><p>Partially public setups have been used to develop verifiable secret sharing models and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge</a> protocols, while a fully-private setup usually requires a trusted setup ceremony for efficiency.</p> Fully private setups <p>A fully private setup represents the ideal trusted setup structure, where even the generated output that the parties receive after computing is kept secret. Hence, either party is oblivious of what they have received. Therefore, trusted setups required for blockchain networks or protocols using zero-knowledge technology fall under fully-private setups.<br></p><p>Fully private setups are often known as “the offline phase”, as MPC (<a href="https://inpher.io/technology/what-is-secure-multiparty-computation/">Multi-party computation</a>) protocols usually have an offline and online phase.<br></p><p>To understand how fully private setups work, we must consider two foremost cryptographic setups that fit into this category: offline phases for MPCs and distributed key generation setups for threshold signature schemes. The offline phase of a typical secure multiparty computation protocol is usually private, as the output needs to remain secret to curtail malicious operations and maintain security. <br></p><p>Distributed key generation setups come in handy for <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/threshold-signatures-explained">threshold signature schemes</a>, which do not require all inputs to produce the already-generated secret, but a minimum number of the involved parties. This involves random bits of the input and a key pair, where one part of the key pair is distributed to all parties, while the other part is split into shares and distributed, with each participant required to keep its part of the secret.</p> Alternatives to trusted setups <p>The emergence of Bitcoin and blockchain technology has already established a fact that we do not have to depend on an individual, institution, or third-party for a network or payment system to function. Trustless systems are the need of the hour and, as we have witnessed in the past decade, these systems are getting more robust and versatile. <br></p><p>It’s worth noting that ZK-technology is still in its infancy and, until now, trusted setups were the most secure way to establish initial parameters for <a href="https://www.michaelstraka.com/posts/recursivesnarks/">recursive proof systems</a>. However, the need to look beyond building systems that rely on trusted setups cannot be avoided. <br></p><p>Some categories of trusted setups do not support <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/the-worlds-first-private-decentralized-protocol-launch-panther-dao-votes-to-launch-private-defi-e721df1364/">decentralization</a>, while others are prone to computational attacks. Whatever seeks to replace trusted setups must ensure proof generation and verification without the trusted setup is possible, without sacrificing speed or performance.<br></p><p>Some protocols use multiple setups that generate several common reference strings (<a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/6582384">CRSs</a>), assuming that they generate a percentage of these reference strings genuinely. With several CRSs in the mix, the protocol can eliminate the need for a single trusted setup. Also, the 'no setup' phase is an alternative, along with collision-resistant <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">hash functions</a>, employed by <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-snarks-vs-zk-starks-differences-in-zero-knowledge-technologies/">zkSTARK</a> technology.<br></p><p>Notably, a trusted setup phase is only done once, and a protocol has to run on the parameters generated on its existing setup until there’s a need to revise its initial parameters. If they fail, a new ceremony is to be conducted. The idea of running a current system on dated parameters may be risky, security-wise. An alternative approach is to adopt continual setup phases that keep updating their common reference string such that the setup phase remains current with the protocol's state.<br></p><p>Finally, a breakthrough emerged when Sean Bowe, Jack Grigg, and Daira Hopwood published a paper called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1021">Recursive Proof Composition without a Trusted Setup</a>. This paper obtained and implemented Halo, the first practical example of recursive proof</p><p>composition without a trusted setup.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that in May of 2022, Zcash started using the <a href="https://halo2.dev/">Halo 2</a> proving system, thereby removing the need for trusted setup ceremonies. Halo 2 is a fast zero-knowledge proof-carrying data implementation which doesn’t require a trusted setup.<br></p><p>Besides Halo, there’s also work being done to run on-chain trusted setup ceremonies without going through all the complexities of the traditional form of trusted setup ceremonies. One of them, known as a <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377">powers-of-tau</a> ceremony, this kind of ceremony leverages smart contracts on Ethereum to allow anyone to run such a ceremony. <br></p><p>Some of the protocols that used powers-of-tau setup to run their own ceremonies include <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">ZK-rollup</a> networks such as Hermes Network, Loopring, Aztec, and zkSync. However, power-of-tau ceremony come with their own set of limitations, such as allowing only up to 64KB of cryptographic parameter size. This limitation of size is due to on-chain data constraints, thereby, only limiting its applications to only small parameters.<br></p>A diagram showing the perpetual rounds of a Power of Tau ceremony. (<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/announcing-the-perpetual-powers-of-tau-ceremony-to-benefit-all-zk-snark-projects-c3da86af8377">Source</a>) Conclusion <p>Trusted setups are integral to the structure and operations of several cryptographic protocols and distributed technologies today. As their name suggests, they are heavily dependent on the honesty of the participants, which poses a risk to the security of the networks running on them.<br></p><p>With the rising pace of innovations in cryptography and most-importantly in ZK-technology, new models are being proposed to do away with the need for generating parameters with trusted setups as we used to know them. Thanks to these new methods, cryptogaphic projects can finally say goodbye to conventional trusted setup ceremonies and achieve the same results on-chain using the fully decentralized Ethereum network.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Nym puts up ‘AnonDrop’ bounty at Kyiv Tech Summit hackathon for people to securely submit evidence of war&nbsp;crimes <p>As a sponsor of the Kyiv Tech Summit, Nym boosts efforts to democratise the documentation of human rights violations with a follow up grant via&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Shipyard</a></p><p>NEUCHÂTEL, SWITZERLAND, 12 SEPTEMBER 2022 — <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, in partnership with <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, both providing persistent decentralised file storage, is pleased to announce that the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/be-brave-as-ukraine-build-anondrop-at-the-kyiv-tech-summit-hackathon-4959ea99cfb8">AnonDrop challenge</a> bounty, worth $4,000, at the recent Kyiv Tech Summit hackathon, has been awarded to the Citizen5 project by <a href="https://devpost.com/allisterb">Allister&nbsp;Beharry</a>.</p><p>AnonDrop is an encrypted file drop application that allows users to securely upload data without compromising their identities. In the current climate in Ukraine, this would be particularly important for the purpose of securely documenting and sharing evidence of war crimes anonymously. One of the harder problems facing the documentation of war crimes is to allow witnesses to send in data without revealing who they are or their location to an adversary that can watch their internet connection.</p><p>The intention is for AnonDrop to become a tool that democratises the gathering of evidence that can be used to pursue human rights cases — by making the process simple and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Nym General Counsel Ahmed Ghappour affirms, “More than ever, witnesses to human rights violations must come forward and without fear of retaliation. In Ukraine, where witnesses of war crimes are facing a technologically sophisticated adversary, network level anonymity is the only way to guarantee the safety and security needed to provide evidence to prosecute perpetrators.”</p><p>Ukraine is the third largest community operating and using Nym at present. Nym CSO Jaya Klara Brekke and COO Alexis Roussel travelled to Kyiv to show the Nym team’s support and to understand the actual threats faced by Ukrainians on the ground. They were joined by the Minister of Digital Transformation and Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov and Vitalik Buterin of Ethereum. Visiting the country is essential for understanding the requirements for AnonDrop to be usable for the Ukrainians.</p><p>The inspiration for AnonDrop is early cypherpunk work on distributed persistent data storage as well as the recent effectiveness of the open source intelligence community (OSINT) in mobilising broad, decentralised efforts towards intelligence gathering and verification during the Russian invasion. The use of OSINT has enabled intelligence gathering, debunking and fact-checking to happen in real&nbsp;time.</p><p>“With AnonDrop, Ukrainians and other witnesses will be afforded the protection they need to capture and upload subversive content. Coupled with a suite of image provenance and verification features, the uploaded media will satisfy evidentiary requirements for use in courts across the globe. Nym is committed to advancing AnonDrop as a matter of urgency as we understand the immediate need for it,” Ghappour&nbsp;adds.</p><p>Use of AnonDrop will extend beyond Ukraine, in cases where human rights work is needed and sender anonymity is paramount, allowing the persistent and decentralised storage of data. There has been a long-stream of work on using mixnets for this use-case, such as the <a href="https://www.freehaven.net/">FreeHaven design</a> that preceded even Tor, but this privacy-preserving storage is now one step closer to becoming a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Using Nym as a decentralised mixnet that provides privacy and anonymity at the network layer, AnonDrop will be able to withstand attacks by even nation level adversaries. The Nym mixnet protects not only the content of messages but also, crucially, the metadata associated with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Further iterations are needed before the application should be used in life or death situations, in view of the gravity of circumstances. To that end, Nym has qualified the winner of the AnonDrop bounty to automatically receive a follow-up grant from their upcoming <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/announcing-nym-shipyard-136fcb93fcb5">Nym Shipyard grant program</a> to continue development. Prioritised features include image provenance and authentication in order to make the evidence usable in&nbsp;court.</p><p>AnonDrop is the first application by Nym that directly addresses an immediate challenge in reporting war crimes. This is in line with Nym’s focus and vision of enabling everyone to communicate freely without censorship or fear, protecting people from the consequences of surveillance, one of which is human rights violations. More applications using the Nym mixnet are expected to be built over the upcoming year through integrations and the Nym Shipyard grant&nbsp;program.</p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralised platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service.

<p>As you all are probably aware, Jason created a digital space with Discourse software and private data storage to run a research group focused on blockchain, debt finance, synthetic-bio and how it is fueling a cybernetic mixed-reality future. This is his project, not mine. It is a small group of members, though anyone is welcome to poke around and see what we’re looking at. You can find it <a href="https://discourse.wrenchinthegears.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Until last week Jeffrey Strahl, a retired statistics lecturer who lives in the Bay Area and is active in the terrain space on social media, was a member of Jason’s group. Jeff had shared some materials from outside writers to the site, but had not actively pursued his own investigations, which was the point of the space.</p>
<p>After a recent post about Russia that referenced Pavel Lushka and Ervin Laszlo, systems theorists who have been pursuing digital evolution for decades, I asked Jeff to do some independent research into the two men and how their work relates to re-skilling, digital credentials, blockchain permissions, and ultimately stackable badge mind-files of Soulbound tokens that will be used for human capital derivatives trading and to train machine learning towards the Singularity.</p>
<p>My concern is that the social media organization of “terrain” interests could be a key “artificial society” set up for monitoring and management by AI nudges. In light of my exploration of game theory and evolutionary algorithms, I became concerned after I was tagged as part of a #TeamNoVirus by Bill Huston, a person with whom I have no acquaintance. He was very, very unpleasant to me when I asked pointed to have my name removed from his site. The tagging is central to the game. Everyone is in the game whether we want to admit it or not.</p>
<p>Jeff was not inclined to take up the task of researching Luksha or blockchain credentials or possible implications for the Poornima spectacle. He was not open to the possibility that “terrain,” which is central focus of Voronoi pattern simulation modeling, could be being used to manage and model resistance sub-groups. I never said people were doing this knowingly. We don’t yet understand the degree to which AI and frequencies are subtly directing actions and outcomes. That is the whole point of the simulation. We many not know the degree to which the twinned world is influencing our material reality and emotional states.</p>
<p>As a career statistician who is familiar with emerging technology, <a href="https://guymcpherson.com/resistance-is-the-only-ethical-response-to-near-term-extinction/">including nano-tech way back in 2013</a>, you might think Jeff would be interested in incorporating these ideas into his analysis. That, however, was not the case. I respect that people have different areas of focus, and if his is health, so be it. I will say, however, that the inability of Bay Area residents in particular to come to terms with Berkeley’s history of radio-isotopes, computational biology, track and trace tech, smart cities, predatory finance, and digital ID will likely back them into a corner over time. But each of us gets to choose, and then we live with the choices we’ve made. That is what makes up human, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>Jason was very clear about the intention of the board. Jeff was not up to meeting the group’s expectations about digging deeper, doing original research, and “lifting the bar” (a term Jason coined as a way to getting us all to step up in a bigger way). At that point Jason removed him from the group. It was not the right fit. In removing Jeff’s account, his posts were also taken down, but I am sharing images from the post in question so you can evaluate what happened for yourself. Jeff misrepresented me in an email group he is an active member of, and that is not ok. This is why I am pulling together this post and sharing key parts of the story that he left out. I went over it in a livestream I did this morning, including some introductory material around social identity and agent-based modeling from the Swarm Intelligence text book.</p>
<p>I will point out that there was a second person in the thread who did use the term psy-op. I never use that term, and people who follow me know that. It was factually incorrect for Jeff to characterize ME as having used that term, and he knows that. You will see in my comments, which surely can be characterized as direct or even blunt, that I was asking Jeff to step up and reflect on his experience professionally and as sometime who spends a lot of time in social media to consider game theory, tagging, and contrived spectacle. I asked him to learn something about blockchain credentials and their connections to transhumanism. I understand that to do this might put him in a difficult position in his chosen digital society. Maybe now is the time to ask if such constructed societies are actually helping or hurting the cause of preserving natural life on earth.</p>
<p>I trust you to look at the facts and sort it out for yourself, but be advised that sometimes really looking means getting uncomfortable. The sections in red are my comments and Jeff’s. The other comments belong to a different person whom Jeff neglected to mention at all. He acted as if what the other person on the thread said was what I had said – a miscalculation on his part. Hard to say if it was about self preservation in his social circles or something else. I’d still like for him to consider doing that homework assignment. It could be informative for all of us.</p>
<p>PS: If any readers out there are interested in doing the assignment I gave to Jeff, email me at timpsila at protonmail dot com. I’d be happy to feature it as a guest post.</p>

 Nym wallet v1.0.9 — Bug&nbsp;fixes <p>A new version of the Nym wallet is released. This release fixes the issue that some of the users were experiencing when querying node rewards in the wallet (more on that&nbsp;below).</p><p>You can download the latest version of the wallet from the <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">website</a>. Nym software is <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym">open source</a>, unpermissioned and can be forked by anyone wishing to extend functionality.</p> What has been&nbsp;fixed: <p>In order to show the operator or delegator rewards, Nym wallet has to do a large query to retrieve rewarding data from the mixnet contract storage. This query can sometimes exceed the default gas query limit of the validators. When the query limit runs out of gas, the wallet silently fails and does not show rewards for the operator or delegators. In order to fix this issue we have changed the default RPC endpoint to a cluster with a high gas query limit so that the query wouldn’t fail and as the result the mix node rewards can be shown in the&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>You can see the proposed changes in the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nym-wallet-v1.0.9/nym-wallet/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a>.</p><p>Thanks to our users for reporting the issue.

<p>The Cosmos is modular. Over the years, the Cosmos SDK has introduced powerful features as modules that developers can easily build on top of. This sits central to the application specific blockchain philosophy: we want developers to focus on building their application, with the least amount of work needed to bootstrap a functioning blockchain.</p><p>These modules are the secret powers that make the Cosmos SDK stand out from the crowd. <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/secret-powers-what-are-the-authz-and-fee-grant-modules-c57d0e808794">A previous blog post </a>— the first of this series — covered Authz and Fee Grant, but now that the Cosmos SDK has released version 0.46, we thought it would be a great moment to introduce you to the new Groups module, and the various ways the Governance module has gotten a well-deserved power&nbsp;boost!</p> Cosmos SDK Groups&nbsp;Module <p>What do we mean with groups? In essence, the Groups module is Multisig on steroids. The Cosmos SDK has supported <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/master/run-node/txs.html">multi-signature wallets</a> since its inception, but limitations were hindering wider adoption. For starters, signatures are not stored on-chain, so you’d have to manually send over signed transactions to all members. Additionally, there is no dynamic key rotation, so if you wanted to change members, you’d have to create a new multisig and move your funds to that&nbsp;account.</p><p>With that in mind, the Groups module was introduced to offer advanced multi-signature wallet support native to the chains built on top of the Cosmos SDK. As a first and obvious use case, this will allow funds to more easily manage their tokens. But there are ample opportunities for developers to build on top of Groups and create vast usability improvements to wallet management, such as 2-factor authentication styled authorizations.</p> How Does the Groups Module&nbsp;Work? <p>At its core, a group has members that vote on proposals. Proposals can be one or multiple arbitrary messages that the chain supports, like staking your tokens, sending an IBC transfer and voting on governance, for example. The members of a group can change either through a proposal, or by an admin if the group has elected one or was configured with one from the&nbsp;start.</p><p>Additionally, the group itself can have multiple decision policies. A decision policy is a set of criteria that determine when a proposal passes or fails. For example, you can have a threshold decision policy that says that 3 out of 5 members need to vote yes within 5 days for a proposal to pass. The secret power here lies in the fact that it’s not the group that holds the tokens, but the decision policy itself. Why is that important?</p><p>Say you’re a member of a DAO that’s funding development work. You may want to pay out a relatively large amount of tokens for work that has been completed. In this case, you want to make sure that a large majority of your group approves the payment, and that there’s enough time for everyone to vote, because you’re dealing with a large sum of money. At the same time, perhaps you’ve had a laptop break down and you need funds to replace the machine quickly. That would be tricky to do with a voting period of, say, 15 days and a 7 out 10 majority requirement.</p><p>When you have multiple decision policies, you can secure your large fund with a strict policy, and allow a smaller fund to be accessed by a smaller threshold in a short period of time. This flexibility allows DAOs to be more responsive, or more secure, wherever it’s appropriate. The choice is&nbsp;yours.</p><p>The <a href="https://interchain.io">Interchain Foundation</a> is currently funding Regen Network to build a front-end interface for Groups, but in the meantime, you can learn to play around with the module on the <a href="https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/understanding-group/">Developer Portal</a>.</p> The New and Improved Governance Module <p>One of great features about Cosmos chains is that they come with an on-chain governance system by default. Anyone who delegates tokens to secure a chain has a vote on how the chain operates, either through parameter changes or software upgrade. Additionally, delegators can vote on signal proposals or decide how funds in the community pool are spent. This on-chain governance system has enabled tremendous community engagement in the past, but was only limited to these four types of proposals so&nbsp;far.</p><p>The Cosmos ecosystem has become more interoperable with the success of IBC, and now that <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-accounts-take-cosmos-interoperability-to-the-next-level-39c9a8aad4ad">Interchain Accounts</a> is starting to roll out to chains, composability is rapidly accelerating. Chains are now able to create addresses on other chains and execute transactions natively. This allows composability between applications similar to how smart contracts on a monolithic chain like Ethereum can interact with each other. How does governance play into&nbsp;this?</p><p>Almost all blockchains built with Cosmos have a community pool. This is a decentralized fund that receives a percentage of the block rewards and continuously keeps growing in size. So far, the community pools have been used to fund public good work, conferences like <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/68">Cosmoverse</a>, and more recently <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/74">HackATOM Seoul 2022</a>, but there are many more opportunities for the fund to engage with the wider ecosystem.</p><p>What’s changed? Instead of the original four proposal types that existed previously, the new Governance module allows people to propose to execute any number of arbitrary messages that the chain supports, similar to how the Groups module functions. A chain’s community pool could for example send tokens over to a decentralized exchange and swap tokens to create a wider exposure to the Cosmos ecosystem, or buy carbon credits on-chain to offset the carbon output of the application. At its core, the extension of the governance module allows a blockchain’s community to interact with the Interchain in ways previously unimaginable.</p><p>We encourage developers to have a look at the <a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/gov/">specification</a> of this module to learn more about the potential impact this might have on their blockchain or&nbsp;client.</p><p>With the tight integration of Groups, Governance and the previous Auth and Authz modules, the Cosmos SDK is building something akin to a Linux permissions system, a core primitive of the Cosmos kernel. When paired with Interchain Accounts, this enables powerful remote account access, quite similar to&nbsp;SSH.</p> Groups and Governance <p>In a sense, the Groups and Governance modules are two sides of the same coin. You can imagine all delegators of a chain to be members of the community group by default seeing as the proposal and voting functionality is pretty much identical between the two modules. We’re excited to see where the new features will take you. We hope that chains are eager to adopt the new modules, that exciting new frontend applications will emerge, and that painstaking multisig management will soon be a thing of the&nbsp;past.</p><p>We’d like to thank <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> for their contribution to the design and engineering work on these features.</p><p>About the Author:<br>Noam Cohen works at <a href="https://www.interchain.berlin/">Interchain GmbH</a> and is the Developers Relations Lead for the Cosmos Hub team.

<p>In a rough and tumble world where it is becoming harder and harder to keep your heart open, having genuinely good people in your life is a true blessing. While Lynn and I came from different ends of the manufactured ideological spectrum, we immediately recognized authenticity, honesty, and gumption in one another, and we’ve been fast friends ever since. This is a sacred engagement designed to test every fiber of our being as moral, loving humans. I am glad to share this glimpse into Lynn’s journey as we get to the heart of the matter.<br>

My journey as a child in the American public school system, and now as an education researcher, is a long and winding road. I grew up in Dallas, and my parents bought their first house on Blessing Drive, which was zoned for Dallas ISD and Dan D. Rogers Elementary. My siblings and I are close in age, and our growing family was busting at the seams. My parents bought a bigger house in Northeast Dallas on Faircrest in Lake Highlands, and I went through Richardson ISD schools. During my senior year at Lake Highlands High School I was in a Pre-Employment Laboratory Education (PELE) program where I studied learning theories and behavioral psychologists like Skinner, Piaget, and Freud and worked as a teachers aide at my alma mater, Northlake Elementary. In June of 1989 I graduated at seventeen and enrolled at the University of North Texas in their Elementary Education department with Special Education as my discipline. After three years of education courses, I realized I was in the wrong major.</p>
<p>In the early 90’s corporations were following wellness trends to get their employees healthier. The idea behind the movement was the notion — or so I thought — that healthier employees would reduce healthcare insurance claims, thus saving corporations the cost of premiums. I changed my major to Corporate Health Promotion/Kinesiology/Wellness with a minor in Psychology. I did an internship with Frito-Lay Headquarters in their onsite fitness facility where I used fat calipers to pinch fat and tell employees what their percentage was (as if they needed someone to pinch them to tell them “you’re fat!”). It was an awkward and humiliating experience they relegated to the lowly unpaid intern. Frito-Lay had complimentary junk food kiosks and soft drinks everywhere as a benefit to employees. The irony was not lost on me. Once again I was in the wrong major, but I stuck it out and completed the internship and the degree plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon graduation in 1996, I applied to a position posted in the employment section of the Dallas Morning News for the Cooper Aerobics Center founded in 1970 by the “Father of Aerobics” Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper. I was thrilled to get an interview and very anxious, but well-prepared. The position was in their physical fitness for education division called FITNESSGRAM where they provided physical fitness assessments for school districts. According to the <a href="https://www.cooperinstitute.org/pub/news.cfm?id=24">website</a>, “The Cooper Institute, the 501(c)3 nonprofit research and education division located at Cooper Aerobics Center in Dallas, developed the FITNESSGRAM in 1982.” In 1998 The Cooper Institute partnered with Human Kinetics, which now publishes and distributes the product to schools nationwide. I didn’t get the job. Things were going great until she asked me to work the printer. I only had retail POS computer experience and had never worked a basic printer. It was a test, and I failed miserably. Divine providence. As an interesting aside, Cooper developed the Smart Snack Ribbon guidelines in 2003 for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frito-Lay">Frito-Lay</a> division of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo">PepsiCo</a>. Junk food junket?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_H._Cooper">Wikipedia</a>, “A native of Oklahoma City, Cooper completed a 13-year military career in both the US Army and Air Force. During his Air Force career, he devised the simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_test">Cooper test</a>, which could conveniently and quickly establish the fitness level of large numbers of people – originally the distance run in 12 minutes which correlated well with the existing concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VO2_max">VO2 max</a>. Cooper left the Air Force in 1970 when he and his wife, Millie moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas">Dallas</a> to start his companies.” He coined the term <a href="https://archive.org/details/aerobics00coop/page/n9/mode/2up">Aerobics</a> in 1966, and his book under the same name was published in 1968. Ten years later he published a mass market version The New Aerobics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an education researcher, I have been on a whirlwind speaking, writing and advocacy tour that began in 2020 after studying and collaborating with Alison McDowell of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/">Wrench in the Gears</a> as she was exposing blockchain technology and the nudging of society towards tokenized economies and synthetic biology. I wrote a piece called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dallas-blockchain-life-ledger-lynn-davenport">Dallas Blockchain: Life on the Ledger</a> to shine a light on GreenLight Credentials and a deal struck between Dallas ISD, Region 10 Education Service Center and Dallas College (formerly Dallas County Community College District). They took a captive market of public school kids and fed them into a centralized blockchain system with a for-profit company to provide “life transcripts” to store academic, mental health, vaccine, and physical fitness data on students. This will be scaled statewide and eventually nationwide. Blockchain wallets are pitched as decentralization and a convenient tool for sharing and “owning our own data.” It’s the opposite. The arrangement allows for one company to have access to enormous amounts of private, sensitive student data for a tokenized future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2022, Dallas Innovates featured this article <a href="https://dallasinnovates.com/cooper-institute-and-greenlight-team-up-to-bring-a-blockchain-digital-locker-to-student-fitness/">Cooper Institute and GreenLight Team Up to Bring a Blockchain ‘Digital Locker’ to Student Fitness</a>. Cooper Institute is partnering with Dallas-based GreenLight Credentials to use its blockchain platform store and share records. School districts upload FITNESSGRAM data to the <a href="https://tea.texas.gov/texas-schools/health-safety-discipline/physical-fitness-assessment-initiative/pfai-fitnessgramr-resources">Texas Education Agency</a> website. I found an old <a href="https://www.cooperinstitute.org/pub/news.cfm?id=24">article</a> from 2007 on the Cooper website about Richardson ISD with a quote from a former superintendent that said, “Richardson ISD is pleased to host this event to stress the importance of exercise among young people,” said Superintendent Dr. David Simmons. “Many of our campuses have been using the FITNESSGRAM as an assessment tool for more than a decade.” RISD recently partnered with GreenLight to provide blockchain transcripts for students, as well.</p>
<p>When I speak in public, I often overwhelm the audience with information so it’s important that I close with action items, solutions, and offerings of hope through scripture and prayer. The most important thing we can do to repel this digital enclosure is to gather, worship, connect with each other and share our open hearts. Upon reflecting on the significance of the heart, I learned the electromagnetic frequency arcs out from the heart and back in the form of a torus field. The axis of this heart torus extends from the pelvic floor to the top of the skull, and the whole field is holographic, which means that information about it can be read from each and every point in the torus.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our friend, Jason Bosch interviewed me in 2020 about the plandemic, the future of work and the biosecurity state being imposed on us. He filmed a series of interviews called ‘If We Were Honest’ and mine was titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iUOkHZ6hY8&amp;t=2656s">Deep in the Heart of Dallas</a>. The aim of the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2PSzCewaA33zQ3xtqYCDkV">biosecurity state</a> to keep us as far apart as our heart frequencies extend is intentional. It is meant to condition us to be isolated, sick and fearful so we grow even further dependent on technology and the metaverse. The detachment from each other, the polarization of the political parties, and the increase in technology has led us to a tuning fork in the road. The tuning fork is two sides resonating negative energy. The energetic output flows into the torus of conflict and strife and feeds this agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of blockchain as a superorganism, as Alison calls it. It can store everything from our financial transactions to our most personal details collected by institutions we are supposed to trust. The more we feed the beast, the more it turns on us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brain is also a torus but when we are embryos, the heart develops first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the heart.&nbsp;</p>

 💡Findora Validator Spotlight — HussariaONE💡  Validator Spotlights showcase the amazing people working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain. Here are HussariaONE’s responses to some questions from the Findora community.  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>I’ve always been a huge fan of technology, and when I found out about blockchain in 2016, I instantly fell in love with it. I’m a software engineer with over 20 years of experience. My father started my journey into programming when I was nine years old, and I’ve been coding ever&nbsp;since.</p><p>I’m an entrepreneur, running a small business for the last 16 years. Based in Poland, I’m a husband and father of a 7-year-old son.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>I was attracted to crypto because, for me, it is freedom. I hope that one day we will be more free thanks to crypto. I see so many opportunities for the world to improve because of blockchain. I would never forgive myself if I missed&nbsp;it.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>Since 2017, I’ve been mining mainly Ethereum on a few GPU and ASIC rigs. A year ago, I started my first validator, which was for Ethereum 2.0, and in December 2021, I started another — this time for HarmonyONE.</p><p>I have a lot of experience with Linux and server administration. All my validators are running on two HP DL380 G10 servers with MSA 1060 storage with SSD&nbsp;drives.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? What should people trust you with their&nbsp;stake? <p>For me, running validator nodes is not so much a business as it is a hobby, and it makes me happy. I like supporting projects I believe in, being part of something new, learning, and gaining amazing experience in the technology world.</p><p>I’ll be in the space for the long haul — I’m not going anywhere. I’m running validators on my own professional, enterprise-grade hardware, which isn’t very common in the community. My validators are secured by a Mikrotik firewall, two fiber optic connections, and a big UPS with additional batteries.</p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>I came to Findora from the Harmony ONE community, and thanks to the amazing people I met there, I started to validate with&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>After some initial research, I found that Findora was not only an interesting project but had big potential for the future. A key feature was their EVM compatibility.</p> 6) How can someone delegate funds to&nbsp;you? <p>You can find Husaria Validator on both the Findora desktop and mobile wallets wallet. Here’s a <a href="https://findorascan.io/node?node=F6D51E19E146E8CCFCCDB65164E66E3773BA6936">direct link to the validator</a>.</p><p>I’ve also prepared a Polish manual on Medium describing how to stake FRA. You can find it&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@husaria.validator/findora-fra-poradnik-dla-pocz%C4%85tkuj%C4%85cych-d490788e76b">here</a>.</p> 7) Where can our community go to learn more about you or contact you? Do you have a validator dashboard link? <p>I’m trying my best to be more available on <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-hussariaone-96e231857126">Twitter</a>, and Telegram (@HusariaOne)</p><p>I’m always happy to answer all your questions, and I am excited to make new connections with the community.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-validator-spotlight-hussariaone-96e231857126">💡Findora Validator Spotlight — HussariaONE💡</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The upcoming Ethereum Merge event will see the Ethereum blockchain migrate from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus on September 15, 2022 (estimated). As we shared last month, Circle will fully and solely support USD Coin (USDC) and Euro Coin (EUROC) on the PoS chain post merge.

<p>Decentralized stablecoins have long been regarded as a fundamental building block for the decentralized web. The first ground-breaking project in this area is Maker with their stablecoin DAI. Multiple ideas existed for how Maker should evolve and the path Maker chose was to add multiple types of collateral and rely on governance input to maintain stability. Over time, the vast majority of Maker's collateral came to be represented by USDC, a centralized stablecoin issued by regulated US institutions.</p><p>Rai Reflex Index (RAI) decided to fork Maker and choose a path favoring trust-minimization over faster scaling. Unlike with Maker, only ETH is accepted as collateral and a different mechanism is used to maintain low volatility that doesn't rely on governance input. We were joined by Reflexer Labs' co-founder Ameen Soleimani to chat about the philosophical differences to Maker, the mechanisms used to ensure the stability of RAI, the threat of regulatory intervention for DAI and how we can create truly trust-minimized stablecoins to ensure the resilience and neutrality of DeFi.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Ameen's background and the vision behind Reflexer  How RAI differs from Maker  The problem with DAI becoming multi-collateral and adding more governance control  RAI's stability mechanism  The function of the redemption price  Who holds RAI and how stable is it?

How does one not just start, but keep, and transform, their company and business? Michael, Marc, Martin and Sonal debate these questions, as well as the impact of the cloud wars, how innovation happens when a company is private and when its public (something Michael knows well, having taken Dell public to private to back to public again), whether you can actually play nice to win as a leader, and more.</p>

  Most people still surf the Internet using Web2 addresses that are rented, not owned. With Brave and Unstoppable Domains, launching a decentralized website couldn’t be easier, giving people an alternative to renting Web2 domains.

<p>Now, more than 2 million Unstoppable domains can be used to easily build decentralized websites that are fully functional on Brave</p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that more than 2 million Unstoppable domains can now be used to display decentralized websites in Brave, a secure and privacy-centric browser that allows you to explore the Internet without being tracked. Through the Unstoppable Domains integration with Brave, creators can build decentralized content with a domain that they fully own and control – or explore the nearly 30,000 websites and counting that have been created using an Unstoppable domain. Now, we’re deepening our integration beyond .crypto to include more top-level domains – including .nft, .x, .wallet, .bitcoin, .blockchain, and .dao.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past 50 years, the Internet has transformed our world and the way we communicate. But today, most people still surf the Internet using Web2 addresses that are rented, not owned. With Brave and Unstoppable Domains, launching a decentralized website couldn’t be easier, giving people an alternative to renting Web2 domains. Unstoppable domains are yours for life with no renewal fees, eliminating the risk of losing a domain because you forget to renew or because the registrar takes it away.</p>
<p>“Together with Unstoppable, we’re giving more people the power to create content and explore the Internet without sacrificing their privacy or their autonomy,” said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave. “We’re excited to expand access to the decentralized Web for our 60 million users and to contribute to a privacy-first Internet where people have ownership of their data.”</p>
<p>“Web3 is the future, and with Brave, we’re expanding access to the decentralized Web and giving people more ways to build their identity online,” said Sandy Carter, SVP and Channel Chief of Unstoppable Domains. “Brave’s Web3-ready browser makes it possible to build websites that are fully owned by people, not rented from big tech companies.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the Brave integration with Unstoppable Domains, domains like Sandy.nft and Brad.crypto function just like normal Web2 addresses, but are hosted on the InterPlanetary File System (IFPS), a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Brave offers a Web3-ready browser with native support for IPFS—meaning you don’t need to take any additional steps, or download any additional software, to access decentralized sites. Navigating to an IPFS URL is as simple as clicking a link or pasting it into the Brave browser’s address bar. Native support for IPFS is a key piece of infrastructure to offer truly decentralized websites where both the domain and Web content are owned entirely by the user and distributed across a network of nodes.&nbsp;</p>

 One domain, endless possibilities 
<p>An Unstoppable domain is your identity for Web3 – you can use it to receive cryptocurrency payments, to log in seamlessly to apps, to send and receive emails, and now, to build your Web3 presence via a personal website. Creators can now build their identity on Web3 by creating a decentralized website with any Unstoppable domain.</p>
<p>With Unstoppable Domains and Brave, you can:</p>
 
 Build a personal blog or thought leader post (TimDraper.crypto) 
 Launch your NFT and create content for your community (DeadHeads.NFT)&nbsp; 
 Inspire the future of gaming (bizesports.x) 
 Build a Web3 resume that expresses who you are (Macncheeasy.blockchain) 
 Advocate and gather your community in one place (UnstoppableWow3.x)&nbsp; 
 Showcase your crypto podcast (0xJosh.NFT)&nbsp; 
 Create a platform to share your knowledge with the world (CryptoMoonWalkers.X) 
 

 Build your decentralized website and win domain credit and tokens 
<p>Interested in building your own decentralized website? Start by minting your Unstoppable domain. Once your domain is minted, you can add an existing IPFS hash, upload HTML directly from the Unstoppable Domains site, or create a new website through Web3 web builders such as <a href="https://pazly.dev/">Pazly</a>. Then, you’re ready to launch a Web3 site and use it as your personal website or a decentralized backup to your Web2 site. There’s no fee to publish a website with your NFT domain – Unstoppable covers gas fees for hosting. You also don’t have to pay for a separate hosting company, which can cost up to $200 per year in the Web2 space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re focused on building utility for NFT domains – Unstoppable Domains recently launched a new <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/mobile-app">mobile app</a> for Web3 identity management, <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/unstoppable-email-skiff">integrated with Skiff</a> to give domain holders end-to-end encrypted email, and now, we’re making it even easier to use your domain to build a personal website. We’re thrilled to take this step towards a more decentralized web and to help more people build their Web3 identity.</p>

         Partnering with Zeet: Bring Your Code to Your Cloud            <p>A simple cloud infrastructure management console—to make developers’ lives easier.</p>  <p>By Lauren Reeder and Bogomil Balkansky</p><p>Published September 6, 2022</p>       



      Zeet co-founders Johnny Dallas and Zihao Zhang.      



 
 
   
<p>We wish we’d found Johnny Dallas four years ago, when he was 16 and the youngest-ever speaker at AWS re:Invent. Already three years into his career, he wasn’t yet old enough to set foot in a casino and had to be escorted to the presentation room—where he proceeded to explain how he automated an entire fleet of over a thousand servers at the video streaming platform Bebo, later acquired by Twitch. The name of that presentation? “<a href="https://newsvideo.su/tech/video/275419">Managing 1,000 Servers Without a Driver’s License</a>.”</p>



<p>Just a couple of years later, Johnny and co-founder Zihao Zhang (CTO) struck out on their own to launch <a href="https://zeet.co/">Zeet</a>, and today, they and their team have built a wonderfully intuitive product that helps companies simplify the management of cloud infrastructure. One common refrain from customers we talked to: “Everyone should use Zeet.”</p>



<p>The origin of the cloud was about self-service. Instead of waiting on internal IT to provision infrastructure, developers flocked to an alternative that offered instant​​—or at least much faster—gratification. As the cloud continues to grow, the cloud providers’ offerings are becoming richer—but also fundamentally more complex.&nbsp;</p>



Options abound in an AWS console.



<p></p>



<p>Most engineers shouldn’t have to worry about DNS or API gateway, or making sure the right ports are exposed. But we’ve seen that application developers everywhere are spending significant cycles on setting up the infrastructure they need to do their job. While it’s a difficult problem to solve, we knew there must be a better way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through an absolutely glowing customer reference, we’re excited to have found that better way in Zeet. Johnny recognized that for most applications, a lot of standard infrastructure can be automated, abstracting away the complexity of the underlying cloud and creating a developer-friendly experience that can scale as products grow. Customers can use Zeet to deploy and manage their applications, but because it operates in their own cloud accounts, they also have an escape hatch—they can go directly to the cloud provider’s management console or use its APIs alongside Zeet. The result is easier deployment of containers, serverless functions and databases, so developers can spend less time on infrastructure and more time on their products.<br></p>



<p>Just as exciting as the product is the team behind Zeet, and Johnny and Zihao are looking for more teammates as they continue to build the company—so if you’d like to help them tackle this massive problem space, please<a href="https://zeet-co.notion.site/zeet-co/Work-Zeet-584be4ec1e924c07af008f72fcf08c41"> reach out</a>! We at Sequoia could not be more thrilled to partner with them in this new round of seed funding, and to support them on their mission to help everyone make better use of the cloud.</p>

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>September has just arrived, giving us a chance to look back upon August and shine a light on the progress we have made. Given the most recent changes in the privacy and crypto space, this has also been a time for us to go back and review several aspects of our roadmap and targets. Nonetheless, there has been no change to our ultimate commitment to enabling privacy and trust in crypto and DeFi.</p><p>Now, let’s jump right into this month’s update!</p> Tech and Product  Advanced Staking <p>Most logic-level fixes and other standing issues detected by the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/wave-3-of-incentivized-advanced-staking-testing-begins-on-july-7th/">third round of Advanced Staking testing</a> were ironed out throughout this month. We also finished internal testing of Multi-Asset Shielded Pools’ initial NFT capabilities this month at a smart contract level. The next step regarding shielding NFTs is to test the user interfaces, which will be initiated shortly.</p><p>Similarly, the fourth and final round of Advanced Staking testing took place with a small group of testers providing feedback upon the previous rounds’ findings. After this, all final pending merges on the contracts’ side were completed successfully. These smart contracts were shipped for an audit, the recommendations of which we’re currently working on. We’re currently in a back-and-forth process with our auditors that, when completed, will allow us to push Advanced Staking live.</p><p>Along with the above, Panther’s UI was updated according to a new design. We are also debuting new tools to track internal testing that should empower Panther to test its products in a better way.</p> Progress towards v1 <p>Advanced progress is crucial to the implementation strategy for Panther’s v1. As a part of the discussions sparked by recent events, next milestones, features and priorities related to disclosure and compliance tools have been determined and ranked.</p><p>Planning and careful, well-informed design are vital to Panther’s development. Along with the release of Advanced Staking, these determinations should provide clarity to developers and architects alike about Panther’s direction, both at a smart contract- and UI-level.</p> Community  Final $ZKP distribution <p>Panther completed the seventh and last distribution of vested $ZKP for Public Sale purchasers in the first week of August. The $ZKP from our Public Sale is now entirely in circulation, in its owners’ hands!</p> Telegram AMA <p>On August 26th, Panther’s Head of Marketing Mike Chan and our Product Managers DeFinci and Andrew Zaichenko hosted a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-compliance-decentralization-more-recap-from-panthers-26-08-ama/">Telegram AMA</a> with the Panther community. They were able to discuss building during a bear market, our approach and stance regarding compliance, and the next steps to further empower the Panther DAO.</p><p>In a direct quote from Mike, “decentralization is an ongoing process that we're constantly thinking about. We're starting small and then iterating on that.” We also described multiple concrete undertakings in the works to make governance more heavily community-focused. </p><p>Check all of this out on our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-compliance-decentralization-more-recap-from-panthers-26-08-ama/">Panther Blog</a>.</p> ZKoffee <p>One day before <a href="https://cbr.stanford.edu/sbc22/">Stanford’s Science of Blockchain Conference 2022</a>, we organized <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/zkoffee-with-panther-tickets-408330907737">ZKoffee</a>, a delightful gathering in Lutticken's Deli over coffee and breakfast for privacy enthusiasts to talk zero knowledge, DeFi, security, and more. </p> Panther in the media <p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder and CTO of Panther, was invited for an <a href="https://anchor.fm/blockchain-dxb/episodes/Tornado-Cash-discussion-Crypto--Coffee-at-8-with-Anish-Mohammed-CTO-of-Panther-Protocol-e1mt9pq">interview on the Blockchain DXB Podcast</a> centered around the Tornado Cash sanctions and what they mean for privacy in blockchain. A nuanced subject like this needs careful analysis, and that is precisely what Anish had to offer to the podcast’s listeners.</p> Hirings <p>Our <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol">Angel.co page</a> lists several open positions for those eager to join the fight for privacy in Web3:</p>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2204245-applied-mathematician">Applied Mathematician</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221049-blockchain-architect">Blockchain Architect</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2221050-cryptography-researcher-zero-knowledge-proofs">Cryptography Researcher (Zero-Knowledge Proofs)</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/1960045-head-of-quantitative-analysis">Head of Quantitative Analysis</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227585-full-stack-developer">Full-Stack Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2227586-lead-front-end-developer">Lead Front-end Developer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2109231-machine-learning-internship">Machine Learning Internship</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2172598-graphic-designer">Graphic Designer</a>  <a href="https://angel.co/company/panther-protocol/jobs/2169604-social-media-manager">Social Media Manager</a>  <p>This month, we also hired new contributors for several key positions.</p><p>If you wish to work with us or know someone who might be a good fit, please follow the links above!</p> September Calendar <p>A lot is lined up for September! The following events have already been announced through our social media platforms. However, we’ll be participating in many more of them, so stay tuned for the Panther team visiting an event near you.</p> Twitter Spaces with Zprize <p>This Thursday, Head of Product Saif Akhtar and CTO Dr. Anish Mohammed are taking part in a Twitters Spaces with our partners, <a href="https://twitter.com/z_prize?lang=es">Zprize</a>. The Spaces will take place at 10 AM PST, and will revolve around Panther’s contribution to cutting-edge cryptography.</p><p>The Zprize competition is aimed at employing private funds to accelerate the advancement of zero-knowledge prover technology. Teams that manage to solve important problems for the advancement of ZK tech are rewarded thanks to this competition.</p> Dr. Anish Mohammed at NEARCON <p>Our CTO, Anish Mohammed, will be a speaker at <a href="https://nearcon.org/">NEARCON</a>, the flagship event of the NEAR ecosystem, taking place in Lisbon from September 11th to 14th.<br></p> CEO Oliver Gale visits Zebu Live <p>Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale. will be in London on September 23rd for <a href="https://www.zebulive.xyz/">Zebu Live</a>, a conference on Web3 with 120+ speakers and over 1200 leaders in the Web3 space. He will be speaking about privacy in Web3 and how to best regulate it.</p> Sponsoring zkSummit <p>As experienced builders and researchers in the field, it was only natural for Panther to sponsor zkSummit’s 8th edition this September. The <a href="https://www.zksummit.com/">Zero Knowledge Summit</a> is the most important conference on cryptography and zero-knowledge in blockchain. The event will take place in Berlin on September 15th, attended by developers, founders, academics, and cryptographers working on zero knowledge for talks and workshops.</p> Continued success in CoinMarketCap’s Community Rankings <p>Our community is one of Panther’s greatest strengths. CoinMarketCap has been releasing its Community Rankings weekly. On them, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/profile/PantherProtocol">Panther</a> has consistently figured as one of the top projects by engagement growth!</p><p>Once again, we’re proud to be in the hands of such an active, engaged community.</p> Stay tuned <p>August wasn’t an easy month for privacy in crypto and DeFi but, as builders, we rest assured that Panther is following a long-term approach. </p><p>Our ultimate goal is to enable privacy and trust in DeFi. The way we choose to do this is by creating tools that are compatible with law enforcement and that enable users to stay on the law’s good side at all times.</p><p>As always, we invite you participate in the communities linked below and to keep an eye out for upcoming updates. We can’t wait to see your reactions to the upcoming Advanced Staking launch and everything we have on the pipeline!</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Be brave as Ukrainians — Build “AnonDrop” at the Kyiv Tech Summit hackathon! <p>One of the harder problems facing the documentation of war crimes is to allow witnesses to send in data without revealing who they are or their location to an adversary that can watch their internet connection. The last thing someone who wishes to disclose a human rights violation to do is to make themselves a victim simply by reporting the&nbsp;crime!</p><p>Nym is a <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/network-privacy">decentralised mixnet</a> that provides privacy and anonymity at the network layer and so potentially can serve as a powerful privacy-protecting front-end for these attacks. The mix network can be utilized to provide strong privacy protections able to withstand attacks by even nation level adversaries.</p><p>We believe there is an urgent need to create an encrypted file drop application — AnonDrop. This will use the Nym mixnet to hide the metadata of a user uploading encrypted files (and their decryption keys) to a service operated by institutions requiring sensitive evidence where sender anonymity is paramount.</p><p>Kyiv Tech Summit and AnonDrop for the freedom of&nbsp;Ukraine</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kyivtechsummit.com/">Kyiv Tech Summit</a>, happening 6–9 September 2022 in a global hybrid format, aims to bring together some of the best developers, technology providers, designers, innovators, and product evangelists who are looking to solve tangible, on-the-ground issues to aid the Ukrainian people in their fight for&nbsp;freedom.</p><p>AnonDrop can be used by those fighting for the freedom of Ukraine to securely upload evidence of war crimes&nbsp;there.</p><p>Looking beyond, the software should defend the uploading of data not just in Ukraine, but anywhere where human rights work is needed, and allow the persistent and decentralised storage of data. There has been a long-stream of work on using mixnets for this use-case, such as the FreeHaven design that preceded even Tor, but now is the time to make privacy-preserving storage a&nbsp;reality!</p><p>Combining the powers of Nym, IPFS and&nbsp;Filecoin</p><p>As we have always believed, privacy loves company! AnonDrop combines the Nym mixnet for anonymity with IPFS for decentralised storage. Solutions built for the Nym specifications therefore also qualify for a <a href="https://ecosystem-wg.notion.site/Filecoin-IPFS-Hackathon-Judging-Criteria-fb29da31431c4c8da1be6c30e1d0ef82">IPFS/Filecoin bounty evaluation</a>!</p><p>Needing little introduction, <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS </a>and <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin </a>have been providing persistent decentralised file storage since 2015 so it is only natural for Nym to join forces with this tried and tested infrastructure to provide real support for defenders of human&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Specifications for&nbsp;AnonDrop</p><p>Code already exists (see section below) for a generic ‘encrypted Dropbox’ proof of concept (‘NymDrive’) which utilises the mixnet. The spec for this challenge requires modifying the NymDrive code with additional features to make it suitable to securely send sensitive evidence to institutions such as the United Nations (‘the Authority’). These service providers will be run by the institutions who will be gathering this evidence. The institutions gathering the evidence run “service providers” enabling people to connect and send files through the decentralised Nym mixnet. The mixnet mixes the data, making it anonymous and untraceable before forwarding it to be stored on IPFS, a decentralised filestore.</p><p>This application spec involves three distinct bits of&nbsp;code:</p><p>1. An Uploader GUI allowing users to do the following through the&nbsp;mixnet:</p>  Store an encrypted file via the AnonDrop service&nbsp;provider  Multi-lingual interface (so interface can be in English and Ukrainian)  Verify their file has been uploaded and stored (via checking&nbsp;hashes)  Toggle an option to delete the local file from their device, ideally secure deletion.  Securely share the hash &amp; decryption key of uploaded encrypted files with ‘the authority’  <p>2. An AnonDrop service provider which does the following via the&nbsp;mixnet:</p>  Receive files.  Hash these files with the same hash function as the GUI and store the files with this hash as its identifier in&nbsp;IPFS.  Respond to verification requests from&nbsp;users.  Send the relevant file as a response to valid retrieval queries.  Deny invalid file retrieval requests.  <p>3. A Reader GUI allowing the Authority to do the following:</p>  Receive files.  Verify these&nbsp;files.  Decrypt these&nbsp;files.  <p>Changes required to existing NymDrive code for challenge</p><p>The specification of the NymDrive code can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16k5lw-Y3fzfk5mzE65DRCBa0IIqCvAUzM26zNsIo0rQ/edit">here</a>, and the code of the winner of the Hackathon <a href="https://github.com/saleel/nymdrive">here</a>.</p><p>There are a number of required changes to modify NymDrive into a FileDrop&nbsp;POC:</p>  Make a ‘reader’ GUI app with which the authority can decrypt and access information that is&nbsp;stored  Make data flow unidirectional    User uploads an encrypted file.  <p>(N.B. we have not yet implemented anonymous replies in the mixnet — as such acknowledgements of receipt of the file by the SP to the Upload Client will have to be implemented manually, and will not be anonymous. Anonymous replies via Single Use Reply Blocks (SURBs) would be swapped in once they are implemented in the mixnet in the future, and would be used in production / deployment of this application.</p><p>TL;DR its fine for teams to implement non-private hacks in this hackathon project as we do not yet have SURBs implemented.)</p>  File optionally deleted from local device (see point&nbsp;below)  Remove option to grab upload from SP at a later date that currently exists with&nbsp;NymDrive  <p>3. Add automatic file wipe from local device on upload as an&nbsp;option</p>  We already have the option of a file being deleted manually via the GUI — add the option for it to be automatic on upload once the encrypted file and other evidence are uploaded &amp; ack is received from the&nbsp;SP  <p>4. Enable Authority running the service provider to decrypt files on SP accessed via ReaderGUI</p>  E.g. something like ECDH key exchange with the Authority for decryption.  <p>5. Include additional information when uploading files to service provider:</p>  ​​​​​​​Identity of sender (cryptographic)  Metadata of photo or video from phone (e.g. time, if location tagging is on then that,&nbsp;etc)  <p>There are a number of additional things which would be interesting to see implemented on top of&nbsp;these:</p>  Image provenance check prior to uploading file&nbsp;to    CAI has a pretty well developed java SDK (the Rust SDK currently only handles images, not video, but might still be worth experimenting with given that this functionality is presumed to be added in the future): <a href="https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool">https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool</a>  Inclusion of this check is noted in the application flow diagram above, where the check takes place after the file is uploaded to a computer, but prior to being encrypted and sent through the mixnet to the&nbsp;SP.  Image provenance tasks are any tasks that must occur on the user’s end to make the file capable of being authenticated, verified, etc. This can be accomplished by running the file through CAI SDK functions.  <p>2.

  zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs permeate almost everything zero-knowledge in blockchain. Here's all you need to know to understand how they differ.

<p>To understand the concept of zk-SNARKs vs zk-STARKs and how these technologies measure against each other, it’s imperative to first outlay the problem they solve.</p><p>Lack of privacy and scalability are the two biggest obstacles hampering the mass adoption of blockchain technology. As beautiful as the idea of a public and permissionless blockchain is, without data privacy, a Web3-heavy future could look like a dystopia in which every single transaction leaves a clear trail open to the public to learn everything about you.</p><p>Publicly accessible <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transaction</a> records are great as verifiable activity proofs, but anyone who cared could go digging, linking payment to payment, and tying your real-world identity to your on-chain trail and could use it against you.</p><p>Similarly, a lack of scalability can gravely inhibit the prospects of blockchain adoption. The scalability problem has been at the core of most of the blockchain innovations we’ve seen in the past couple of years. Without sacrificing <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a>, the current state of blockchain technology simply cannot support applications that reach mass adoption.</p><p>Then came zero-knowledge proofs – &nbsp;a single solution to both problems.</p> ZKPs – a solution to the blockchain privacy/scalability riddle <p>A ZKP (Which stands for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proof</a>) allows one party to verify (among other things) a claim that a transaction is valid or correct without the need to carry additional information about the transaction. Through them, cryptography found a way to prove the authenticity of a transaction without revealing sensitive information.</p>A simple illustration of a zero-knowledge proof. (<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-are-zero-knowledge-proofs-7ef6aab955fc">Source</a>)<p>The emergence of ZK-proofs signaled a new dawn for the crypto space. Not only could they enable truly private transactions, but they could also help networks like Ethereum scale.</p><p>For a zero-knowledge proof to work, it needs to fulfill three conditions – completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge. ZKPs can be of one of two types – interactive and non-interactive. Interactive zero-knowledge proofs needed constant, back-and-forth interactions between the prover and the verifier until the verifier confirms the truth in the prover's claims.</p><p>Non-interactive ZKPs require no such interaction, with a single exchange of information sufficing to satisfy both parties. The most prominent non-interactive ZKPs are zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs. In this article, we’ll look at what they are, their differences, applications, and use cases.</p> What are zk-SNARKs? <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zksnarks-through-the-lens-of-the-cypherpunks/">zk-SNARK</a> stand for Zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge, a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof widely used today. Privacy coin protocols like Zcash use zk-SNARKs to offer a shielded blockchain experience while providing sufficient proof that every shielded transaction is valid.</p><p>To understand how zk-SNARKs work, we must consider each letter of the acronym:</p>  ZK: This pair represents “zero-knowledge”, signifying that a zk-SNARK provides no additional information other than the validity of its submitter claims. Any information that describes the nature of the transaction(s), its participants, and the exchanged value is withheld from the verifier.  S: This letter stands for “succinct”, meaning that the proof size is small (occupying little space) paving the way for quick and easy verifications.  N: Stands for non-interactive, meaning that little or no interaction is required between prover and verifier. Everything from proof generation to submission and verification occurs within a single transaction.  ARK: Represents “Argument of Knowledge”, and this part adds the quality of computational soundness to zk-SNARKs. Simply put, a bad actor can hardly cheat the system without the knowledge to support their claim (i.e. by holding the underlying information they’re trying to forge). This is based on the theory that the bad actor has limited computational power, meaning that anyone with unlimited computational power could create fake proofs. Some zk-SNARK protocols have a way to prevent this kind of attack.  <p>zk-SNARKs have an important piece of their makeup: they require a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted setup</a> between prover and verifier. To construct zero-knowledge proofs with zk-SNARKs, a set of public parameters is needed, along with the creation of cryptographic keys. You can liken these parameters to the “rules” of a protocol, and they are usually encoded. Meanwhile, the keys make privacy possible.</p><p>Zcash is one of the foremost privacy-preserving protocols that use zk-SNARKs. Also, some popular <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">ZK-rollups</a> and Layer-2 blockchains use <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">zk-SNARK proof technology to provide scalability to traditional blockchain networks like Ethereum.</a></p> What are zk-STARKs? <p>The first papers detailing STARKs were published in 2018 by Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horeshy, and Michael Riabzev. As another type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, zk-STARKs are less popular than their zkSNARK counterparts, mostly because they are a newer model. The term stands for zero-knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge, and they are faithful to the fundamentals of zero-knowledge proofs, allowing users to share validated data or perform computations with third parties without disclosing any actual information to the third party. Like in the case of zk-SNARKs, we will evaluate each letter of the acronym to learn how zk-STARKs work.</p>  ZK: Like in “zk-SNARKs”, this also means “zero-knowledge”, implying that they prove transactions or interactions without disclosing any underlying information except that they are correct and authentic.  S: This means “scalable”, highlighting how these zero-knowledge proofs focus on enhancing blockchain scalability. zk-STARKs enable developers to execute computation and store data off-chain, increasing scalability exponentially. The zero-knowledge proofs verify these off-chain activities, which are then submitted online for interested parties to verify them.  T: Stands for “transparent”, and this quality marks one of the most significant differences between zk-STARKs and zk-SNARKs. They use publicly-available randomness to generate parameters, eliminating the need for a trusted setup.  ARK: “Argument of Knowledge” implies the same as in zk-SNARKs, but use a different computation approach. They use <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/">hash functions</a> resistant to collisions, effectively eliminating the need for trusted setups.  <p>zkSTARK technology is more recent than zk-SNARKs, and it was pioneered by Starkware with rollup solutions. Using zk-STARKs, one can compute several thousands of transactions in batches off-chain and submit a sole zkSTARK proof to confirm the transactions’ validity on-chain.</p> zk-SNARKs vs. zk-STARKs: similarities and differences  Similarities <p>These two share a few similarities. Firstly, they are non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocols, requiring little interaction between prover and verifier. Proof generation, submission, and verification are usually completed within one transaction.</p><p>Also, they enhance blockchain scalability. Zero-knowledge proofs are much smaller than the average Bitcoin transaction and get verified much quicker. Swift verification and less block space mean more scalability for networks like Ethereum.</p> Differences <p>zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs differ on four major points, at least:</p>Difference between zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and Bulletproofs (emojis are the author’s). (<a href="https://github.com/gluk64/awesome-zero-knowledge-proofs">Source</a>) Transparency <p>zk-SNARKs need an initial trusted setup phase to generate the randomness required to generate zero-knowledge proofs. These parameters are usually held in the custody of a small group to protect them. If the parameters fall into the wrong hands, dishonest actors could use them to create false proofs.</p><p>zk-STARKs follow a different approach, utilizing collision-resistant cryptography to eliminate the need for private parameter generation ceremonies. Without trusted setups, the parameters for generating randomness are public, limiting centralization and empowering <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/">transparency</a>.</p> Security <p>zk-SNARKs use an initial setup to generate parameters and, according to their setup, are computationally sound. Their soundness, however, assumes that provers have limited computing power. However, when a prover uses an unlimited amount of computing power, they will be able to, for instance, make use of a certain algorithm that can execute extremely quick parallel integer factorization computations that can be used to extract a private key from a public key. In other words, they will be able to breach proof systems. Thus, zk-SNARKs are, in theory, vulnerable to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590005621000138">quantum computing attacks</a>, therefore, not quantum resistant.</p><p>zk-STARKs do not need an initial <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html">trusted setup</a>, choosing a collision-resistant approach instead. Thus, they do not require high computation costs like zk-SNARKs, eliminating the threat of being compromised by the unlimited computation power of quantum computing. They are, therefore, higher in the quantum resistant scale.</p> Scalability <p>zk-SNARKs have a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bulletproofs-in-crypto-an-introduction-to-a-non-interactive-zk-proof/">smaller byte size</a> compared to zk-STARKs, but their computational demand makes them slower to generate proofs compared to the other option. zk-SNARKs consume less gas than zk-STARKs, and they verify proofs faster because of the difference in byte size.</p><p>While it may seem like zk-SNARKs are more scalable due to their faster proof verification, zk-STARKs generate proofs quicker and scale faster, consuming less gas when coming on-chain due to the adoption of off-chain computation and storage. However, during periods of low throughput (few proofs created), they will take much longer to verify.</p> Structure <p>zk-SNARKs are built on elliptic curves, which improve security and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">privacy</a> under the assumption that it is infeasible to find the logarithm of a random elliptic curve element in relation to a public base point.</p><p>zk-STARKs, on the other hand, uses lean cryptography – collision-resistant hash functions – to provide scalability and security.</p> Applications and Use Cases  zk-SNARKs <p>zk-SNARKs are the more popular of the two main non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs. Several projects in the crypto space today have adopted them to further scalability and privacy, with the latter being more widely used.</p><p>zk-SNARKs generate and verify zero-knowledge proofs quickly, and privacy-enhancing protocols have used them vastly. With zk-SNARKs, privacy-enabled blockchains can shield transactions from the public eye, allowing users to provide zero-knowledge proofs in the place of average transaction records.</p><p>Some privacy protocols like <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/">Panther Protocol</a> have integrated selective disclosure mechanisms that allow users to share the information shielded by the blockchain with trusted third parties.</p><p>zk-SNARKs can also be adapted for identity verification, allowing users to pass <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC and AML</a> requirements without putting their sensitive information at risk. Using zk-SNARKs, these protocols can allow users to submit a zero-knowledge proof of their identity instead of &nbsp;documents, confirming that they have the required data to be verified without revealing any extra information. zk-SNARKs have also been adopted to drive <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-defi-privacy-suite-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary/">privacy in decentralized finance</a>, gaming, ZK-rollups, and asset ownership.</p> zk-STARKs <p>zk-STARKs are known to scale better than zk-SNARKs. Hence they have been adopted by blockchain scalability solutions like ZK-rollups and Layer-2 blockchain solutions. With them, these protocols compute transactions and store data off-chain, then submit zero-knowledge proofs on-chain to update the network's state.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>This week someone described me as a file that had been closed, annotated, and archived. In this (relatively) short video I compare the cybernetic circle with the dynamic spiral. Promises of stability and homeostasis are set against uncertainty with possibility. It draws upon themes I raised today in my discussions with Jason and Leo on parametric insurance contracts and risk profiling Mother Nature. I try to make the case for the spiral as we make our way to a hopefully less transactional and more reciprocal future. I did this as a clearing of any intentions, conscious or unconscious, meant to contain me in digital amber. I am a dynamic, evolving force, and I have more waves to make before my time is up.</p>
<p>I also read from John Trudell’s poetry book “<a href="https://indigenousliteratures.wordpress.com/2014/03/14/lines-from-a-mined-mind/">Lines From A Mined Mind</a>.”</p>

<p>“Peridot is a popular stone for protection against difficulties and negativity. It is also often used to strengthen and purify the physical and energetic bodies. Peridot is considered a very joyful, warm, friendly stone that can ease anger and jealousy as well as encourage open-heartedness. It is also a stone of abundance and gratitude, and can help us to acknowledge and invite abundance, both material and spiritual, in our lives. Peridot is also helpful when it comes to recognizing patterns that have been causing blocks, so that you can move past them. In addition, peridot can help you to trust your own inner voice and become less attached to the guidance of others outside of you.”</p>

That data will improve artificial intelligence machine learning as attempts are made to catalyze “life” at the cybernetic edge – order out of chaos. IoT monitored insurance risk is simply a more sophisticated cybernetic governance system. We plan to finish the second half of this discussion next Thursday, September 8, at 1pm EST.</p>

<p></p><p>On August 26th, we hosted an exciting AMA session at Panther Protocol’s Telegram group chat. This AMA featured Mike Chan (Head of Marketing), DeFinci, and Andrew Zaichenko (both Product Managers), answering live and pre-submitted questions from Panther’s followers. &nbsp;<br></p><p>Below you can read our transcript for the event. Also note that, although they share the same title, DeFinci is mostly focused on Interchain work, while Andrew is primarily dedicated to Advanced Staking.<br></p><p>The transcript starts here:<br></p> What is the status of Advanced Staking, and how did the testing rounds go? <br> <p>Andrew:</p><p>We have a 100% functional product, which passed multiple internal test cycles. The latest updates were about implementing a mutable staking time and NFT-functionalities (with no UI yet). <br></p><p>There have been three separate workflows within Advanced Staking development: <br></p>  Addressing audit recommendations: The team received the results of the audit, addressed its recommendations, and provided feedback during the current week. As with every audit taking itself seriously, this process entails multiple feedback and change rounds before arriving at a final version.<br>  Resolving final tasks from the backend/contracts side: Numerous items informed by testing and internal work.<br>  Updating the UI's design to look beautiful while remaining functional. These products are a gateway into Panther's v1, so we want to make the UX feel as much as possible as the first version of the protocol.<br>  <p>The team's current key focus in terms of Advanced Staking is auditing. Implementation of audit results will enhance the product and unblock further iterations. <br></p> What’s the status of your progress when it comes to interchain features? This kind of feature is core to the protocol, so it’d be great to know what’s going on there. <br> <p>DeFinci:</p><p>I would say that MASPs are the core feature of the Panther Protocol. The Interchain Mechanism is a horizontal scaling architecture that would, in time, be the backbone of the Panther Ecosystem and drive the private communication between blockchains and dApps.<br></p><p>To emphasize how serious we take Interchain for anyone who just joined the ranks of Panther Protocol, here's what I can say. The world of blockchains is architecturally transparent, and there is a need for a solution that preserves the privacy of token transfers between different ecosystems. With private interchain transfers, we aim to solve the default transparency of blockchains, giving users a right to privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.<br></p><p>So far, we’ve identified the most appropriate liquidity approach to reduce the latency of token delivery from one blockchain to another, guaranteeing a higher rate of anonymity. Liquidity is the backbone of each successful interchain mechanism, and we take it very seriously. By design, everyone participating in MASPs will be appropriately rewarded depending on the demand and supply between multiple blockchains.<br></p> Panther takes compliance very seriously, unlike other players on the field. Do you see this as a competitive advantage or a drawback?<br> <p>Mike:</p><p>We’ve been serious about compliance from the very beginning, and in light of recent events, we’ve been proven to be correct. So we definitely see this as a competitive advantage.<br></p><p>We believe in the tenets of decentralization and permissionlessness that DeFi provides and, of course, the freedoms that privacy provides. But we also understand the regulatory environment and that DeFi won’t be left alone to run wild. <br></p><p>Regulators are here. They mean well, more are coming, and DeFi protocols must address that. And the tools we are building will help them do so and allow institutions to have a path towards compliance in DeFi and crypto.<br></p> Is Panther fast-tracking any compliance features in light of recent events?<br> <p>DeFinci:</p><p>We had multiple brainstorming sessions to design features that would solve various mass market problems. As it stands now, we will prioritize our approach toward disclosures and compliance with each new feature released within the Panther ecosystem. <br></p><p>We have been focusing on disclosures of token ownership and shielded transfers within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools and, later on, an audit trail with the release of Interchain Transfers. There are a lot more things that we are designing behind the scenes and consulting with lawyers closely following recent events that we can’t yet talk about.<br></p> Does the Panther Protocol have enough resources to sustain itself during a bear market?<br> <p>Mike:</p><p>Definitely. Every project’s token Treasury took a hit during this bear market. But we raised a good chunk of money through our Private and Public Sales and received a few grants from Layer-1s to integrate with their networks. So we’re in a good spot. <br></p><p>We’re still recruiting developers and engineers, as you may see in posts on social networks because we’ve got a lot to build. We’re also being smart with our budgets, cutting costs where we can, and spending on things we believe will give us a good return. <br></p><p>The bottom line is we are in an excellent position to weather the bear market and come out stronger on the other side.<br></p> Can you share what Panther is building with Flare? Any information about the partnership? Anything to do with the Flare/Songbird network?<br> <p>DeFinci:</p><p>We've done one round of deployment and testing so far with the Songbird network. There is further testing in progress, and once that's concluded, we will share it with the community in a formal report.<br></p><p>In the meantime, we would like to mention that we are thankful for the grant from Flare, and we are looking forward to their network being a part of the Panther Ecosystem. Both our projects are aligned in more than one way in our ideals.<br></p><p>Andrew:<br></p><p>We find Flare as a great project to cooperate with. Our team has been investigating the current state of the network and its technical possibilities. As of now, we've clarified that: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>  Cryptographic contracts exist on the chain, and we have deployed Panther's contracts there.  Subgraph itself does not support the network. Therefore, we need to host the subgraph node on our server.  A Gnosis Safe instance does not exist on the network,  Flare does not have a bridge to move messages from ETH to Flare.<br>  <p>We are in touch with an excellent Flare team and looking forward to developing our cooperation!<br></p> What are your next steps toward decentralization?<br> <p>Mike:</p><p>The first thing I'll say is that decentralization is an ongoing process that we're constantly thinking about. We're starting small and then iterating on that.</p><p>Some of the things we have in the works include:<br></p>  Creating a forum that allows all of us as a community to bring up, discuss, and debate topics about the protocol and its development. This could include technical, community, or marketing topics. This protocol was launched in a fully decentralized way, and we want everything we do to be as decentralized as possible.  Using this forum as a tool, we're creating a process for community members to be able to pitch Panther Improvement Proposals or PIPs. In the past, PIPs were put up on Snapshot with voting as the only way for the community to express their opinions. This will definitely change, and the community will have a much greater voice in the direction of the protocol.  Down the road, we're talking grants so community members can help build and grow the protocol, changing our corporate structure to ensure we're sufficiently decentralized, and much more. <br>  <p>Andrew:<br></p><p>I would add that the product team has been analyzing a decentralized way of voting function realization. Snapshot (which we have been using) is a good tool and has brought a lot of value to the crypto world and Panther. However, it is still representative of off-chain voting. This has specific risks, which can be mitigated using an on-chain voting attitude only. Any other intermediary actor/system is a potential point of failure. The target is to reach more independence and develop a self-sustainable ecosystem for the users and the community. &nbsp;<br></p> What are the main challenges when it comes to building a MASP?<br> <p>Andrew:<br></p><p>The accuracy one needs to craft real privacy. Here's how accurate the MASP's development must be to protect your privacy: <br></p><p>Digital activity produces digital footprints. E.g., any of your transactions (both of crypto and non-crypto nature) creates a footprint. In the case of decentralized tech, this footprint is immutable and publicly accessible. Now, guess: what data can potentially damage privacy? In-protocol rewards are a non-obvious yet easily-exploitable case. This is not intuitive, but we realized it within our work and have taken measures against it.<br></p><p>Why are rewards problematic? Well, because they need to be appropriately rounded.

<p>I’ve been working for the past month or so to wrap my head around bio-geochemistry, radio-ecology, and complexity theory. During that time a collaboration I’d had with Raul Diego at Silicon Icarus transitioned, which I am chalking up to a cyclical communication failure, which unfortunately is not uncommon in these challenging digital waters. That situation led me to revisit “green” impact finance at the University of Pennsylvania, my alma mater, and discover new, unsettling things about the “just transition” and plans for next-gen modular nuclear energy that surprise, surprise will also serve as factories that will produce “medical” isotopes for the Human+ transition. You can read the piece <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/08/28/upenns-nuclear-green-syn-bio-blockchain-web-of-impact-and-leaving-silicon-icarus/">here</a>. I did a read aloud of it yesterday and attempted to clarify my position to set Raul’s mind at ease that my pursuing my own course of research was not meant as an attack on his important project, Silicon Icarus.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, I’d heard from some folks that they would like for me to read some of my longer posts, because it is more convenient to listen to them while they are driving or doing housework / errands, etc. I kind of resisted at first, but honestly, it’s not a bad idea. In fact, I’d like to go back and re-read my early work on education as I think much of this is coming to pass now and invite people to comment with updated links showing how my predictions are all coming out into the open. Because my wireless connection isn’t great, I recorded the audio separately and actually set up a podcast format. It’s very basic, but it’s a start. If you want to check out things I post there, here’s the <a href="https://anchor.fm/alison-mcdowell">link</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I’d love some help thinking through this, because I believe I’m really onto something. Look at the screenshots that follow – circles, circles, circles. These circles are mathematically imposed and seek to remove or at least dampen the “chaos” of nature, replacing an open system of harmonized cycles – the symphony of the cosmos – with some sort of neutered, synthetic homeostasis. Contrast the image below, the placenta as the sacred tree of life, with the featured one above. Are we so enslaved to scientism that we will stand idly by as evolutionary algorithms supersede the womb?</p>

<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Lazslo-World-Homeostat-Peace-Bahai.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>The first excerpt is from a talk given by Ervin Laszlo to the Baha’i in 1989 about global peace and convergence with “unity through diversity.” The second is from the paper I shared about complexity theory in Neal Stephenson’s sci-fi books touching on the emergence of life from non-life at the edge where order meets chaos. This is needed for ready access to stored energy to catalyze random molecules into novel bio-geochemical patterns that can hold and maintain their new form. It sounds similar to what I described at Southern Virginia University talking about science-fiction author Orson Scott Card’s theory of philotic twining.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This leads me to wonder about the push for cybernetic society. Is their closed-loop system of circles an attempt to delineate “order” from “chaos,” while engineering catalytic edge environments suited to their enhanced evolutionary plans? I’d guess it goes back to Ouroboros. Is the energy currency programmable money? Is, perhaps, the method of transfer being woven into our very biology through nanotechnology? Are we talking a new form of ecological economics with interspecies currency based on our metabolisms tracked through radioactive isotopes? Is that why we are seeing so many “hack your metabolism apps flooding our consciousness now?</p>

<p>When reading Laszlo’s quote, I can’t help thinking of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and his idea that “world peace” was necessary for the convergence. I suspect “peace” and “harmony” are going to be incorporated into the branding of the cybernetic global control grid. Remaking global economies along the lines of “sustainable” doughnuts double the edges. “The edge of chaos is where new ideas and innovative genotypes are forever nibbling away at the edges of the status quo, and where even the most entrenched old guard will be overthrown.” So much chaos, most of it manufactured. This is part of the pulsing program towards emergence.</p>
 
 
 
 
  
 <a href="https://www.aihr.com/blog/diversity-equity-inclusion-belonging-deib/">Source</a> 
 
 
 
 Is this planned doughnut economy (torus) and smart mega-city regionalism meant to incubate loosely structured, “decentralized” energy exchanges that maximize the edges described? To turn a non-life information system into a sentient entity? Maybe that’s what Oliver Reiser was talking about in the “World Sensorium”? Is it an Egregore seeking to usurp the sacred noosphere? Is it an emergent energetic parasite trying to leverage life as an armature to join the living? When you watch the clip with the rat in the torus, note that he is “illuminated.” Remember the metabolism hacking app is called Lumen.

<p>I see Laszlo using the term “parametric” like the parametric insurance Jason and Leo and I&nbsp; will be discussing in an upcoming podcast. How better to control populations within the cybernetic matrix than by systematically disrupting living conditions, including access to basic necessities like water and shelter and food? They are cultivating mass dispossession, which I wrote about in my series on cyber-physical systems and refugee encampments.&nbsp; Governments and defense contractors and telecom interests are able to monitor and influence weather outcomes. Somehow I feel like the weather derivatives and these new parametric&nbsp; insurance products are important tools they plan to use to run us as puppets in order to generate their desired hyper-cycles.</p>

<p><a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-admin/upload.php?item=13433">Source</a></p>
<p>Note that Cambridge is also where they are monitoring crypto currency energy data. I believe this is to set up futures markets in “just transition” with inflated baselines, but also the energetic control grid will be key in catalyzing new forms of “life” for information fields – the injection or pulsing of energy?</p>
<p>That feels like the dual use of the concept of “parametric” as in insurance. It is the pulsing, the controlled management of information fields whether it be information warfare, supply chain scarcity, weather, currency exchange – that is the trigger point. Managing the “current” to use existing life forms to create “life” from “non-life.” It is also a technique by which to derive isotopes! Unbelievable.</p>

<p>It also makes me think about the push for holons and the promotion of decentralized nodes as optimal – that by creating many, many circles they exponentially expand the edges they have and the potential for emergent behavior, right? I’ve included some mapping I’ve done in that regard linking gestalt to management theory to social impact investing and the Earth as spaceship metaphor. There is a large map and a smaller one, but you can click through and explore beyond the edges using the links provided.</p>

<p>Also, the concepts of hormesis and hopeful monsters – that low-level stress causes changes that lead to evolutionary adaptation. What if ongoing austerity and UBI and managed scarcity are some attempt at a social science of hormesis? What if the subscription renter economy is actually social hormesis? And that by putting UBI on blockchain it will transmit the dynamic pattern of behaviors out to the edge of chaos in a way that allows information yet non-living to continue its progression towards self-organization and “life”?</p>
<p>For me the mechanical / engineered emergence from computers is a parallel to natural life and embryology, the fear of which is perhaps personified in the Vagina Dentata, first popularized by the writings of enlightenment philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg. The family of Andrew Carnegie were members of Swedenborg’s Church of the New Jerusalem in Pittsburgh as well as the Pitcairn family who brought his papers to the Delaware Valley and built a vast cathedral at Bryn Athyn in his honor. I paid a visit to set an intention for healing there in the early spring, leaving one of my felt mothers in a niche in the base of a tree on the hillside.</p>

<p>In recent weeks I and other women with whom I’ve been working have found stumbling blocks thrown across our paths as we get deeper into the labyrinth and closer to the truth of the matter. I really think that innate intuition is important and perhaps inclined to the feminine side, which can trigger intense pushback from data rationalists and lead others to sow confusion to direct us away from the path we are meant to be on. We don’t need numbers to do this work, though it does get lonely. We just need a few people to who can get to the center while holding onto our clarity and moral compass. Once there, maybe we can unlock something that will help ameliorate this ongoing psychic wound and find the way back out without getting stuck in the hamster wheel virtual torus.</p>
