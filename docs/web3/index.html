      The Next Billion Developers         
	By David Cahn	 





Published November 15, 2023
        The developer revolution will be as important as the AI revolution.      



 
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is Silicon Valley’s latest obsession. Brilliant minds like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/elon-musk-reveals-xai-efforts-predicts-full-agi-by-2029/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman</a> believe achieving AGI is not just likely, but inevitable. Others disagree. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_i-think-the-phrase-agi-should-be-retired-activity-6889610518529613824-gl2F/">Yann LeCun</a>, one of the godfathers of machine learning, has said “there is no such thing as AGI.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea">Jack Clark</a> of Anthropic has described the “breathless enthusiasm” for AGI as a “misplaced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2DaQxTihc">religious impulse</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a lightning rod, AGI captures our imagination. AGI promises <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-altman-on-the-a-i-revolution-trillionaires/id1548604447?i=1000525043188">free education and housing</a>, the eradication of poverty with universal basic income, and a reallocation of human capital to science and art. These are worthwhile objectives.</p>



<p>But what if AGI is a distraction? What if there’s another path to this same future—one that does not require a technological leap of faith and is already underway?</p>



<p>There are more developers today than ever before. And the population is starting to snowball. Our thesis is that bringing 1B developers into the software economy could rival AGI in terms of its economic impact.1</p>



<p>Software engineering is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. If we can make it even more widely available—assisted and accelerated by AI—it could result in the automation of many non-tech industries, creating an economic surplus.</p>



<p>But is this target of 1B developers really achievable? Isn’t software engineering too hard to teach to so many people? And what would we do with all those developers?</p>



<p>Let’s start with the goal of 1B developers. This year, the developer population crossed <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">100M</a>, up from 24M when Github first started reporting the metric in 2017.2 In Github’s recently published <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">State of the Octoverse</a> report, they shared that the global developer population grew 26% in the last year. Github added 21M new accounts in 2022.</p>



<p>We have three reasons to believe hypergrowth in the developer population will persist.<br></p>



<p>First, it’s been getting much easier to become a developer, and we expect this flywheel to continue. In just the last decade, Cloud abstracted away the server. Databases like MongoDB and Postgres simplified the back-end. Vercel and React reshaped the front-end. The best software engineers continue to focus on improving the discipline itself. By iteratively building better and better abstractions, software engineers have created a flywheel that reduces complexity while increasing potency. As a result, a 12 year-old in India can now build a web app in a matter of days, something that would have taken a professional developer weeks before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, market forces continue to attract more and more young people to become software engineers. Already, the best and brightest are disproportionately learning to code. Rather than dampening as more talent has entered the field, the economic returns to software engineering only seem to be expanding. What this means is that the productivity of software engineers, and the applicability of their skills, is expanding faster than the supply.</p>



<p>Third, AI has been an unanticipated accelerator. Today, <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/">Github Copilot</a> is writing 46% of users’ code. <a href="https://zapier.com/ai">Zapier</a> enables developers to build automations with text descriptions. <a href="https://openinterpreter.com/">Open Interpreter</a> is turning the command line into a chat interface. With AI copilots, we may eventually be able to program computers using natural language alone.</p>



<p>Growth in the developer population enables the software economy to broaden its scope and impact. For example, companies like Stripe, Twilio and Plaid have created essential building blocks for payments, telecommunications and banking. Traditional companies in mature industries are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/despite-mass-layoffs-led-by-meta-its-still-hard-to-fill-tech-jobs.html">bringing on</a> more and more software engineers to drive internal digitization. Newer startups are also taking software and AI and applying these technologies to sectors like mining, robotics, construction, accounting and legal. The opportunity with 1B developers is to drive automation not just in the digital economy, but in the physical economy as well.</p>



<p>Unlike AGI, the promise of 1B developers is not about eliminating work altogether. Rather, it is about taking our resources—human resources—and leveraging them to have more and more impact. Thus, the story of the coming decades may be about the increased power of AI. But more quietly, the methodical march of the developer revolution will continue.&nbsp;</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/replit-remix-the-internet">Amjad Masad</a> was one of the first visionaries to articulate this goal and has been at its forefront</p> 



 <p><a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">Github’s</a> definition: “developers are individual, not-spammy user accounts on GitHub”</p>

 The internet and friends 
<p>You’ve most likely had an experience like this:</p>
<p>One day, you wake up with a hint of a headache and a sniffle. You sneeze. What do you do next? You Google it. You eventually land on WebMD. Was that sneeze a common cold or a bout of seasonal allergies? Or are you in fact dying from a rare form of nasal cancer? You determine you should see an allergist. But which one? How do you find a good one? Does your health plan require a referral? How much is this going to cost you? You text a friend who is a nurse, and another who works at the local hospital, hoping they’ll guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>If so, you’re not alone. <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/google-receives-more-than-1-billion-health-questions-every-day">1 billion</a> health-related queries are submitted to Google every day, and 7% of overall questions asked to Google are health-related. WebMD is frequented by over 180 million people every month. It turns out that a broad set of the population turns to the internet and friends to figure out what their health condition might be, and which doctor to go see for it. In industry speak: the internet and your friend are today’s “front door to healthcare.”</p>
 A better way 
<p></p>
<p>While the Google –&gt; WebMD –&gt; Friend protocol may be a common way to enter into the healthcare system, it is certainly not an optimal one. Most of us are not well-equipped to self-diagnose from a list of possible conditions, and our friends who work in healthcare often don’t have the exact expertise we need. But when we turn to this protocol, what we’re effectively looking for is:</p>
 
 Someone who knows enough to help us navigate to the right type of service (e.g. should we go to the urgent care clinic, or does this actually require a specialist?) 
 Someone who knows the inside baseball of which specific doctor to see, and how to jump the scheduling line to get a timely appointment 
 Someone who knows a little about how the insurance billing system works to prevent us from paying for something that we don’t have to 
 
<p>We’ve <a href="https://quorasessionwithjulieyoo.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-healthcare">long imagined</a> a version of the healthcare future in which every human has an all-knowing, empathic healthcare companion who fulfills these criteria based on personalized data—like a real life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbKSvOfqxF0">Baymax</a>, the healthcare robot from the movie Big Hero 6.</p>
<p>But this isn’t entirely in the realm of fiction. The aforementioned tasks are what large language models (LLMs) are well poised to be tuned to do—e.g. exhibit college graduate-level smarts, follow some rules, send programmatic instructions to third-party software systems to take an action, and help provide empathetic, patient guidance to someone who is likely feeling stressed and confused due to uncertainty about a health issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they can escalate to a trained professional if they encounter a high-risk use case, or based on preference of the user. Hospitals and provider groups already hire hoards of their own call center agents to triage inbound consumers and make sure they are getting to the right site and type of care—because getting this wrong could mean wasting scarce appointment slots by sending the patient to the wrong type of doctor.</p>
<p>As such, we are optimistic about the opportunity for a specialist LLM to serve as a far more effective future front door to healthcare, integrating into a <a href="https://a16z.com/2023/04/07/healthcare-marketplaces-where-art-thou/">healthcare marketplace</a> to enable people to book appointments and pay for their care.</p>
<p>From a patient perspective, the experience would also be much smoother:</p>
<p>One day, you wake up with a hint of a headache and a sniffle. You sneeze. What do you do next?&nbsp;You turn to your Baymax-like app, input your symptoms, and after a few follow up questions, it predicts— given your current location, the weather, your recent sleep scores, your diet, and your personal trends—that you’ve got allergies. It offers you a same-day appointment with a nearby allergist covered by your insurance to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, it recommends you try an over-the-counter allergy medication, offering to have it delivered to your house. It orders extra tissues for you, for good measure.</p>
 The size of the prize 
<p>Not only is this business a great opportunity to improve human health, patient experience, and provider experience, but the business case is also very clear.</p>
<p>First, the traditional businesses mentioned above are quite lucrative today. Health information sites like Google and WebMD make the majority of their revenue through ads; in 2016, the year before WebMD was taken private, it did <a href="https://www.webmd.com/corporate/press/20170216/webmd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2016-financial">$561 million</a> in advertising revenue. The healthcare and pharmaceutical industry spends an estimated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/235966/us-healthcare-and-pharmaceutical-industry-online-ad-spending/">$18 billion</a> a year on digital ads alone, usually advertising on condition-specific searches that indicate a consumer’s intent to engage with a specific healthcare product or service.</p>
<p>B2B revenue is also quite large for these businesses; WebMD offered “private portal” health information services products to health plans and employers that generated $114 million of revenue even back in 2016. Accolade, a comparable employer- and payor- sponsored navigation business, generated $300 million revenue in 2022.</p>
<p>Add to this the opportunity to monetize transactions once the LLM integrates into a marketplace of services that can be directly booked, and numerous revenue streams worth billions of dollars in aggregate become possible.</p>
 The next WebMD 
<p>While a big, white, puffy healthcare robot like Baymax is a possible manifestation of the future front door to healthcare, perhaps a more realistic one is an LLM tied to a healthcare services marketplace. We envision a not-so-distant future in which the daunting task of navigating the healthcare maze is significantly simplified for both patients and providers, with a viable business model to boot. When that happens, you’ll no longer need to self-diagnose, and your healthcare friends will thank you.</p>

      Finding Her Place in the Sun         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published November 14, 2023
        Lynn Jurich’s unwavering determination to unlock cleaner, greener energy powered the rise of Sunrun.      



 
<p>In March 2023, solar entrepreneur Lynn Jurich took the stage for the Stanford Graduate School of Business’s Climate, Business &amp; Innovation Summit. In the 15 years that had passed since she had attended the school herself, solar energy had come of age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in history, the cost of solar energy has fallen below that of fossil fuels, and Sunrun, which Jurich co-founded in 2007, is now the largest installer of residential solar panels in the U.S., with more than 800,000 customers in 20 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. Her unwavering determination to change energy infrastructure (and the world) is what brought Jurich back to GSB that day. But these achievements, and the survival of her company, were never a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich took her audience back to Sunrun’s early days, to a time when consumer solar was still the wheelhouse of “hippies and hobbyists,” and installation and hardware were expensive. Back then, Jurich and her co-founders had waded through the complexities of the green energy space without a clear sense for how to make their business model, much less the world, sustainable. And they were perilously close to burning through their venture capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our initial vision was that we would be pretty asset-light,” Jurich told the audience. “The existing solar installers out there would be doing the construction and selling to homeowners. We would raise the capital, and own and monitor the systems. So we’d only need a few employees. But we were wrong. Very, very wrong.”</p>



 



<p>The sun had already set, but the teenage Jurich refused to go back inside without sinking a few more shots. She wouldn’t feel content calling it a day until she was, according to her sister Tracy, “basically shooting NBA free-throw percentages.” Focus, which in this case earned Jurich a spot on the Pac-10 recruiting list for basketball by 8th grade, had been Jurich’s speciality since kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At five years old, Jurich had started writing to-do lists. “My list would be like, ‘invent something.’ Or, ‘make a scientific discovery,’” she remembers. At age six, reading biographies became her pastime of choice, an activity that suited her introverted nature. She’d go to the public library in her neighborhood near Point Defiance, a lush peninsula jutting into the Puget Sound, and work her way through their nonfiction section. She had lots of things she wanted to accomplish, and was looking for proofs of concept. “I was always attracted to people who mastered their craft,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her early favorites centered on strong women: Florence Nightingale, Betsy Ross, Anne Frank. But fittingly, no biography captivated her more than that of Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb (and 1,000 or so other things). In a prescient 1931 exchange between Edison and Henry Ford, Edison notes, “We should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind and tide.” (According to recent sources, the sun produces enough sunlight to power Earth’s electricity needs for a year every hour.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But truly mastering one’s craft was no easy feat—Jurich had internalized this from her biography obsession. It required resolve and concentration, which Jurich maintained through high school and then college at Stanford, where she earned top honors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating, Jurich landed a competitive role at a prestigious private equity firm. Her job was to get in front of entrepreneurs by any means necessary—cold-calling, attending the same conferences as them, befriending their assistants so that she could sit next to them on a plane—and evaluate them for potential investment opportunities. This was daunting for the self-described “strong introvert,” but once she worked up the nerve she found that pushing herself had an important upside. Like her biography kick on steroids, she got to observe dozens of highly accomplished individuals modeling potential paths to success, an experience that made it clear to her that “if there’s a good company out there, it’s going to get funded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After three years working on the investor side, she needed no further proof of concept. “It was just very clear to me that I wanted to be on the entrepreneur side,” says Jurich. This hard-earned clarity led her to return to Stanford for business school.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“How do we get people to give solar a shot?” It was January 2007, and this was the question Jurich, Ed Fenster, a Stanford GSB classmate, and Nat Kreamer, a childhood friend of Fenster’s, had been debating for weeks over pizza and Diet Coke in the living room of Fenster’s San Francisco apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’d filed the paperwork for their company Sunrun just a few days earlier, officially making this question of particular interest for the group. Jurich was fresh off a summer banking internship in Shanghai, where she had been struck by the density of construction and urban energy infrastructure. She couldn’t stop thinking about clean energy and how to make continued infrastructure development more sustainable. Kreamer was recently back from a tour in Afghanistan and motivated to seek energy independence after fighting in a war he’d concluded was mostly about fossil fuels. Fenster had connected the dots, uniting the team in his apartment to solve the challenge of solar expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fueled by cheesy carbohydrates and artificial sweetener, they concluded that the real opportunity lay not in developing cleantech, but in deploying it. “We saw that VC money was already being put toward making solar panels cheaper. We were quite certain that innovation was going to happen,” says Jurich. “So we thought, ‘Why don’t we solve the problem of convincing people to give solar panels a shot, and figuring out how to interface with the electric grid?’ That was gonna be the bigger challenge and the bigger area to add value.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer they settled on was to lower the barrier to solar adoption as much as possible for homeowners. Sunrun would offer ‘solar-as-a-service,’ leasing solar panels with a small upfront cost at a time when owning and installing one’s own solar panels was still logistically challenging, and prohibitively expensive for many. “The business model innovation was that we would put solar panels on your rooftop for very little money, and you would sign a 20-year contract to buy the electricity from us for X cents per kilowatt hour,” says Jurich. “So it was a long-term contract for us, the customer didn’t have to spend the money up front, and they could get cheaper power. Win-win all the way around.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going the consumer route, as opposed to leasing solar panels to corporations, was an added challenge, however. It meant figuring out how to install and operate panels on houses of all shapes and sizes in varying conditions around the country. But if they could manage all of that, Jurich believed this approach would ultimately make a more defensible business. “We believed costs would hit grid parity first at the consumer level because consumers pay the most money for power,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By narrowing their focus to homeowners, the founders were actually thinking bigger—not only would they be spreading clean energy, they could reduce inefficiencies in energy infrastructure. “What’s really innovative about solar is you can use an existing roof,” says Jurich. “You don’t have to acquire land. You don’t have to build big transmission lines. You don’t have to interrupt the ecosystem.” The value prop and climate impact seemed undeniable. They’d soon find out it wasn’t such an easy sell.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>Jurich’s voice was hoarse from hollering at passersby. This was her third county fair in as many days, dusty and hot, and a far cry from her time in private equity traveling on private jets (which, at least on an environmental level, felt like karmic justice). Again, Jurich had found herself in the challenging situation of having to talk to strangers. This time, Jurich was donning her company swag (an oversized white tee that read, “A penny for your watts?”) and standing next to an oversized pumpkin. She was desperate to make a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fenster, they decided early on, would take the role of CEO and focus on raising capital; Kreamer, as president, would take on installations, billing, and system monitoring; and it was up to Jurich as COO to build out their business pipeline (read: sales). She had deduced that the quickest way to sell consumers on solar panels was to go straight to the source. “This was 2007. There weren’t a lot of people online searching, you know, ‘I want a solar energy system,’” says Jurich. “So we were like, ‘Where do you find a homeowner who would be interested in Sunrun?’ I decided to go to places with lots of homes and lots of sun.”</p>



<p>From the rare fair-goer who agreed to chat, Jurich gleaned that “going green” still wasn’t enough—they were willing to consider solar only if it saved them money. Even after Sunrun’s upfront costs (initially about $10,000 for installs, still well below the cost of buying and installing one’s own panels), Sunrun would save them money, but only over the course of years—a commitment most consumers weren’t willing to make with a startup that had existed for just a few months. “What I always told them was, ‘If someone came to your house and said they would install a gasoline tank, and you could buy gas for $1 per gallon for the next 20 years, would you do it? That’s what we’re offering: Electricity at a fixed price for 20 years and it’s cheaper,’” says Jurich. “People thought it was too good to be true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After dozens of refusals, Jurich finally caught the attention of a woman named Sue who ran a trucking company. Jurich made her pitch, highlighting the fixed, long-term rate, which was much lower than traditional electrical costs. She told Sue that Sunrun would own, operate and maintain the solar panels on her roof, but that they outsourced sales and installation to existing solar installers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sue, excited to bet on a young female entrepreneur, was convinced. And Jurich, after months in the summer heat hawking her solar wares, made her third sale (Sunrun’s first sale was to Fenster, and the second was to his therapist). “Seeing that there was actually consumer interest in this helped me so much,” says Jurich, “It gave me the conviction that this was gonna work, that all the hustle was worth it. That conviction can get you through some pretty hard times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hard times turned out to be just around the corner, and she’d need all the conviction she could muster.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“We’re done for,” Jurich thought as she read the headlines announcing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Bank. It was September 2008, and Sunrun was desperately in need of funding—money that suddenly seemed entirely unattainable.</p>



<p>Sunrun’s early sales had put its business model to the test. Since the company was covering most of the upfront purchase and installation costs, its ability to sell was contingent upon its ability to raise money. But banks wanted proof of sales before lending. “We had a chicken and an egg problem,” says Jurich. The co-founders were forced to use their seed money—a few million they’d managed to raise from contacts in private equity and banking—to finance their earliest installs. But with dwindling funds and no guarantee that they could secure investments to stay afloat, “it made for an extremely stressful time,” Jurich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They had finally managed to raise $12 million in June 2008, a lifeline as sales were starting to take off—but nothing close to what they needed to scale. Just as new term sheets began to come their way, Lehman Brothers went under, signaling a complete collapse of the financing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, another bank pulled out of negotiations. Sunrun’s point of contact would be fired, or the entire financial institution would dissolve. But then, in November 2008, there came a flicker of hope. The Sunrun founders received a callback from U.S. Bank, the rare financial institution that hadn’t been decimated by the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this was likely their only shot, the founders negotiated a deal they hoped would be hard to refuse. “We were panicking,” Jurich says. “But at the same time, we were like ‘We are going to close this deal because we have no choice.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2008, Sunrun closed a $40 million debt financing round from U.S. Bank. “Looking back, we call this moment our big awakening,” Jurich says. Fenster agrees. “Had we not gotten that deal,” he says, “the company might not have made it another four months.”</p>



 



<p>Six years after bringing Sunrun back from the brink, Jurich’s sense of solar inevitability was feeling like less of a moonshot with every passing day. For one, Sequoia became a believer (and led Sunrun’s Series C), as did traditional energy giant, PG&amp;E, who had invested an additional $100 million to finance installations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which isn’t to say things were entirely sunny. Solar gaining traction threatened most other incumbent utilities, who did all they could to block Sunrun’s growth through lobbying. And then there were the government subsidies—hugely positive in the ways they pushed growth in a sustainable direction, but wildly destabilizing from a business perspective, with one subsidy or regulation unlocking a market one month, and an expiring subsidy making another disappear the next.</p>



<p>In 2009, the Obama stimulus package extended a solar tax credit to homeowners who bought their own system. This lowered the purchase price of solar panels overall, which made it harder for Sunrun to convince homeowners to buy into their leasing model, in particular paying for the company’s upfront installation costs. “That blew up our whole transaction model,” says Fenster. Jurich and Fenster, by then co-CEOs (Kreamer left the company in 2009), decided they needed to eliminate upfront costs entirely in order to remain competitive. To compensate, they increased their new customers’ monthly payments while still managing to stay below traditional utility rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their new no-upfront pricing structure made it easier than ever for homeowners to give solar a shot, but not enough to edge out their competition. Elon Musk’s SolarCity had just gone public and was starting to outpace Sunrun. And SolarCity had something crucial that Sunrun lacked: their own operations and installation capabilities. Seven years in, Sunrun was still essentially operating as a management and financing company, relying on third parties for construction, installation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they wanted to scale, Sunrun would have to take over the third-party labor themselves. This, of course, required a huge amount of capital that Sunrun didn’t have. But, no stranger to complex negotiations, Jurich and Fenster managed to secure a massive acquisition of their largest installations partner, REC Solar’s Residential Division (AEE Solar and SnapNrack), in an all-equity deal as a workaround. Overnight, Sunrun grew from 150 employees to 550. That same year, signaling just how much Jurich had grown as a leader since her days of reluctant cold-calling, Fenster stepped down as co-CEO of Sunrun, and Jurich stepped into the role. “Lynn was a better head for the company than I was,” he says. “There are really smart people who are excellent at making decisions but who aren’t great at managing people. Lynn’s unique in that she can do both.”</p>



<p>Poised for expansion, and in the wake of SolarCity’s IPO, the pressure was on for Sunrun to follow suit. “I knew we needed to go public,” Jurich says. “There were a handful of solar IPOs that had just happened that we didn’t believe in, and we thought they were gonna spook the market. So I didn’t really feel that I had the luxury to slow down at any point in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even when she learned she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich’s daughter Blythe was born just a few weeks before Sunrun’s IPO on August 5, 2015, and was in Jurich’s arms when she rang the Nasdaq bell. “I got on a conference call the day I got home from the hospital, and my mom moved in and helped me,” says Jurich. (While Jurich, who had her second child in 2018, didn’t take maternity leave, she expanded maternity leave benefits for the rest of the company, signaling that she didn’t expect others to make the same choice that she had.)</p>



<p>Sunrun’s share price dropped roughly 20% on its first day of trading, which only fed Jurich’s resolve to be as present at the company as possible. She started her investor roadshow when Blythe was just five weeks old, bringing her mother and a nurse along for support. “I was constantly pumping and shuttling milk back and forth between hotels and hedge fund offices,” Jurich says. “It was exhausting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2017, Sunrun had rebounded from its post-IPO dip to become the largest publicly traded rooftop solar company in the U.S. following Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. After years of fundraising, surviving a recession, battling incumbent utilities, navigating company altering climate legislation, IPOing and becoming a mother, Jurich felt like things were finally in a good place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s when the Wall Street Journal article came out.</p>

<p>In the May 2017 piece, former Sunrun employees claimed the company hadn’t reported order cancellations that may have affected sales data in financial disclosures leading up to the IPO. Jurich denied all wrongdoing, claiming the journalism was “not representative of the company and suspect.” Despite Sunrun’s assurances, the article triggered a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) of Sunrun and its competitor, SolarCity. Sunrun’s stock bottomed out. And shareholders filed a class action suit against Sunrun.</p>



<p>Jurich remembers this time, as her company’s reputation and her own integrity were called into question, as one dominated by a profound sense of grief and powerlessness. Ever since her days of writing her first to-do lists, she’d been laser focused on success. But suddenly, no amount of resolve, no degree of hustle could change the way the world perceived her and her company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, months after the initial article broke, Sunrun released a statement saying that after conducting an internal audit, the SEC didn’t find any evidence of manipulated sales data. Still, the company ended up making a $30 million settlement with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Sunrun’s name had technically been cleared, in the weeks following, Jurich continued to struggle emotionally from the toll the probe had taken. For the woman who had defined so much of her life by her achievements, this failure—which she certainly saw it as—felt existential. She faced a choice: “Your options are either to crumble because you can’t deal with it, or to figure out how to keep going and operate at a higher level,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time, she decided that “higher level” didn’t mean working harder. It meant “reflecting on my values, starting a meditation practice, keeping my fitness going, and not caring too much about what other people think,” says Jurich. She was able to let go, minding public perceptions less as her company slowly but surely regained its footing and earned back consumer trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, from their all-time low in share prices, something surprising happened. “The WSJ article was an interesting inflection point for the company,” says Fenster, “because after it caused the stock to bottom, momentum started to come back.” Over the next two years, Sunrun’s stock rose roughly 400%, signaling to the world that Sunrun had staying power.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Just before Thomas Edison’s death, in that same 1931 conversation with Henry Ford, he said, “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” Today, Jurich feels closer than ever to paying out her hero’s bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, Sunrun has deployed 5.7 gigawatts of total solar capacity, making it one of the world’s largest sources of networked solar energy. In 2019, Sunrun overtook Tesla’s SolarCity as the leading installer of residential rooftop solar panels in the U.S. “We’re at this inflection point where consumers have wrapped their minds around solar power, and they accept it,” says Jurich, who stepped down as CEO of Sunrun in 2021, but remains the company’s Co-Executive Chair.</p>



<p>Part of that acceptance comes from a greater understanding of climate urgency. It comes from legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other clean energy initiatives, reinstates generous tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels. And it comes from increasingly affordable solar hardware, a trend the founders predicted at Sunrun’s outset (today, solar panel prices are down nine times since 2006). An additional factor is technological advancement: “One of the challenges with solar was always that you couldn’t store it,” says Jurich, “but now, batteries have completely changed that. You can generate, store and distribute energy to the grid without building new plants, or even solar farms. You can just use existing roofs!” To that end, in 2020 Sunrun funded and helped found Lunar Energy, an independent company focused on building the next-generation home battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade and a half working in clean energy has made Jurich a realist about the magnitude of her company’s undertakings. Which is why, more than ever, she’s looking to others to share the burden, and in part why she returned to her alma mater in March 2023. This was a chance to speak to a new generation of potential clean energy leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do worry that the United States broadly has lost the skillset to develop large-scale infrastructure,” Jurich said toward the end of her keynote. “But I encourage all of you to help. I’ve already talked to a couple of you who have great business ideas around trying to make labor more efficient, making large-scale construction more efficient. And I do think we will get there.”</p>



<p>By “there,” Jurich means a sustainable future of clean energy abundance. And on a personal level, she hopes for a future with more balance, filled with more of the hard-earned equanimity on display at the GSB climate summit. “One of the things I’ve come to appreciate in life is that in order to be most effective, you need periods of both intensity and periods of rest and renewal,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest, as always with Jurich, is a relative concept. She’s Co-Executive Chair of Sunrun, Chair of Lunar Energy, and she’s launching a women’s health institute and writing a novel—imagining different worlds while working to improve our own. But at the very least, “I’m no longer trying to do it all at once,” she says. That simply wouldn’t be sustainable.</p>

 Episode Transcript 
<p>This transcript has been condensed and edited for readability and clarity.</p>
<p>Seema Amble:&nbsp;It’d be great if you could just walk us through how did you found Mercury and what was the background to starting the company?</p>
<p>Immad Akhund:&nbsp;Sure. So I had this idea for Mercury in 2013, but it didn’t start until 2017. So it was kind of in the back of my mind for a long time. All of these tools that were useful as startups for running your business had improved a lot. When I first started in 2006, everything was really bad. There was no straight there was no Gusto, there was no Rippling, there was no Slack. Everything was quite painful as an entrepreneur. And then there was this kind of 10-year period where things had generally improved. Every one of these categories had had a really strong product, but banking was still exactly as they had been forever. And it just seemed obvious to me that someone would make a better bank product for for startups and for entrepreneurs. It wasn’t until 2017 that I could do it myself since no one else had, and that’s where the idea came from.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Like so many of our founders, you had the pain point yourself and decided to go tackle it head on. So when you got started, how did you think about the MVP?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Banking is a utility, right? And there is a pretty high bar of existing players there. And I always had in my mind that I wanted to be your primary bank account. So we slightly simplified it. But I focused on a very specific ICP, ideal customer profile, which was an early stage startup. So we didn’t need to go build all the things that a public IPO company would need from their banking product, we needed it for a smaller set, but it’s still a fairly high bar. But I felt like I very deeply understood what that bar was. I was very stubborn about a certain set of features that no other bank had done before.</p>
<p>I felt we needed both domestic and international wires. Now there are other new banks that have done that, but back in 2017, no one had done that. And I was also fairly stubborn about wanting to have immigrated immigrant founders support. Because I was an immigrant to the U.S. and I wanted to be able to support people like me. I always felt, yeah, immigrant founders are a pretty large set of founders and I didn’t want to disqualify that segment. So, I had a very specific kind of feature set and spec in mind. It took us a year and a half to launch because we were quite stubborn about hitting all of those features, which were not all trivial to get.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;So you your MVP was actually fairly robust in terms of feature set. It sounds like that was pretty intentional. Was that because this was what you were hearing from potential customers, that they needed a whole set of features or how did you end up making that decision?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;I think it’s important to understand what you’re trying to achieve. I think there’s a set of companies that are trying to do some thing new in a new market that there isn’t an alternative product or there is an alternative but it’s super different. And then there’s a set of things like Mercury, where there are lots of incumbents. And it’s not like we were serving a set of customers that didn’t have bank accounts, we were very deliberately serving a set of people that had alternatives so and then the bar is just much higher. You have to catch up with everything that exists. And you have to be 10x better than that, which is very different from a kind of new market, new idea. Then , what you’re really testing is does this idea have any legs at all? And does anyone care?</p>
<p>I think as long as you understand who you are, you can kind of decide what makes sense. If you take Mercury or Figma, or those types of things where there are incumbents, it’s a complicated issue problem. You have to spend a reasonable amount of time, sometimes years, developing. I mean, it kind of still is an MVP, I prefer minimum delightful product, but that minimum is just way higher than in a new market.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I love the minimum delightful product. I love that phrase. So you were working on this for a year and a half, during that time what did what did the company look like?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;We kept it pretty small. 7 engineers, if you include me, one designer and one kinda product slash everything else, who’s my co founder. I’m a big fan of keeping teams fairly lean at the start. We actually raised 6 million upfront, so we had a lot more money, but I think pre-product market fit, it’s better to be sub 10 people.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Let’s shift gears a little bit into how you found your initial customers and who you decided to target?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;So during that year and a half, I talked to about 100 startup founders. Part of it was like, “Do people actually want this?” and it was actually kind of funny, it was a little disheartening. A lot of them were like, oh yeah, this sounds cool. But they weren’t that excited about it. That’s one of the slightly funny things about talking to customers before you have something like that. It’s actually hard to really learn because if you have a big enough market, actually if 2% really, really love it that’s actually big enough to have like this kind of early adopter thing, even though you might be wondering whether you’re even doing the right thing at that point.</p>
<p>And we really focused on going to the startup community, the people I understand and they tend to care about product. And obviously, in the startup space, if you want a new product, you want to initially focus on the earliest startups just because they’re the easiest to win. We did a beta, before we launched, a lot of time during the beta, it just basically didn’t work. But we were kind of testing it with some real customers. And they weren’t putting all their money into it or anything, but it was useful. A lot of those people were people that I invested in, so I had a little bit of an unusual thing where I’d invested in, I guess, by that point, about 90 startups. They’re all like, perfectly in the ICP, they were all early stage seed stage companies. And obviously, they, to some extent, they liked me, so they were willing to kind of try out the product.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;You said you weren’t necessarily getting super strong feedback from a lot of the initial customer conversations. What empowered you to push through?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;There’s this concept of vitamin and painkillers, which actually don’t love that concept, but it kind of plays to that as well, right? Like, if you look at, if you look at the reason people use things, sometimes people use something new, because it’s a super strong pain point for them. And then they can often describe that pain point and say, if you could solve this for me, I would pay you this much money. And there’s definitely like a class of startups that are in that kind of group.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say Mercury’s in that group. Some people really hate their banks. Obviously, we can relate to that. But most people have a bank account, and at the point before Mercury launched, I don’t think many people could imagine a much, much better experience. And I actually feel that a lot of successful companies, they are in that bucket. Take Slack or Zoom. All of those things existed. There was plenty of instant messaging and plenty of web communication things, they just all kind of sucked. So when you came out with a much, much better product, it got people really excited. But I think you kind of need to see that.</p>
<p>Whereas if someone describes a much, much better product, it’s hard to get that excited about the description of a better product. That’s kind of my thinking about why it wasn’t as exciting to people as it was to me. Like, I could imagine a product and I would use that product. And that was what like pushed me through it.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;You ended up having an amazing launch. What would you attribute to, to that? And how did you convince customers to trust you, with their money?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;There’s a few things actually, like the trust question and why the launch was successful is like the same question to some extent. I think the hardest part of Mercury is always winning people’s trust, because using a startup to do your banking is quite a difficult thing to convince people of. So there’s a bunch of factors. Number 1, in 2019, the fact that we were launching a full bank product was very unusual, like no one had really done that in the business setting. So the meme of the idea was very shareable and likeable and people were very frustrated with their bank.</p>
<p>Number 2, we had a very credible set of investors. So yeah, Andreessen Horowitz was a seed investor. But along with Andreessen Horowitz, we had about 60 initial angel investors and some funds. So we had these people that lended us their credibility and brand to some extent. And then number 3, we had a lot of time to polish things, partly because we were trying to get these cards working. And we had to do like two bank partnerships. So we had a lot of time to make it. So the front page was very compelling, the initial signup experience was very fluid and easy. So the initial people that went through that experience wanted to share that, because it was such an unexpectedly nice experience. And it was the first impression they got. So that helped continue this kind of sharing cycle.</p>
<p>Lastly, we were targeting this fairly tight knit community, right? Founders follow each other on Twitter, we are in WhatsApp groups, in Slack groups. There’s a lot of ways that founders and investors talk to each other. If you go and sell something to a bunch of dentists, they probably don’t have that many dentist friends. Whereas, every founder has 20+ founder friends that they’re connected to in some way, because it’s just a fairly tight knit community. So all of those factors lead to like a pretty successful launch, and something that compounded the trust.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;And how did you think about the, you know, sign up of customers and collecting feedback? Was there a first batch that you got off the first launch that you signed up and then you sort of pulled up and got feedback? Or was it more fluid over time?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;If you have a successful launch, like we did, it seems very obvious what is like hair on fire? And I would say that say the first six weeks, we thought sending international wires was working, but it wasn’t working. And so we obviously we were trying to fix it from day one, it but it took 6 weeks for it to actually become a smooth working process. So a lot of the initial 6 months was like, you rank all the things that are broken and you try to fix the most important broken thing first. It was very much like that. It wasn’t like, oh, let’s get subtle feedback. It was just like, Okay, here’s all the crazy broken things, let’s just go fix them one by one.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Let’s shift gears a little bit and talk a little about scaling up. So you’ve got your initial number of customers. I’m curious when you actually started investing in a go-to-market effort?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;So for the first year or so, it was kind of this organic growth. I struck up some partnerships and we did some stuff but there wasn’t strong kind of leadership or even that many hires around sales partnership or marketing. And that was still working fairly well for us even a year later. The first hire shouldn’t be a head of sales. I think you should just go hire some salespeople and see if there’s a repeatable process that you can come up with together. So, we hired our first salesperson and we hired our first brand marketing person, and it was much more with the idea that they would also become managers as things worked. And then we just kept kind of incrementally adding. It was only about a year ago that we hired a VP of revenue, and a year and a half ago that we hired our VP of marketing.</p>
<p>Taking a function from zero to one is something that I think should be founder-led. And then once you’ve built out some of that function, then you can think about more like leadership roles.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I’d be curious to learn a little more about the pricing journey you guys had at Mercury and how you made those decisions on what to charge customers?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Yeah, pricing is kind of weird for Mercury. So the way we have pricing is actually, for the revenue we do make, how much do we pass over to people? So the rewards on credit card, for example, we have 1.5% cash back and that’s kind of like a pricing question or interest rates on deposits. And we have a treasury function, and we do have fees around that.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to have a philosophy around pricing. Amazon has this famous philosophy, right, your margin is my opportunity. So they always wanted to be the cheapest out there, that was always their philosophy. For Mercury, our philosophy was always, I don’t want to be the best pricing. I think it’s one of the mistakes that fintechs make is they become differentiated through pricing power, like we’re gonna give away the most margin possible. Whereas Mercury’s main thing was, hey, we want to be a really good deal. But we mostly want you to use us because of product. We want to be the best and most easiest to use product. And then we want to be a reasonable pricing deal, but we don’t necessarily want to be the best pricing out there. And I think that’s a much better take personally, because it gives you enough margin that you can do distribution and all this other stuff. Whereas, if you are all about just giving away as much as possible without making money on it, then it’s just a much harder position, in my opinion. But you know, obviously worked for Amazon.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;There are two interesting things that you mentioned there. One, when Mercury launched, it was a time when a lot of other a lot of the other card products in the market were focused on rewards and just giving away product for free. And to your point, it almost seems like it’s a much stronger signal of product market fit or just that you’re truly delighting customers. If they’re saying, it’s not the price that is the reason I’m adopting this, I actually love the product.</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;I mean, that’s one of the problems with pricing first companies, someone else will come across and come by and undercut you. Then you have a set of customers that are extremely price sensitive, so they’re much more likely to like go to the next company that undercuts you on pricing. Yeah, I think pricing is a very dangerous kind of methodology to compete on, it’s much better to compete on some other dimension.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;You’ve done this multiple times before, if you were to compare it against rough map or one of the other startups, what have you learned through the journey. We’d love to hear any advice that you have for early founders.</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;To build a really big company, you really need a lot of customers. So you think that’s much easier to do when the demand is so high that people are coming to you. And it’s much harder to do when you have to kinda convert one person at a time and force them to use you, people really have to want to use you. I mean, obviously not every sale is going to be easy. But you have to have this kind of groundswell of demand. So you really have to think about, what can I do do have such a good product that creates that groundswell, which is I think product and distribution have to always kind of come together to some extent, especially when you’re really early.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I’d be curious how much did you actually think about unit economics and the CAC? Or was it more like, let’s get this product out into people’s hands and figure that out later?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;No, I did the spreadsheet. I don’t know how convincing these things are really before you, you’ve tried them. I really think it’s very hard to know, things until you try it, like is the conversion rate of your sales pipeline gonna be 5% or 1%? And, obviously, the numbers are completely different between the two of them. But I mean, the other problem with any of these distribution mats is what you can do at Day Zero is not going to work when you have 10 million ARR.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I’m curious if you have you looked back at the spreadsheet. And how correct was it?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;I mean, I’ve looked at my seed deck quite a few times. And, I mean, it’s mostly accurate. There’s some assumptions that were incorrect. But yeah, I haven’t looked at the projection math.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Last thing to wrap up. If you had to give one piece of advice to your earlier self on finding and winning your initial customers, what might that be?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Depends on how much earlier we go to my earliest self. I was very much an engineer and kind of worried about running sales processes and things like that. I think the thing that I would tell that person and I tell other founders is, I think it’s better to think about sales as a numbers game. It’s like how many people do talk to? How good is your conversion rate? And that equals how many sales you make. I think when you think about as an engineer, at least when you think about it more as a numbers game, rather than a kind of an emotional sales game, I think that’s when you can be more successful at sales. You need to run a process, you need to run a pipeline and that’s just what you have to do to be successful.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Well, thanks so much. It was great to chat with you. And thanks for sharing all these pearls of wisdom.</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Thanks for having me, Seema.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 4th December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-December the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis. </p>



<p>From January, Committee members will receive a nominal stipend of $650 per calendar month from ZF (paid as shielded ZEC). This stipend may be subject to review, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces.</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>AI trailblazer Suchi Saria, PhD, in conversation with Vijay Pande, sheds light on the winding path that led her to launch Bayesian Health, a bold effort to infuse intelligence into clinical workflows.</p>
<p>With infectious optimism, Suchi describes her vision to create “clinical copilots” that augment human capabilities and unburden care teams. At the same time, she acknowledges the delicate balancing act required to implement AI ethically, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and oversight to build trust. For founders navigating uncertain regulatory seas, Suchi offers a lifeline, suggesting that regulation done right may actually accelerate adoption by fostering confidence. Through candid reflections on lessons from the trenches, Suchi provides a rare glimpse into the mind of an innovator who has one foot planted in research rigor and the other striding towards real-world impact. Steeped in over 20 years of experience, her insights map guideposts for founders aspiring to positively disrupt healthcare with AI.</p>

 The Horizen DAO increases community involvement in decision-making for improvements to the protocol and ecosystem. 



<p>The Horizen community is excited to announce the Horizen DAO is now open for all $ZEN holders to participate in governance and take an active role in the direction of the project!</p>



<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. A strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is informed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/guiding_values">Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 How to Participate in Voting 



<p>Voting for the Horizen DAO is done on Horizen EON, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain including the $ZEN you have staked with the Horizen EON validators. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold,&nbsp; the more voting power you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.jpg"></a> 


<p></p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours. For more information about the process of voting, please start <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing the Horizen DAO Special Council 



<p>What is the Horizen DAO Special Council?</p>



<p>The Special Council serves as a steward for the Horizen DAO and provides oversight of the Horizen Foundation with security of the Horizen DAO and ecosystem as its paramount focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What exactly does the Special Council do?</p>



<p>Special Council members serve as a DAO committee and function as a liaison between the Horizen community and the Horizen Foundation. In practical terms, this means providing review and oversight during the improvement proposal process, calling emergency operational meetings as needed to discuss and address security threats to the Horizen DAO, any protocol utilizing the Token, the Tokenholders, or the Foundation, and serving as signers on the Horizen community multi-signature wallet.</p>



<p>Who are the Special Council members?</p>



<p>Initially, the Special Council will be made up of 7 individuals initially appointed by the Foundation Director(s):</p>

<p>Leading decentralised perpetual exchange, dYdX V4 recently migrated to Cosmos to build its own sovereign appchain, in order to provide its users a much better trading experience, while continuing to deliver DeFi innovations (e.g. permisionless markets). By having full control over the appchain’s parameters, the dYdX DAOs can shape the future of the protocol, starting from the very bedrock, ensuring proper distribution and incentives for the validator set. From early adopter of L2 zero knowledge proofs (STARKs), to building its own Cosmos appchain, dYdX has proven once again to be a trailblazer for new technologies.</p><p>We were joined by Charles d’Haussy, CEO of dYdX Foundation, to discuss dYdX V4’s recent migration to a Cosmos appchain and what challenges it solves in terms of: order book decentralisation, validator distribution and user experience.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Charles’ background, from Asia to CEO of dYdX  dYdX’s history and V4’s transition to a Cosmos appchain  How perpetual futures work  dYdX supported assets and permissionless markets  DeFi innovations vs. CEX UX  The current state of dYdX V4’s alpha mainnet  dYdX validator dynamics &amp; order book decentralisation  dYdX’s DAOs &amp; governance  Mitigating MEV (feat.

<p>This post describes work done by Principal Engineer Anthony Tseng and Staff Engineer Anirudha Bose. We also thank Anxo Rodriguez from the CoW Swap team for his code-review on our work done for CoW Swap.</p>
<p>Written by Anirudha Bose.</p>

 Summary 
<p>With our recent Brave browser release version 1.60, we are excited to introduce two powerful features for the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) gets a major overhaul, with first-class support for parsing ERC-4361 messages, and a brand new UX. We also extend our redesigned signing experience for Brave Swap to CoW Swap orders. Both these features enhance the security and UX of signing messages in Brave Wallet.</p>

 Sign-In With Ethereum 

 What is Sign-In With Ethereum? 
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (or SIWE for short) replaces traditional login credentials with wallet-based sign-in functionality. Imagine a world where your wallet can help you login stamped with the indelible ink of an Ethereum wallet address of your choosing. This functionality shifts the role of authentication away from large centralized identity providers, into the hands of the individual.</p>
<p>The Sign-In With Ethereum protocol defines a method by which Ethereum accounts can sign in to external services by signing a standard message format as defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">ERC-4361</a>.&nbsp; Thanks to this standard, you get the power of self-custodial identity while remaining portable across wallet implementations.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Next-level SIWE 
<p>Brave Wallet always had basic support for SIWE. Since SIWE uses <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191">ERC-191</a> (Signed Data Standard), we’ve been able to display SIWE prompts as human-readable plaintext messages, but without any validation by the wallet.</p>
<p>In this latest update, we’re introducing a significant improvement to Sign-In With Ethereum support with our implementation of an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/19443">ABNF parser</a> for ERC-4361 conformant messages. This allows us to not only interpret SIWE messages and present them with a better look and feel, but also to improve the safety of signing into third-party apps and services. However, since there may still be cases where the SIWE message does not conform with these specifications, we fallback to legacy ERC-191 signing for maximum interoperability.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Safety features 
<p>Once a SIWE message is successfully parsed, we verify the message for binding of domain, account, and chain ID fields, and display an appropriate error message if there’s a mismatch. This measure is designed to prevent phishing attacks, where a malicious actor may obtain a valid authorization to a legitimate third-party service. This is particularly important for SIWE, since the sign-in action is basically producing a signature for a message, which is susceptible to spoofing by a motivated attacker.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 CoW Swap 

 What is CoW Swap? 
<p>Coincidence of Wants (CoW) is a concept from the field of economics, particularly related to the barter system. It describes a situation where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they agree to trade these items directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://swap.cow.fi">CoW Swap</a> leverages this idea for trading on-chain assets. It is an interface built on top of the CoW Protocol—a fully permissionless trading protocol that leverages batch auctions as its price finding mechanism. CoW Protocol enables batch auctions to maximize liquidity via CoWs in addition to tapping all available on-chain liquidity whenever needed. Users express off-chain intents as signed <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</a> typed messages through the CoW Swap interface. The CoW Protocol gathers these intents into a batch auction, to be settled by solvers that compete to find the most optimal CoW. The winning solver then executes all intents in a single on-chain transaction, maximizing trade surplus and saving on network fees.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>A CoW settlement transaction</p>

 The dangers of off-chain messages 
<p>Signing off-chain messages, such as CoW orders, is unfortunately not the most friendly UX on any wallet. While off-chain messages significantly improve usability by providing a reliable way to exchange data through a gasless experience, such messages are largely opaque and unreadable to users. This is very similar to blind-signing of transaction calldata (which we have discussed in depth in a <a>previous blog post</a>). Because signing off-chain messages does not incur a gas fee, users are very likely to blindly approve a signing request without verifying the details. A maliciously crafted message is more than capable of draining assets from users’ wallets, without raising any suspicion because of its verbosity.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1604074440941506560">December 2022</a>, a scammer stole 14 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">BAYCs</a> worth over 852 ETH ($1.07 million USD) at the time, through a sophisticated, month-long social engineering scam. The victim was tricked into signing a gasless <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview">Seaport</a> message, which actually created a private bundle listing all of his BAYCs to the scammer for 0.00000001 ETH. Such attacks are becoming increasingly common due to the massive adoption of off-chain messages in NFT marketplaces, DEXs, etc.</p>

 EIP-712 to the rescue 
<p>EIP-712 proposed a standard for signing typed structured data as opposed to bytestrings. While typed messages are easier for machines to read, they are still not user-friendly enough for most people. For users to be able to confidently approve signing requests for CoW orders, they need to clearly see all the order details such as formatted amounts, token symbols, logos, etc.</p>
<p>We conceived the idea to solve this problem at <a href="https://www.dappcon.io">DappCon 2023</a> in Berlin where we met CoW Swap’s engineering team. After brainstorming together, we came up with the <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/20203">solution</a> to implement a message parser for CoW orders, to be able to extract the relevant parameters, and render them in a familiar way that’s easy to understand. The parser is tied to the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#rationale-for-typehash">type hash</a> of the specific order struct used by CoW Swap, to prevent the parser from being used on non-CoW messages. We’ve also implemented calldata parsers for cases where the swap involves an on-chain transaction like, for example, when the user is swapping a native asset (such as ETH, or XDAI). Here’s what the final result looks like:</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Conclusion 
<p>In the 1.60 release of the Brave browser, we have completely revamped the experience of Sign-In With Ethereum using Brave Wallet. We’ve added safety features and UX improvements that make the SIWE experience comparable to signing in on websites with traditional login credentials. You can try it out at <a href="https://login.xyz">https://login.xyz</a>, which also has developer documentation for supporting SIWE on your websites.</p>
<p>We have extended similar improvements to the signing of CoW Swap orders, turning the unreadable off-chain messages into something that users can easily audit. You can try it out at <a href="https://swap.cow.fi">https://swap.cow.fi</a> on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.</p>
<p>We intend to bring similar improvements to the signing experience in Brave Wallet, in order to protect users from inadvertently signing malicious messages and transactions. Stay tuned for major updates on these improvements coming soon to Brave Wallet.</p>

<p>It’s been an eventful year in the world of generative music.</p>
<p>In April, the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwx44/heart-on-my-sleeve-ai-ghostwriter-drake-spotify">first viral</a> AI cover dropped: ghostwriter’s “Heart on My Sleeve,” which woke up the music world to the fact that AI content could not only exist, but could be good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon after, Google <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/musiclm-google-ai-test-kitchen/">unveiled</a> MusicLM, a text-to-music tool that generates songs from a basic prompt; Paul McCartney used AI to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-65881813">extract</a> John Lennon’s voice for a new Beatles track; and Grimes <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/grimes-unveils-software-to-mimic-her-voice-and-announces-2-new-songs/">offered</a> creators 50% of the royalties for streams of songs that used an AI clone of her voice. And perhaps most importantly, Meta open sourced <a href="https://ai.honu.io/papers/musicgen/">MusicGen</a>, a music generation model that can turn a text prompt into quality samples. This move alone spawned a flurry of new apps that use and extend the model to help people create tracks.</p>
<p>Similar to how instruments, recorded music, synthesizers, and samplers all supercharged the number of creators and consumers of music when they were introduced, we believe that generative music will help artists make a similar creative leap by blurring the lines between artist, consumer, producer, and performer. By dramatically reducing the friction from idea to creation, AI will allow more people to make music, while also boosting the creative capabilities of existing artists and producers.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll dive into what people are doing today, explore where AI music might be headed, and outline a few of the emerging companies and capabilities at the forefront of the space. This post is structured around 5 core use cases for ease of comprehension, but we’ve found another helpful way to categorize these products is by target audience — products built for everyday consumers vary greatly from prosumers/creators with commercial use cases. We demonstrate the overlap below:</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Market-Map-Spectrum-2-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 Real-Time Music Streaming  
<p>Thus far, most of the emerging generative streaming products have been in the functional music category: apps like <a href="https://endel.io/">Endel</a>, <a href="https://www.brain.fm/">Brain.fm</a>, and <a href="https://www.aimi.fm/">Aimi</a>. They generate never-ending playlists to help you get into a certain mood or headspace, and then adapt based on the time of day and your activity. (However, functional music is starting to converge with traditional music, as powerhouse labels like UMG partner with generative music companies like Endel to create “functional” versions of popular <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/endel-and-universal-music-group-to-create-ai-powered-artist-driven-functional-music-designed-to-support-listener-wellness-301832191.html#:~:text=BERLIN%20%26%20SANTA%20MONICA%2C%20Calif.,for%20daily%20activities%20like%20sleep%2C">new releases</a>.)</p>
<p>In the Endel app, you can hear how the sound is quite different if you’re in “deep work” mode vs. “trying to relax” mode. Endel has also <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/endel-and-universal-music-group-to-create-ai-powered-artist-driven-functional-music-designed-to-support-listener-wellness-301832191.html#:~:text=BERLIN%20%26%20SANTA%20MONICA%2C%20Calif">partnered</a> with creatives to produce soundscapes based on their work, like a generative album.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Iphone-Endel-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Most of the products in the music streaming space have been focused on soundscapes or background noise, and they don’t generate vocals. But, it’s not hard to imagine a future where AI-powered streaming apps can also create more traditional music with AI generated vocals. Just as recorded music brought about the long play album as a format for music, one can imagine generative models enabling “infinite songs” as a new format.</p>
<p>This gets more interesting if you don’t have to prompt the product with text. What if you could instead provide general guidance on the genres or artists you’re interested in, or even allow it to learn from your past listening history with no prompt required? Or what if the product connects to your calendar to serve the perfect “pump up” playlist before a big meeting?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotify has been making strides toward personalized, auto-generated playlists. In February, they launched an <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-02-22/spotify-debuts-a-new-ai-dj-right-in-your-pocket/">AI DJ</a> that sets a curated lineup of music alongside commentary. It’s based on the latest music you’ve listened to as well as old favorites — plus it constantly refreshes the lineup based on your feedback. And this month, they unveiled “<a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-09-12/ever-changing-playlist-daylist-music-for-all-day/">Daylist</a>” — an automated playlist that updates multiple times a day based on what you typically listen to at specific times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Spotify isn’t generating new music, but instead curating these playlists from existing songs. But the most evolved version of this product would likely involve an AI-generated and human-created mix of content, soundscapes, instrumentals, and songs.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Iphone-Spotify-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
 AI Covers  
<p>AI-generated covers were arguably the first killer use case for AI music. Since “Heart on My Sleeve” dropped in April, the AI cover industry has exploded, with videos labeled #aicover racking up more than 10 billion views on TikTok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of this activity started by creators in the <a href="https://discord.gg/aihub">AI Hub Discord</a>, which had 500k+ members before it was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/popular-ai-hub-discord-taken-down-following-copyright-complaints-231005/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">shut down</a> in early October after repeated copyright violation claims, and as discussed below, these legal concerns have not been resolved. That server has now disaggregated into more private communities where users train and share voice models for specific characters or artists. Many use <a href="https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI">retrieval-based voice conversion</a>, which essentially transforms a clip of someone speaking (or singing!) into another person’s voice. Some experts, despite legal uncertainty, have even created guides on how to train a model and make covers with it, and they’ll post links to models they’ve trained for others to download.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AI-Hubs-Discord-Server-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Running one of these models locally requires some technical sophistication. There are now a number of browser-based alternatives that do the heavy lifting for you. Products like <a href="https://musicfy.lol/">Musicfy</a>, <a href="https://www.voicify.ai/">Voicify</a>, <a href="https://covers.ai/">Covers</a>, and <a href="https://www.kits.ai/">Kits</a> are some examples of new products trying to streamline the process. Most require you to upload a clip of yourself (or someone else) singing to transform the voice, but we expect that text-to-song is on the horizon (products like <a href="https://www.uberduck.ai/">Uberduck</a> are already doing this for rappers).</p>
 
<a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ken_Plankton_V5.mp4">https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ken_Plankton_V5.mp4</a> 
<p>The major unresolved problem with AI covers is legal rights, which are important to take into consideration if you’re working in this space.</p>
<p>However, similar legal uncertainty has accompanied other changes in technology. For example, the litigation and claims around sampling that defined the early years of hip hop. After years of litigation starting in the early 1990s, many of the “original” sampled artists realized that finding an economic arrangement with those who wished to sample their work was positive-sum both creatively and financially. Labels dedicated entire teams to clearing samples, and Biz Markie even released a tongue-in-cheek album entitled “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2013/05/01/180375856/20-years-ago-biz-markie-got-the-last-laugh">All Samples Cleared</a>.”</p>
<p>While some labels and artists feel threatened by AI music, others see opportunity — they can make a passive income from other creators generating songs that use their voice, no work required! Grimes is the highest profile example of this, as she released a product called <a href="https://elf.tech/">Elf.tech</a> that enables others to create new songs with her voice. She’s pledged to <a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz/status/1650304051718791170">split royalties</a> with any AI-created song that is able to generate revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect to see infrastructure emerge to support this on a greater scale. For example, artists need a place to store their custom voice models, track AI covers, and understand streams and monetization across tracks. Some artists or producers may even want to use their voice models to test different lyrics, see how a given voice sounds on a song, or experiment with different collaborators on a track.&nbsp;</p>
 Royalty-Free Tracks (aka AI Muzak)  
<p>Moving into prosumer tools, if you’ve ever created a YouTube video, podcast, or any type of video content for a business, you’ve probably experienced the struggle of finding royalty-free music. While stock music libraries exist, they’re often challenging to navigate and the best tracks tend to be overused. There is even an often-mocked genre of music that defines this forgettable — but royalty free — sound: “muzak” or “elevator music.”</p>
<p>Enter AI-generated music. Products like <a href="https://www.beatoven.ai/">Beatoven</a>, <a href="https://soundraw.io/">Soundraw</a>, and <a href="https://boomy.com/">Boomy</a> make it easy for anyone to generate unique, royalty-free tracks. These tools typically allow you to choose a genre, mood, and energy level for your song, and then use your inputs to auto-generate a new track. Some of these tools enable you to edit the output if it’s not quite right, e.g., increasing or decreasing the tempo, adding or subtracting certain instruments, or even rearranging notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Boomy-scaled.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We expect the future of royalty-free music will be almost entirely AI-generated. This genre has already become commoditized, so it’s not hard to imagine a world where all background music is created by AI, and we break the historical tradeoff between quality and cost.</p>
<p>The early adopters of these products have largely been individual content creators and SMBs. However, we expect these tools to move upmarket, in terms of both traditional enterprise sales to larger companies like games studios, and embedded music generation in content creation platforms via APIs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Music Generation  
<p>Perhaps the most exciting implication of large models combined with music is the potential for bedroom producers and other prosumers (including those that lack formal music training) to create professional-grade music. A few of the key capabilities here will include:</p>
 
 Inpainting: Taking a couple of notes that a producer plays and “filling” out the phrase. 
 Outpainting: Taking a section of a song and extrapolating what the next few bars might look like. This is already supported by MusicGen with the “<a href="https://replicate.com/meta/musicgen">continuation</a>” setting. 
 Audio to MIDI: Converting audio to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> including pitch bend, velocity, and other MIDI attributes, as available via Spotify’s <a href="https://basicpitch.spotify.com/">Basic Pitch</a> product. 
 Stem separation: Decompiling a song into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_(audio)">stems</a> including vocals, bassline, and percussion using technologies like Demucs. 
 
<p>You can imagine a future producer’s workflow looking something like this:</p>
 
 Grab an appropriately cleared song you want to sample&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs">Split the stems</a> and convert an interesting<a href="https://basicpitch.spotify.com/"> audio element to MIDI</a> 
 Play a few notes on a synthesizer and then use in-painting to fill out the phrase 
 Extrapolate that phrase to a few additional phrases using outpainting 
 Compose a track (further using generative tech to create one-shots), replicate or extend studio musicians, and master the track in a specific style 
 
<p>We’ve also started to see the rise of software-only products that focus on various parts of the production stack; for example, generating samples (<a href="https://soundry.ai/">Soundry AI</a>), melodies (<a href="https://www.wave-ai.net/">MelodyStudio</a>), MIDI files (<a href="https://www.lemonaide.ai/">Lemonaide</a>, <a href="https://www.audiocipher.com/">AudioCipher</a>), or even mixing (<a href="https://www.roexaudio.com/">RoEx</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be critical that these models are multimodal, and accept music and other audio inputs as many people lack the vocabulary to describe the exact sounds they’re seeking. We expect to see a tight loop between hardware and software — including the rise of “generative instruments,” which may be DJ controllers and synthesizers that embed these ideas directly into the physical product.&nbsp;</p>
 Professional Tools  
<p>Finally, we’ll touch on a newer category of AI music products: professional tools that are used in the workflow of music producers, artists, and labels. (Note that while we say professional, many of these products also serve indie or amateur creators.)</p>
<p>These products vary widely in complexity and use cases, as well as the extent to which they integrate within the traditional production workflow. We can split them into 3 major categories:</p>
 
 Browser-based tools that focus on one element of the creation or editing pipeline and are accessible to all; you don’t need to use traditional production software to benefit from them. For example, <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs">Demucs</a> (an open source model from Meta), <a href="https://www.lalal.ai/">Lalal</a>, <a href="https://www.audioshake.ai/">AudioShake</a>, and <a href="https://phonicmind.com/">PhonicMind</a> do stem splitting. 
 AI-powered virtual studio technologies (VSTs) that plug into digital audio workstations (DAWs) like Ableton Live, Pro Tools, and Logic Pro. These VSTs, including <a href="https://mawf.io/">Mawf</a>, <a href="https://neutone.space/">Neutone</a>, and <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/products/neutron.html">Izotope</a>, can be used to synthesize or process sound within a producer’s existing workspace without requiring them to re-home their workflow. 
 Products that are trying to re-invent the DAW entirely with an AI-first approach, making it more accessible to a new generation of consumers and professionals alike. Many of the most popular DAWs today are 20+ years old; startups like <a href="https://tuneflow.com/">TuneFlow</a> and <a href="https://wavtool.com/">WavTool</a> are tackling the ambitious challenge of building a new version of the DAW from the ground up. 
 
 Music’s Midjourney Moment  
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Market-Map-Opt-2-scaled.jpg"></a>Products like Midjourney and Runway have allowed consumers to create impressive visual content that previously would have required knowledge of and access to expensive, specialized and cumbersome tools. Already, we’re seeing creative professionals such as graphic designers adopt these early generative AI tools to expedite their workflows and iterate on content more quickly. We expect to see analogous products in music — AI-powered tools that decrease the friction from inspiration to expression to zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This “Midjourney moment” for generative music — when creating a quality track becomes fast and easy enough for everyday consumers to do it — will have massive implications for the music industry, from professional producers and artists to a new class of consumer creators.</p>
<p>Our ultimate dream? An end-to-end tool where you provide guidance on the vibe and themes of the track you’re looking to create, in the form of text, audio, images, or even video, and an AI copilot then collaborates with you to write and produce the song. We don’t imagine the most popular songs will ever be entirely AI generated — there’s a human element to music, as well as a connection to the artist that can’t be replaced — however, we do expect AI assistance will make it easier for the average person to become a musician. And we like the sound of that!&nbsp;</p>

It wraps into packets and mixes together IP traffic from many users inside the mixnet. It encrypts and mixes <a href="https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf">Sphinx packet</a> traffic so that it cannot be determined who is communicating with&nbsp;whom.</p>  Use mixFetch — it’s just like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> API, but via the&nbsp;mixnet  <p>MixFetch is a drop-in replacement for the fetch API, used to send HTTP requests over the Nym mixnet. It does this by grabbing the same arguments as ‘vanilla’ fetch, then constructing a SOCKS5 request which is made to the destination host on the internet via a <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/quickstart/socks-proxy.html">SOCKS5</a> <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/network-requester.html">Network Requester</a>.</p>  Use CosmosKit to run Cosmos-based components via Nym infrastructure  Create and spend <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/zk-nyms">zk-nyms</a> — the anonymous credentials system based on the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/coconut.html">Coconut</a> cryptographic signature scheme.  <p>This is currently a work in progress, and will soon be added and documented. It lets application programmers concerned with resource access control to think and code in a new way. And most importantly, zk-nyms allows builders to be paid anonymously.</p> SDK and package variant&nbsp;overview <p>While the Nym smart contracts only come in the ESM version, the mixnet client and mixFetch are both available in four variants: ESM, CommonJS, unbundled, and pre-bundled (full-fat).</p><p>You can find a detailed description of the type of package you should use on <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/overview">this page</a> along with specific details regarding each.</p> Great! What do I need for an out-of-the-box, quick&nbsp;start? <p>The SDK is still a work in progress and the documentation will evolve in the weeks to&nbsp;come.</p><p>However, at this stage, builders are recommended to use <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> as a bundler, in order to use the full-fat versions of the different clients.</p><p>Documentation on other bundlers, such as Webpack, can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/bundling/webpack">here</a>.</p> Step-by-step tutorials <p>You can find step-by-step tutorials in the <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/examples/mix-fetch">“Examples” section</a>, which are basic guides for how to use each SDK client in isolated environments.</p> Example: sending traffic over the Nym mixnet using the TypeScript SDK <p>To send or receive messages over the mixnet, you’ll need to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk">SDK Client</a>, which will allow you to create apps that can use the Nym mixnet and zk-nyms credentials.</p><p>More details about the clients can be <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/guides/mixnet">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Below is a tutorial for creating a raw version of a basic messaging application to send traffic over the Nym mixnet using Vite, TS and&nbsp;React.</p><p>Alternatively, you can test this app directly in the <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/playground/mixfetch">developer live playground</a> specifically tailored for Nym’s documentation environment, using&nbsp;Nextra.</p><p>Environment set-up</p><p>Create, cd into your directory and set up your environment:</p> npm create vite@latest <p>Select ‘React’ and later ‘TypeScript’ as you go to your environment setup if you want your app to work off the bat following this tutorial.</p><p>Then run:</p> cd &lt;app_name&gt;<br>npm i <br>npm run dev <p>Installation</p><p>Install all the required packages:</p> npm i @nymproject/sdk-full-fat <p>Imports</p><p>Import from the&nbsp;module:</p> import { createNymMixnetClient, NymMixnetClient, Payload } from "@nymproject/sdk-full-fat"; <p>Build your&nbsp;app</p><p>By pasting the below example code, you should be able to send and receive messages through the mixnet with an unstyled mixnet app template.</p> import "./App.css";<br>import { useEffect, useState } from "react";<br>import {<br>  createNymMixnetClient,<br>  NymMixnetClient,<br>  Payload,<br>} from "@nymproject/sdk-full-fat";<br> <br>const nymApiUrl = "https://validator.nymtech.net/api";<br> <br>export function MixnetClient() {<br>  const [nym, setNym] = useState&lt;NymMixnetClient&gt;();<br>  const [selfAddress, setSelfAddress] = useState&lt;string&gt;();<br>  const [recipient, setRecipient] = useState&lt;string&gt;();<br>  const [payload, setPayload] = useState&lt;Payload&gt;();<br>  const [receivedMessage, setReceivedMessage] = useState&lt;string&gt;();<br> <br>  const init = async () =&gt; {<br>    const client = await createNymMixnetClient();<br>    setNym(client);<br> <br>    // Start the client and connect to a gateway<br>    await client?.client.start({<br>      clientId: crypto.randomUUID(),<br>      nymApiUrl,<br>      forceTls: true, // force WSS<br>    });<br> <br>    // Check when is connected and set the self address<br>    client?.events.subscribeToConnected((e) =&gt; {<br>      const { address } = e.args;<br>      setSelfAddress(address);<br>    });<br> <br>    // Show whether the client is ready or not<br>    client?.events.subscribeToLoaded((e) =&gt; {<br>      console.log("Client ready: ", e.args);<br>    });<br> <br>    // Show message payload content when received<br>    client?.events.subscribeToTextMessageReceivedEvent((e) =&gt; {<br>      console.log(e.args.payload);<br>      setReceivedMessage(e.args.payload);<br>    });<br>  };<br> <br> <br>  const stop = async () =&gt; {<br>    await nym?.client.stop();<br>  };<br> <br> const send = () =&gt; {<br>    if (!nym || !payload || !recipient) return<br>    nym.client.send({ payload, recipient });<br>  }<br> <br>  useEffect(() =&gt; {<br>    init();<br>    return () =&gt; {<br>      stop();<br>    };<br>  }, []);<br> <br>  if (!nym) return &lt;div&gt;Waiting for the mixnet client...&lt;/div&gt;;<br> <br>  if (!selfAddress) return &lt;div&gt;Connecting...&lt;/div&gt;;<br> <br> <br>  return (<br>    &lt;div&gt;<br>      &lt;h1&gt;Send messages through the Nym mixnet&lt;/h1&gt;<br>      &lt;p style={{ border: "1px solid black" }}&gt;<br>        My self address is: {selfAddress ?

<p>Despite the many alternative flavors of NoSQL databases that have caught the attention of developers over the years, relational databases remain the de facto standard for storing and retrieving digital information. Every technology worker from the back-office IT personnel to the modern Web developer has been trained to use, manage, and query relational databases. SQL, the language used to interact with relational databases, is the lingua franca of data management. Yet, while blockchains can be thought of as decentralized databases, they are not geared for the same storage and query tasks as relational databases, making them too slow, too expensive, and decidedly foreign for the average developer to interact with. This creates a paradoxical and undesirable situation in which developers of decentralized technologies choose the path of least resistance for their data storage needs: traditional, centralized, relational databases.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>, a multi-chain relational database network that brings SQL to smart contracts. Using this foundation, Tableland is developing Basin — a product for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) projects. With a focus on user-friendly tools and cryptographic data formats, Basin is designed to make data secure and usable for generations to come. Provenance tracking ensures a transparent data lineage, while Filecoin guarantees decentralized data accessibility and permanence. With Basin, Tableland is <a href="https://mirror.xyz/tableland.eth/UJMDvy8vAqekOGpPmspRGzdl2-osjPeGVaIv2Lv4Oh0">solving a critical pain point </a>for DePIN projects by creating a more secure, efficient, and transparent decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Tableland launched their community in Q2 of 2022 with 3000 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/tableland-rigs">utilitarian NFTs</a> with their metadata stored in relational tables in Tableland itself, showcasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAc0xDyQDZbo-PnGBbv1aBTVMVwd4qncL">tangible use case</a> for the product. The NFTs sold out in under 5 minutes. Since then, they’ve launched on Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and other L2&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As crypto continues to grow and quickly evolve, developers will lean toward tools and technologies that make them more productive. Tried and true, widely adopted patterns such as relational tables and SQL will continue to play an important foundational role, even as applications become decentralized. With growing momentum behind DePIN projects, Tableland can position itself as a foundational building block for a world where crypto-economic incentives are used to coordinate physical infrastructure. We are excited to be backing the entire Tableland team on their&nbsp;mission.</p>

This update forms the basis of the exit gateway node — an essential part of the new ‘Smooshed’ setup in the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>The next step will be to ‘smoosh’ gateways and mixnodes, so operators can easily service any hop in the network, radically improving the redundancy of the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Read on to find out all about the Galaxy&nbsp;update.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/faster-better-stronger-smooshier-improving-mixnet-coverage-with-project-smoosh-eaf4b215507f">Faster, better, stronger, Smooshier — improving mixnet coverage with Project&nbsp;Smoosh</a></p> Exit gateways now run a ‘deny&nbsp;list’ <p>NymConnect has, until now, run on a limited ‘allow list’ only letting through traffic from a very narrow number of applications. With the upcoming release of NymVPN — the evolution of NymConnect into a consumer product — this is changing to a ‘deny list’ in order to enable privacy for the broadest possible user base, with the widest available range of web services.</p><p>In short, this means that gateways will now block known malicious traffic, rather than only allowing the traffic of a select few services. This is a much more permissive setup to enhance appeal and accessibility for end&nbsp;users.</p><p>To protect operators, an <a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt">exit policy</a> has been introduced so known malicious actors are blocked by default. This is based on a combination of the <a href="https://tornull.org/">Tor Null advisory block list</a> and the <a href="https://tornull.org/tor-reduced-reduced-exit-policy.php">Tor reduced exit&nbsp;policy</a>.</p> Introducing Nym Operators Legal&nbsp;Forum <p>To further assist operators, <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/exit-gateway.html">Nym DevRels have started to compile a document for legal best practice and&nbsp;advice</a>.</p><p>The document serves as the basis for a consultation with Nym node operators on any concerns, plus additional support and information operators might need throughout the change for ensuring maximum availability, usability and adoption.</p><p>Operators are invited to research their own jurisdictions and add their findings to this document.</p><p>To do so, create a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/documentation/operators/src">repository</a>, then message DevRels to alert them in the new <a href="https://matrix.to/#/!YfoUFsJjsXbWmijbPG:nymtech.chat?via=nymtech.chat&amp;via=matrix.org">Nym Operators Legal Forum on Element</a>. Note: only members of the general or node operator rooms may access the Legal Forum on&nbsp;Element.</p><p>While Nym core team cannot provide comprehensive legal advice across all jurisdictions, work is ongoing to build knowledge and experience with the help of the community and legal&nbsp;counsel.</p><p>That said, Nym core has now published preliminary findings from legal counsel on Nym exit gateways in two jurisdictions, <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/swiss.html">Switzerland</a> and the <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/united-states.html">United States</a>. These should not be viewed as comprehensive legal counsel and are presented unedited.</p><p>Given the legal similarity between Nym exit gateways and Tor exit relays, it is also recommended that operators acquaint themselves with <a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/tor-exit-guidelines/">Tor community exit guidelines</a>.</p><p>Nym core team cannot provide operators with definitive answers regarding the potential risks of operating open gateways, but there is evidence of some considerations that may arise, from operating Tor exit&nbsp;relays:</p>  From a technical perspective, Nym node operators may need to implement additional controls, such as dedicated hardware and IP usage, or setting up an HTML exit notice on port&nbsp;80.  From an operational standpoint, node operators may be expected to actively manage their relationship with their ISP or VPS provider and respond to abuse requests using the proposed templates.  Legally, exit relays are typically considered “telecommunication networks” and are subject to intermediary liability protection. However, there may be exceptions, particularly in cases involving criminal law and copyright claims. Operators could seek advice from local privacy associations and may consider running nodes under an entity rather than as individuals.  <p>Nym node operators are strongly encouraged to join operator channels on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Element</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Telegram</a> to share best practices and experiences.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-galaxy-update-has-just-completed-c54beea6c01a">Nym node ‘Galaxy’ update has just completed</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Some notable improvements from our previous release include <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7772">better recovery from brief network interruptions</a>, and mitigation of potential network and verification denial of service and performance issues. We have restored our macOS tests in CI, and now support macOS on a best-effort basis.</p>



<p>We have also changed our documentation website URL, and are considering deprecating some Docker image tags from release 1.5.0 onwards.</p>



 Mining RPCs in Production Builds 



<p>Since the 1.4.0 release, Zebra’s mining RPCs are <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7740">available in release builds</a> so that any Zebra instance can be used by a solo miner or mining pool. With this release, we are providing production level support to 12 mining related RPCs, including getblocktemplate,&nbsp; submitblock, getmininginfo, getnetworksolps, [z_]validateaddress and getblocksubsidy. Do <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">let us know</a> if your mining pool requires any extra RPC methods or fields!</p>



 Zcash Parameters in zebrad Binary 



<p>zebrad now bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly into its binary. This increases the binary size by a few megabytes, but reduces the size of the Docker image by around 600 MB because the parameters don’t contain the Sprout proving key anymore. We have also removed the “zebrad download” command as it is no longer necessary. If you have upgraded zebrad to 1.4.0 or later, and zcashd to 5.7.0 or later, you can delete the zk-SNARK parameter files to save approximately 700 MB disk space. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a>.</p>



 macOS Support 



<p>We have restored support for macOS x86_64 on a best-effort basis. macOS builds and some tests run in Zebra’s CI. You can check out the list of Zebra <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/supported-platforms.html">supported platforms</a> for more details on the different tiers of support we provide for the listed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Deprecation Warnings 



<p>In an effort to remove redundancies and simplify things, we would like to share the following deprecation warnings.</p>



 DockerHub Image Tags 



<p>Zebra currently publishes 11 DockerHub tags for each new release. We want to reduce the number of DockerHub tags we publish in a future minor Zebra release. Based on usage and user feedback, in release 1.5.0 we could stop publishing:</p>



 
 The 1 tag, which updates each release until NU6 



 The 1.x tag, which updates each patch release until the next minor release 



 The 1.x.y tag, which is the same as v1.x.y 



 The sha-xxxxxxx tag, which is the same as v1.x.y (for production releases) 
 



<p>We also want to standardise experimental image tags to -experimental, rather than .experimental.</p>



<p>This means that, for release 1.5.0 onwards, we are considering only publishing the following tags:</p>



 
 latest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 latest-experimental (a new tag) 



 V1.5.0 



 v1.5.0-experimental 
 



<p>Please let us know if you need any other tags by <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">opening a GitHub ticket</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend using the “latest” tag to always get the most recent Zebra release.</p>



 Documentation Website URL Change 



<p>We have replaced the API documentation which was previously available on the doc.zebra.zfnd.org website with <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>. Zebra’s API documentation can now be found on:<br></p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>, which renders documentation for the public API of the latest crate releases; 



 <a href="https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/">doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org</a>, which renders documentation for the internal API on the main branch. 
 



<p>This API documentation is in addition to the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/">Zebra Book</a> user documentation, which is still available as usual.</p>

Anchored to these economics are key dates every quarter from the launch of the Nym mainnet and initial coin offerings through to May 2024. These are something called the ‘vesting schedule’ or vest dates — in simple terms, this is where more tokens are released into the&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Let’s quickly take a look at when the remaining vest dates are and what this&nbsp;means.</p><p>For NYM holders already familiar with the token economics, scroll below for the latest supply figures plus parameter changes (spoiler alert: there are no changes at time of publication).</p> How does the Nym vesting schedule&nbsp;work? <p>For newcomers to the Nym universe, the granular details of how the token operates might feel a little confusing.</p><p>But the main thing to remember is unlike many tokens in the Web3 world, the NYM token is deflationary. This is similar to Bitcoin and means there is a finite number of NYM tokens that exist and will ever exist: 1&nbsp;billion.</p><p>However, not all of these tokens are yet in circulation.</p><p>Instead, there are two important mechanisms that affect the number of tokens in circulation.</p><p>They are each tied to a ‘smart contract’ hosted on the Nyx blockchain. They&nbsp;are:</p>  Token rewards for Nym nodes. These are distributed monthly from the ‘mixmining pool’. This is facilitated by the mixnet smart contract.  Token vest. This is where tokens that have been allocated to Coinlist buyers, backers, and the Nym core team are released on a quarterly basis. This is facilitated by the vesting smart contract.  <p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">A breakdown of the smart contracts that run the Nym token economics</a></p><p>The overall vesting schedule began in 2022, the year the Nym mainnet went live and the NYM token was publicly listed. There are quarterly vests over the course of two years ending in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>The most recent vest dates were 2 November to Coinlist buyers, then 4 November to validators, and then on 5 November to backers and advisors, who hold the most NYM tokens out of any&nbsp;group.</p><p>See below for the vest schedule through to May,&nbsp;2024:</p><p>It is important to remember that because NYM tokens are deflationary, large vest dates may have a temporary impact on the value of the NYM&nbsp;token.</p><p>This is to be expected, according to the laws of supply and demand. Token price movements around vest dates tend to rebalance and recover afterwards.</p> What does the token supply look&nbsp;like? <p>Openness and transparency are essential to the Nym mission, so the core team publishes regular updates on the number of tokens currently circulating.</p><p>Anyone can check the current token supply at any time using <a href="https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/circulating-supply">this&nbsp;API</a>.</p><p>At the time of writing, the total circulating supply is 607.4m&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Additionally, 22.4% of tokens remain in the mix-mining pool, essentially a bootstrapping mechanism to reward node operators for good&nbsp;mixes.</p><p>As paid usage begins with the upcoming NymVPN, the fiat or crypto that VPN subscribers pay for access will be converted to NYM tokens and distributed as rewards to the various entities that make the service possible. This leads to a circular flow of NYM tokens with sustainable demand.</p><p>Furthermore, the zk-nym zero-knowledge protocols enable subscribers to unlink their payment from their credentials and usage of the service, thus protecting their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-2023-24-2466711e1fad">Nym roadmap update — 2023–24</a></p> Staking parameter update <p>Tied to the vesting schedule and the token economics is something called a staking parameter update. This entails adjusting the target staking supply to account for the increase in overall staking supply. An increase here, in turn, affects node stake saturation point and therefore the APY of nodes and delegators.</p><p>Before diving into that, here are the current parameters:</p>  Circulating supply: 607 million NYM&nbsp;(<a href="https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/circulating-supply">API</a>)  Locked staking supply: 168 million&nbsp;NYM  Max staking supply: 657 million&nbsp;NYM  Target staking supply: 230 million&nbsp;NYM  Mix node stake saturation point: 960,000&nbsp;NYM  <p>Let’s walk through these one by one and explain why they&nbsp;matter.</p><p>The NYM tokens that are released during the vests entail a significant increase in the circulating supply of tokens. In addition to this, token holders can also stake some of their locked tokens (concretely, 10% of their original locked amount can be&nbsp;staked).</p><p>The circulating supply plus locked staking supply determines the max staking supply, meaning the total amount of NYM tokens that could in theory be staked on Nym&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Now, it is highly unlikely that all tokens will be staked on Nym&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>For example, right now 150 million NYM, representing 23% of the max staking supply, are&nbsp;staked.</p><p>For this reason, a target staking supply is set at a reasonable number between the max staking supply (657m) and actual current level of staked tokens&nbsp;(150m).</p><p>The target staking supply parameter is set to maximise APY, or rate of return, for currently staked tokens, while nevertheless incentivising further&nbsp;staking.</p><p>This determines the stake saturation point of Nym nodes. The stake saturation point is found by dividing the target staking supply by the number of rewarded mix nodes: 230m / 240 = 960k saturation point.</p><p>The saturation levels of a node signify its reputation, and this affects whether the node is selected to the active set (or ‘epoch’) in the mixnet, and earning rewards. If all nodes reach saturation too easily because the target is set very low, then the incentive algorithm no longer works, and staking loses its significance in the selection process.</p><p>In short: setting a target lower than the current level of staked tokens would disincentivise people from operating nodes and delegating stake. But setting the target a lot higher could raise the saturation point to unreachable levels. This would harm the APY of mix nodes, and also disincentivise operating and&nbsp;staking.</p><p>So, in order to offer a good APY to operators and stakers, the target staking supply for rewards is higher than the current level of staked tokens, but lower than the current maximum of 657m, and set at&nbsp;230m.</p><p>And those all together are the ‘parameters’.</p> Parameter update — no&nbsp;update! <p>Changes to the parameters are only necessary when the level of staking in the mixnet is approaching the&nbsp;target.</p><p>This number might increase with rewards being released every month from the mixmining pool. And it is even more likely to increase with the quarterly vest, as this releases a large amount of tokens that can be&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Having said all that, the target staking point of 230 million NYM is still a way off, therefore none of the parameters need to&nbsp;change.</p><p>The parameters will be revisited with the next vest to assess whether the total staked in the network is nearing the&nbsp;target.</p><p>Whew: deep breath. Make&nbsp;sense?</p><p>Check out the paper <a href="https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/diaz-reward-sharing-mixnets/release/2">Reward sharing for mixnets</a> for a deeper dive into how this all&nbsp;works.</p><p>And don’t forget to keep an eye on Nym Shipyard masterclasses from community members, Nym core team, and special guests for more info about nodes, staking, and the token economics.

 The use of stablecoins for speculative trading in cryptocurrency markets has experienced a consistent, steep decline over the past five years. That’s the key takeaway of “Beyond Speculation: Payment Stablecoins for Real-time Gross Settlements,” a paper that was among the four winning research projects featured at DC Fintech Week 2023.

<p>Bootstrap Org, the nonprofit parent organization of Electric Coin Co., has added long-time Zcash community contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/michlai007">Michelle Lai</a> to its Board of Directors. Michelle joins members Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Zaki Manian, and Zooko Wilcox.</p>



<p>“Michelle has worked hard to support Zcash and the cause of financial freedom for years,” Fairless said. “We love her insight and imagination on tech product use cases.”</p>



<p>A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2007), Michelle has spent half her career in crypto and half in financial services, including stints at Anchorage Digital, Bitpay, Credit Suisse, a private equity buyout fund, and as a consultant to CEOs of large financial services companies. She’s performed a wide range of roles, including COO, BD and product roles, and says she most enjoys solving tricky business problems and managing high-stakes negotiations.</p>



<p>She is passionate about crypto-related technology as “a means of achieving a fairer and freer world.”</p>



<p>In Michelle’s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My journey with Zcash started in 2018 when I worked at a crypto asset custodian and we were looking to support $ZEC. Since then, I’ve fallen further down the privacy money rabbit hole, becoming a member of the first grant organization in 2021 (the Zcash Open Major Grants committee) and then staying involved as someone who actively advocates for privacy and freedom applications in crypto.</p>



<p>My vision of tomorrow’s Zcash is one that earns its place back as a leader of privacy tech in crypto so that we can keep supporting the universal values of privacy and freedom. We did it once with the best talent in ZK and engineering, and we can do it again.</p>



<p>Today, as the crypto privacy community faces several challenges, including market sentiment and regulatory onslaught, I join the Bootstrap team to navigate the turbulent waters we find ourselves in. I have had professional experience in turnaround situations and hope to bring that to bear in this new role on the board of Bootstrap.</p>



<p>The road ahead is strewn with both extremely difficult questions and compelling opportunities for all ZK and privacy projects, including us. It will take a grand effort for us to arrive at a new horizon, but this is the moment where we dig in, gear up, and keep marching on in service of humanity.</p>



<p>If you have ideas and opinions from anywhere in the crypto community, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.</p>

<p>The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

He discussed <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-partners-with-near-foundation-bringing-web3-privacy-to-users-and-validators-844966df7f0b">the recent partnership with the NEAR Foundation</a> to bring the privacy protections of the Nym mixnet to Near’s L1 blockchain, and encouraged builders to apply for open grants&nbsp;now.</p>Presentation slide on the three Shipyard tracks from Huxian, Nym community contributor (featuring visuals from&nbsp;<a href="https://linktr.ee/Poppel">Poppel</a>)<p>Huxian, Nym community contributor updated viewers on <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-level-1-unlocked-87e79da32f67">Nym Shipyard</a> and detailed his vision for Nym community squads — what he describes as a ‘social mesh’ system of ‘autonomous collective intelligence agents, weaving trust into the fabric of the mixnet’. He urged viewers to form their own squads, or join existing ones, whether ‘Builders’, ‘Operators’ or ‘Visionaries’, to contribute to the health of the mixnet and build the future private internet.</p> Community Q&amp;A <p>The following Q&amp;A session was compiled from the questions received after each individual core team member’s presentation, as well as the open Q&amp;A at the end of the Town Hall. The questions and answers have been lightly edited only for grammar, clarity, and readability.</p><p>Are there any specific types of applications you think are more or less appropriate for integrating and using the mixnet at this point, and in the&nbsp;future?</p><p>Mark Sinclair, Head of Engineering, Nym: I think for any applications that are written in JavaScript, and that use the Fetch API, mixFetch is a really easy&nbsp;drop-in.</p><p>Currently, because of the allow list [for the network requesters], there are only a few hosts on the internet that you’ll be able to&nbsp;use.</p><p>But as we go live with the ‘smooshed’ gateways and network requesters from project Smoosh, this obviously opens it up to a much wider piece of the internet. Definitely React applications — say React Native, anything written in TypeScript, or JavaScript, Node.Js. All of those are really good candidates for mixFetch and should be pretty easy to integrate with.</p><p>Are there any limitations with the mixnet to be wary of, such as&nbsp;latency?</p><p>Mark Sinclair: Obviously, the main purpose of the mixnet is to hide people’s traffic from a global adversary.</p><p>Because of the cover traffic — some of the traffic will be cover traffic and some will be real traffic —there will be delays. I think it’s not really appropriate for doing things that are really timing specific. That’s just the sacrifice that you have to pay for things that are private, so please don’t use it to do things that are really time sensitive. The performance will never be as good there because it specifically adds delays to add&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Can Nym work on&nbsp;Solana?</p><p>Mark Sinclair: Well, that’s quite a question! I think the thing is that it depends on which bits you’re trying to do. If you’re trying to make sure that any kind of transactions that you’re sending are hidden from a global adversary, and you’ve got a way — like in those diagrams that I showed — to hide portions of the infrastructure from a global adversary, then&nbsp;yes.</p><p>Otherwise, there really are two kinds of use cases here: user traffic, and things that have to do with say, consensus or validators. And then the validators themselves would need to have Nym built into them. Because if any part is sticking out, then you’re maybe not getting the benefits&nbsp;there.</p><p>So the answer would be yes, but it depends what exactly you’re trying to protect. And I suggest looking at the integration guide on <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/">sdk.nymtech.net</a>.</p><p>Do you suspect any issues paying for NymVPN on iOS devices, since Apple doesn’t like payments that bypass the app&nbsp;store?</p><p>Marc Debizet, Lead Product Manager, Nym: When you buy the subscriptions for Nym directly on the iOS app, you’ll have to follow the rules set by Apple. So if you want to bypass that you will have to subscribe to NymVPN directly on our&nbsp;website.</p><p>After NymVPN is launched and efficiently working, is there anything stopping the team from giving us a Nym antivirus?</p><p>Marc Debizet: The Nym mission is to enable privacy for everyone. So we’re not into cyber security, we are into&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Are there any plans to make the e-cash system interoperable with other blockchain or payment ecosystems? How would this impact user privacy and cross-platform transactions?</p><p>Ania Piotrowska, Nym cofounder and Head of Research: In general, the whole scheme which we designed, which was published at PETS, is quite generic. We use them in Nym for paying for using the Nym network. But they can be used in many other scenarios. They could be used by other blockchains. They could be used by CBDCs, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>So it’s a very generic protocol, which could be deployed in many, many situations. That’s really a little bit up to imagination and the needs of people from other projects.</p><p>Right now, we’re not planning to do any big-scale integrations, we’d rather focus on using them within our network. But once we’re gonna polish this, and we’re happy with how this works with Nym, who knows where we are going to&nbsp;look?</p><p>What are the benefits that the Nym community can see in the long from the Nym-Near partnership?</p><p>Ade Molajo: That’s a really good question. So for the Nym community, obviously, once the Near partnership is live, once the integration has been done, that it means that we’re going to be having more traffic going through the mix nodes, which invariably means there will be more awards for our node operators, as well as validators. So that’s the immediate benefit that we’ll&nbsp;see.</p><p>It’s evidently an incredibly exciting time for Nym and the Nym community. We in the core team hope you found the Community Town Hall as enjoyable as we did. See you in&nbsp;Q4!</p><p>As always: for more updates as they happen, keep your eyes on this blog, follow Nym on socials, and join the Nym community.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-community-town-hall-q3-recap-c2f78c981493">Nym Community Town Hall Q3 — recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A busy month just went by! Here’s everything we did and what’s on the horizon for Panther.</p><p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>October has been a productive month for us, and we’re excited to share our progress in many areas as we work towards Panther v1. <br>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 2 <p>The latest development sprints were focused on solving a bug related to an external library used for Stage 2, an external factor that has caused a delay. <br><br>Our Incentivized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Testnet Stage 2 </a>is now officially underway, bringing a wave of features and rewards to the Panther community. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Stage 2</a> is critical as it puts our user interaction and reward mechanisms to the test, laying the groundwork for Panther Protocol’s privacy-preserving features. Our protocol’s privacy is intricately tied to unique game-theoretical features that encourage active user participation, making this stage a pivotal moment for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Stage 2 includes creating and activating your Panther Account, finding your onboarding bonuses, and claiming your vouchers. <br>Your participation and feedback are crucial as we move closer to our v1 release. Thank you for being a part of Testnet Stage 2, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts through our community channels!</p> V1 redesign <p>Over the past weeks, we have done some UX refinements too. The focus was reviewing what we have learned from the previous design iterations and expanding on it further while also elevating the user experience. Another objective was to revamp and update the onboarding process for more seamless account setup.</p><p>You can take a look at a quick preview below:</p> Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi Protocol <p>Just in case you missed our last update, on October 2nd we hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqKVqmnqaaxB?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a great conversation via Twitter Spaces</a> with our partners at PureFi.

<p>Now and through the end of January 2024, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) objectives center on delivering an improved ZEC user experience, primarily through the Zashi wallet. Across teams — Product; Engineering; PeopleOps; and Communications and Advocacy — ECC employees are focused on work that either directly contributes to the wallet or in some way makes ZEC and Zashi adoption more viable.</p>



<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

 Intro <p>Panther community,</p><p>As we conclude Testnet Stage 1 with a number of learnings and upgrades, we are thrilled to announce the commencement of Stage 2 of our Testnet.</p><p>This second phase is designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. As Panther’s privacy is built upon unique game-theoretical features fostering user activity, Stage 2 is key for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Stage 2. It comprises three main categories of reward mechanisms: Rewards, Recharge pool, and Vouchers.</p> 1. Rewards <p>Rewards or protocol reward points (PRPs) are created as an incentive for users to join and continuously use Panther Protocol. This implies converting the ‘Available PRP’ to ZKP which is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided AMM</a> (automated market maker) pool. It is one-sided because users can only convert their PRP to ZKP and not vice versa. The exchange rate of this conversion is dynamic in nature and depends on several factors, including the amount of ZKP in the pool and the total available PRP held by users at any given point in time, among other factors. For details on how Panther Rewards works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p><p>There are two types of PRPs:</p>  Available PRPs which can be exchanged to zZKP (ZKP within the MASP) immediately.  Pending PRP is the accrued rewards that are not realized yet because a user has not spent those UTXOs. To make it available, the UTXO's should be included in transactions that a user performs within Panther.<br>   2. Recharge Pool  <p>Note: Recharge Pool functionality is currently not included in Stage 2; it will be announced in the upcoming days, prior to Stage 3 release.</p><p>This is a functionality where ZKP is fed to the AMM pool which will be triggered by the user (which costs some gas fees) and the protocol incentivizes the action in the form of a Voucher as described above.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a> to understand the source of ZKP to the Reward Pool (on Polygon)</p><p>The pool can be recharged which means an additional amount of zZKP tokens (see the Recharge screen, Recharge Size field) will be brought to the pool.&nbsp;</p> 3. Vouchers <p>Vouchers are a reward mechanism that can be used by the Protocol to incentivize certain functions that have to be triggered by Users. We refer to them as Admin functions. Those could include but are not limited to functions such as:</p>  Recharging Reward Pool  Trigger conversion of token&nbsp;  <p>Note: the onboarding reward voucher issued atThe voucher this Stage is only for testing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a new account is created and activated successfully, a user gets (a) 100 zZKP onto his zAccount and (b) 1 voucher which is worth 500 PRP. This is valid for all new users and the users who have created accounts during Stage 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: it can take up to a minute to get the voucher screen updated to let a user find his onboarding voucher.</p><p>The voucher has a stable predefined value which can be different depending on the type of performed action (onboarding = PRP 500, triggering recharge the reward pool = PRP 100). The voucher is nominated in PRP.&nbsp; To get those PRP, one should claim a voucher - it is about submitting a transaction “burn a voucher - get the corresponding PRP”.&nbsp;</p><p>Vouchers are grouped per type of action performed. Stage 2 will have two such groups - (1) Onboarding bonus voucher and (2) Recharge bonus voucher. Vouchers can be claimed by group only, which means a user gets the total PRP for all vouchers in a given group. When claiming is completed successfully, a user will see an updated balance on his (a) Dashboard → Panther Rewards Points section → Available PRP amount and (b) Rewards page → Redeem PRP screen → Available PRP section. &nbsp;</p> STAGE 2 TESTING <p>As we progress through our Testnet stages, we want to express our gratitude for your continued support, feedback, and enthusiasm. To start testing Stage 2, please visit Panther docs <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> to get the most updated test link and follow the steps:</p>  New user creates and activates Panther Account (existing users go through the same step but the onboarding process bypasses the KYC verification) - see <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">the Stage 1 functionality and instructions</a>.&nbsp;  <p>Note 1.1: both (a) new accounts and (b) previously created during Stage 1 Panther accounts both are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>When your account is successfully created, you will find a success screen:</p>  Find the first part of your onboarding bonus on your dashboard. This bonus is in the form of Panther Account zZKP which is expected to fuel all types of transactions within Panther such as paying Protocol fees, paying to Relayer for gasless transactions, paying Miner’s fee etc. Users are expected to maintain a sufficient balance of this account in zZKP using transfer functions available in later stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Find the second part of your onboarding bonus - an onboarding voucher,, which equals 500 PRPs. The voucher should be claimed to get the PRPs into your account. To find the second part, please follow the Rewards menu item =&gt; Vouchers screen =&gt; Onboarding Reward Vouchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Note 3.1: It takes time to detect and reflect the corresponding group of vouchers so there can be a case when the screen is empty before the data is updated:</p><p>Note 3.2: It takes time to make your voucher available for claiming, as the zAccount UTXO must be mined in advance. The UI will reflect your bonus voucher. Please be aware that claiming the voucher may take a few minutes in the test environment (due to lower mining activity which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The claim button is disabled until claiming is available.&nbsp;</p>  Claim your voucher via the Vouchers screen functionality. After Voucher is claimed successfully (Voucher screen will go back to the state mentioned in Note 3.1 upon a successfully claimed transaction), you can find the corresponding amount of PRP on the Redeem PRP screen, Available PRP field&nbsp;  <p>Note 4.1: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes to display the PRP available for redeeming (due to lower mining activity in the test environment, which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The button is disabled until Redeem is successful.&nbsp;</p>  Redeem your PRP from the Redeem PRP screen to get your zZKP. This zZKP will now be available in your Private zAssets section and zAssets Summary section balance in the Dashboard screen.  <p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks not just an advancement in the protocol's capabilities, but gets us a step closer to our v1 release. As always, make sure to let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in Testnet Stage 2!&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs.

  Partnering with Factory: Autonomous AI for All  <p>Matan and Eno are building fully-autonomous programming “Droids” to unlock creativity within and beyond engineering teams.</p>   
	By Shaun Maguire	 



Published November 2, 2023
  



 
<p>Like any VC partner, I get a lot of cold emails. But when Matan Grinberg’s note appeared in my inbox in March, it got my attention right away. Just from the subject line—”Chat with a fellow former hep-th physicist”—I knew we shared a background in the same tiny sub-field of high-energy physics theory. And as I read on and Googled a bit, I discovered that what he humbly described as having “worked with Juan” actually referred to co-authoring a paper with Juan Maldacena—a professor at the elite Institute for Advanced Study and arguably the world’s best-known living physicist—when Matan was still an undergrad.</p>



<p>I wrote back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>A few days later, Matan and I went for a walk. He’d been working at the intersection of physics and AI at Berkeley and pursuing a PhD, but was considering a transition from academia to a start-up—and though he hadn’t yet settled on a specific idea, it was clear that he wanted to build a company. It was also clear that he had a high EQ to match his exceptional background. I encouraged him to take the leap.</p>



<p>He started iterating, and within a week was working on the autonomous coding project&nbsp; that would become <a href="https://www.factory.ai/">Factory</a>—and working with a co-founder who, as it turned out, was in Sequoia’s orbit as well.</p>



<p>Eno Reyes, who grew up in Atlanta and first met Matan at Princeton, had recently accepted a job as an ML engineer at Hugging Face and moved to San Francisco’s Mission District—just a block from where his grandparents had settled down and set up a restaurant after immigrating from Puebla, Mexico. Shortly before he and Matan reunited at a hackathon and started building Factory, the Sequoia team met Eno at AI Ascent, a small gathering of the leading minds in AI that we held in March. Just a year out of college and a few months into his new role, he had already impressed enough to join CEO Clem Delangue at the event.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno’s idea was to build on the historic momentum in AI and unlock even more creativity in software development—and not just among engineers. In the face of a persistent tech talent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent">shortage</a>, with many Fortune 500 companies still running infrastructure built decades ago simply because they don’t have enough people to update it, these two co-founders understood that handing off time-consuming tasks like code review, documentation, testing, project management and debugging to fully autonomous “Droids,” or agents, would indeed be a game-changer for engineering teams. But they also understood that for every software developer, there are another 100 people who don’t have highly technical backgrounds—but do have great ideas that software could bring to life.</p>



<p>It is a next-generation vision for AI, and just a year ago, it would have been too ambitious. But Matan and Eno’s timing is perfect—and they are perfectly suited to the task, not only because of their deep domain expertise in ML, AI and physics, but also because they move at lightning speed. Once they’d landed on an idea, it took them a day to sign a term sheet, incorporate the company and start to build.</p>



<p>Six months later, Factory is delivering value to early customers that include two public companies and two decacorns. Meanwhile, Matan and Eno have more complex functionality on the roadmap, and they are <a href="https://www.factory.ai/careers">growing</a> an amazing team to build it. It has been a joy to welcome them to the Sequoia community, and we look forward to supporting them over the months and years to come as they work toward a world where programming capacity no longer limits our collective creativity.</p>

The litepaper details the peerless privacy protections on offer, features a comprehensive competitor analysis, and explains exactly why NymVPN will be an essential tool for the future internet. NymVPN will preserve your privacy, resist censorship and keep all your data, including metadata, safe — even from the app itself. Let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p> NymVPN: unparalleled privacy protections <p>The NymVPN is the first truly private consumer product that encrypts data and protects traffic analysis of metadata.</p><p>NymVPN is entirely decentralised, powered by the Nym network, with no single central point of control or failure. It will be accessible with completely private payments in the form of zk-nym credentials, based on zero-knowledge technology, shredding any financial paper trail between the user and their access to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/publicamos-el-litepaper-y-v%C3%ADdeo-de-nymvpn-28f1fae88873">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/litepaper-nymvpn-dan-video-pratinjau-dirilis-1b108f76643e">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nymvpn-litepaper-ve-%C3%B6nizleme-videosu-yay%C4%B1nland%C4%B1-421db890b2f4">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/litepaper-%D0%B8-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%8C%D1%8E-nymvpn-%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B5-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BD%D1%8B-d32a6a4c1054">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymfrance/publication-du-litepaper-et-de-la-vid%C3%A9o-de-pr%C3%A9sentation-de-nymvpn-56b3e08acb5b">Française</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nymvpn%E7%99%BD%E7%9A%AE%E4%B9%A6%E5%92%8C%E8%A7%86%E9%A2%91%E9%A2%84%E8%A7%88-5a72109ddb1d">中文</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n6d8560f4d0e7">日本</a></p><p>What’s more, NymVPN gives control to the users with two main options to choose from for their privacy&nbsp;needs:</p>  VPN mode, a decentralised, secure 2-hop mode using the WireGuard protocol that’s optimised for speed — for medium-privacy/high-performance  Mixnet mode, for complete pattern protection security preventing even metadata analysis — for high-privacy/medium performance.  <p>This is a groundbreaking product — until now, the privacy landscape has been fragmented, with even privacy-conscious users having to pick between or audit multiple technologies to understand what works for them. No longer: pick whatever you need in the NymVPN app and use the internet with confidence.</p><p>Features will include a built-in ‘kill switch’ failsafe so if your VPN or mixnet connection drops, your internet access is blocked too. In time, the VPN will also have split tunnelling features, so users can select exactly which application traffic to route through the mixnet or the VPN, so that they don’t have to switch between the two&nbsp;modes.</p><p>With the shifting sands of censorship and anti-digital rights legislation sweeping across the planet right now, a VPN will be an essential tool for anyone who wants to securely access the internet services that they require. And the Nym R&amp;D team is also <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-censorship-resistance-update-d2f5e08e66d1">exploring proven censorship resistance technologies</a> to further cloak mixnet traffic and make it indistinguishable from anything else — so that any person on the planet can enjoy the privacy protections that are their&nbsp;right.</p><p>With NymVPN, the privacy protections are without parallel.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf">Read the Litepaper now for an ultra in-depth deep dive of NymVPN, including competitor analysis and the wider privacy landscape. Learn how NymVPN stacks up against traditional VPNs — and even&nbsp;Tor.</a></p><p>With NymVPN, you get real privacy — made&nbsp;simple.</p> Why does the world need NymVPN? Because traditional VPNs aren’t really private. NymVPN&nbsp;is. <p>The VPN market is enormous and growing — in fact, a third of all internet users worldwide use a VPN. That’s billions of people who know they need privacy, integrity, and security. Unfortunately, the vast majority of VPNs do not actually protect your&nbsp;privacy.</p> Traditional VPNs bleed&nbsp;metadata <p>Although they mask traffic from your internet service provider, traditional VPNs are able to see your unencrypted traffic in&nbsp;full.</p><p>Even with your encrypted traffic, your metadata — data about data — remains exposed, and this metadata can be even more revealing than the content of messages&nbsp;itself.</p><p>As the former General Counsel of the NSA, Stewart Baker, once said: “Metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life. If you have enough metadata, you don’t really need content.”</p><p>NymVPN uses its powerful mix network to obfuscate metadata, preventing powerful adversaries from conducting traffic analysis attacks and de-anonymising users through observing the network. Cloaking metadata is a complex problem and it is one that every existing privacy-preserving technology, even great projects like Tor and Signal, fail to address — until&nbsp;now.</p> Traditional VPNs are centralised — you have to trust the technology and the business, completely <p>Many centralised VPNs, even privacy-focused VPNs, claim they have a “no log policy” — but when push comes to shove, even supposedly private VPNs have turned over information to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>What’s more, centralised VPNs have a central point of failure, putting them at grave risk of data breaches — <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/whats-the-truth-about-the-nordvpn-breach-heres-what-we-now-know">possibly allowing observers to view&nbsp;traffic</a>.</p><p>When VPNs are centralised, you have to trust their business structure, too, and sometimes this is complicated <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-nordsec-the-company-behind-nordvpn-wants-to-be-your-one-stop-privacy-suite/">by many stakeholders who are not visible at first glance</a>. In the case of ‘free’ VPNs, the user is the product — your every movement being tracked and then sold on to faceless data brokers for&nbsp;profit.</p><p>The question is: why risk entrusting any of this data to an unknown third party at all? It’s better to eliminate the risk of holding unnecessary data at all. This is what decentralisation via the Nym network&nbsp;offers.</p> Zk-nym credentials — solving the paper trail problem with real&nbsp;privacy <p>It is no secret that peoples’ financial lives are not exactly&nbsp;private.</p><p>When users pay for access to traditional VPNs, they leave a digital, financial paper trail behind, linking their payments to their&nbsp;account.</p><p>To solve this problem, NymVPN uses something called <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/zk-nyms">zk-nyms</a> to shred that paper trail and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">ensure full privacy from the moment a user&nbsp;pays</a>.</p><p>Zk-nyms are a credentials system based on zero-knowledge technologies. The user can be confident that their payments are private, but to understand exactly why, let’s take a look at what goes on in the background.</p><p>Essentially, zk-nyms are an access token that allow users to access the Nym network. They are issued by Nym-API nodes on the Nym network, after validating a user’s subscription and payment. The current implementation is based on the Coconut scheme, a cryptographic protocol that enables the issuance and verification of anonymous credentials, but optimised for use cases specific to Nym.

With the VPN mode, users will have their traffic run through two hops of these nodes. With the mixnet mode, users will have their traffic run through five hops of these nodes with ‘mixing’ performed in the inner three nodes of the&nbsp;flow.</p><p>This decentralised system is the result of a great deal of academic work designed to create a self-sustaining privacy system. Contrary to privacy projects like Tor which rely on community goodwill, the Nym network is incentivised and governed democratically by its own community. It is the fastest, most reliable mixnet in existence today, making real the idea first conceptualised by legendary cryptographer David Chaum decades&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">original Nym whitepaper</a> and the brand new <a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf">NymVPN litepaper</a> for an even deeper dive on the Nym token economics.</p><p>Everyone is invited to participate in the health of this democratic, decentralised system. NymVPN users can, for instance, ‘delegate’ their NYM tokens to mix node operators — a vote of confidence in the quality of service of that node, and an investment, because delegators will receive a share of that node’s&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Node operators and delegators therefore have a symbiotic relationship. Uptime and good quality mixes are rewarded, whereas if nodes perform poorly, the community can remove their NYM tokens from that node at any time, and place them in a competing node.</p><p>The whole system is carefully designed to promote community self-governance, along with an incentivised anti-surveillance business model — one that’s completely at odds with the current pro-surveillance business model of web 2.0. And with the payment conversion from fiat to NYM detailed above, Nym core expects an increase in activity in this ecosystem as more NYM tokens are acquired.</p><p>Below are the two main key entities in the underlying NymVPN network. Note there are more entities in the wider ecosystem specifically relating to our blockchain, smart contracts, economics including vaildators on the Nyx blockchain etc.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">See also: What is Nyx?

Relay nodes are operated by independent individuals, each contributing to the network’s powerful decentralisation.  Gateways: These are the entry point and the exit points for&nbsp;traffic.  <p>Again, in VPN mode, the data goes through two hops — via an entry gateway and an exit gateway, both encrypting traffic and located in different geographies.</p><p>In mixnet mode, the data goes through 5 hops.

<p>Brave is also introducing Leo Premium, a paid plan featuring Anthropic’s Claude Instant with faster response times</p>
<p>Three months ago, Brave previewed <a>Leo—the browser-native AI assistant</a>—on its Nightly channel for developers and testers. Since then we’ve seen great adoption, with tens of thousands of users globally. With user feedback, we’ve been able to improve much faster than we’d hoped—on response-times, the quality of responses, even the product UI. Today, we’re excited to announce that Brave Leo is ready for all Brave users, available in desktop release 1.60.</p>
<p>With that testing, we also received requests for new features. The most common one has been to add different AI language models in Leo. To that end, we’re bringing our users advanced conversational AI experiences through <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">Brave Leo Premium</a>—our new paid option featuring Claude Instant, Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI assistant.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Leo, Brave’s browser AI assistant, can help with all sorts of tasks. It can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos. It can answer questions about content, or generate new content. It can even translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, or creating content, Leo can help.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy, free access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of typical AI chatbot services.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly common today to use AI to ask questions and get assistance. AI can be a powerful tool but it can also present growing concerns for data privacy and there’s a need for a privacy-first solution,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and will provide our users with secure and personalized AI assistance where they already spend their time online. We’re also thrilled to work with Anthropic to bring Claude’s exceptional conversational abilities to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>

 Introducing Leo Premium 
<p>By default, Brave Leo is free for all users, with easy access to the Llama 2 large language model from Meta. For users who want additional models, Brave is also releasing a premium version of Leo for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$15/month</a>. Leo Premium subscribers will get access to Claude Instant, Anthropic’s faster and lighter model that excels at logical reasoning and coding. The current version of Claude produces longer, more structured responses, follows instructions better than previous versions of Instant, and shows improvements in math, coding, multilingual abilities, and question answering. Additional models will be available to Leo Premium users, as well as access to higher rate limits, higher-quality conversations, priority queuing during periods of peak usage, and early access to new features and improvements.</p>
<p>This integration represents a milestone in delivering sophisticated natural language conversations powered by AI directly within the browser environment. With Claude’s advanced capabilities and Brave’s focus on user privacy and control, we hope to set a new standard for helpful, responsible, and context sensitive AI interactions. Anthropic used <a>Brave’s Search API</a> to train their latest model, Claude 2, on high-quality data to help optimize Claude’s outputs for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) queries.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Brave is going to bring our state-of-the-art large language model Claude Instant directly into their browser. Integrating access to Claude seamlessly within Brave gives users assistance whenever they need it, right in the context of the page they are on,” says Matt Bell, Head of Product Research at Anthropic. “Whether Brave users are analyzing text, editing documents, or writing code, they can now benefit from having personalized help from Claude at any time. This integration unlocks the potential for AI to enhance people’s browsing and productivity in an intuitive, contextual way.”</p>

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo is no different:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymized server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 Accessing Brave Leo 
<p>Leo is now available to Brave desktop users with version 1.60. It will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. It will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more at <a>brave.com/leo</a>, and see details about Leo’s roadmap <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it is built right into the Brave desktop browser, and no extra apps or extensions are required. It provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or also as a sidebar, a chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage.</p>
<p>To access Leo, existing Brave users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in Brave Sidebar.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

      Battling the Trojan Horse in Open Source         
	By Ananya Menon	 



Published November 1, 2023
        Chainguard’s Dan Lorenc is taking on software supply chain security.      



 
<p>Dan Lorenc was at a restaurant in downtown Austin with friends when he received an unusual text. It was the summer of 2021, and the message was from his former coworker, Matt Moore. Lorenc was a software engineer at Google, and he and Moore had worked together on its cyber-security team. The past year had been especially challenging, as the security industry as a whole had faced a reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, SolarWinds reported that its network monitoring platform had been hacked by operatives suspected of working for Russian intelligence. The attackers had planted malware in SolarWinds’ code, which allowed them to access the data of thousands of SolarWinds’ clients, from Microsoft to the U.S. government. The hack exposed a critical flaw in the security of software supply chains. Just as in real-world manufacturing, software is assembled from components created by developers all over the world. At some point during SolarWinds’ development process, malicious actors inserted malware into two software updates, which were then installed by customers all around the world. SolarWinds’ data breach was a wake-up call. Without verifying the integrity of software at every stage of its lifespan this type of hack could and would happen again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore had left Google earlier in the year, and Lorenc had called him every month since, hoping to convince him to return. Moore was one of the finest software engineers Lorenc knew, and if anyone could find a solution to supply chain security, it was him. That night, Moore’s text to Lorenc said he was ready to get back to work—but not at Google. “Let’s start a new company,” Moore texted. Lorenc didn’t need to think twice. He was in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, Lorenc put in notice at Google, bought a new laptop and began work on Chainguard, a company focused on software supply chain security. Although technically the company was born that night in Austin, Lorenc had been preparing for this moment for years.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The late 2000s ushered in a fundamental shift in the way tech companies approached security, as alarm around new types of digital threats grew. In what became known as Operation Aurora in 2009, Chinese hackers attempted to access and change source code in a series of attacks against companies like Google and Adobe. In the Snowden leaks in 2013, a contracted employee for the NSA hacked its database and leaked classified documents.</p>



<p>Lorenc joined Google in 2012, working on the company’s efforts to secure its own code and protect its databases from external or internal attackers. In 2016, after he and his team had implemented Google’s new, refined security system, Lorenc shifted focus to work on Minikube, a tool for open-source Kubernetes container management. This was Lorenc’s first time working predominantly with open-source code—code that’s freely available for anyone to download, modify and exchange. As Lorenc was building and shipping Minikube to users all over the world, he realized he could have easily slipped malware into the software. The container’s label would read “Minikube,” but few would take time to comb through the thousands of lines of code in every directory of the program to determine exactly what was inside. Proper verification was something that would take an engineer days, weeks or even months to complete—bandwidth they almost certainly didn’t have, and therefore a task that would fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>Lorenc was terrified. Wasn’t it just a matter of time before someone packaged up open-source software that secretly contained code that could put an entire company and its community at risk? “I realized how much damage I myself could do, and how easily,” Lorenc says. “And if I could do that, so could anyone.”</p>



<p>The concern over how to protect software from hidden malware isn’t a new one. In 1984, an engineer named Ken Thompson wrote an article called “Reflections on Trusting Trust” that demonstrated how easy it was to hide Trojan horse viruses in a computer program. Thompson’s point was that you could never fully trust any code you hadn’t written yourself. According to Lorenc, 90-98% of code used today is open source. Most companies focus resources on making sure the tiny amount of code they write themselves is secure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. “The 2% of proprietary code is the only part you see over the water, but beneath that is the 98% of code you’re not responsible for yourself,” Lorenc says. “In some ways, open-source code is amazing. It’s enabled all this innovation and velocity and reuse. But it’s also scary because that means 98% of your code is written by strangers on the internet. Which is great when people are well-intentioned, but not everyone on the internet is nice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite evidence of the risks open-source code can pose to a company’s security, Lorenc learned that managing these risks wasn’t something widely prioritized. When he spoke with engineers at other software companies, supply chain security wasn’t a top concern. “Being a software engineer is like playing Whac-A-Mole. There are so many issues you have to deal with on a constant basis that you can’t spend time on preventive measures,” Lorenc says. “You only pay attention to a problem when it rears its head. At this point, there hadn’t been large instances of open-source vulnerability being a problem, so no one seemed to think much about it.”</p>



<p>No one but Lorenc. That is, until December 2020.</p>
 



Lorenc with fierce Chainguard mascot, Charlie



 
<p>Lorenc was at home when he received a news alert about the SolarWinds attack. Thousands of companies were reporting their data, networks and systems compromised—exactly what Lorenc had been worried about. He stood and walked to his car. Lorenc’s house in Austin was close to SolarWinds’ headquarters. He drove there and took a picture of himself in front of its sign. It would serve as a reminder of how important it was that he continue to raise a red flag about the software supply chain. But it was also a moment of validation—he had seen this coming, and he felt vindicated that his concern was justified. Maybe now people would take the problem seriously.</p>



<p>Although Google was not affected by the breach, Lorenc and his coworkers were intimately familiar with the type of attack that SolarWinds fell victim to because they had spent years building internal systems at Google to prevent it. Dan and team would end up working closely with engineers from SolarWinds to help them do the same. (The following year, when Chainguard held a conference to announce its launch, a SolarWinds engineer spoke about how instrumental Lorenc’s team had been in designing its new security system.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question of how to entirely prevent these attacks remained: When programs are built on hundreds of thousands of lines of open-source code, how do you ensure that every line is as advertised and secure? It’s a problem so large in scale that it feels almost impossible to figure out. Luckily, that’s kind of Lorenc’s thing.</p>



 



<p>Lorenc’s love of solving difficult problems began when he was a kid, fixing up damaged stock cars with his grandfather. They’d spend hours after school and on weekends tinkering together in a small garage. Once the cars were up and running, Lorenc’s grandfather (and after he got his license, Lorenc himself) would race them in community events. When the cars would break down, they would take inventory of the problems and fix them up again. This was the part Lorenc loved most—looking at the engine as a system of parts, understanding how each one functioned and then using that knowledge to fix what wasn’t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In college, Lorenc pursued mechanical engineering. During his junior year he took a programming class and was hooked. “I was building stuff, but it was a lot faster,” Lorenc says. “You didn’t have to order parts and wait a week for them to ship. You could build those components yourself with a laptop, anywhere.” Software engineering offered the same thrill as fixing up old cars. “It’s that loop of trying to solve a problem, and then either seeing it work or seeing it fail miserably and getting to debug it live. You keep going and get real-time feedback until you solve it. That’s why I liked the computer world. I could do more of that in a lot less time.”</p>



<p>One of the first pieces of code he wrote was a program to solve Rubik’s cubes. The program didn’t work—it kept running without ever arriving at a solution. One of his peers laughed when he saw the code and showed Lorenc how to fix it. It was an important moment. “That’s when I realized, with programming, there’s always a solution,” Lorenc says. “It might not be obvious at first, but it’s there. You just have to find it.”</p>



<p>Lorenc began working at Microsoft soon after he graduated college. He remembers the environment as rewarding, but also stressful. There was a weekend when he and his colleagues were working overtime for an upcoming release, and during a particularly tense moment, his manager pantomimed a Monty Python sketch. Lorenc and his team broke into fits of laughter, and the mood instantly brightened. This left an impression on Lorenc: the need for a work environment that balanced hard work with humor.</p>
 



Chainguard founders Kim Lewandowski, Ville Aikas, Dan Lorenc and Matt Moore.



 
<p>“You’re doing what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogomil Balkansky, Chainguard’s partner at Sequoia, sat across the table from Lorenc and Moore, not sure he was hearing them right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months since Moore’s initial text to Lorenc at the restaurant in Austin, Chainguard had officially launched, and its founders had begun building its product and seeking out investors. Lorenc says starting a company at the beginning of 2022 wasn’t easy. Inflation was rising and a wave of layoffs at tech companies meant Lorenc would pitch Chainguard to software engineers—potential customers—one day, only to learn the following week that they had been laid off. After months of meetings, they finally gained traction. The need for supply chain security tools was too great, and companies realized they couldn’t handle the job alone.</p>



<p>Lorenc and the Chainguard team first met with Sequoia in the spring of 2022. Balkansky was impressed by Chainguard’s initial product in development, Chainguard Enforce, a program that scans containers and produces an itemized list of the code inside. Engineers can then review the list for malware and loopholes that might make the containers vulnerable to hackers. And so Balkansky was surprised to learn, just days after Sequoia’s partnership with Chainguard was finalized, that, according to Lorenc, Chainguard was in the midst of building out a far more ambitious product: Chainguard Images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computing, a “container image” refers to a static collection of executable code. Chainguard Images would be a library of these files, made from open-source code that Chainguard engineers would verify, sign, patch and secure. With Chainguard Images, customers would no longer have to opt for open-source code they’d found on the internet and hope for the best. Instead, they could select an image from Chainguard’s library and feel confident that their code was as advertised and could not be edited by bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a massive undertaking, which explained Balkansky’s incredulity when he first learned of it. To execute Chainguard Images, Lorenc and his team would first have to build a Linux distribution, an operating system on which Chainguard Images could run. Balkansky had worked with other companies who had endeavored to do this but hadn’t succeeded; he knew it was an incredibly complex task that could take years to complete, and even then there was no guarantee it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky wasn’t the only one who was skeptical. Other software companies with thousands of engineers struggled to believe that Chainguard, with only 25 engineers, could not only build a Linux distribution, but also comb through and verify numerous libraries of code. “Yes, it seemed impossible,” Lorenc says. “Yes, just based on the sheer numbers, the lines of code we would need to pore over and adjust to make secure, it was daunting. Everyone else looked at it and saw it as too hard of a problem, too massive to actually solve. But it seemed obvious it was something we needed to do.” Lorenc shrugs, “To me, it didn’t seem impossible, it just seemed hard. And I’m okay with hard.”</p>



<p>“Hard” paid off. Lorenc and his team spent a year working tirelessly on Chainguard Images. To motivate and energize his team during long days and even longer nights and weekends, Lorenc pulled from the lesson learned at Microsoft, making sure that hours of focus were interspersed with jokes, lighthearted stories and plenty of room for laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky was sitting in a conference room in early 2023 when Lorenc let him know Chainguard Images was live. Balkansky’s first thought: “Pretty damn impressive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Chainguard has rebuilt around 80% of the open-source code most companies use, and because Chainguard is the only company offering access to this type of library, they’re racing to keep up with demand for the remaining 20%. Chainguard also takes custom orders—if a company needs a certain container specific to their product verified, Chainguard will take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As time consuming and challenging as building out Chainguard Images continues to be, Lorenc recognizes its payoff for users. It’s akin to building a house—yes, you can use cheap and readily available materials for construction and deal with a rickety staircase or a toilet that won’t flush later, but Chainguard’s philosophy is that it’s worth the extra time, money and labor to start with high-quality products. Lorenc believes in taking every measure possible, no matter how complicated it might be, when it comes to keeping software and its users safe.</p>



 



<p>Working in security necessitates a certain amount of paranoia—the fear of what you’ve missed, of an unseen crack or fatal flaw, is relentless. Lorenc’s use of humor to assuage the high-risk, high-anxiety environment has paid off in more ways than one. He regularly makes his own memes, many of which have gone viral within software development communities. One meme shows Ken from the Barbie movie, with the caption “My job is just CVEs.” (CVEs meaning “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.”) Another depicts Ned Stark from “Game of Thrones,” with a caption that reads “Brace yourselves. VEX is coming.” (VEX is an open platform for sharing information about software vulnerabilities.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorenc’s goal in creating memes was originally to provide levity and form a community with people working in security, so he was surprised when his social media presence ended up being one of Chainguard’s most successful marketing strategies. Lorenc regularly sees his memes making rounds on LinkedIn and X, formerly Twitter. Chainguard’s TikToks are also popular among engineers, many of which feature Lorenc, in his trademark backward baseball cap, speaking to viewers as though he was guiding a friend through a casual tutorial on software security. Lorenc attributes the love for Chainguard’s social media to his users’ desire for authenticity. He’s not some faceless CEO of a corporation; he’s a software engineer, just like his customers, and he speaks their language. It’s not a traditional avenue for a security company to market itself, but Chainguard has always done things its own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his numerous duties as CEO, Lorenc’s favorite part of the job is still working with other engineers to solve complex and granular problems. He thinks Chainguard was able to attract some of the best engineers in the industry precisely because the company has such lofty goals. “The people on our team were drawn to the difficulty of our mission,” he says. “Smart people want to work on hard problems.” Often when people encounter what seems like an impossible series of problems, they get overwhelmed, but not Lorenc. He knows every inch of this engine, and working on it part by part, he’s confident he can get it to run.</p>

<p>“Everything is theoretically impossible, until it is done.” —Robert A. Heinlein, American science-fiction writer and aeronautical engineer</p>
<p>Modern medicine is full of awe-inspiring progress, but also many humbling limitations. In the face of these limitations, innovators have consistently propelled entirely new classes of drugs from theoretical concepts that sound like total science fiction (vaccines, antibodies, genetic medicines to reprogram our cells, and more)—into the realm of safe and effective therapies for patients.</p>
 Small molecules: the OGs of the therapeutic arsenal 
<p>Amidst all this rapid progress, small molecules—the original heroes of the therapeutic arsenal, the original enablers of the “pill” form of drugs we all have in our medicine cabinets—continue to represent ~60% of all new FDA approvals. Small molecules are fantastical in their own right: they are typically orally bioavailable, conveniently administered, cheaper to manufacture, and distribute well throughout many tissues in our bodies (including the brain). They are also most widely accessible to patients: drugs like aspirin, penicillin, statins, and tamoxifen have had tremendous impact on billions of patients globally.</p>
<p>Now, ushered forward by a wave of new and enabling technologies, the field of small molecule discovery is undergoing nothing short of a <a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/small-molecule-drug-discovery-having/101/i36#">renaissance</a>. Important classes of targets, however—including thousands of extracellular and secreted protein targets—remain challenging for small molecules to effectively address. This is where Gate Bio comes in.</p>
 Gate Bio: engineering cell biology to build a novel class of medicines 
<p>Gate Bio is building a new class of small molecules called Molecular Gates. While most small molecule drugs bind and inhibit the disease-causing activity of their (typically intracellular) protein targets, Gate Bio instead attacks harmful extracellular proteins by eliminating them at their very root: right where they are produced and secreted from the cell. The secretion of ‘bad-actor’ proteins can drive conditions like neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, cancer, and more: what if we could design small molecules to stop them (“gate” them) from being secreted in the first place—before they even have a chance to cause disease?</p>
<p>To do this, the founders at Gate Bio had a clever idea: to exploit the biology of the single, shared channel through which all ~4000 secreted human proteins must make their journey out of the cell. To visualize this mechanism, go all the way back to high school biology and recall that squiggly, ribosome-lined organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Remember learning that it functions as the cell’s manufacturing and transportation apparatus? Well, this is because getting important secretory proteins (peptide hormones, receptors, cytokines, etc) across the cell’s membrane (a lipid bilayer) from inside the cell to outside is no easy task—and nature has evolved a tightly choreographed dance to make this happen. Central in this sequence is the ER, and specifically a channel within the ER called the secretory translocon, through which all newly synthesized secretory proteins coming off a ribosome must pass in order to enter the ER, fold properly, and ultimately exit the cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the scientific community gained greater insight into the structure and function of the secretory translocon, Gate Bio’s founders began creatively designing Molecular Gates to bind this translocon and specifically block disease-causing proteins (but not healthy proteins) from exiting the channel. Once a disease protein is ‘gated’ from exiting the channel, it has nowhere to go, and then—as if in a stroke of elegant science fiction!—it gets degraded by the cell’s already existing, natural cleanup machinery. Behold!</p>
<p>If Molecular Gates could be engineered for many high-value targets, they could represent a massive new drug class for extracellular protein targets, with a fundamentally new mechanism of action in the cell—a rare feat in biotech. This vision got us excited, in part because we’ve seen other novel drug classes in recent years (e.g. molecular glues, PROTACs, splice modulators, and more), and each new class has proven that new mechanisms of action can unlock previously inaccessible targets that are important in human disease. Inventing a new modality is also one of the best ways to endow an otherwise lean biotech startup team with a massive moat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a16z, we love platform biotech companies, and Gate Bio’s platform has a particularly unique feature that we couldn’t resist. Molecular Gate medicines, no matter the target, share a common mechanism of action: gating that secretory translocon. This means that every technology that gets built at the company, every problem solved, and insight uncovered—actually makes all our future programs smarter. Gate Bio is building the platform to screen, design, systematically characterize, and optimize Molecular Gates. And it’s truly a self-reinforcing, always-learning engine that is getting better every day.</p>
 An inventive ensemble of builders 
<p>I have known Jordi Mata-Fink, cofounder and CEO of Gate Bio, for nearly two decades. We went to college at Stanford together, and were even lucky enough to live in the same hallway of the same dorm community (shout out to “FroSoCo” nerds everywhere)! What I remember most from then was Jordi’s massive smile, his excitement when describing an engineering problem, and the way in which people gravitated towards him. Our paths crossed again when we were both in grad school at MIT, and then Jordi subsequently joined a biotech venture incubator in the Boston ecosystem where he helped build and lead several new companies. He has always loved both science and people, and so when he called to say he was starting a biotech company and raising Seed financing, I knew I wanted to be involved.</p>
<p>Raman Talwar (Gate Bio cofounder) and I first met in the context of another exciting company that he helped start a few years ago—where I learned that he has an infectious “Yes, why not?” personality that always makes people want to try and jump even higher. Raman is endlessly and authentically curious, a quality which, when combined with his personal magnetism, makes him a hub for the creative synthesis of new ideas and (perhaps more importantly for a young company) the creative assembly of new people.</p>
<p>And finally, it’s been a joy to work with Pat Sharp, cofounder and the original chemistry brains behind the Gate Bio operation. Pat co-led <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01326-1">academic work on chemically perturbing the secretory translocon</a> at UCSF and then did a tour of duty in big pharma at Merck before jumping into Gate to lead the development of our chemistry and experimental science platform. He is super smart, wonderfully kind, and explains even the most complex chemistry in a soothing Australian accent.</p>
<p>I suspect the founders would say that they are most proud of the amazing team they have recruited around themselves. The Gate Bio team – still small but mighty – is a special ensemble of talent. They are deeply motivated by patient experience, and willing to tread in new waters. They aren’t afraid to build new tools and new ways of measuring the impact of a Molecular Gate, but are also keen to learn from the experience of previously ‘new’ modalities. I can feel the urgency of ‘patients are waiting’ in every interaction with this team, and it is thus such a privilege to be co-leading Gate Bio’s Series A financing and joining their board. We are also thrilled to be working with great friends at Versant Ventures, GV, and ARCH. Please reach out if you’re interested in <a href="https://www.gatebio.com/">joining this team</a> of pioneers!</p>

<p>One of the most common pricing questions we get from late-stage SaaS companies is: should we switch to a usage-based pricing model (also known as consumption-based pricing)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, these companies have an existing subscription model, and usage-based pricing sounds like it would further align their incentives with their customers’. After all, the more their customers use their product, the more revenue they capture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just because usage-based pricing has worked for other companies doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll work for yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our rule of thumb: usage-based pricing generally works best for SaaS products whose end user is other software, while subscription-based models tend to work best for SaaS products with human end users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is usually because software-to-human products make employees more productive (through collaboration, training, etc.), while software-to-software products tend to power their customers’ products or internal systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With software-to-software products, customers want to get access to the products, start using it, and only pay for what they use. These products typically have great product telemetry data, so it’s easy for these companies to set up processes that track, bill, and even cap that usage—which ultimately leads to smoother adoption processes, strong net dollar retention, and a robust land-and-expand motion.</p>
<p>But what removes friction for software-to-software customers actually creates friction for software-to-human customers. The average enterprise has over 100 SaaS apps, and no human user wants to monitor their usage to make sure their IT spend doesn’t surge past a given limit. Individual users also don’t like to be nickel-and-dimed for what they use: imagine if a CRM charged sales reps every time they created an opportunity! That’s why software with human end users typically benefits from subscription models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s also a natural limit to how much a human user will consume a certain amount of software: they can only watch so many training videos or create so many collaborative documents. Use of software-to-software products, like code testing or data transfer, can grow exponentially, however, so usage-based pricing can better capture the value of those kinds of workloads.</p>
<p>And from a vendor perspective, software-to-software products also generally have a higher marginal cost of service than software-to-human products, so charging by usage sets up stronger unit economics that can cover those costs. Imagine the converse: you run an infrastructure company that bills by subscription and, all of the sudden, your customers’ usages skyrocket—it becomes much less cost-effective to serve them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t a hard-and-fast rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we’ve outlined an either/or logic above, in reality, pricing is often a spectrum. We often see companies offer hybrid subscription-and-usage pricing models depending on their cost structures, customer needs, or the nature of their product. Our rule of thumb should help you figure out whether to emphasize subscription or usage in your pricing model. And of course, AI is rapidly changing software, how we use it, and how we monetize and charge for it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of questions you’ll need to answer if you want to implement usage-based pricing in your business: how can you best predict usage for both you and your customers? What’s the role of your salesforce? How will you compensate your reps? How do you need to set up your company in order to operationalize a usage model? We’ll touch on all of these topics in forthcoming posts, but this rule of thumb should be a good first step in figuring out if switching to a usage-based model is something you want to consider.</p>

This partnership will integrate the Nym mixnet into the NEAR ecosystem, providing unparalleled privacy to all traffic transmitted across the blockchain — allowing users to access their favourite NFTs, DeFi protocols, and dApps away from the prying eyes of malicious actors like cyber-criminals.</p><p>NEAR Protocol is a leading layer 1 blockchain that operates with many ‘shards’, each acting like its own independent blockchain. Because transactions take place independently of one another, NEAR Protocol is able to provide ultra-high speed, throughput, and scale to projects in its ecosystem.</p><p>Earlier this year, the NEAR Protocol unveiled the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.) to create the ideal entry point of the Open Web, and to seamlessly bridge the gap between web 2.0 and Web3. B.O.S. addresses critical challenges around building frontends for Web3 apps, including access, security, composability, and time to market. With B.O.S., the code for Components is permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, version control, and easy exploration.</p><p>The NEAR ecosystem supported Nym early in its development path via Nym’s participation in the Open Web Collective in 2021, a Web3 incubator sponsored by the NEAR Foundation.</p><p>However, the open, transparent nature of public permissionless blockchains means that transaction data is visible to anyone who cares to look, and even off-chain information like IP addresses and geolocation data can be vulnerable to being exposed. This opens users and validators up to surveillance, targeted attacks, and cyber&nbsp;crime.</p><p>Nym and the NEAR Foundation share the same vision for the future of privacy in Web3. The future of the internet can only take shape successfully provided that it is private, and does not repeat the same mistakes of the legacy internet — namely, monopoly, surveillance, and putting user privacy at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>“Blockchain technology is a large change in digital communications but it’s an open secret that by their very nature, blockchains are not private,” said Harry Halpin, cofounder and CEO at Nym Technologies. “Only weaving privacy into the fabric of Web3 can ensure its success. Nym is highly modular and the mixnet can be plugged into any blockchain, giving users and builders the confidence that they’re not being tracked and followed across the internet or painting targets on themselves for cyber criminals.”</p><p>To make this vision a reality, the Nym mixnet will integrate into NEAR Protocol to encrypt and cloak traffic across the whole ecosystem. By masking off-chain metadata traffic, not only is transaction data protected in transit, but this makes it much more difficult for adversaries to de-anonymise users via their public IP addresses.</p><p>To protect these traffic patterns from analysis, the Nym mixnet splits data into identical encrypted packets and disperses these in three hops to ‘mix nodes’ worldwide via the mixnet. Cover traffic is then inserted into the mix at randomised times to further obfuscate the nature of the communication. This makes tracking metadata patterns impossible, even for powerful adversaries with a global view of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Chris Donovan, CEO of the NEAR Foundation said: “Privacy is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of the Web3 vision to create a more secure, user-centric and user-empowered web. We are proud to support Nym and its innovative technology, which will help developers and users across the NEAR ecosystem maintain their privacy.”</p><p>By integrating the Nym mixnet into any ecosystem, partners can have confidence that their developers, operators, and users are able to enjoy real privacy, shielding them from surveillance and cyber criminals.</p><p>The Nym mixnet is layer-0 privacy infrastructure: it is chain-agnostic and can be integrated into any blockchain to obscure traffic, protect privacy, and secure users and validators. By partnering with Nym, Near joins other Web3 projects like <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/new-mixnet-integration-nym-for-monero-f0a3068e803f">Monero</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-partners-with-aztec-to-provide-integral-infrastructure-privacy-in-ethereum-chains-694963c55192">Aztec</a>.</p><p>For more information about Nym please visit <a href="https://nymtech.net/">https://nymtech.net/</a></p><p>About Nym Technologies</p><p>Nym Technologies is a trailblazing leader in privacy and blockchain technology. With a mission to empower individuals and organizations with privacy-enhancing solutions, Nym develops cutting-edge technology that conceals sensitive data and enhances digital privacy. Backed by visionary investors and renowned validators, Nym Technologies is at the forefront of a more private and secure digital&nbsp;future.</p><p>About NEAR Foundation:</p><p>NEAR Foundation is a non-profit that supports the growth and development of the NEAR ecosystem and the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.), a full stack Web3 development and app distribution platform at the heart of an open web.

<p>911 call centers –&nbsp;also known as public safety answering points (PSAPs) – are one of the most actively used public-safety infrastructure systems in the United States, fielding an estimated <a href="https://www.nena.org/page/911statistics">240 million calls per year</a>. That’s more than 650,000 per day. These centers act as the first point of engagement between a citizen and the public safety system, and PSAPs are often the conduit between the citizen and the eventual field responders (e.g., police, fire, emergency medicine) who go on-site to help. To say they serve a life-or-death function would be an understatement.</p>
<p>Despite its importance, though, our 911 system is ill equipped to handle many modern emergencies. When someone calls 911, they often don’t speak the same language as the operator, are in situations where speaking cogently to the operator is fraught, or don’t know the necessary details needed for help to arrive.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult for operators to get the information they need from callers, while still keeping callers safe and making them feel comfortable. Information loss can dramatically degrade incident response and resolution. In addition, over <a href="https://www.911.gov/newsletters/issue-14/survey-more-than-half-of-911-centers-face-staffing-crisis/">half of PSAPs nationally</a> are experiencing staffing and labor shortages, and the emotional and physical toll of working in these centers has led to <a href="https://www.iaedjournal.org/keeping-them-in-the-profession">meaningful burnout</a> and turnover among the staff.</p>
<p>We’ve already used software to optimize countless tasks across countless industries, and it’s imperative that first-class software also be built to support one of the most important pieces of our public safety infrastructure. In emergency moments seconds matter, and the right data and context can be a critical determinant in the outcome of the call. That’s why we are so proud to invest in <a href="https://www.prepared911.com/">Prepared</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 911 infrastructure was first rolled out in the United States in the 1960s, when most individuals were calling through landlines. With smartphones now virtually ubiquitous, however, <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/files/documents/bring-wireless-911-rosenworcel.pdf">70% of 911 calls</a> are now made with wireless phones. And smartphones have a wealth of data about a situation that 911 operators should have –&nbsp;GPS location, phone/video access, text capabilities, etc. –&nbsp;but historically these operators have not had an easy way to access that data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prepared is the advanced data layer for 911. They provide operators with real-time data during emergency situations by providing callers with a web-based link to stream live video, share pictures, text, and GPS location to the 911 operators. It also provides real-time translation in more than 140 languages and AI transcription of calls so that operators can seamlessly communicate with the caller while documenting the most important information. Going further, Prepared then allows the 911 operator to share that data as it is coming in with the field responders (e.g., police, fire, emergency medicine) so that they have the full context and can better protect the caller, as well as themselves. Emergency rooms were transformed when ambulances started carrying radios to call ahead and alert an ER about patient status resulting in countless lives saved; the same will be true here where police and emergency responders can get details and live video about a situation in real-time before they arrive at an incident.</p>
<p>We were blown away by the reach Prepared has been able to achieve in a short period of time. Since their founding in 2019, nearly 15% of all 911 centers leverage Prepared, collectively serving more than 75 million Americans.</p>
<p>The customer feedback we received was also glowing. Prepared has spread rapidly, through word-of-mouth, among neighboring law enforcement regions as operators realize the lifesaving benefits of the product and have encouraged neighboring operations centers to adopt it.</p>
<p>It is exceedingly rare to meet a company that achieves that level of reach in public safety — so quickly and with that level of customer love — and it’s a true testament to the Prepared team. Michael Chime, Dylan Gleicher, and Neal Soni are highly mission-driven and passionate about solving this problem. Michael started Prepared in his dorm room after experiencing a shooting in his hometown and took leave after being awarded the Thiel Fellowship to work on Prepared full-time.&nbsp;We are thrilled to be leading their Series A and supporting them as they build out critical infrastructure for our emergency operators. <a href="https://www.prepared911.com/careers">They’re hiring! </a></p>

 Introducing PIVX Perspectives:<br>Engaging conversations with remarkable contributors to the PIVX community. Get ready for insightful dialogues about PIVX’s journey and future. Stay tuned for inspiring stories from various individuals who have played an important role in the PIVX ecosystem. <p>Our first guest is Jeffrey, PIVX Business Development Lead and a key driving force behind the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Can you tell us a little about yourself please?<br>Hey everyone, my name is Jeffrey, I currently live in South Africa but I have also lived in Indonesia and Singapore. I’m an extremely passionate and energetic person when it comes to digital finance and privacy, advocating for secure and efficient financial solutions in a digital age. My academic journey took me to Singapore where I completed my Bachelors in IT with Distinction. During this time is where I became deeply interested in the world of digital finance, as Singapore is a hub for&nbsp;fintech.</p><p>I’ve been a proud member of the PIVX family since early 2017, joining right around the time of the rebrand. It’s been a fortunate journey, allowing me to witness the remarkable growth of the project and actively contribute to its&nbsp;success.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?<br>My cryptocurrency journey goes quite far back and is actually thanks to a stranger, I was part of a social group where people share discounts or deals on servers. Someone wanted to pay on this particular website for a linux VPS but they wanted PayPal. So in return he sent me my first ever Bitcoin and I paid using PayPal. I believe this was back in late 2012 or early 2013. The wallet at the time I used was called MultiBit if I recall correctly. During this time I also experienced so many issues with online payment methods especially since I am from South Africa and many at the time did not provide their services or had lengthy and often privacy invading verification processes. Bitcoin was so fast, I remember being like wow I received this already and didn’t need to register or provide any of my information. My passion grew and I loved superior technology. Sadly I did end up using it as my main payment method for online goods and services lol so could not really enjoy the extreme growth over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>When and why did you choose to get involved with PIVX?<br>Cryptocurrency was starting to go really viral in 2017, It was at this time myself and some online friends were all looking to invest and buy more. The best way to find new cryptocurrencies to invest in at this time was to browse BitcoinTalk. I was lucky enough to find the PIVX post in 2017 on the forum. I read it was a coin dedicated to privacy which piqued my interest. The forum post also provided a Slack invitation link so PIVX ended up being the first cryptocurrency that I joined the official community for. So I guess initially my first finding out about PIVX was for investment purposes however the community was so helpful. I learned so much in just a week there amongst all the “Purple Rain” showers of PIVX tips flying out to everyone. I dedicated so much time that I ended up assisting with the support team by providing technical assistance as well as hosting calls to show people how to trade&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market?<br>For me it’s the human touch. PIVX is the only community where anyone can just join in and discuss openly and share ideas with developers, graphics designers, moderators and others from many backgrounds. PIVX may be a privacy coin but it’s extremely human-centric. What I love most is the aim to redefine privacy to its root. That privacy is not for criminals but simply a human right to protect oneself from malicious parties. PIVX makes this privacy option dubbed “SHIELD” completely optional therefore giving the user complete control over how they spend their PIV. PIVX also is a DAO with a treasury guaranteeing constant development and growth therefore PIVX in my opinion has a stable future and is here to secure your digital financial footprint.</p><p>How do you envision PIVX’s role in the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies?<br>PIVX has an ambassador program as well as community members that are introducing PIVX for the first time to many people, many of which will be their first ever crypto and therefore the beginning of their cryptocurrency journey. PIVX sets a benchmark through their meticulous development process that ensures the safety of their blockchain and privacy protocol.</p><p>This unwavering commitment to user safety and the protection of their assets sets a noteworthy example for other cryptocurrencies to follow almost like a benchmark. By establishing such high standards, PIVX contributes to the creation of a safer and more secure environment for newcomers, ultimately fostering increased adoption.</p><p>Can you share any success stories or notable achievements during your time at PIVX?<br>Honestly my biggest achievement in my cryptocurrency career with PIVX is getting feedback from our community on their experiences with PIVX and seeing how positive it is. I work as the lead of business development, I secure new listings and integrations. When I come across fellow Pivians enthusiastically sharing how they’ve started accepting PIVX through platforms like NowPayments, booked flights on Travala using PIVX, or found joy in trading on exchanges such as WhiteBit and LBank, it represents the pinnacle of success for me. More recently, learning how PIVX is enabling our community to make a difference by assisting families in need through the purchase of gift cards on Coinsbee is both humbling and inspiring. It’s not just about me, it’s about the collective impact my decisions make and how they can help others. I hope all my work and achievements combined empowers our community and fellow PIVX holders to explore new possibilities with&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>How do you approach building strong relationships with exchange platforms and integrating PIVX into their trading systems?<br>I begin this first with market research, identifying areas that we lack. For example an exchange that doesn’t require KYC or perhaps provides GBP withdraws to a bank, Once I establish a decent list of exchanges that provide our needs I proceed to contact&nbsp;them.</p><p>The most important thing is a mutual understanding of the objective. Once we establish that we would like a relationship that is more than just trading PIVX but actually engaging with both communities and building together then I can proceed to discuss listings. Exchanges and cryptocurrencies work hand in hand in securing the future of Crypto. Not everyone supports centralised exchanges however it is thanks to them that cryptocurrency is thriving and vice versa. If an exchange wants to foster a relationship that involves us potentially collaborating on future marketing events or conferences then this is a good sign. If an exchange simply wants a listing fee and nothing more then that is a red flag in my&nbsp;book.</p><p>Obviously I will always advise anyone to do their own research on the exchange before trading however if an exchange is positive and wants to highlight the growth of PIVX and be apart of it, I will do my part by making this known to our communities and giving them the thanks they deserve as well as collaboration on any marketing from our&nbsp;side.</p><p>Thank you for reading our PIVX perspectives, stay tuned for more exciting insights and future&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/introducing-pivx-perspectives-engaging-conversations-with-remarkable-contributors-to-the-pivx-bcc9f0698ed8">Introducing PIVX Perspectives:

<p>Introduction:<br>In the world of cryptocurrency, liquidity plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and efficient trading. PIVX has experienced significant improvements in liquidity thanks to the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on Binance. Over the past seven weeks, this program has not only enhanced trading opportunities but also increased the chances of reintroducing a USDT pair on the exchange.</p><p>Enhanced Liquidity on Binance:<br>Since the launch of the <a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/market/76?snapshotTimestamp=1698515760000&amp;interval=1">Hummingbot Liquidity Program, </a>PIVX has witnessed a notable improvement in liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance. The sufficient liquidity provided by HummingBot has allowed for a more stable market that meets the supply and demand of services such as payment gateways that use Binance as an exchange. Sufficient liquidity provides a better market for traders and service providers.</p><p>Positive Results and Future Prospects:<br>During the campaign, Hummingbot miners have traded over $1.5 million worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair. The campaign has consistently ranked among the top three in terms of performance, with an average of 15.5 active bots, $9.93k in open order volume, and $35.1k in daily filled order volume. These figures account for nearly 6% of the total traded volume for PIVX/BTC on&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>The success of the campaign has prompted a proposal to extend it for another eight weeks on the PIVX/BTC pair. If this extension proves fruitful, there are plans to introduce a longer campaign with increased rewards in both PIVX and HBOT tokens, the native crypto of Hummingbot.</p>First 8 weeks of Hummingbot Liquidity Program on&nbsp;Binance.<p>About Hummingbot:<br><a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/">Hummingbot</a>, developed by the Hummingbot Foundation, is an open-source market-making bot that aims to democratize high-frequency trading. It provides a platform for token projects, trading firms, and individual traders to own their liquidity and earn rewards through liquidity mining. Hummingbot has evolved from a simple market-making bot into a powerful platform that allows users to create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots running various trading strategies.</p><p>The Importance of Liquidity:<br>Liquidity is a crucial metric for financial assets and trading venues. Traditionally, market making, the provision of liquidity, has been limited to a few participants such as quantitative hedge funds and large financial institutions. However, the Hummingbot Liquidity Program enables anyone to become a market maker and contribute to liquidity provision in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>A Marketplace-Based Approach:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program takes a marketplace-based approach to promote consistent liquidity provision, improve matching efficiency, and mitigate the risk of manipulative practices. Inspired by successful two-sided digital marketplaces in other industries, this approach tackles the liquidity fragmentation problem in the crypto market, benefiting both exchanges and token&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program has proven to be highly beneficial for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX</a>, enhancing liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance and fostering increased trading opportunities. With impressive results and a positive outlook for the future, continuing the program will contribute to the long-term growth and success of PIVX. By leveraging the power of Hummingbot and its marketplace-based approach, PIVX can further strengthen its position in the crypto market and attract more liquidity providers, ultimately supporting a USDT pair too, perhaps with its own Hummingbot Liquidity Program, benefiting all stakeholders involved</p>Miners on Hummingbot have traded over 1.5 million dollars worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair during the first campaign. <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-beneficial-impact-of-the-hummingbot-liquidity-program-on-pivx-b2cd2734b75e">The Beneficial Impact of the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

<p>We are excited to announce the official mainnet launch of <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/">Horizen EON</a>, Horizen’s fully EVM-compatible sidechain and smart contracting platform. Developed and powered by Horizen, Horizen EON is poised to play a pivotal role in the web3 revolution. Horizen’s goal is to offer a market-leading solution to drive the industry forward – a permissionless, interoperable, customizable multi-chain network with EON being the first of many smart contracting sidechains on Horizen that will onboard the next generation of builders and users to the web3 economy!</p>



 Why Build on Horizen EON? 



<p>Horizen EON (Ethereum Open Network ) is a scalable blockchain platform optimized for streamlined and diverse dapp development. It is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, leveraging Ethereum’s vast resources and community for easy and seamless dapp deployment on Horizen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Ethereum has been driving broad adoption of DeFi ecosystems and smart contracts, Horizen has been developing its ZK-powered cross-chain protocol and horizontal scaling solution, <a href="https://www.horizen.io/zendoo/">Zendoo</a>, that allows a wider adoption of blockchain technology with full customization at the protocol level. With the addition of Horizen EON, Horizen now also opens its fast-growing ecosystem up to more opportunities for efficient development and usage of a wide range of dApps and services than ever before.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ZBF_EVM_mainnet-build-on-EON.jpg"></a> 




 Horizen EON’s mission is to empower the next generation of Web3 developers 



<p>Focus: Horizen EON is dedicated to nurturing the next wave of Web3 developers. These are innovators eager to introduce groundbreaking web3 products, but are hindered by the limitations of existing chains, such as inadequate tooling, network congestion, centralization, and lack of growth support.</p>



<p>The EON Ecosystem: Horizen EON is committed to establishing a robust ecosystem tailored for visionaries aiming to challenge and replace the status quo by offering best-in-class launch and growth support including :</p>



 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Comprehensive toolings that ensure seamless integrations and dapp deployment&nbsp; 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Business development assistance 



 &nbsp;&nbsp;Access to liquidity, grants, and more. 
 



<p>The EON Identity: Horizen EON also positions itself to be the new hub for consumer dapps aimed at bridging the Web2 – Web3 divide. This ambitious goal is supported by EON’s hands-on approach to crafting an ecosystem optimized for everyday users. The EON platform is designed to provide both the technical infrastructure and a nurturing environment for builders, complete with product support and incubation.</p>



 The EON Launch is Joined by a Vibrant Range of Protocol Integrations and Partnerships

  Partnering with Chkk: Your Kubernetes Co-Pilot  <p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are helping devops catch problems before they lead to downtime.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published October 25, 2023
  



Awais, Bogomil, Fawad and Ali at Sequoia.



 
<p>If you’re building an application hosted in the cloud today, there’s a very good chance it’s running on Kubernetes. In fact, a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) found an impressive 96% of organizations using or evaluating K8s—and as ever-more business-critical apps land on the platform, its uptime and availability have become a top concern for Platform Engineering, SRE and DevOps teams. But some of Kubernetes’ main strengths, its flexibility and its vibrant ecosystem of add-ons, come with a price: complexity. Navigating the multiple configs and tracking intricate dependencies, across multiple layers and multiple add-on solutions, is not for the light-hearted. A typical Kubernetes footprint is not a single platform or product; rather, it is a complex environment built using components from add-ons in the CNCF ecosystem, many of them open source, and some of them commercial products. Each add-on has its own release and upgrade schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seams between these products are where failures most often occur, and most current tooling is designed to address problems after the fact—meaning devops and SREs get stuck in fire-fighting mode. This reactive troubleshooting is both painful and resource-intensive, with even mundane config changes and upgrades taking a lot of time and effort.</p>



<p>But what if you could add a proactive tool to your toolbelt, to warn you about potential issues—and help you fix them—before they ever lead to downtime? That tantalizing possibility is now a reality with <a href="https://www.chkk.io/">Chkk</a>, a first-of-its-kind platform that allows enterprises to identify and address availability risks and upgrade their Kubernetes deployments safely, quickly and with confidence. Think of it like the X-ray that diagnoses your health issue early on—so it doesn’t land you in the ER.</p>



<p>Chkk co-founders Awais Nemat, Fawad Khaliq and Ali Khayam took inspiration from best practices in cybersecurity, where security vulnerabilities are reported publicly. Similarly, Chkk is building a database of availability risks by tracking the behavior of hundreds of Kubernetes projects. Powered by this innovative Collective Learning technology, the platform then continuously scans your environment to find and prioritize risks and prevent disruptions—and even creates pre-verified plans to reduce upgrade time from weeks to days. Teams learn from other’s mistakes so they don’t repeat them, and developers spend far less of their valuable time putting out fires.</p>



<p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are a founding dream team who worked together for more than a decade, including at AWS and on the team that built Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and they understand the challenges Platform, SRE and DevOps teams are facing firsthand. Now, they’re on a mission to solve those same problems for all developers, and we at Sequoia are thrilled to support them and lead this seed round. With their Kubernetes Availability Platform now in general availability and with more infrastructure teams adopting Kubernetes every day, we believe this is just the beginning—for Chkk’s growing team, and for the indispensable technology they’re building.</p>

 Noir comes to the&nbsp;browser! <p>Today we’re releasing NoirJS- a Javascript package for <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> developers who want to build real applications that generate zero knowledge proofs in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>Web development within the Noir ecosystem has historically been, uhm, complex. Practically, that meant Noir developers couldn’t really build applications that ran in the browser. And we want people to build applications with our software!</p> Y u no&nbsp;browser <p>A browser is an application used to access the World Wide Web and interact with Internet applications. It turns out most people like using browsers.</p><p>Before today, Noir didn’t really let you build applications that could run in-browser. Instead, developers were forced to run applications locally in a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>In simple terms, that meant Noir couldn’t actually support real applications.</p><p>But now Noir does support applications with&nbsp;NoirJS.</p><p>The goals of NoirJS are&nbsp;simple:</p>  Enable Noir applications to work in web&nbsp;browsers  Simplify package management  Improve DevEx from “oh God” to “oh&nbsp;good”   Reminder on what Noir&nbsp;is <p>Noir is a zero knowledge circuit-writing language that works with multiple crypto proving back-ends. That means the front-end (the language) remains the same but Noir can be modularized to support the latest and greatest in zero knowledge proving research.</p><p>We do this through the ACIR (abstract circuit intermediate representation). Learn more about the ACIR&nbsp;<a href="https://noir-lang.org/#whats-new-about-noir">here</a>.</p><p>NoirJS lets developers build around the core concept of client-side compute: the ability to harness user hardware-phones, laptops, tablets-through the browser in order to compute proofs of execution.</p><p>And client-side compute in turn allows for fully private and trustless blockchain systems.</p><p>…sound familiar??</p><p>That’s the core philosophy of Aztec-giving developers the tools to develop programs with private data and compute while remaining fully trustless.</p>  Users download encrypted data  They decrypt and manipulate the data locally (unbeknownst to anyone&nbsp;else)  They furnish a proof of computational correctness  They submit the&nbsp;proof  <p>In English: do blockchain things without anyone knowing! Cool,&nbsp;right?</p><p>And for developers’ convenience, NoirJS is packaged with Barretenberg-the same Plonkish backend used by <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Labs</a> in the Aztec rollup. No need to go shopping for a proving system unless you like, really want&nbsp;to.</p> Quality of Life Improvements <p>NoirJS does a lot of other things, too! Developers were previously burdened by the need to manage multiple components like `bb.js`, `acvm`, `noirc_abi`, and future components like `noir_wasm`.</p><p>But managing component libraries and balancing version compatibility is not our idea of&nbsp;fun.</p><p>To install NoirJS you simply run `npm i @noir-lang/noir_js` in your Javascript directory</p><p>Install your proving backend of choice (ahem, probably Barretenberg), and you’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>NoirJS handles all Noir dependencies, exposing them through one clean interface, allowing you to focus on building rather than fiddling with packages.</p><p>Here are some other advantages:</p><p>Immediate Access: Browser-based applications don’t require additional software, making it easier for developers to reach a wider audience.</p><p>Improved User Experience: By enabling Noir functionality in the browser, users can interact with applications in real-time. That means fast&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Enhanced Security: Operating in the browser allows for client-side cryptography, offering an additional layer of security for applications that require cryptographic proofs.</p><p>Developer Flexibility: NoirJS enables developers to build rich, client-side applications with cryptographic functions, providing a broader toolkit for web development.</p><p>Community Building: Browser-based Noir enables rapid prototyping and sharing among the developer community. This is especially useful for teams who focus on in-browser applications and use-cases.</p><p>In-Browser Tooling: NoirJS fits seamlessly with in-browser IDEs like VSCode for web, allowing for a streamlined development process in which Noir programs can be compiled and proven directly in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>So to summarize, by bringing Noir to the browser,&nbsp;we’re:</p>  simplifying development  expanding the scope and capabilities of what can be built with&nbsp;Noir  <p>Siiick.</p> Use-Cases and Applications <p>Less development pain means more time for building new applications. Here are some use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see:</p>  Pseudonymous identity web apps: Projects like <a href="https://www.noxx.xyz/">Noxx</a> are focused on building pseudonymous identity web&nbsp;apps.  In-browser ZK games: Tonk.gg’s NES emulator <a href="https://tonk-gg.github.io/dappicom-site/">Dappicom</a> can now incorporate Noir functionalities seamlessly.  Proof of solvency: prove solvency or liquidity without exposing the underlying assets or&nbsp;trades  On-chain poker: play poker with its hidden card dynamics without a trusted third&nbsp;party  zkEmail: decentralized e-mail with no trusted&nbsp;servers   Conclusion <p>NoirJS lets you build real Noir applications that run in the browser. It also makes your life easy breezy beautiful CoverGirl.</p><p>If you don’t know what Noir is, read <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge/">this announcement</a>, scan <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">these docs</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AHsyRkd2is&amp;ab_channel=ETHGlobal">this&nbsp;video</a>.</p><p>If you do know what Noir is, install NoirJS <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right&nbsp;now</a>.</p><p>And if you end up building something cool, <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">come ask us for&nbsp;money</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://aztec.network/blog/announcing-noirjs-noir-applications-in-your-browser">https://aztec.network</a> on October 25,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-noirjs-privacy-preserving-zk-applications-in-your-browser-d7d78692f15a">Announcing NoirJS: Privacy-Preserving ZK Applications In Your Browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Decentralised applications will only become the future of the web if the people using them can be confident their activity is private and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>This initial proof of concept shows promising potential for how the mixnet can be plugged in to broader open source wallet protocols, guarding transactions between wallets and dApps against surveillance.</p><p>On the dApp side, this exploratory integration is based on the <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/migration-from-v1.x/dapps#ethereum-provider">Ethereum-provider</a> tool, while for the wallets, the integration protects the <a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/advanced/migration-from-v1.x/wallets">WalletConnect TypeScript SDK for browser-based wallets</a>.</p><p>Please note that this is not an end-user integration with full privacy protections, but merely scoping out the possibilities of a future integration. It is a feasibility exercise, forked from the original WalletConnect repo. This proposal includes linking via Node Package Manager, while the chosen dApp uses conventional WalletConnect integration. Relying on this integration for privacy protections is risky for two major&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Not all dApps integrate WalletConnect in the same&nbsp;way  The forked repo is already behind the upstream in terms of commits, creating heavy incompatibility issues.  <p>However, the integration does work and therefore its logic is sound, paving the way for more formalised, official integrations to&nbsp;come.</p><p>If you are a developer and keen to try this integration yourself, here are the&nbsp;steps:</p><p>1. Pick a wallet and application from the 180 wallets and 450 dApps that currently work with WalletConnect.</p><p>2. Download the source code of that wallet and&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>3. Download <a href="https://github.com/Huntsekkern/walletconnect-utils-nym/tree/master">walletconnect-utils-nym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Huntsekkern/walletconnect-monorepo-nym">walletconnect-monorepo-nym</a>.</p><p>4. Run ‘npm link’ on every modified package to create a local, importable version.</p><p>5. If the wallet and the dApp rely on the WalletConnect TS SDK and Ethereum-provider, the integration was designed with these tools in mind. Skip step&nbsp;6.</p><p>6. If the wallet and/or the dApp do not rely on WalletConnect TS SDK or Ethereum-provider but a third-party library, go ahead and download the intermediary libraries. Run npm link as required for those intermediaries.</p><p>7. Run ‘npm install’ first for the wallet and&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>8. Update the dependencies in the source code of the wallet and dApp to use the Nym-powered version, for instance, nym-ethereum-provider or nym-web3wallet.</p><p>9. Link the nym-enabled dependencies by running ‘npm link nym-package-name-1&nbsp;… nym-package-name-n’</p><p>10. Optional step: update parameters downflow to include Nym&nbsp;ports.</p><p>11. Run one Nym client on the wallet device. The default port for the Nym client should be&nbsp;1970.</p><p>12. Run two Nym clients on the dApp. The default ports for those Nym clients should be 1977 and&nbsp;1990.</p><p>13. Run the Nym-enabled dApp and the Nym-enabled wallet.</p><p>14. That’s&nbsp;it!</p><p>Keep an eye out on this blog and Nym socials for more integration news.

<p>Recommitting to open-source security</p><p>Today we’re announcing that as a result of Aztec Labs’ full investigation into a vulnerability in <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, we have paid $450,000 to a whitehat independent security researcher through our Immunefi bug bounty&nbsp;program.</p><p>On September 12th, independent security researcher <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> discovered a vulnerability in Aztec Connect, Aztec Labs’ zkRollup system designed to enhance privacy in DeFi operations.</p><p>Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Aztec’s team moved swiftly to mitigate any potential damage, temporarily restricting public access to the affected workflow.</p><p>The team has conducted a full technical postmortem, the result of which you can view&nbsp;here:</p><p><a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug">https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/claim-proof-bug</a></p><p>We remain extremely committed to open-source software development, and see the treatment of this vulnerability as further evidence of the robustness of the open source community.</p><p>As a reminder, Aztec Labs will no longer support its first-party front-end <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> after March, 2024. Users are reminded and urged to withdraw funds as soon as possible by navigating to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a>.</p><blockquote>💸 Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>.</blockquote> Summary <p>At the heart of the issue was the computation related to determining a user’s output from an intended DeFi interaction-in other words, the funds a user gets back after initiating a transaction within Aztec Connect. Due to this oversight, a malicious sequencer-and only a malicious sequencer-could exploit this computation via Aztec Connect’s escape hatch, a mechanism for individuals to exit funds directly to L1 Ethereum.</p><p>The primary challenge emanated from the inherent complexities of executing integer arithmetic within ZK circuits. These circuits are designed to operate over finite fields, making integer operations particularly tricky.</p><p>The crux of the problem was tied to the system’s handling of integer division and the subsequent remainders. In the absence of proper constraints, a sequencer could manipulate the `user_output` value, adjusting the remainder to ensure the primary equation still held true. This opened up avenues for multiple valid decompositions for a single value, making it a target for exploitation.</p><p>The remedy involved introducing stringent constraints to ensure a consistent and direct mapping between the original values and their decomposed counterparts. Furthermore, to prevent any undue advantage to the sequencer, the remainder value was also carefully constrained.</p><p>This incident with Aztec Connect serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and potential pitfalls inherent in developing large-scale projects, even with extensive auditing. It underscores the necessity for continuous scrutiny, highlighting the invaluable role of bug bounty programs in maintaining the security and reliability of such&nbsp;systems.</p> Conclusion <p>Our $450,000 bug bounty payment to <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> is our largest ever, and a reiteration of our commitment to open source software development.</p><p>We appreciate him and the broader ZK community for maintaining a high degree of vigilance over complex crypto&nbsp;systems.</p><p>We strongly encourage all users of <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and third party Aztec Connect products to withdraw funds as soon as possible. Support for <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> will be sunset in March 2024, after which individuals will have to withdraw funds by running their own sequencers.</p>  Navigate to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> to withdraw&nbsp;funds  Read our full technical breakdown <a href="https://hackmd.io/OrsPExbWTJaJAX5A8dCvGw">here</a>  Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztec-connect-postmortem/">https://aztec.network</a> on October 24,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-labs-announces-our-largest-ever-bug-bounty-of-450-000-434ab2477b3a">Aztec Labs Announces Our Largest-Ever Bug Bounty Of $450,000</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Even huge technology companies are making privacy central to their marketing, and Fortune Business Insights<a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/data-privacy-software-market-105420"> expects the value of the worldwide data privacy market to reach US$30 billion by&nbsp;2030</a>.</p><p>There’s clearly ample opportunity for new ideas, business models, and community projects to spring into action. The antiquated surveillance economic model of the internet is ripe for disruption, and ready to be replaced with an anti-surveillance model that respects the digital integrity of&nbsp;people.</p><p>And that is why Nym is proud to announce its ambitious $300 million Innovation Fund will officially open for applications at the beginning of November&nbsp;2023.</p><p>To ensure the health of this new privacy ecosystem, Nym has secured funding commitments from its own investors including Polychain, KR1, Huobi Incubator, Eden Block, and others to support projects that will safeguard privacy in Web3 and beyond by using the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">The Nym Innovation Fund was launched and piloted last year. The website is now live for open applications — head here to learn more and get ready to&nbsp;apply</a>!</p> Nym Innovation Fund: how does it&nbsp;work? <p>This bold initiative follows on from the Community Grants Programme and Nym Shipyard. With a cohort of people graduating with training in digital privacy, the Innovation Fund will support the best squads and ideas, funnelling them through the VC pipeline. Grants will be available through the Innovation Fund, with formalised processes to streamline applications.</p><p>This new grants programme operates on a rolling basis, allowing for continuous submissions and the review of grant applications throughout the year. The aim is to offer flexibility and ongoing opportunities for individuals and teams to participate.</p><p>The programme will open for applications as of November&nbsp;2023.</p><p>This fund will be a crucial catalyst for Web3 builders, developers, communities, and privacy advocates, providing you with the capital to make innovative projects a reality. Already, as part of an initial pilot programme, Nym has helped <a href="https://www.side.one/">Side Protocol</a>, a trustless bridge for Cosmos assets, raise US$1.5&nbsp;million.</p><p>“The Nym Innovation Fund has been an indispensable ally to Side Protocol from our earliest days,” said Shane Qiu, cofounder of Side Protocol. “Their unparalleled advice, technical expertise, and introductions to pivotal investors have profoundly helped shape our trajectory and fortify our resolve. As we advance, the imprint of Nym’s support remains evident in every milestone we achieve.”</p><p>At a time of macro-economic uncertainty, the Nym Innovation Fund also demonstrates Nym’s commitment to Web3 as a force for change — one that jettisons the legacy model of Web 2.0, but that can only succeed if privacy protections are in place for users, builders, and communities.</p><p>In the words of Nym cofounder and CEO Harry Halpin: “Web3 will only succeed as the future of the internet if privacy exists. A new, better, decentralised internet free from monopoly and censorship needs privacy at its very core, or it will replicate the faults of the legacy&nbsp;web.</p><p>“The Nym Innovation Fund is designed to breathe life into good ideas that make privacy a reality in Web3. This groundbreaking programme will ensure the health of the privacy ecosystem but it will also advance the Web3 industry as a whole, providing mentorship and funding during this difficult macroeconomic climate.”</p> Nym Innovation Fund: the&nbsp;process <p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) serves as a formal announcement expressing interest in receiving applications related to a particular project the Nym team would like to see resolved.</p><p>Typically, these RFPs focus on areas Nym considers important, lacking, or unresolved for the ecosystem.</p><p>The focus areas of the initial RFPs&nbsp;are:</p>  Web3 wallets: applications that store private keys, designed to interact with and manage access to decentralised applications (dApps) that can be integrated with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs): a protocol that can be used to retrieve data from a blockchain network or to send transactions to a blockchain network from a dApp and can be integrated with the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  Public Goods Services: essential resources, tooling, libraries, infrastructure, or initiatives that benefit the broader ecosystem and are available to the public as open-source projects. These services play a crucial role in advancing the development, security, and accessibility of Nym as well as decentralised applications (dApps).  <p>If you see an available RFP that aligns with your capabilities, <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">please do submit a grant application</a>!</p><p>Within the application template, there is a dedicated section where you can indicate the specific RFP you are addressing.</p><p>Interested parties should submit proposals that&nbsp;include:</p>  A project overview, including goals and objectives.  A detailed project plan, including milestones and timelines.  Technical specifications and architectural design detailing Nym stack usage and/or integration.  Team qualifications and relevant experience.  A budget breakdown and resource allocation.  Plans for open-source development and community engagement.  <p>Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>  Alignment with Nym Technologies’ mission and&nbsp;goals.

<p>This means that a Zebra-backed lightwalletd server can now query Zebra using the new and updated RPC methods for the Spend before Sync light wallet feature.</p>



<p>One other notable feature released in this version is the ability to enable progress bars in Zebra’s config file. When progress bars are enabled, users will be able to see Zebra’s blocks, transactions and peer connections in their terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would like Zebra users to <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/blob/main/README.md#configuring-progress-bars">test out this new feature</a> and give us feedback on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-progress-bars/44485">forums</a>.</p>

<p>Stablecoins represent a safe haven against crypto’s volatility, allowing participants to remain in the market, without off-ramping to fiat. While the major stablecoins are centrally issued (e.g. USDT, USDC, BUSD), there is a pressing need for an algorithmic variant or a synthetic dollar asset. (DAI is somewhere in between since approximately 50% of its collateral is USDC). After Luna’s collapse, many jumped to point out its design flaws, yet such a concept would be crucial for crypto’s decentralisation and self-sustainability. Arthur Hayes proposed an interesting concept of NAKA synthetic dollar (NUSD), backed by Bitcoin and its inverse perpetual swap short. However, yield generation on $BTC is significantly lower than that of $ETH. A sustainable yield would help balance the cases in which funding rates would be negative (a minority in crypto).</p><p>We were joined by Guy Young, co-founder of Ethena, to discuss the stablecoin landscape and their synthetic eUSD, backed by staked ETH and its inverse perpetual swap.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Guy’s background and founding Ethena  The history of stablecoins  The stablecoin trilemma and transparency  eUSD synthetic dollar mechanics  Ethena’s insurance fund and hedging  Minimising the impact of depegging  Leveraging centralised liquidity while maintaining self custody through MPC  User experience  Risk factors  CEX vs. DEX: liquidity, infrastructure, UX  The potential of fixed return rates  Supply &amp; rates equilibrium  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_">Guy Young on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs">Ethena Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/dust-on-crust-300d4b5cf3ec">Arthur Hayes' article proposing the Naka synthetic dollar</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

    <p>Q3 2023 was full of growth and exciting milestones for the Horizen ecosystem! The Horizen DAO went live and the core team launched the Alpha version of Horizen’s EVM sidechain, EON on mainnet. This alpha launch has activated increased developer activity and&nbsp; BD partnerships – watch out for more news in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>We look forward to another fruitful and productive quarter!</p>
<p></p>
 Launch of the Horizen DAO 
<p></p>
<p>Last month, the Horizen DAO officially launched, marking the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!<br><br><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">Learn more about the Horizen DAO launch in our blog post.</a></p>
 Horizen EON Alpha Launch&nbsp; 
<p>On August 1st, Horizen EON Alpha was activated on mainnet, marking the beginning of the on-boarding phase for launch partners &amp; early builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Horizen EON documentation can be found in our <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">documentation hub</a>, featuring content around different network environments, developing and deploying smart contracts, staking, service providers, and tutorials.</p>
<p>The core team has also worked to release a new software upgrade that adds a new voting power contract for the Horizen DAO governance, improved the node synchronization speed, and enhanced security&nbsp; features.</p>
 Horizen EON Q3 Partnerships and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-wanchain-to-expand-cross-chain-interoperability-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Wanchain Expanding Cross-Chain Interoperability for EON</a></p>
<p>Wanchain is an R&amp;D-focused blockchain interoperability project whose mission is to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized bridges that connect the world’s many siloed blockchain networks.</p>
<p>This collaboration will enhance Horizen EON’s potential by adding it to the roster of chains that users can bridge their funds to using Wanchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-tatum-to-enabling-blockchain-application-development-and-integrations-on-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Tatum Enabling Blockchain Application Development And Integrations On EON</a></p>
<p>This collaboration aims to make it much easier for developers to build using Horizen ecosystem by integrating Tatum’s easy-to-use blockchain development tools and framework. By leveraging Tatum, Horizen EON will offer developers the ability to seamlessly integrate blockchain functionalities into their applications, coded in JavaScript.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-and-pyth-network-join-forces-to-amplify-decentralized-oracle-services-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Pyth Network Amplifying Decentralized Oracle Services For EON</a></p>
<p>Pyth Network is a specialized oracle solution, to provide decentralized oracle services for EON. This collaboration will bring accurate and trusted on-chain market data to EON, empowering developers to enhance their smart contract capabilities and expand the possibilities for DeFi, gaming, and NFT applications.</p>
 Horizen EON Welcomes NTT DATA, Joining The Network As A Certificate Signer Node To Support The Growth And Security Of The EON Network 
<p>Last month, a leading IT service provider and global innovation partner, NTT DATA, is deploying a Horizen EON blockchain Certificate Signer Node on the NTT DATA infrastructure, which will contribute proactively to the credibility, security, and robustness of the Horizen EON network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen EON chain will have a total of 47 certificate signer nodes. These signer nodes provide credibility to the transactions on the EON chain and ensure decentralization. They are responsible for signing backward transfer requests allowing the flow of ZEN from the EON chain to the Horizen mainchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-welcomes-ntt-data-joining-the-network-as-a-certificate-signer-node/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=marketing+EON">Learn more about this announcement here.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Q3 Core Software Releases 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/new-software-release-eon-1-0-0-is-available-to-download-now/">EON 1.0.0 Release</a></p>
 
 EON 1.0.0 is used for GOBI Testnet nodes and EON Mainnet nodes. Deployment guides can be found at <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON Documentation</a>.

<p>Learn more about ZEN 4.1.0 in <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">our blog post.&nbsp;</a></p>
 ZenIP 42206 – Redirecting Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON 
<p></p>
<p>Horizen’s Community Council has recently submitted <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, which proposes a redirect of the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the removal of the shielded pools on the mainchain, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more about ZenIP 42206 </a>and let us know what you think by submitting the community survey:</p>

 Community Voting Proposals 
<p>During Q3, the Horizen ecosystem saw a few different community voting proposals ongoing. Featuring a proposal for <a href="https://debank.com/proposal/15639">Rabby Wallet to support the EON chain</a>, Tally, a leading DAO tool to join the EON chain, and a request for Phantom Wallet to integrate with EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also saw a proposal to deploy Synapse on Horizen EON, this deployment aims to establish connectivity between the Horizen Ecosystem and a wide range of popular Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains connected to the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hype of web3 in marketing has entered the chat. More and more businesses from various industries turn towards leveraging web3 opportunities within their marketing campaigns. To put this into reality, so has the <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-loreal-is-gearing-up-for-the-metaverse/">L’Oréal Group</a> utilised the variety of web3 in several of their latest marketing campaigns, especially the metaverse, gamification as well as NFT drops. As more companies seek innovative ways to connect with audiences, the marketing department often takes the lead in experimenting with these modern approaches. Let’s dive in and explore what web3 means for the future of marketing.</p>



 Traditional vs. Web3 Marketing: Effectiveness&nbsp; 



<p>In the dynamic landscape of marketing, two distinct paradigms emerge: web3 marketing and traditional marketing. Web3 marketing harnesses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to empower users with greater control over their digital presence. In contrast, traditional marketing relies on established channels and centralisation. Web3 marketing is an unchartered field with creative means of disrupting traditional marketing models. The characteristics of web3 marketing are (logically) close to what benefits web3 can offer in general:</p>



 
 Decentralisation  



 Transparency  



 Tokenisation  



 Community  



 Ownership  
 



<p>Especially decentralisation is the pillar that differentiates web3 marketing from traditional marketing practices. Decentralisation is giving individuals control over their data. This shift creates a cooperative and mutually beneficial environment, strengthening the bond between brands and consumers.</p>







<p>When evaluating the effectiveness of web3 marketing in both the short and long term, one key aspect stands out: customer loyalty. Ultimately, it’s the bedrock of long-term success in web3 marketing. Without a loyal customer base, your marketing endeavors lack purpose. While many aspects of web3 may currently seem like mere buzzwords, the cultivation of a strong community sets apart effective web3 marketing from fleeting traditional campaigns (through e.g., print, radio, TV, or social media), as the latter often yield only short-term results. By embracing the user-centric essence of Web3 technologies, businesses can lay the foundation for long-lasting effectiveness. This approach enables them to cultivate trust and engagement with their consumer base, and forge meaningful connections with their target audience, ultimately leading to sustainable marketing success in the long run. One of many ways to achieve this is through, e.g., the introduction of loyalty programs, to keep customers hooked and committed.</p>



 Community-centricity: Reinvented brand-customer power dynamics 



 The community 



<p>“Commonality is a purpose, meets frequency of touch” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qu5KQJGCs">Swan Sit – web3 developer</a>). Establishing meaningful connections between a brand and its customers is a fundamental objective in marketing. This involves not only targeting customers who align with the brand’s values but also striving for maximum customer engagement. What sets web3 marketing apart is its participatory nature, where customers are not only part of a group but actively engage within that collective. Furthermore, the notion of tangible value comes into play, as the community can receive incentives or rewards from the brand they support, fostering a sense of pride in being part of that specific community. How these incentives could look like, is touched upon later in the article (see NFTs).</p>



<p>Navigating the integration of web3 into your marketing practices may encounter resistance from existing communities that are resistant to change. To overcome potential backlash, open and transparent communication is essential. Engage with your community, address their concerns, and emphasise how the shift to web3 benefits them. Demonstrating a clear understanding of their needs and a commitment to preserving what they value can help ease the transition. Additionally, gradual implementation and education about the advantages of web3 can mitigate resistance and pave the way for a smoother transition, ultimately ensuring the long-term success of your brand’s evolution.</p>



 New power dynamics  



<p>In today’s evolving landscape, we can witness a shift in power dynamics, where the consumer takes a central stage and wields a more significant influence on brand decisions. This represents a stark departure from the traditional paradigm where brands held the upper hand, often due to information imbalances. Web3 technology is a game-changer in this context, offering the potential to rebalance these dynamics. What’s particularly noteworthy is the active involvement of brands in these online communities, signifying a fundamental transformation in how businesses approach marketing.</p>



<p>In this new era, understanding your audience and constructing strategies tailored to their preferences and behaviours becomes paramount. It’s a shift towards a more consumer-centric approach, where the community’s voice plays a crucial role in shaping brand decisions and forging stronger, mutually beneficial relationships.</p>



<p>Web3 technology, thanks to its transparent and authentic nature, helps build trust between brands and consumers. Using blockchain, brands can provide proof of where their products come from, their authenticity, and their sustainability, giving consumers the information they need to make informed decisions. In this context, deceptive marketing practices struggle to gain traction, highlighting how important transparency and authenticity are in web3 marketing. This shift represents a significant departure from traditional marketing, fostering a more genuine and accountable connection between brands and their audiences.</p>



 The web3 marketing trends 



<p>Web3 marketing allows for various new trends, which enrich ways of doing marketing:&nbsp;</p>



 
 NFTs 



 Virtual experiences 



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  
 



 NFTs 



<p>A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a one-of-a-kind digital asset, which replicates real-life items in the form of e.g., art or music and can be sold or bought online. NFTs have gained popularity as a means for brands to enter the web3 marketing space, and hold the promise of serving as valuable bridges between brands and their communities.</p>



<p>NFTs serve a dual purpose:</p>



 
 NFTs can expand the current audience of the brand, and reel those in, that show a clear interest in the web3 space.&nbsp; 



 Additionally, they can also be harnessed for branding and communication strategies. Businesses can use NFTs as a means to incentivise their fans and followers. Within the NFT ecosystem, the range of possibilities is vast: this includes providing discounts, delivering rewarding products, or crafting unique digital items exclusively available to members of the NFT community. 
 



<p>To put this into reality, <a href="https://raritysniper.com/news/adidas-tokenproof-partnership-to-reward-loyal-nft-holders/">Adidas</a> has explored web3 marketing through NFTs. They recently collaborated with Tokengate, where an NFT loyalty program grants access to exclusive Adidas sneakers. Furthermore, Adidas has also teamed up with the Doodles collection and had a partnership with Pharrell &amp; Adidas for an exclusive Samba sneaker drop.</p>



 Virtual experiences 



<p>One of the major trends within web3 marketing revolves around creating virtual experiences, primarily through the metaverse or Virtual Reality (VR). The core concept of such, in a marketing sense, is to offer a fluid experience that seamlessly bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. This enables users to engage with both one another and digital elements in real time, soaking up the person into the action. As previously mentioned, consumers are part of a brand experience, giving them a sense of belonging to the particular brand, as well as active participation in the experience. This emotional side of marketing can often be more important than the actual physical product being sold.</p>



<p>In November of 2021, Nike solidified its position in the nascent metaverse with the launch of <a href="https://www.nike.com/kids/nikeland-roblox">Nikeland</a>, a branded virtual interactive space, marking a significant step in blending sales, marketing, and gaming.</p>



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  



<p>Worries regarding privacy and the handling of personal data have surged, and the demand for replacing platforms is growing. Think of web3 as the rebel of the internet world, challenging the status quo. It’s all about giving you, the user, the reins to control your online experience. Unlike those traditional social media giants that hoard your data on their servers, web3 rides on blockchain technology, creating decentralised networks where you are the data owner. Privacy, anonymity, security, and ownership are redefined in web3 (social media) marketing, creating a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion: Embrace the shift  



<p>As we navigate the evolving landscape of marketing, it’s crucial for brands to adapt and embrace the shift towards integrating web3 into their practices. This means staying true to your brand’s core values while modifying your existing products or services to align with the futuristic space. In this context, experimentation is not an option; it’s a necessity. Embracing web3 in your marketing strategies is the path forward to ensure your brand remains relevant and competitive in an ever-changing digital world.</p>

<p>Demystifying artificial intelligence, challenging the status quo, and empowering everyday people to embrace the digital revolution.</p>
<p><a>The Brave Technologist Podcast</a> (formerly The Brave Marketer) returns for a new season with a fresh perspective: Deconstructing AI and Bleeding-Edge Tech</p>
<p>From privacy concerns to limitless potential, AI is rapidly impacting society.</p>
<p>How can we, as new users and early adopters, make emerging tech more approachable and less daunting? How can we unlock the potential of new Web technologies with confidence and curiosity, and redefine the digital age?</p>
<p>Every Wednesday, The Brave Technologist will bring you insightful conversations with industry leaders who share their expertise, visions, and practical applications of AI. The new season launches today, and features an interview with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kjellcarlsson/">Dr. Kjell Carlsson</a>, Head of Data Science Strategy &amp; Evangelism at Domino Data Lab. Together, we’ll discuss AI’s impact on human intelligence (both now and in the future), and its implications for how we understand ourselves and our place in the world. Part philosophy, part tech, this episode promises to get you thinking.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>Future episodes will feature guests from Planful, A121 Labs, the University of Michigan, the Brave Search team, and more! Topics in this new 10-episode season include: privacy concerns, the future of AI, local data, machine learning, the confluence of Web3 and AI, and more!</p>

<p>In 2021, the US Department of Defense spent $142 billion on procurement and $106 billion on developing new technologies (RDT&amp;E) — while global defense spending reached over two trillion dollars. Yet the US and its allies are potentially dangerously wrong-footed by having over-spent on legacy hardware systems (eg aircraft carriers etc) while neglecting what could be the defining battlefield of the future: the control of the radio spectrum, otherwise known as electronic warfare. In a world where societies and markets run on electronics and signals — this is the ultimate defense&nbsp;line.</p><p>Much of electronic warfare is out of sight of the public and media, but since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident">Iran captured and then reverse engineered a sophisticated high-end US UAV</a> using its electronic warfare capabilities — it has become evident just how dangerous these capabilities will become. Since this incident and others like it, the US DoD has made significant investments in electronic warfare capabilities. However these have come from legacy providers, grown through M&amp;A with no cross system or modular capabilities — severely holding back the US’ and NATO’s electronic warfare capabilities. The lack of composability has created a frustration among end users and demands for open standards.</p><p>AnySignal is building open-core radio software for satellite communications, UAVs, and other next generation defense capabilities. The company sits at the core of a more compatible, modular and fast scaling electronic warfare approach.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>In the future, control of radio spectrum will be used to project power instead of aircraft carriers or ICBMs. NATO will continue to make massive investments in this field, but existing defense contractors are not well positioned to deliver what their clients need. A vibrant startup ecosystem, built with open source components that will be maintained long after the company producing the product is gone, will replace slow moving defense prime contractors. The team’s past experience building radio systems at SpaceX &amp; Kepler Communications puts them in a unique position to help define industry standards and open source implementations through their usage of GNU Radio, a widely used, 21 year old, open source project. With this, AnySignal has the potential to provide many of the performance defining components in this emergent ecosystem.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the AnySignal team on their mission to master the radiofrequency (RF) domain through end-to-end solutions that cover communications, radar, navigation, and RF sensing for advanced aircraft, satellites, and national security. Read more about their recent seed financing <a href="https://anysignal.medium.com/anysignal-closes-seed-round-to-build-multi-domain-radio-platform-ab8aa6844bc8">here</a>.</p>

<p>One of the best known memes in crypto is: 'Not your keys, not your coins'. This usually resurfaces whenever a (custodial) centralised exchange is hacked or goes bust altogether. Although Web3 provides the infrastructure for self custody, this often shares the fate of Pandora. Self-custody requires increased security measures, from both end-users, as well as application developers. Web3 wallets are the interface between users and decentralised applications deployed on blockchains. While Metamask still maintains the largest market share, a multitude of wallets have emerged, promising additional features and a better UX.</p><p>We were joined by Evgeny Yurtaev, co-founder &amp; CEO of Zerion, to discuss the challenges of building a Web3 wallet and how Zerion aims to improve user experience, while still maintaining security.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Evgeny’s background  The motivation behind building a Web3 wallet  Zerion UX and security  Seed phrase storing  Zerion user profile  Challenges in building a new wallet app  Protecting users and potential attack vectors  Supported blockchains and (seamless) bridging  Account abstraction and MPC  Business models for Web3 wallets  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/evgeth_">Evgeny Yurtaev on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zerion">Zerion on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

 This article gives instructions on how to use the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website and Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile to preconvert ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH. <p>First I recommend to read: <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/bridging-done-right-verus-ethereum-bridge-launches-now-1b2ca42939b2">Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!</a></p><p>✅ We will show&nbsp;you:</p>  How-to bridge ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus  How-to enable vETH, DAI.vETH &amp; MKR.vETH on Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile  How-to preconvert into Bridge.vETH with Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile    Download the latest <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> or Verus Mobile (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/verus-mobile/id6447361908">iOS App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.autonomoussoftwarefoundation.verusmobile.android&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  If on Verus Desktop make sure you are on native mode and fully synced. (And remember to always backup your wallet.dat file!)  Visit the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website here: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>   Bridging ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus <p>First thing we need to do, before we can preconvert, is to bridge over. To bridge ETH, DAI or MKR over you need to visit the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">bridge website&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Then connect your Metamask or WalletConnect wallet. Follow the steps they give&nbsp;you.</p><p>Then fill in the address (R- or i-address) you want the bridged ETH, DAI or MKR to end&nbsp;up.</p><p>Then choose what you want to bridge over (ETH, DAI, MKR or VRSC). And then the destination. After that choose the amount and click&nbsp;send.</p><p>Metamask or WalletConnect will guide you through the next steps. ⚠️ It can take up to 45 minutes before your bridged ETH, DAI or MKR arrives on the Verus blockchain and in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>⛽ Also, the gas fee calculation is quite high, it could be that you pay a lot less, but this is never a guarantee.</p> Getting Verus Desktop to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>Go to the “Multiverse”-tab, click on Verus on the left. You can see that Bridge.vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH &amp; vETH or not “added” yet. Click on one of the currencies.</p><p>When clicking on one of the currencies you can see a button “Add Currency”. Click on it, and do it for all if you&nbsp;want.</p><p>You can now go back to the “Wallet”-tab.</p><p>You can now see the added currencies in the dropdown in your Wallet-tab (when Verus is selected).</p> Getting Verus Mobile to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>For this step we assume you already have the wallet installed and are ready to go. Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Click on the big plus button in the right bottom corner. Then click “Add PBaaS Currency”.</p><p>Then you can type in vETH (or DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH depending on what you want to add). (not capital sensitive). Btw, you can also already add Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Follow the steps and the currency will be added to your main&nbsp;screen.</p> Preconverting to Bridge.vETH  Verus Desktop <p>To actually start preconverting currencies to Bridge.vETH click on “Convert Currencies”.</p><p>Now go to “Advanced”.</p><p>You only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See&nbsp;below:</p>  Amount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH  From Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)  To Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  Destination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct). Can be a R-address, i-address or&nbsp;VerusID.  Send as pre-convert: Check&nbsp;this  Refund Address: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn’t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.  <p>Now click on “Convert Currencies” and confirm the transaction. You have now preconverted funds into Bridge.vETH!</p> Verus Mobile <p>Now we want to preconvert currencies (vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH) into Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Click on the currency you want to preconvert into Bridge.vETH. Go to the correct tab where you have the currency stored. Click “Send”, then “Convert or Cross-chain”, then click “Pre-convert”.</p>  Recipient address: This is the address where you will receive the Bridge.vETH, you can click on “self”, or choose something else.  Amount: choose the amount of the currency you want to convert into Bridge.vETH.  Currency to convert to: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  <p>Then click send and follow the steps. You have now preconverted currencies into Bridge.vETH!</p><p>On Friday 20 Oct you will receive an amount of the 100,000 initial supply of Bridge.vETH in your destination address.</p><p>You can always check <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a> for statistics on Bridge.vETH</p> Join the community.

 Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!  The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is the first non-custodial and trustless bridge in the industry, and where the accounting of funds is proven and verified by consensus. And you can participate in its launch right&nbsp;now!  ⏱️ Verus-Ethereum Bridge launch: block height 2,758,800 (Fri 20 Oct,&nbsp;2023).  ✅ Start preconverting to the bridge currency Bridge.vETH (with an initial supply of 100,000) NOW for a 10 day period. 👉 <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io">Connect to the&nbsp;bridge</a>  👀 The first ever truly non-custodial, trustless and consensus proven cryptocurrency bridge.  How it&nbsp;Works <p>You can already start to preconvert VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH.</p>  Bridge ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus network. 👉 <a href="http://eth.verusbridge.io">Go to the bridge website</a> <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-participate-in-the-verus-ethereum-bridge-launch-73aeeae1c76a">How-to guide for bridging &amp; preconversion</a>  Preconvert vETH (ETH), DAI.vETH (DAI), MKR.vETH (MKR) or VRSC into Bridge.vETH.  See Bridge.vETH statistics on <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a>  <p>When the bridge currency launches on 20 Oct the initial supply of 100,000 will be distributed by the protocol among all preconverters.</p><p>If you move ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched your cross-chain fees are subsidized. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.</p> Dynamic Supply <p>The Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of&nbsp;it.</p>After the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.<blockquote>Worth noting: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant. There is no front/back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">More details on docs.verus.io</a></blockquote><p>The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.</p> The Bridge Accrues&nbsp;Fees <p>The bridge currency accrues fees with the cross-chain functions, conversions and&nbsp;.vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable the more it’s&nbsp;used.</p><p>Dai holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. DAI in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.</p> Use the&nbsp;Bridge <p>After Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed you can now use the bridge as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Convert into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion mode.  Export launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Send currencies, tokens and liquidity pools cross-chain.

Present Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges <p>Let’s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.</p>  The custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.  The smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security&nbsp;issues.  Smart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.  <p>These problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.</p> Why the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different <p>The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone’s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>Every 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called “notarizations’’, contain, among other things: the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> for Verus, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Merkle Patricia Trie</a> for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.</p><blockquote>👉 <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5">Read more here</a> on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable&nbsp;way.</blockquote> Safeguards Against Bridge&nbsp;Hacks <p>Threats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to&nbsp;happen:</p>  Colluding, malicious witnesses.  Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain.  <p>These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.</p><p>The notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.</p> Bridgekeeper <p>The two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive&nbsp;fees.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper">Bridgekeeper for CLI</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/kyEqBX_erJo?si=UOajk4TnSD0ToRY4">How to become a Bridgekeeper — video</a></p> Verus ➡️&nbsp;Ethereum <p>Let’s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has passed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a ‘CCE’ (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a>, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).</p><p>Meanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. The notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.</p><p>Then when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it’s sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Anyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the notary witnesses paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.</p><p>If there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is minimal&nbsp;cost.</p> Ethereum ➡️&nbsp;Verus <p>The above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the notary witnesses that send the group of transactions over, but any miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Notarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie</a> proof that relates to the new confirmed data.</p> A Giant Leap&nbsp;Forward <p>The delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>This system is decentralized, which means it’s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It’s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of&nbsp;it!</p> Join the community. Learn about the protocol.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It’s the end of the month again! Here’s a round-up of everything that went down this September.</p> Tech Updates  v1 Testnet update <p>Stage 2 of our v1 Testnet is still in the making. This Stage is predominantly about converting Panther Reward Points to $zZKP. The introduction of an additional feature ("vouchers") will enable users to test this conversion while remaining in a testnet environment, an addition that slightly differs from this Stage's original design. The function is still undergoing internal testing.</p><p>Concurrently, Stage 3 work has already started and is in progress. This Stage will be centered around depositing assets into Shielded Pools.</p><p>We're excited to get Panther v1 in your hands. Look out for more updates on the Testnet launch in the coming weeks!</p> Update to the Stage 1 Testnet’s url <p>As we progress on the above, we have updated the link for Stage 1 on our Testnet information repository. The new version contains a few tweaks and upgrades.</p><p>To access it, go to: <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages</a></p> Comparing Panther’s approach to ‘Privacy Pools’ <p>The recent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> struck a chord with the Web3 community. It's clear that preserving users' privacy in a compliant way is crucial for the mass adoption of decentralized technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>After carefully reviewing the paper by <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mat_nadler?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Mat Nadler</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chainalysis?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Chainalysis</a>' J. Illum, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fschaer?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Fabien Schär</a>, we wrote an article comparing Panther's solutions to ‘Privacy Pools’.&nbsp;</p><p>Both protocols attempt to exclude bad actors from a privacy-preserving system based on disclosures that can be legally adopted. However, although there are clear similarities, there are also key differences in how we tackle this challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>Read our in-depth analysis:</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/">https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-privacy-pools-approaches-compared/</a></p>We analyze Panther's solutions against ‘Privacy Pools’, both aiming to exclude malicious actors from privacy-preserving systems. Integrating PureFi as Panther’s first accredited compliance integration <p>Although PureFi’s integration into v1 had already been approved by the Panther DAO, this month we formalized it with an announcement. With this, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-joins-forces-with-purefi-to-enable-compliance-in-prifi/">PureFi joins Panther in enabling compliant DeFi privacy</a>.</p><p>Privacy integrations enable Panther to:</p>  Improve its decentralization  Apply compliance at a protocol level  Provide on-chain support for ZK-compatible attestations &amp; signatures  <p>These&nbsp; integrations also prioritize neutrality. Through our team’s collaboration with compliance providers like PureFi Protocol, they will be able to issue zero-knowledge proofs for Panther users that submit their data and achieve passing AML scores, ensuring Panther remains uninformed of user data.</p><p>Integrating third-party compliance tools like PureFi underscores Panther's dedication to shaping a DeFi ecosystem where privacy tools are normalized and malicious actors are diligently screened out.</p>PureFi &amp; Panther’s integration illustrated. Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi <p>We hosted a meeting with PureFi Protocol to discuss our upcoming v1 integration.</p><p>Panther’s CEO Oliver Gale, CTO Anish Mohammed, and Head of Product Saif Akhtar joined PureFi’s CEO Slava Demchuk, CTO Mykhailo Tiutin, and COO Vasily Vidmanov to break down the complexities of the integration and answer all your questions.&nbsp;</p><p>This was a great opportunity to showcase how Panther and PureFi are working together to make privacy-preserving DeFi a no-brainer.</p><p>You can listen back to this Twitter Spaces at:</p> <blockquote><p>We'll be hosting a panel with <a href="https://twitter.com/PureFi_Protocol?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@PureFi_Protocol</a> to discuss our v1 integration!<br><br>We'll have Panther CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/OriginalOlii?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@OriginalOlii</a>, CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@anishmohammed</a>, Product Head <a href="https://twitter.com/saifonblock?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@saifonblock</a> with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/demchukvm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@demchukvm</a> , CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/mtiutin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">@mtiutin</a> and COO Vasily Vidmanov from PureFi.<br><br>Set a reminder: <a href="https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://t.co/HXZ3933KX8</a></p>— Panther Protocol (@ZKPanther) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1708924109906727164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">October 2, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>Danny Ryan is a coordinator at the Ethereum Foundation. He’s been on Bankless many times before. Usually, we’re talking about the Ethereum roadmap and what’s coming next. This time we’re talking about something different…a risk to Ethereum that Danny sees. A little over a year ago, Danny wrote a blog post titled “The Risk of LSDs”... discussing the various risk vectors that a dominant LSD presents to Ethereum…even naming Lido specifically in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ A lot of people have decided that liquid staking with Lido is the place to do it. At the time of recording Lido has over 30% of all staked Ether. Does this present a systemic risk to Ethereum?</p> <p>We did an episode called, “In Defense of Lido” with researcher Hasu who argued that Lido does not pose a systemic risk to Ethereum. In fact, Lido’s dominance is better than many other alternatives. We left that conversation half-finished when we published it in August 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s episode, we cover part two of that debate with Ethereum researcher and guest Danny Ryan who argues the opposite. Lido is a systemic risk to Ethereum and what to do about it.</p> <p>We believe our role as podcasters for issues like this is to voice both sides of the argument in long-form conversations and healthy debate. It is exactly the kind of thing you don’t get on Twitter. That’s why we’ve given voice to both sides of this issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>We think there are good actors who care about this ecosystem at Lido and in the broader Ethereum community and we’re sure this episode won’t be the last word on this subject.</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 a16z Startup School | Apply Before Oct. 20th <a href="https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school">https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠<a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp; ⁠</a></p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING <a>⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap&nbsp;</a></p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:41 Is Lido a Threat to Ethereum 8:57 &nbsp;Blog Post Thinking Change? 19:30 Uniswap 21:20 Theoretical Main Risks 25:45 God Mode&nbsp; 27:20 Practical Main Risks 34:00 Hasu Counter-Arguments&nbsp; 38:25 Permissionless Validator Set Mitigation 42:30 Veto Power Mitigation Argument 46:55 How Likely is the Lido Risk? 51:26 Client Team Positioning&nbsp; 55:00 How Special is the Lido Case?&nbsp; 57:45 One LST Inevitability &nbsp; 1:02:30 Solutions&nbsp; 1:06:55 Profit Maximization&nbsp; 1:09:00 Action Steps For Ethereum Decentralization&nbsp; 1:11:53 Can Ethereum Devs Do Something?&nbsp; 1:20:10 Hasu Questions Answered by Danny&nbsp; 1:22:45 Magnitude of the Lido Threat 1:24:20 How Can Lido Fix This?&nbsp; 1:25:59 Stick &amp; Carrot for Lido 1:26:27 Silverlining of Lido Threat 1:29:05 Next Conversations&nbsp; 1:32:16 Closing &amp; Disclaimers &nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Danny Ryan <a href="https://twitter.com/dannyryan">https://twitter.com/dannyryan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Danny Ryan Blog Post <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd">https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasu’s Bankless Interview <a href="https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY">https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Back in 2017, there was no DeFi as we know it today, yet MakerDAO were already envisioning and building towards what they thought to be a certainty. The backbone of DeFi is represented by stable coins, and MakerDAO quickly understood this: they set out to build a decentralised stable coin, $DAI (and its precursor $SAI). Being collateral-backed, the smart contract needs to know the value of that collateral, but any off-chain price data is not readily available on-chain. This is where oracles come in and provide data feeds on-chain. MakerDAO’s internal oracle has been active since 2017 on Ethereum and has recently branched out, forming Chronicle. By using aggregated Schnorr signatures, Chronicle solves the problem of oracle cost-efficient scaling.</p><p>We were joined by Niklas Kunkel, founder of Chronicle, to discuss the challenges and tradeoffs that oracles regularly face, and how Chronicle is solving them, continuing the ethos of early MakerDAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Niklas’ background and the early days of MakerDAO  How MakerDAO evolved over time and the adoption of DAI  MakerDAO’s core principles  Why Chronicle branched out from MakerDAO  Oracle challenges &amp; tradeoffs  Oracle validators  Business model for oracles  Providing oracle services to different blockchains  Schnorr signatures  Chronicle’s supported chains and oracle offerings  Real-world assets (RWA) and credit delegation  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nomos_paradox">Niklas Kunkel on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronicleLabs">Chronicle on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO">Maker DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p><code>zcashd</code> 5.7.0 deprecates <code>fetch-params.sh</code> and <code>zcash-fetch-params</code> and bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly so they do not need to be downloaded or stored separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless you need to generate transactions using the deprecated Sprout shielded pool, you can delete the parameter files stored in these directories to save space, as they are no longer read or used by <code>zcashd</code>: </p>



 
 <code>~/.zcash-params</code>&nbsp;(on Linux); or 



 <code>~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Mac); or 



 <code>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Windows) 
 



<p>If you do wish to use the Sprout pool, you will need the <code>sprout-groth16.params</code> currently available for download <a href="https://download.z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params">here</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 5.7.0 reports new mempool metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All node operators, which include our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as possible. Please note that version 5.6.1 will expire on or around Wednesday, October 11.</p>



<p>Additional changes have been included in this release. For technical details, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0</a>.</p>

							<p>Over the past few months, members of the Zcash community have begun discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. The Zcash Foundation (ZF) looks forward to supporting the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>As a party to the Zcash <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">Trademark Donation and License Agreement</a>, ZF is committed to enacting the clear consensus of the Zcash community when it comes to approving and implementing proposed changes to the Zcash protocol (aka network upgrades). The introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund falls within this remit, as it would involve a change to the Zcash protocol.</p><p>Therefore, ZF proposes that we follow a similar approach to the tried and tested process that resulted in the creation and adoption of ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 History Lesson: How the first Dev Fund was created 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>During 2019, the Zcash community began discussions about what should happen after the end of the Founders Reward in late 2020. In August 2019, the Zcash Foundation set forth a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-foundation-guidance-on-dev-fund-proposals/">process and timeline</a>, and described how it would assess community sentiment towards proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community members drafted <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063">twenty proposals</a>. Following extensive community debate, these twenty were whittled down to thirteen (preserved in the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/">Zcash ZIPs repository</a>, as ZIPs 1001 thru 1013), which were presented to the community in November 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community sentiment was gathered using three mechanisms:&nbsp;</p>
 
 a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/68dcd8ba-08b5-11ea-95c2-1a34a475f69c/view">poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (previously known as the Community Governance Panel or CGP), in which 48 people voted, 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-sentiment-collection-poll-on-nu4-dev-fund-zips/35439/">forum poll</a>, in which people who had joined the forum before March 2019 were eligible to vote, and in which 71 people voted, and 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/7">staked poll</a> of coinholders (in which <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHq-KoiE0mKmllcr_LTwS5tNacf5HHt_VFKPL_tYlHU/edit#gid=0">over 105,000 ZEC was staked for polling purposes by 17 distinct Zcash addresses</a>).&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
<p>ZF also <a href="https://zfnd.org/restarting-community-sentiment-collection-for-dev-fund-proposals/#on-miner-signaling">invited miners to signal their sentiment</a> but no miners did so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the ZCAP (CGP), forum (F), and staked poll (CH) can be found <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dev-Fund-Results.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;(with credit to ECC for creating the graphic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZF and ECC worked together to draft a new, mutually-agreeable proposal based on the proposals that had received the most support from the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result was a draft of <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">ZIP 1014</a>, which proposed instituting a Dev Fund, consisting of 20% of newly minted coins and lasting until the next halving event (projected for late 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2020, two mechanisms were used to assess community sentiment regarding ZIP 1014, and to decide on some final details, including how the Dev Fund should be divided among its recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zcash Foundation conducted a <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">combined poll</a> of users who participated in the forum poll during the first round of community sentiment gathering, alongside the pre-existing Zcash Community Advisory Panel. This combined group numbered 119, and <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43b9bec8-39a1-11ea-914c-b6e34ffa859a/view">88 voted in the poll</a>, which approved ZIP 1014 by 77 votes to 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/111">staked poll</a> of coinholders was coordinated by Zooko and Andrew Miller, in which 24 distinct Zcash addresses staked over 119,000 ZEC for the purposes of the poll. All but one of the participants in this poll (representing 99.9% of the staked coins) voted to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlHXhA_NoJy0RW3Gc6YY3bmYcKT_YF8oS_BrSkBnvEGGaJ56WYo7iL_9shuoh-z_DZMYojA6FpLoJv/pubhtml">approve ZIP 1014</a>.</p>
<p>ZF and ECC subsequently agreed that ZIP 1014 should be implemented in the Zcash protocol, and it duly activated in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			  Process and Timeline for Submitting Proposals 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Both ZF and ECC agree that it is desirable to gain clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem sooner, rather than later. Therefore, we aim to conduct a first round of community sentiment gathering by polling ZCAP in December (alongside the Zcash Community Grants election).&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, teams and organisations that are interested in receiving protocol funding should publicly announce their interest as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the process that led to ZIP 1014, we invite community members to post proposals to the Zcash community forums, in the form of a draft ZIP for review and discussion by the community.</p><p>We will consult with the ZIP editors on whether they are willing to provide editorial feedback on the draft ZIPs (something that Daira and str4d did last time, and which was very useful in clarifying the proposals), and, if so, what deadline would be appropriate for submitting pull requests to the ZIPs Github repo in time for a December round of community sentiment gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>We will host community calls where specific proposals can be discussed, and the community can ask questions of those who are putting forward proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first round of voting, we will assess the results and, if necessary, do further rounds of proposal revision and sentiment-gathering, in order to zero in on a proposal that we are confident represents the clear consensus of the Zcash community</p><p>While we don’t currently intend to formally analyze sentiment beyond the ZCAP poll, we are interested to hear suggestions and ideas&nbsp; for other means of assessing community sentiment, and we will consider other forms of community feedback collected by other parties if it is valuable and informative, and was collected in good faith.</p><p>If you have suggestions or ideas, please post them to the Zcash Community Forum, in the Governance category.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 A Note on Impartiality 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>We at the Zcash Foundation believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community. We hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding the work of the Foundation.</p><p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p><p>If the Zcash community does decide to create a new Dev Fund, ZF recommends furthering the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem by increasing the number of Dev Fund recipients, with at least one recipient in a jurisdiction outside the United States. We also recommend that any new recipients should be nonprofit entities with tax-exempt status, that are subject to legally-enforceable governance requirements similar to those required of&nbsp; 501(c)(3) organizations (e.g. prohibition of private inurement, restrictions on excessive executive compensation, financial disclosure requirements to ensure transparency and accountability).&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to helping the Zcash community reach consensus on this important decision, which will have a far-reaching impact on the future of Zcash!</p>

							<p>In August, we invited applications for the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-minor-grants-round-2/">second round of the Zcash Minor Grants program</a>. This program is aimed at individuals and teams who are seeking funding of up to $25,000 for work that benefits Zcash, or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose. The total budget for this round of Minor Grants is $75,000.</p><p>Minor Grant applications are submitted to a poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). To be eligible for funding, applications must receive greater than 50% approval in the poll, and grants will be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget ($75,000) permits.</p><p>We’re pleased to present 20 applications that were submitted to this round of the Minor Grants program. Below are the links to the grant applications (in PDF format), listed in alphabetical order:</p><p>You can also <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zcash_Minor_Grants_applications_October_2023.zip">download a ZIP file containing all 20 PDFs</a> (6MB).&nbsp;</p>

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency, and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q1 2023.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Key takeaways</p>



 
 Bootstrap received coins at a value below the ECC operating expense level for Q1 2023.

 At the end of Q1 2023, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $1.4M in USD and approximately 107.8K ZEC. As of September 27, 2023, the company held approximately $676K in USD and approximately 89K ZEC.

<p>When we compute a ZK circuit we are not just executing some code, but proving that we have executed the code correctly.</p><p>Take a program that computes x + y = z. It's not enough for a ZK program to simply output z, the program also needs to prove that x + y was executed correctly to arrive at the value&nbsp;z.</p><p>Producing the proof requires establishing constraints.</p><p>In other words, circuits are comprised of constrained functions -meaning ZK programs that generate proofs based on a set of constraints.</p><p>So why then, would you need a function with no constraints — an unconstrained function? You might think unconstrained functions would be unsafe, given their name — like taking the guardrails off of a ZK circuit. And you’d be&nbsp;right!</p><p>Circuit code without constraints can be “proven” to create any outcome! Rather than creating a proof that deterministically proves the validity of a piece of code, unconstrained functions allow you to execute code that would otherwise be very expensive or difficult to compute inside the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>But being able to execute logic outside of a circuit is critical for both circuit performance and constructing proofs on information that is external to a&nbsp;circuit.</p> When to&nbsp;use <p>Generally, we want to use unconstrained functions whenever there’s something that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>An unconstrained function simply executes code as you would expect in a normal programming execution environment.</p><p>In this post we want to make sure that developers who are tapping into the performance benefits of unconstrained functions aren’t incorrectly implementing unconstrained functions in a way that leads to worse security for their programs. Incorrect usage of unconstrained functions could lead to bugs, and zk development overall is a newer, scarier paradigm. We want to make it easy for developers to use <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> to write performant and secure ZK programs, and unconstrained functions can help them optimize their circuits when implemented correctly.</p> Simple division <p>Assuming proving divisions in ZK is costly while proving multiplications is easy, and we want to prove the computation of 100 /&nbsp;5.</p><p>Proving 100 / 5 = x directly in ZK would be inefficient:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;6<p>Instead, we might use unconstrained functions to optimize our circuits. A more optimized approach would&nbsp;involve:</p><p>1. Computing 100 / 5 = x in an unconstrained manner</p><p>2. Proving x * 5 = 100 in&nbsp;ZK</p><p>Here’s a way to optimize the same division operation:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;7<p>Cautious readers however might notice both the code excerpts above yield approximately the same number of constraints in Noir’s abstract circuit intermediate representation (ACIR) given the optimization is simple enough to implement in Noir’s compiler.</p><p>The key intuition here is that in a ZK execution environment, proving multiplications is cheaper than proving divisions.</p><p>Given all Noir programs compile to an intermediate representation called the Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation (ACIR), we can judge circuit optimization on both ACIR opcodes and the ultimate number of backend circuit&nbsp;gates.</p><p>This simple division case has 2 ACIR opcodes and 7 final backend circuit gates. The unoptimized version where we check assert(x == 20) has 3 ACIR opcodes and 8 final backend circuit sizes. Our optimization reduced the final backend size by one gate. Given this is a super simple example, let's dive into a more complex case where the optimizations are more meaningful.</p> A more complex&nbsp;example <p>Colin Nielsen, developer in the Noir community wrote the following code for converting unsigned integers (uints) to u8 arrays, without the use of unconstrained functions.</p><blockquote>👀 See Colin’s <a href="https://twitter.com/colinrives">Twitter</a> +&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen">Github</a></blockquote><p>Here’s the unoptimized code:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;8<p>This code has 91 total ACIR opcodes and a circuit size of 3,619. A lot of the operations in this function are already optimized away by the compiler (e.g., all the bitshifts turn into divisions by constants).</p><p>However, we can save a bunch of gates by casting to u8 a bit earlier. This automatically truncates the bitshifted value to fit in a u8, which allows us to remove the XOR against&nbsp;0xff.</p><p>This is what the slightly-optimized code looks&nbsp;like:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;9<p>ACIR opcodes generated: 75</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;3,143</p><p>Already, this saves us ~480 gates in total, but we can do&nbsp;better.</p><p>This code is all constrained, so we’re proving every step of the calculation using num. But in fact, we don't actually care about how we make the calculation, just that the computation is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>This is where unconstrained functions come&nbsp;in.</p> Optimizing with unconstrained functions <p>It turns out that truncating a u72 into a u8 is hard to do inside of a SNARK. Each time we do this operation to truncate down into u8, we lay down 4 ACIR opcodes, which get converted into multiple&nbsp;gates.</p><p>It’s actually much easier to calculate num from out, rather than the other way around. All we need to do is multiply each element of out by a constant and add them all together, both of which are relatively easy operations to do inside of a&nbsp;SNARK.</p><p>So, instead of truncating u72 into u8, we can run u72_to_u8 as unconstrained function code in order to calculate out. Then, we can use that result in our constrained function and assert that if we were to do the reverse calculation, we'd get back&nbsp;num.</p><p>An example of what this looks like is&nbsp;below:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;10<p>Total ACIR opcodes generated: 78</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;2,902</p><p>This usage of unconstrained functions ends up optimizing our circuit even further and taking off another ~250 gates from our&nbsp;circuit!</p><p>We’ve ended up with more ACIR opcodes than before, but these are easier for the backend to prove (resulting in fewer gates overall). This is the beauty of using unconstrained functions — optimizing code that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>Put differently, unconstrained functions allow you to reformulate certain pieces of code that are easier to check than to execute directly in a ZK&nbsp;circuit.</p> Resources <p>For more on unconstrained functions, see this post by Tom French in the official Noir docs: <a href="https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/">https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/</a></p><p>Are you a developer interested in getting started with&nbsp;Noir?</p><p>Jump into the <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">noir-starter Github repo</a> and when you’re ready <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">apply for a Grant</a> — we’re currently supporting Noir use-cases through the end of&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/unconstrained-functions-in-noir/">https://aztec.network</a> on September 26,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/unconstrained-functions-in-noir-b6884d697679">Unconstrained Functions In Noir</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>Horizen EON Forger Nodes will soon be available to the public for anyone who wishes to participate in the EON network.</p>



<p>Available on the Proof-Of-Stake Horizen EON chain, these nodes are different from the Proof-Of-Work Horizen mainchain nodes. How do these two types of nodes differ, and how do they each play a critical role in securing the network?</p>



<p>Before understanding the importance of these forger nodes, it’s important to first remember or learn some blockchain terms.</p>



 What is the Horizen mainchain and the Horizen EON sidechain? 







<p>The Horizen mainchain is a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/layer-0/">layer 0</a> chain whose native cryptocurrency is ZEN. It doesn’t natively support smart contracts but natively supports the creation of sidechains.</p>



<p>A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to the Horizen mainchain and inherits its security. Sidechains can be used to extend the capabilities of the mainchain, for example by enabling smart contracts, token minting, voting, etc. In addition, ZEN can be transferred back and forth between the mainchain and sidechains (as a gas token) using the forward and backward transfer mechanism.</p>



<p>The Horizen sidechains and the mainchain are independent of each other. A sidechain can have its own consensus and does not rely on the mainchain to grow and add more blocks.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is a dedicated sidechain that implements an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This brings smart contract capabilities to the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Thanks to the forward and backward transfer mechanism, it’s possible to mint ZEN on Horizen EON by locking an equal amount of ZEN on the mainchain and vice versa. This is important for two reasons:</p>



 
 ZEN are required to pay gas fees on Horizen EON. 



 Horizen EON brings programmability to ZEN. Once ZEN are transferred to Horizen EON, it’s possible to operate on them with all the flexibility enabled by smart contracts.&nbsp; 
 



 Why does the Horizen EON sidechain need forger nodes? 







<p>Horizen’s mainchain operates on a proof-of-work consensus, meaning that it is the miners (in this case, ASICs) who compete to add new blocks to the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, The Horizen blockchain has a block reward system where the miner who completes the block receives 60% of the reward for this work. Then 10% goes to the Secure Nodes operators, 10% to the Super Nodes operators, and 20% to the ecosystem Treasury.</p>



<p>Secure Nodes and Super Nodes may sound like a hybrid POS/POW system, but they’re not. On Horizen, Secure Nodes and Super Nodes were created to add an extra layer of security to the network by allowing the community to keep a copy of the blockchain and be compensated for verifying transactions validated by miners.</p>



<p>This multi-layer node system has been in place since 2018. In the meantime, the needs of the network have evolved, particularly with the release of Zendoo and Horizen EON, Horizen’s EVM-compatible sidechain. As a result, the current Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen network. Furthermore, with <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">the removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is a strong need for forger nodes in the EON chain. The Horizen EON chain is consensus and scalability-independent. To achieve consensus independence, it is necessary for the chain to have its own nodes to validate the transactions taking place on its chain.</p>



 Forger nodes permit to secure the network 



<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>



 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 



 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 



 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss if they behave maliciously. 



 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 



 Sybil attack resistance: PoS networks are less vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates many fake nodes to gain control. 



 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved. 
 



<p>There is an open Zen Improvement Proposal (ZenIP) for redirecting Secure Node block rewards to EON forger node. The purpose of this proposal is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization through forger nodes. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support. For more information about this ZenIP, please visit “ <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a>”.</p>

 The launch of the Horizen DAO marks the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community. 



<p><a href="http://horizen.io">Horizen</a> is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>



 About Horizen DAO 



<p>DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” which has emerged as the standard for decentralized governance in the blockchain space and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizen has always been a community-driven project and has long recognized that a strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is directed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on<a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about"> the Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 Proposal Phases and Voting Process 



<p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protocol Improvement Proposals (IPs) are an established mechanism used to select and implement new features and core protocol changes in many blockchain projects. In Horizen’s case, this IP process is the key tool for the Horizen DAO’s community-led governance. With Horizen’s native token, $ZEN, serving as the governance token for both the Horizen mainchain and the EON sidechain, IPs for each are called, respectively, ZenIPs and EONIPs.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
 


<p>$ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">hard fork that was activated at block 1426200</a> (September 26th 2023), private addresses can no longer receive ZEN from transparent addresses. This affects both Secure and Super Nodes’ ability to continue to perform challenges, and the ability to set up new nodes which currently requires a balance in a shielded address.</p>



<p>Starting September 26, 2023, challenges in both systems are suspended indefinitely. The increased requirements of successfully validating certificates introduced with the registration of EON will serve as a substitute for challenges in the interim.</p>



 Steps for Node Operators 



<p>Existing Nodes<br>There should be no effect on any existing nodes unless the node’s wallet is replaced. See New Nodes below.</p>



<p>Any API calls from a node operator requesting a manual challenge should be stopped.</p>



<p>New Nodes<br>If a new node is created (or a new wallet is created) it will need to follow the current guide. One private address will still need to be created and a very small amount of ZEN sent to it to give the private address a balance. The ZEN will need to be sent from another private address. This is a workaround until a new version of the Nodetracker is published.</p>



 System Changes 



 
 An updated version of the Nodetracker software that removes the check for private addresses will be available for new nodes once testing is complete. 



 An updated version of the tracking server software that disables challenges (instead of just suspending) will be rolled out once testing is complete. 
 



<p>After the system changes have been implemented, Node Operators are free to start withdrawing funds previously required for challenges from their shielded addresses to transparent addresses.</p>

  Partnering with PartyKit: Everything is Better with Friends  <p>Sunil and his team are turning lonely online tasks into collaborative multiplayer experiences.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published September 26, 2023
  



Team PartyKit: CXO Sylwia Vargas, Founder Sunil Pai and CTO Jani Eväkallio.



 
<p>I am a student of antiquity. At age 10, while many of my peers in the tech industry were learning how to code, I was buried somewhere between the sixth and fifth centuries BC, learning Latin and ancient Greek. (To this day I have some highly marketable skills—like reciting Virgil in the original.) One lesson that stuck with me from those studies is something Aristotle said many centuries ago: that we humans are “social animals.” As markets and technologies have come and gone, this part of our nature has been slow to change; <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/this-study-of-300000-people-reveals-1-secret-to-living-a-longer-healthier-life.html">dozens of studies</a> on health and longevity show that no matter what we do in life, it is better with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that measure, the Internet is not an ideal environment for us—because our digital experiences are so often lonely. We spend 8-10 hrs a day in front of our screens largely alone. Collaborative editing in Google Docs, collaborative design in Figma, and multiplayer video games are the rare exceptions that give us a taste of what the good life on the internet could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view that all business apps require multiplayer collaboration is not necessarily universally held. The skeptic might ask how many Google Docs and Figmas there can be, i.e., how many apps truly require real-time, multiplayer collaboration?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is a failure of imagination, anchored in how things have been rather than how things can be. The fact is very few business processes are truly single-player; even something as mundane as expense reports requires collaboration, as does every other workflow that involves approvals. But these naturally multiplayer experiences have been artificially constrained into sequential, asynchronous workflows that can take weeks to complete.</p>



<p>Imagine instead you could just tag your manager or colleague in finance—or your friendly AI-driven finance copilot—to review your expense report, and they could flag anything that needs fixing on the spot. Historically, creating that kind of collaborative experience required a lot of hard work and technical sophistication. The likes of Google could do it, but your average SaaS startup could not. And while some new technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> libraries have been inching us closer to multiplayer experiences, they still require a lot of technology integration and many hours of engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">PartyKit</a>, a developer-friendly platform for real-time human-to-human and human-to-AI collaboration. PartyKit does the heavy lifting for you, enabling multiplayer experiences with a few lines of Javascript code. It is easy to customize; it includes all the analytics, and other tools you need to build production apps; and because it is open source, it can run on your organization’s own infrastructure—or even your own laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first met PartyKit founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunil-pai-a47732253/">Sunil Pai</a> earlier this year, we fell in love with his velocity and can-do attitude. Case in point is the way he got hired at Cloudflare: after he complained on X (formerly known as Twitter) about certain aspects of the developer experience, they invited him to join the team and fix it—which he did. During <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sequoia-arc/">Sequoia Arc</a>, we got to know Sunil very well, and were impressed with his contagious enthusiasm for his creation; he was quick to show anyone who was interested a demo on his phone. As they say, ABC—always be closing!</p>



<p>During the beta period, we were also impressed with the diversity of applications users found for PartyKit, from a <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">drawing app</a> to a <a href="http://v/">state machine</a> to an <a href="https://sitegpt.ai/">LLM-based customer service agent</a>. And those are just small hints of what’s to come; as we celebrate the general availability of the platform, we will no doubt be surprised in the weeks and months ahead by the multitude of use cases PartyKit enables! We are proud to support Sunil and his team as they continue to grow, and we look forward to the better, less lonely internet we’ll all enjoy as they work to make collaborative multiplayer experiences the norm.</p>

 📖 Deep dive: How Machiavellian principles could help fix decentralized governance <p>Miles Jennings</p><p>Whatever you make of Renaissance-era Italian philosopher and political operator Niccolo Machiavelli (who inspired the word “Machiavellian” for better or worse), many of the principles he explored in his writings remain relevant today. For instance, we can see echoes of such principles -- on leadership and the preservation of political liberty -- in both the Federalist Papers and design of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;</p><p>But several Machiavellian principles can also be applied to fix decentralized governance, particularly issues with DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) in web3. How? Because Machiavelli’s philosophy during that time was developed with a very pragmatic understanding of the struggle for social power, as well as the premise that no mechanism exists to guarantee virtuous actions.&nbsp;And while most DAOs have developed, as a first step, simplified models of governance based on direct democracy, indirect democracy, and corporate governance -- these approaches have failed to overcome the complex sociopolitical realities involved in decentralized governance. </p><p>So in this set of articles, Jennings examines issues facing DAOs today; and outlines current solutions such as subDAOs, delegate programs, governance minimization, and others, as well as their limitations. Jennings then shares how 4 Machiavellian principles can help design more effective DAOs and better decentralized governance, including minimizing governance and checking-and-balancing the leadership class.</p><p>read more on Machiavelli for DAOs:<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-principles-dao-decentralized-governance/">Principles for Fixing Decentralized Governance</a> (part 1)<br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/machiavelli-daos-designing-effective-decentralized-governance/">Designing Effective Decentralized Governance</a> (part 2)</p><p>share on: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1705276359831060654?s=20">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://warpcast.com/a16zcrypto/0x22ba35">Farcaster</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7111042659175059456">LinkedIn</a><br><br>see also: </p>  <p>“a16z suggests Machiavelli to fix decentralized governance”, by Ana Paula Pereira in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/a16z-machiavelli-fix-decentralized-governance">Cointelegraph</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>“Lightspeed Democracy: What web3 organizations can learn from the history of governance”, by Andrew Hall and Porter Smith on <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-from-the-history-of-governance/">a16zcrypto.com</a></p>   🇬🇧 Announcing: Crypto Startup School goes to London <p>Jason Rosenthal&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-startup-school/">Crypto Startup School</a> (CSS) is our popular accelerator program for early-stage companies, providing expert guidance, capital, and resources tailored for crypto founders.

<p>Protecting users from total transparency is crucial for addressing one of the main hurdles facing DeFi adoption: data privacy.</p><p>In a system where blockchain transparency can be maliciously exploited, alpha decay and surveillance are inevitable, making the current state of decentralized finance incompatible with traditional services. As such, addressing our networks’ inherent concerns can only be done with robust controls and proactive strategies in place to prevent the misuse of decentralized tools.</p><p>To this end, and in an ecosystem milestone, <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a> and its DAO are debuting a suite of zero-knowledge compliance solutions. This initial release integrates <a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">PureFi</a>'s services to create a path to compliance and data privacy in DeFi. </p> Panther Protocol’s approach to compliance <p>Panther Protocol’s goal is to create a cross-chain architecture that enables seamless access to DeFi while preserving the privacy of users’ data and activity. The protocol leverages the security and liquidity of existing networks while integrating zero-knowledge technology for users to have full control over their data. The protocol’s v1 also integrates these features into a solution that DeFi enthusiasts can use to access their favorite protocols.</p><p>In a first-of-its-kind approach that complements its decentralized structure, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. Panther integrates third-party<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance providers</a>, operating autonomously from the protocol, to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after users complete a series of verifications. These credentials then serve the dual purposes of:</p>  Crafting zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers.  Seamlessly integrating with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms.  <p>Due to the flexibility of this design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider, being able to choose from a variety of them. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. As a result, Panther can retain its neutrality while giving users a path to complying with regulations.</p> Integrating PureFi<br> <p>In the process of selecting a compliance vendor suitable for Panther’s compliance flow and willing to support the proposed architecture, the Panther DAO elected PureFi.</p><p>PureFi has gained recognition in the Web3 space by pioneering the use of technologies such as decentralized verifiable credentials. The protocol’s goal is to become a one-stop decentralized compliance solution that onboards institutional money to DeFi. PureFi also actively participated in the Panther DAO’s discussions surrounding compliance integrations.</p><p>For Panther’s v1 release, the integration will fulfill the following functions (with all zero-knowledge capabilities built by the Panther team and PureFi in charge of compliance procedures):</p>  Capturing users’ data (email, name, birth date, and nationality) upon their first attempt to access the protocol.  Issuing a signed zk-friendly attestation of the user sharing their data, tied to the user’s wallet (which the user can use as a “Master” account to identify themselves).  Running KYT checks (aka “wallet screening”) to analyze AML/CTF risks of a deposit/withdrawal, both on the receiver’s and sender’s end, and issuing zk-friendly KYT attestations upon passing.  Maintaining an on-chain list of valid cryptographic keys (i.e., certificates) of compliance providers, including the EdDSA public key available on Polygon.  Escrowing the compliance provider’s backup keys with a reliable 3rd party, e.g., a law firm, to be used in case PureFi goes offline.  <p>Importantly, the integration is designed to be compatible with any compliance provider or multiple of them simultaneously.</p> In Summary <p>Zero-knowledge, decentralized compliance, and self-sovereign identity solutions create a technology stack that, for the first time ever, opens a seamless path to compliance while protecting users’ privacy. Panther and PureFi are proud to announce a collaboration that will set the foundation for greater adoption of these solutions and Decentralized Finance as a whole.</p><p>Panther’s <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">compliance integrations</a> can already be tested by ZK technology and DeFi enthusiasts at <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s Testnet Stage 1</a>, released earlier this month.

Testers can go through the verification flow, create Panther Accounts, and get an exclusive look at Panther's v1!</p> About PureFi Protocol <p>PureFi Protocol allows dApps to fully comply with local and global regulations while preserving decentralization and user anonymity.</p><p>Developed by AMLBot in partnership with Hacken Foundation to provide a full-cycle solution for crypto asset analytics and AML/KYC procedures for the Web3 infrastructure.</p><p><a href="https://purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> |<a href="https://dashboard.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Dashboard</a> |<a href="https://wp.purefi.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Whitepaper</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefiprotocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG Chat</a> |<a href="https://t.me/purefipro?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> TG ANN</a> |<a href="https://medium.com/purefi?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Medium</a> |<a href="https://twitter.com/Purefi_Protocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Twitter</a></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>On stage at Messari Mainnet today in New York, Brave, Electric Coin Co. (ECC), and Filecoin Foundation announced that they are teaming up to bring innovative new privacy features to the Brave browser and its integrated Web3 wallet.</p>

 Private transactions for all&nbsp; 
<p>With support from ECC, Brave will integrate the Zcash protocol in the browser’s built-in crypto wallet so users can securely store, send, and receive ZEC alongside other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The integration underscores Brave’s commitment to blending privacy, transparency, and user choice. With private transactions possible alongside public ones, users will have greater control over their Web3 activity.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m excited about integrating Zcash into the Brave web browser because privacy should be normal. The Brave browser is a tool that tens of millions of people are using for everyday communication, web browsing, shopping, and other activities. This gives them access to money that respects their security and consent. I’m thrilled for this launch — and what’s to come — as a result of this partnership with Brave and Filecoin Foundation.”</p>
<p>— Zooko Wilcox, CEO, Electric Coin Co.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This partnership with like-minded organizations reinforces Brave’s mission for a more private and user-first Web. Not only do we hope to make it simple to use ZEC for private transactions, but we also aim to maximize privacy during key moments of purchase or exchange.”</p>
<p>— Yan Zhu, CISO, Brave</p>
</blockquote>

 A private and decentralized messaging feature 
<p>Brave, ECC, and Filecoin Foundation also teased plans on stage to develop a new, privacy-based feature in the Brave browser that will offer private messages and media transmission via the Zcash protocol. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) – the technology underlying the Filecoin protocol – will play a crucial role in providing secure storage for the encrypted content.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re thrilled to be a part of this important project. We believe cryptocurrency can be the foundation for a better Internet — an alternative to big tech that puts people in control of their own data, protects user privacy and security, and permanently preserves humanity’s most important information.”</p>
<p>— Marta Belcher, President, Filecoin Foundation</p>
</blockquote>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>Brave</p>
<p>Brave Software’s fast, privacy-oriented browser, combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform, is reinventing the Web for users, publishers, and advertisers. Users can opt into privacy-respecting ads that reward them with the Basic Attention Token (BAT), a frequent flyer-like token they can redeem or use to tip or contribute to publishers and other content creators. Brave is a driving force leading the way for Web3 adoption, directly supporting Web3 into the broader Web through its privacy browser, independent search engine, and browser-native, multi-chain crypto wallet. Brave currently has over 60 million monthly active users and 1.8 million Creators. Learn more at <a>brave.com</a>.</p>
<p>Electric Coin Co.</p>
<p>Electric Coin Co. launched Zcash in 2016 and continues to support the protocol and user experience, alongside other developers and teams. Zcash is a cryptocurrency built to empower economic freedom. It is similar to Bitcoin in its design, but it uses a privacy technology that encrypts transaction information and allows users to shield their assets. Our vision for Zcash is that it will provide equal access to economic systems and give everyone the ability to participate in economic activity.

 <blockquote>Different approaches to private asset velocity in light of the Privacy Pools paper.</blockquote> <br>Introduction <p>Public blockchains inherently champion transparency. The cornerstone of this architecture allows anyone to validate transactions without dependence on centralized intermediaries. This transparency, while advantageous in many respects, also accentuates the pressing need for privacy, especially given the escalating prominence of platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, their DeFi applications, and adoption by institutions.<br><br>The industry has various challenges to solve to deliver privacy-enhancing protocols: transaction linkability, network privacy, and private key management are some. There have been commendable strides in these areas, such as the development of Layer-1 blockchains like <a href="https://z.cash/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zcash</a>, which offers private transactions, and smart contract solutions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_Cash?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Tornado Cash</a>, which breaks the transaction link between deposit and withdrawal addresses on Ethereum. Due to their permissionless nature and approach, these systems are currently not designed for risk management. Notably, Tornado Cash was rampantly used for cybercrime money laundering activities. According to Buterin: “Tornado Cash has also been used by various bad actors. Deposit data suggests that hacker groups have moved funds from illicit sources through the protocol.” (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Buterin et al.</a>, page 1). While Tornado Cash had its pitfalls, notably its usage by malicious actors (causing the protocol to get internationally sanctioned), the root cause of such vulnerabilities isn't necessarily technological but rather structural and was meant to be exploited.<br>At its core, the true sentiment we need to grapple with is this: compliance, while ensuring standardized behavior and safeguarding user interests, undeniably carries a cost – both financial and in terms of user accessibility. There's an exclusionary element to compliance, where stringent checks can sometimes inadvertently alienate non-malicious users. Furthermore, the absence of clear regulatory frameworks around decentralization and DAOs has ushered in shades of ambiguity. This uncertain environment is ripe for exploitation.</p><p>Historically, many actors in the space prioritized rapid growth over diligent compliance, often underestimating or even ignoring the long-term repercussions of such a strategy. Their motivations were straightforward – to reduce immediate costs and accelerate expansion. But such a strategy is inherently flawed. With today's well-informed user base demanding greater clarity and accountability, the repercussions of neglecting compliance have grown exponentially in magnitude. Simply put, compromising compliance for short-term gains threatens the longevity and credibility of any decentralized system.</p><p>It's essential to differentiate between ideologic and economic motives. While the decentralized movement was born from a <a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">desire for autonomy and freedom from permissionless surveillance</a>, its sustained growth and mainstream adoption are undeniably tethered to economic incentives. In this case, ideology isn't the dominant force; it's the potential for economic upside. Similarly, while security concerns are paramount, they represent a distinct set of challenges, separate from those posed by compliance.</p><p>Thus, as we critique systems like Tornado Cash, it's imperative to understand that their vulnerabilities aren't just a result of technology but are deeply intertwined with larger strategic challenges and a blind eye toward solving compliant access.<br><br><a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Protocol</a>, however, envisions a refined balance. Our goal is to augment data privacy on public blockchains while introducing a flexible approach to compliance, making it accessible to a diverse user base, from individuals to institutional giants.<br></p> Panther’s overall approach <p>Panther Protocol refines and extends the Shielded Pool concept and has developed advanced <a href="https://research.metastate.dev/multi-asset_shielded_pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Multi-Asset Shielded Pools</a> to include compliance features enabled by zero-knowledge proofs.</p>  Users can deposit into a <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-shielded-pools-the-cornerstone-of-panther-protocol/">Multi-Asset Shielded Pool</a> (or simply Shielded Pool) only after <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/">presenting a ZK proof of their verified status</a>, an action that's verifiable on-chain.  Transactional activities like deposits or withdrawals necessitate a ZK proof to vouch for the purity of the associated wallet address.  Upon providing the necessary proofs, users activate a zero-knowledge <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/panther-accounts?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Account</a> (or zAccount), which serves as a unique user identity record, tethering all their transactions.  Situations like regulatory scrutiny may necessitate users to reaffirm their credentials, leading to zAccount reactivation.  All interactions with the protocol are strictly based on zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring minimal data exposure on-chain.  With the zAccount system, all transactions from the same user are interconnected, and a ZK proof can be generated to showcase the volume or assets dealt with, offering a possible avenue for regulatory review.  <p>In a pioneering approach that seamlessly complements the decentralized structure we've discussed, Panther introduces an innovative method to manage compliance risks. At the heart of this strategy is the inclusion of a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/enabling-compliance-while-preserving-privacy-panthers-compliance-integrations-explained/"> compliance provider</a>, operating autonomously from the Protocol. This provider's principal role is to authenticate users, offering them a unique set of credentials after a series of verifications. These credentials then serve a dual purpose:</p><p>First, they enable users to craft zero-knowledge proofs directly within their browsers—a testament to the strategy's user-centric design. Second, in line with the modern digital identity landscape, these credentials can be seamlessly integrated with blockchain-based <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DIDs </a>and similar platforms. Panther's vision extends even further. In a move that underscores flexibility and choice, users aren't bound to a single compliance provider. They can seek verification from any compliance provider of their choice. Once verified, users can then present these credentials as an irrefutable attestation to their authenticity, granting them unhindered access to the protocol. This strategic integration ensures multilevel compliance and amplifies user trust, forging a pathway to a more secure decentralized future.</p> <br>The Solution for the problems presented in the Privacy Pools paper. <p>In a quest to strike the right balance between privacy and compliance in decentralized finance, Panther unveils a revolutionary approach that aspires to solve the same set of issues as presented in the paper titled “Blockchain Privacy and Regulatory Compliance: Towards a Practical Equilibrium”, also known as the “<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools” research paper</a>, by thought leaders such as <a href="http://vitalik.ca/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Vitalik Buterin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Ameen Soleimani</a>. As highlighted in their work, "Privacy Pools-like systems allow users to achieve more privacy around their financial transaction histories and activity while retaining the ability to prove their disassociation with known illicit activity. We expect that honest users will be incentivized to participate in such a scheme by a combination of two factors: (i) the desire for privacy, and (ii) the desire to avoid suspicion.” (p.8)</p><p>Central to the Privacy Pools model is a foundational idea: "Instead of merely zero-knowledge-proving that their withdrawal is linked to some previously-made deposit, a user proves membership in a more restrictive association set." (p.4) However, Panther diverges here, adopting a more tailored approach suited for real-world applicability. Panther operates on the positive constraint that all deposits emanate from verified users with authenticated wallets. This eradicates the need for additional proof during fund withdrawals.</p><p>Users can:</p>  Attest ownership of the originating Account for their deposits.  Showcase credentials affirming the withdrawal to an address in good standing, either owned by them or a validated Account holder within Panther.  When directing withdrawals <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/defi-adaptors?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">to other DeFi protocols</a> or centralized exchanges, they can offer proof of 'source of funds', which is verifiable by the receiving party.  <p>Another aspect highlighted in the Privacy Pools paper is the inventive adaptation of the Tornado cash UTXO model. However, one of the challenges presented is the maintenance of reliable and upright Associate Set Providers within a decentralised framework. These systems employ third-party entities known as ASPs to establish association sets. While the association data resides off-chain, its Merkle proof is recorded on-chain, ensuring ASPs maintain data integrity. ASPs might encompass compliance providers or even wallet screening oracle services.</p><p>The Privacy Pools paper underscores the necessity of expansive association sets to attain the desired privacy level and to lure good depositors, distancing them from malicious actors. Panther's answer to this is the creation of "<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zones</a>". Differently from the association sets of Privacy Pools, Zones are logical divisions within a Shielded Pool, each identified by a unique Zone-ID ingrained in every UTXO commitment. This allows for entities to create and tailor their own Zone, shaping membership criteria, selecting compliance providers, meeting regulatory demands, and even facilitating interactions with other Zone members. Notably, while these Zones provide tailored functionalities, they share the same anonymity set, as they all operate under the unified MASP architecture, reinforcing the strength and integrity of the system.</p><p>For instance, as a Zone Manager, an institution would have the capability to:</p>  Designate which Zones can transact their Zone and vice versa.  Choose a new compliance provider or integrate an existing one tailored for its Zone.  Define KYC renewal durations for Zone members.  Set transactional boundaries, including deposit, withdrawal, and internal transfer limits.  <p>The advent of "Zones" thus arms regulated entities and institutions with a formidable toolset, enabling them to seamlessly conduct privacy-preserving on-chain transactions and interact with protocols, welcoming a broader spectrum of participants into the world of DeFi. This agility comes out of Panther’s UTXO design and is instrumental in tapping into new opportunities and maximizing the potential of decentralized finance.<br></p> Panther Protocol &amp; the advanced UTXO model <p>Before the broader public became acquainted with the intricacies of the Privacy Pools paper, which mentions, "The simplified, privacy-preserving coin systems above only support coin transfers in the same denomination. Zcash supports arbitrary denominations through its use of a UTXO model," (p.6) Panther Protocol was already ahead of the curve. Panther crafted a pioneering system that not only facilitated transactions in diverse denominations, but also tackled real-world challenges to amplify on-chain transactional privacy. Additionally, Panther's advanced Shielded Pools are designed to support a wide range of assets, including:</p>  <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-20</a>: The standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum, allowing for a consistent interface across multiple token contracts.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-721</a>: A standard for representing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can be used to represent ownership over unique items or pieces of content.  <a href="https://ethereum.org/nl/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">ERC-1155</a>: A more generalized standard that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens, enabling the creation of multiple token types within a single contract.  <p>With these integrations, Panther Protocol not only serves as a privacy shield for traditional tokens, but also for the blossoming world of NFTs, showcasing its versatility and forward-thinking approach.</p><p>Let’s dig a little deeper into Panther User Accounts and how they enable Compliance:</p><p>1. User Account UTXOs ( or zAccounts): At the heart of Panther's approach lies the concept of the "User Account UTXO" — a distinctive type of UTXO nestled within the broader UTXO Merkle Tree. This can be imagined as a dynamic address book or user registry that can be activated based on several criteria, such as:</p>  Association with a social network account.  Linkage to an Ethereum address.  Ties to a user’s KYC records.  <p>2. Activation and Non-Interactive Transfers: Upon Account activation, the user account registry establishes a link between the public root spending key, public reading key, and a "public" Ethereum address associated with the user. This elegant arrangement enables non-interactive transfers within the Shielded Pool, eliminating the need for the sender to fetch the receiver’s pubkeys.</p><p>3. Accounts and their utility: The fields encapsulated within the zAccount UTXO pave the way for a myriad of functionalities. For instance:</p>  The "Nonce" serves as a transaction counter for user accounts, helping in linking and ordering transactions under the same Account.  Parameters such as "Order" and "Quantity" further enhance transactional clarity.  This feature might also be employed for disclosures to provide proof of completeness.  <p>4. Expiry Time &amp; Renewal Mechanisms: Recognizing the absence of a foolproof exclusion proof, Panther has instituted an "Expiry Time"mechanism, which mandates periodic renewals of user accounts. Potential renewal methodologies could range from:</p>  Aligning with KYC renewals.  Adopting a permissionless approach.  Re-verification of humanity.  Using a zk-proof to validate the total volume of transactions remaining under specified limits.  <p>Panther Protocol's nuanced use of the UTXO model paints a future where transactions are not only private but also flexibly aligned with the intricate demands of the world of DeFi.</p> <br>Navigating the DeFi space with Panther Protocol <p>Panther's architecture, with its foundational pillars of privacy, is crowned with a structure for on-chain compliance. Yet, one might wonder –what avenues are available to Panther users to leverage the augmented privacy derived from their Panther-based transactions?</p><p>This is precisely where Panther distinguishes itself from conventional privacy paradigms:</p><p>1. Seamless integration with premier DeFi protocols<br>Panther has engineered private adaptors in collaboration with eminent DeFi protocols such as <a href="https://uniswap.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Uniswap </a>and <a href="https://www.curve.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Curve</a>. This enables users to execute  ‘one-click’ swaps, instantly privatizing and verifying the transaction from a regulatory standpoint.</p><p>2. Diverse platform Adaptors<br>Our vision goes beyond mere swaps. We anticipate adaptors that <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zswap-and-defi-adaptors-unlocking-private-defi-usage/">bridge Panther with an eclectic range of platforms</a>, spanning from NFT marketplaces to lending hubs and beyond.</p><p>3. zTrade: Panther’s Dark Pool<br>Panther includes an innovative solution for confidential and compliant dark pool transactions. With <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ztrade-otc-trading?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zTrade</a>, users can preserve their trading strategies, mitigate counterparty risks, and effortlessly execute voluminous trades at pre-negotiated rates, all within the Shielded Pool.<br></p> Conclusion <p>In the ever-evolving world of decentralized technology, the quest for innovation remains perpetual. As the landscape gravitates towards establishing fully permissionless and decentralized privacy solutions, the challenge is ensuring these platforms don't inadvertently provide refuge to malicious actors. Panther recognizes this dilemma and has meticulously worked to strike a balance. By weaving in compliance features, we ensure a blend of unwavering privacy without compromising the ethos of decentralization.</p><p>An essential distinction to note is that while Panther's system might appear to have rules-based access on the surface, it operates within a decentralized framework. No centralized entity dictates or establishes the rules. Instead, the rules of compliance, tiers, and other requirements are orchestrated by the Panther DAO or by the institutional entities that will own and oversee the Zones. This approach signifies a pioneering stride in the blockchain world, merging decentralized ethos and structured compliance advantages.</p><p>Moreover, as government-issued identities gain traction in various developing nations and blockchain-based DIDs persist, the symbiosis with Panther becomes increasingly potent. We are confident that such integrations will pave the way for scalable, secure, and trustful access methods, aligning with the vision of a more inclusive and transparent decentralized world.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p><p></p>

      Generative AI’s Act Two         
	By Sonya Huang, Pat Grady, and GPT-4	 



Animation: James Buckhouse, Midjourney and Runway



Published September 20, 2023
        One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.      



 
<p>Scientists, historians and economists have long studied the optimal conditions that create a Cambrian explosion of innovation. In generative AI, we have reached a modern marvel, our generation’s space race.</p>



<p>This moment has been decades in the making. Six decades of Moore’s Law have given us the compute horsepower to process exaflops of data. Four decades of the internet (accelerated by COVID) have given us trillions of tokens’ worth of training data. Two decades of mobile and cloud computing have given every human a supercomputer in the palm of our hands. In other words, decades of technological progress have accumulated to create the necessary conditions for generative AI to take flight.</p>



<p>ChatGPT’s rise was the spark that lit the fuse, unleashing a density and fervor of innovation that we have not seen in years—perhaps since the early days of the internet. The breathless excitement was especially visceral in “Cerebral Valley,” where AI researchers reached rockstar status and hacker houses were filled to the brim each weekend with new autonomous agents and companionship chatbots. AI researchers transformed from the proverbial “hacker in the garage” to special forces units commanding billions of dollars of compute. The arXiv printing press has become so prolific that researchers have jokingly called for a pause on new publications so they can catch up.</p>



<p>But quickly, AI excitement turned to borderline hysteria. Suddenly, every company was an “AI copilot.” Our inboxes got filled up with undifferentiated pitches for “AI Salesforce” and “AI Adobe” and “AI Instagram.” The $100M pre-product seed round returned. We found ourselves in an unsustainable feeding frenzy of fundraising, talent wars and GPU procurement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And sure enough, the cracks started to show. Artists and writers and singers challenged the legitimacy of machine-generated IP. Debates over ethics, regulation and looming superintelligence consumed Washington. And perhaps most worryingly, a whisper began to spread within Silicon Valley that generative AI was not actually useful. The products were falling far short of expectations, as evidenced by terrible user retention. End user demand began to plateau for many applications. Was this just another vaporware cycle?</p>



<p>The AI summer of discontent has sent critics gleefully grave dancing, reminiscent of the early days of the internet, where in 1998 one famous economist declared “By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet’s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine’s.”</p>



<p>Make no mistake—despite the noise and the hysteria and the air of uncertainty and discontent,&nbsp; generative AI has already had a more successful start than SaaS, with &gt;$1 billion in revenue from startups alone (it took the SaaS market years, not months, to reach the same scale). Some applications have become household names: ChatGPT became the fastest-growing application with particularly strong product-market fit among students and developers; Midjourney became our collective creative muse and was reported to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with a team of just eleven; and Character popularized AI entertainment and companionship and created the consumer “social” application we craved the most—with users spending two hours on average in-app.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, these early signs of success don’t change the reality that a lot of AI companies simply do not have product-market fit or a sustainable competitive advantage, and that the overall ebullience of the AI ecosystem is unsustainable.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled for a bit, we thought it would be an opportune moment to zoom out and reflect on generative AI—where we find ourselves today, and where we’re possibly headed.&nbsp;</p>



 Towards Act Two 



<p>Generative AI’s first year out the gate—“Act 1”—came from the technology-out. We discovered a new “hammer”—foundation models—and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.</p>



<p>The market is already beginning to transition from “Act 1” to “Act 2.” Examples of companies entering “Act 2” include <a href="http://harvey.ai">Harvey</a>, which is building custom LLMs for elite law firms; <a href="http://glean.com">Glean</a>, which is crawling and indexing our workspaces to make Generative AI more relevant at work; and <a href="http://character.ai">Character</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ava-your-digital-friend/id6446257579">Ava</a>, which are creating digital companions.&nbsp;</p>



 Market Map 



<p>Our updated generative AI market map is below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike last year’s map, we have chosen to organize this map by use case rather than by model modality. This reflects two important thrusts in the market: Generative AI’s evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of generative AI applications.</p>
 







 
<p>In addition, we have included a new LLM developer stack that reflects the compute and tooling vendors that companies are turning to as they build generative AI applications in production.</p>
 







 
 Revisiting Our Thesis 



<p>Our original <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">essay</a> laid out a thesis for the generative AI market opportunity and a hypothesis for how the market would unfold. How did we do?</p>



<p>Here’s what we got wrong:</p>



 
 Things happened quickly. Last year, we anticipated it would be nearly a decade before we had intern-level code generation, Hollywood-quality videos or human quality speech that didn’t sound mechanical. But a quick listen to Eleven Labs’ voices on TikTok or Runway’s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, quickly.&nbsp; 



 The bottleneck is on the supply side. We did not anticipate the extent to which end user demand would outstrip GPU supply. The bottleneck to many companies’ growth quickly became not customer demand but access to the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Long wait times became the norm, and a simple business model emerged: pay a subscription fee to skip the line and access better models.&nbsp; 



 Vertical separation hasn’t happened yet. We still believe that there will be a separation between the “application layer” companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI. In reality, that separation hasn’t cleanly happened yet. In fact, the most successful user-facing applications out of the gate have been vertically integrated. 



 Cutthroat competitive environment and swiftness of the incumbent response. Last year, there were a few overcrowded categories of the competitive landscape (notably image generation and copywriting), but by and large the market was whitespace. Today, many corners of the competitive landscape have more competition than opportunity. The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google’s Duet and Bard to Adobe’s Firefly—and the willingness of incumbents to finally go “risk on”—has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors.&nbsp; 



 The moats are in the customers, not the data. We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage → more data → better model → more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the “data moats” are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, workflows and user networks seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage. 
 



<p>Here’s what we got right:</p>



 
 Generative AI is a thing. Suddenly, every developer was working on a generative AI application and every enterprise buyer was demanding it. The market even kept the “generative AI” moniker. Talent flowed into the market, as did venture capital dollars. Generative AI even became a pop culture phenomenon in viral videos like “Harry Potter Balenciaga” or the Drake imitation song “Heart on My Sleeve” by Ghostwriter which has become a chart-topping hit. 



 The first killer apps emerged. It’s been well documented that ChatGPT was the fastest application to reach 100M MAU—and it did so organically in just 6 weeks. By contrast, Instagram took 2.5 years, WhatsApp took 3.5 years, and YouTube and Facebook took 4 years to reach that level of user demand. But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived. 



 Developers are the key. One of the core insights of developer-first companies like Stripe or Unity has been that developer access opens up use cases you could not even imagine. In the last several quarters, we have been pitched everything from music generation communities to AI matchmakers to AI customer support agents. 



 The form factor is evolving. The first versions of AI applications have largely been autocomplete and first drafts, but these form factors are now growing in complexity. Midjourney’s introduction of camera panning and infilling is a nice illustration of how the generative AI-first user experience has grown richer. Across the board, form factors are evolving from individual to system-level productivity and from human-in-the-loop to execution-oriented agentic systems. 



 Copyright and ethics and existential dread. The debate has roared on these hot-button topics. Artists and writers and musicians are split, with some creators rightfully outraged that others are profiting off derivative work, and some creators embracing the new AI reality (Grimes’ profit-sharing proposition and James Buckhouse’s optimism about becoming part of the <a href="https://buckhouse.medium.com/augmented-imagination-a3f4519f9784">creative genome</a> come to mind). No startup wants to be the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90942310/ai-napster-who-going-to-own-it-next">Napster or Limewire to the eventual Spotify</a> (h/t Jason Boehmig). The rules are opaque: Japan has declared that content used to train AI has no IP rights, while Europe has proposed heavy-handed regulation.&nbsp; 
 



 Where do we stand now? Generative AI’s Value Problem 



<p>Generative AI is not lacking in use cases or customer demand. Users crave AI that makes their jobs easier and their work products better, which is why they have flocked to applications in record-setting droves (in spite of a lack of natural distribution).&nbsp;</p>







<p>But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies.&nbsp;</p>







<p>User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp’s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.</p>







<p>In short, generative AI’s biggest problem is not finding use cases or demand or distribution, it is proving value. As our colleague David Cahn writes, “the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">$200B question</a> is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?” The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.</p>



<p>Let’s not despair. Generative AI is still in its “awkward teenage years.” There are glimpses of brilliance, and when the products fall short of expectations the failures are often reliable, repeatable and fixable. Our work is cut out for us.&nbsp;</p>



 Act Two: A Shared Playbook 



<p>Founders are embarking on the hard work of prompt engineering, fine tuning and dataset curation to make their AI products *good*. Brick by brick, they are building flashy demos into whole product experiences. And meanwhile, the foundation model substrate continues to brim with research and innovation.</p>



<p>A shared playbook is developing as companies figure out the path to enduring value. We now have shared techniques to make models useful, as well as emerging UI paradigms that will shape generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p>The Model Development Stack</p>



 
 Emerging reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought and reflexion are improving models’ ability to perform richer, more complex reasoning tasks, closing the gap between customer expectations and model capabilities. Developers are using frameworks like <a href="http://langchain.com">Langchain</a> to invoke and debug more complex multi-chain sequences. 



 Transfer learning techniques like RLHF and fine-tuning are becoming more accessible, especially with the recent availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2, which means that companies can adapt foundation models to their specific domains and improve from user feedback. Developers are downloading open-source models from <a href="http://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> and fine-tuning them to achieve <a href="https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-llms-lora-or-full-parameter-an-in-depth-analysis-with-llama-2">quality</a> performance. 



 Retrieval-augmented generation is bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations and increasing truthfulness and usefulness. Vector databases from companies like <a href="http://pinecone.io">Pinecone</a> have become the infrastructure backbone for RAG. 



 New developer tools and application frameworks are giving companies reusable building blocks to create more advanced AI applications and helping developers evaluate, improve and monitor the performance of AI models in production, including LLMOps tools like <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">Langsmith</a> and <a href="http://wandb.ai">Weights &amp; Biases</a>&nbsp; 



 AI-first infrastructure companies like <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/">Coreweave</a>, <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a>, <a href="https://mlfoundry.com/">Foundry</a>, <a href="https://replicate.com/">Replicate</a> and <a href="https://modal.com/">Modal</a> are unbundling the public clouds and providing what AI companies need most: plentiful GPUs at a reasonable cost, available on-demand and highly scalable, with a nice PaaS developer experience. 
 



<p>Together, these techniques should close the expectations vs reality gap for models as the underlying foundation models simultaneously improve. But making the models great is only half the battle. The playbook for a generative AI-first user experience is evolving as well:</p>



<p>Emerging Product Blueprints</p>



 
 Generative interfaces. A text-based conversational user experience is the default interface on top of an LLM. Gradually, newer form factors are entering the arsenal, from Perplexity’s <a href="https://twitter.com/alexgraveley/status/1659276299091812353">generative user interfaces</a> to new modalities like human-sounding voices from Inflection AI.&nbsp; 



 New editing experiences: from Copilot to Director’s Mode. As we advance from zero-shot to <a href="https://thezbook.com/ask-adjust-the-future-of-productivity-interfaces">ask-and-adjust</a> (h/t Zach Lloyd), generative AI companies are inventing a new set of knobs and switches that look very different from traditional editing workflows. Midjourney’s new panning commands and Runway’s Director’s Mode create new camera-like editing experiences. Eleven Labs is making it possible to manipulate voices through prompting. 



 Increasingly sophisticated agentic systems. Generative AI applications are increasingly not just autocomplete or first drafts for human review; they now have the autonomy to problem-solve, access external tools and solve problems end-to-end on our behalf. We are steadily progressing from level 0 to level 5 autonomy.&nbsp; 



 System-wide optimization. Rather than embed in a single human user’s workflow and make that individual more efficient, some companies are directly tackling the system-wide optimization problem. Can you pick off a chunk of support tickets or pull requests and autonomously solve them, thereby making the whole system more effective? 
 



 Parting Thoughts 



<p>As we approach the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-paradox-perspective/">frontier paradox</a> and as the novelty of transformers and diffusion models dies down, the nature of the generative AI market is evolving. Hype and flash are giving way to real value and whole product experiences.</p>



<p>At Sequoia we remain steadfast believers in generative AI. The necessary conditions for this market to take flight have accumulated over the span of decades, and the market is finally here. The emergence of killer applications and the sheer magnitude of end user demand has deepened our conviction in the market.</p>



<p>However, Amara’s Law—the phenomenon that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run—is running its course. We are applying patience and judgment in our investment decisions, with careful attention to how founders are solving the value problem. The shared playbook companies are using to push the boundaries on model performance and product experiences gives us optimism on generative AI’s second act.</p>



<p><br>If you are building in the AI market with an eye towards value and whole product experiences, we would love to hear from you. Please email Sonya (<a href="mailto:sonya@sequoiacap.com">sonya@sequoiacap.com</a>) and Pat (<a href="mailto:grady@sequoiacap.com">grady@sequoiacap.com</a>).

  AI’s $200B Question  <p>GPU capacity is getting overbuilt. Long-term, this is good. Short-term, things could get messy.</p>   
	By David Cahn	 



Published September 20, 2023
  



 
<p>The Generative AI wave, which began last summer, has gone into hyperspeed. The catalyst for this double acceleration was Nvidia’s Q2 earnings guide and subsequent beat. This signaled to the market an insatiable level of demand for GPUs and AI model training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before Nvidia’s announcement, consumer launches like ChatGPT, Midjourney and Stable Diffusion had raised AI into the public consciousness. With Nvidia’s results, founders and investors were delivered empirical evidence that AI can generate billions of dollars of net new revenue. This has shifted the category into its highest gear yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While investors have extrapolated much from Nvidia’s results—and AI investments are now happening at a torrid pace and at record valuations—a big open question remains: What are all these GPUs being used for? Who is the customer’s customer? How much value needs to be generated for this rapid rate of investment to pay off?</p>



<p>Consider the following: For every $1 spent on a GPU, roughly $1 needs to be spent on energy costs to run the GPU in a data center. So if Nvidia sells $50B in run-rate GPU revenue by the end of the year (a conservative estimate based on analyst forecasts), that implies approximately $100B in data center expenditures. The end user of the GPU—for example, Starbucks, X, Tesla, Github Copilot or a new startup—needs to earn a margin too. Let’s assume they need to earn a 50% margin. This implies that for each year of current GPU CapEx, $200B of lifetime revenue would need to be generated by these GPUs to pay back the upfront capital investment. This does not include any margin for the cloud vendors—for them to earn a positive return, the total revenue requirement would be even higher.</p>







<p>Based on public filings, much of the incremental data center build-out is coming from big tech companies: Google, Microsoft and Meta, for example, have reported increased data center CapEx. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9dfee156-4870-4ca4-b67d-bb5a285d855c">Reports</a> indicate that Bytedance, Tencent and Alibaba are big Nvidia customers as well. On a go-forward basis, companies like Amazon, Oracle, Apple, Tesla and Coreweave should also be important contributors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The important question to be asking is: How much of this CapEx build out is linked to true end-customer demand, and how much of it is being built in anticipation of future end-customer demand? This is the $200B question.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-passes-1-billion-revenue-pace-as-big-companies-boost-ai-spending?rc=0uxjjk">The Information</a> has reported that OpenAI is generating $1B in annual revenue. Microsoft has said it expects to generate $10B in AI revenue from products like Microsoft Copilot. Let’s assume Google will generate a similar amount of revenue from its AI products, such as Duet and Bard. Let’s also assume Meta and Apple each generate $10B in revenues from AI. Let’s use a $5B placeholder for Oracle, Bytedance, Alibaba, Tencent, X and Tesla. These are all dummy assumptions—the point is that even if you assume extremely generous gains from AI, there’s a $125B+ hole that needs to be filled for each year of CapEx at today’s levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a large opportunity for the startup ecosystem to fill this hole. Our goal is to “follow the GPUs” and find the next generation of startups that leverage AI technology to create real end-customer value. We want to invest in these companies.</p>



<p>The goal of this analysis is to highlight the gap that we see today. AI hype has finally caught up to the deep learning technology breakthroughs in development since 2017. This is good news. A major CapEx buildout is happening. This should bring AI development costs down dramatically over the long-term. You used to have to buy a server rack to build any application. Now you can use the public clouds at a much lower cost. Likewise, today many AI companies are using a large portion of their venture capital on GPUs. As today’s supply constraints give way to a supply glut, the cost of running AI workloads will come down. This should spur more product development. It should also attract more founders to build in this space.</p>



<p>During historical technology cycles, overbuilding of infrastructure has often incinerated capital, while at the same time unleashing future innovation by bringing down the marginal cost of new product development. We expect this pattern will repeat itself in AI.</p>



<p>For startups, the takeaway is clear: As a community, we need to shift our thinking away from infrastructure and towards end-customer value. Happy customers are a fundamental requirement of every great business. For AI to have an impact, we need to figure out how to leverage this new technology to make people’s lives better. How can we translate these amazing innovations into products that customers use every day, love and are willing to pay for?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AI infrastructure build out is happening. Infrastructure is not the problem anymore. Many foundation models are being developed—this is not the problem anymore, either. And the tooling in AI is pretty good today. So the $200B question is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?&nbsp;</p>

 The most ambitious software release in Aztec Labs’&nbsp;history <p>Today we’re proud to announce the Aztec <a href="https://aztec.network/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, a local developer testnet for building end-to-end applications on&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>Aztec is designed to be the endgame for blockchain privacy — the most complete solution for privacy-first blockchain applications ever attempted.</p><p>The Aztec Sandbox is the first milestone toward that endgame, allowing developers to write applications that leverage a full suite of privacy primitives:</p>  Private smart contract composability (including public-private composability)  Private L1-L2 function&nbsp;calls  Private state management  Hidden function execution  <p>All enabled by an intuitive software development environment that abstracts the complicated mechanisms necessary to protect user&nbsp;privacy.</p><blockquote>⬇️ Download the Aztec Sandbox at <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a>.</blockquote> Background <p><a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Labs</a> has been laying the foundation for a privacy-preserving Ethereum L2 for&nbsp;years.</p><p>Yet building the Sandbox has taken just 5 months-a testament to the quality of our team and the ever-improving modularity of Aztec’s technology.</p><p>The Sandbox is the first major step on a development roadmap that includes a multi-phase testnet for Aztec’s execution environment, fee model, sequencers, and provers-all culminating in a privacy preserving zkRollup that is fully decentralized at mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p> What comes in the&nbsp;box? <p>The Aztec Sandbox is a comprehensive software release providing developers with a fast, lightweight local Aztec node, with features similar to Ethereum’s Ganache or Anvil local node packages.</p><p>Alongside Aztec’s local node testing environment, the Sandbox includes powerful tools and frameworks that allow developers to write and test smart contracts:</p>  Aztec Node: build and publish rollup blocks with Aztec’s node&nbsp;software  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/aztec-rpc">Aztec RPC Server</a>: decrypt and store client-side private state, execute private functions and submit transactions to the Aztec&nbsp;Node  <a href="http://aztec.nr/">Aztec.nr</a>: write smart contracts using a comprehensive framework that extends Noir-an open-source zero knowledge programming language-with private smart contract functionality  <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/about_aztec/roadmap/features_initial_ldt#aztecjs%20">Aztec.js</a>: make RPC calls to an Aztec Node via Aztec’s Typescript wrapper  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/docs/docs/dev_docs/cli/main.md">Aztec CLI</a>: interact directly with an Aztec Node using Aztec’s command-line tool  <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=noir-lang.vscode-noir">Noir VS Code Extension</a>: write Noir conveniently. Syntax highlighting, debugging and [other features] that make writing smart contracts in Noir utterly&nbsp;painless  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts">Code examples</a>: get inspired by Aztec Labs-written example private smart contracts and example wallet implementations  <p>Developers should be aware that they are early adopters. You may encounter bugs or&nbsp;hiccups.</p><p>No fret.</p><p>For support related to the Aztec Sandbox, join our <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse forum</a>, where you can get hands-on support from Aztec Labs’ developer relation teams and build alongside the Aztec developer community.</p><blockquote>🗣 Join the conversation on Aztec Labs’ <a href="http://discourse.aztec.network/">Discourse</a></blockquote> Get Started in&nbsp;Minutes <p>The Aztec Sandbox provides a local development system for building and testing Aztec smart contracts in a fast, safe, and free environment.</p><p>The process of downloading the Sandbox, installing client libraries, and using it to deploy and use a fully private token contract on a local Aztec node takes less than 10&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>First, navigate to <a href="http://sandbox.aztec.network/">sandbox.aztec.network</a></p><p>Or curl the&nbsp;site:</p><p>/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://sandbox.aztec.network')"</p><p>A package will then download and execute, spinning up two Docker containers:</p>  Anvil  Aztec Sandbox  <p>The Sandbox will create servers on localhost ports 8545 (Anvil) and 8080 (Sandbox); ensure those ports are free to prevent any conflicts.</p><p>Within a few seconds the Sandbox should be up and&nbsp;running!</p> What can you do with&nbsp;it <p>The Sandbox is the starting point for Aztec smart contract and application developers. The Sandbox helps future-looking developers get a head-start interacting with ZK-native blockchain environments.</p><p>And as pioneers in smart contract privacy, developers will need to add a few useful heuristics to their public-blockchain mental models. Some new concepts&nbsp;include:</p>  Private state management  Account abstraction models  Understanding patterns to keep private information private  Transaction paths which span both private and public function execution  Organizing contracts into privately executable logic and publicly executable logic  <blockquote>For more about UTXO abstraction and how Aztec makes it convenient to manage manipulating private state, read our blog post <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/privacy-abstraction-with-aztec/">here</a>. For more information relating to privacy preservation best practices, see <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/privacy/main">here</a>. And for more about transaction architecture, see&nbsp;<a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztecs-transaction-anatomy/">here</a>.</blockquote><p>Using Aztec.js, developers can build full-fledged applications that let&nbsp;users:</p>  write, deploy and test private smart contracts  create accounts (choosing one of various account abstraction schemes!)  manage their&nbsp;wallets  send transactions to the network and track their&nbsp;progress  query current chain state such as chain ID, block number,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Learn more about how to write an Aztec smart contract along with ready-made examples and walkthrough guides&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">here</a>.</p> Use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see <p>Aztec’s <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts">smart contract examples</a> include a broad swath of use&nbsp;cases</p>  Public and private token contracts  Private DeFi  Oracle price&nbsp;feeds  Air-drop contracts  Two-party private&nbsp;escrow  Account contracts that can privately validate account credentials  <p>We’re excited to see other application primitives including private identity, fully on-chain private games, and decentralized finance protocols offering privacy by&nbsp;default.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the explosion of higher-order privacy mechanisms that will be created by remixing and composing these basic primitives into complex smart contracts and full-fledged privacy-first applications.</p> What you can’t do&nbsp;(yet) <p>The Aztec Sandbox is our minimum viable local developer testnet. While developers can begin writing smart contracts, there is no shared in-production network.</p><p>While account creation, wallet management, smart contract creation, and transaction execution are all live, fee estimation, transaction sequencing, proving, and advanced key and address functionality will be released in future iterations of the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p><blockquote>🎻 For a full current list of limitations see&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/limitations/main">here</a>.</blockquote><p>You can learn how to write and test Aztec smart contracts. You just can’t deploy production applications-yet.</p> What is Noir’s relationship to all&nbsp;this? <p>Aztec Labs first developed Noir as a standalone, open-source, universal language for zero-knowledge programming. Noir is designed to be compatible across proving systems while also being verifiable to any chain, not just&nbsp;Aztec.</p><p>​​It’s no surprise then, that we’ve chosen Noir as a basis for writing smart contracts on Aztec. Using Noir, we’ve written a collection of functions, types, methods, state variables, annotations, etc. which together provide a rich, syntactically pleasing framework, to aid developers in writing intuitive and legible private smart contracts.</p><p>Imaginatively, we called this framework <a href="http://aztec.nr/">Aztec.nr</a>.</p><p>Aztec applications written with the <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Aztec.nr</a> framework have the advantage of features and tools developers might expect to be packaged with any smart contract framework:</p>  Contracts (including callable contract functions and inter-contract function&nbsp;calls)  Persistent state variables  Contract address semantics  Access to msg.sender and other call context information  Access to transaction context information  Access to historic blockchain data  Events (logs) (both encrypted and unencrypted)  Cryptographic primitives  Cross-chain (L1 -&gt; L2 and L2 -&gt; L1) message&nbsp;passing  <p><a href="http://noir-lang.org/">Noir</a> is an open-source language with universal applicability to zero knowledge use-cases.

<p>In August 2023, Brave released <a>Leo—Brave’s native AI assistant</a>—on its <a>Nightly channel</a>. Since then we’ve incorporated a lot of user feedback, and made numerous improvements to the feature. There are more changes on the way, and soon we will launch Leo on our full release channel, making it available to our 60 million users.</p>
<p>We thought now would be a great time to share more about how Brave is thinking about Leo, and the future AI integrations within the browser.</p>

 Background: Brave as a user agent 
<p>Brave has always been a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</a>. A user agent is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_%28computing%29">client</a> application that gives users better control of the content they access on the Internet, without conflicts of interest between server operators – including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking">third parties</a> – and the user. Leo takes this concept one step further, moving beyond the limited stance of browsing content in the way the author or creator intended. With Leo, you’re not passively consuming web pages and videos, rather you’re actively exploring content: asking tangential questions, seeking clarifications, exploring diverse viewpoints, and overall tailoring the Web to your preferences.</p>
<p>Leo “understands” the current page you’re visiting—it’s the next best thing to talking directly with the author. In fact, in many ways it’s better, as Leo can independently analyze and reason about pages, free of the author’s or creator’s biases.</p>
<p>To be clear, Brave isn’t trying to create the world’s leading Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch. Instead, our goal is to link users with top LLMs and harness them in innovative and where feasible, privacy preserving ways. Our goal is to open novel, convenient, and private use cases that are often possible only in the context of a particular user’s browsing session.</p>
<p>As with all Brave products, Leo adheres to Brave’s core values and is built with privacy by design. User inputs are always submitted anonymously through a reverse-proxy to our inference infrastructure, giving users an AI experience with unparalleled privacy. Also, conversations are discarded immediately after the reply is generated and are not persisted on Brave’s servers. As we expand Leo’s development, we will continue to integrate privacy into its features and to innovate with new approaches to give our users the privacy they expect.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 General release channel availability: cost and viability&nbsp; 
<p>The first step to opening <a>this amazing feature</a> to our general release channel is to make sure the cost is viable for Brave to offer to its full user base. With more than 60 million users worldwide, the cost of running Leo as-is on our general release channel would be prohibitive without a paid option. For this reason, we’ll soon be offering a premium version of Leo. Alongside the free version of this feature, the premium version will cover the costs of hosting our premium models, and for paying the API access for other premium model choices.</p>
<p>This next update to Leo will include:</p>
 
 A seamless onboarding experience for the premium upgrade, including the ability to pay for premium access with BAT. 
 The ability to select different models directly in the main Leo interface. 
 The addition of integration points from other parts of the browser into Leo. 
 Access to better models such as Llama 2 70B, and Claude Instant (by Anthropic). 
 
<p>Here’s a table that summarizes the free / premium options:</p>

<p>We’re targeting mid to late Q4 for the Leo release.</p>

 Mobile parity 
<p>Mobile parity will most likely follow shortly after the desktop release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus of the mobile release will be to make sure everything from the desktop release works on Android and iOS.</p>

 Roadmap 
<p>Major enhancements and features for Leo are described and grouped into categories below. Some of these features will be available with the first release, and others will roll out during each of our browser updates.</p>

 Local persistence of conversations, and full-page interactions 
 
 Ability to store and reference past conversations locally on your device, and continue these conversations at a later date. 
 Ability to sync these conversations across devices using Brave Sync. 
 Full-page interactive UI via a URL like brave://chat (or brave://leo). 
 

 Better answers 
 
 Provide Brave Search results to the model for up-to-date information. 
 Provide <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Q&amp;A</a> and <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us">Brave Support</a> to the model for user questions. 
 Provide Brave News results to the model for help answering user questions. 
 Provide cryptocurrency context to the model for help answering Web3-related questions. 
 Provide a generalized extension framework, or adopt an existing form of extensions such as ChatGPT plugins. 
 

 Richer output 
 
 Image generation as part of Leo’s possible outputs. 
 Ability to highlight text within a page that’s currently being viewed to support Leo’s claims. 
 Ability for Leo to take actions on a user’s behalf (for example, for Leo to start a Web search, change the current page to dark mode, or change a browser setting). 
 Entity highlighting of response text to link to Brave Search (for example, if an output talked about Brave, it may highlight Brave and make it a Brave Search query). 
 

 Model expansions 
 
 Continually add access to the latest-and-greatest models. 
 Expand commercial relationships to offer more model choices for premium users. 
 Larger context sizes. 
 

 Better language support 
<p>Today, if Leo is prompted in another language, it can already answer in that language (such as French and Spanish). However, not all languages are covered, and a page’s context, when used, will likely determine the response language. We’d like to add better handling for languages, and overall to expand the number of languages, and the quality of the output of those languages, by adding better international models.</p>

 Chat interface and customization 
 
 At the time of writing, context for Leo interactions can derive either from the entire page, or it can work with no context at all. In the future, we’d like to make this better via context menus, allowing users to select a specific part of a page to supply the model its interaction context. 
 We’d like to offer access to Leo via omnibox (address bar) suggestions, a new tab card, and more. 
 A CodeLlama integration into developer tools and in the sidebar, with optional injection into the current page context. 
 

 Model personalization and personification 
 
 Customize Leo’s tone and summary styles for personalized interactions. 
 User-defined boundaries, mood, and context awareness. 
 

 Content consumption 
 
 PDF summarization: the ability to interface with not only web pages and videos, but also with PDF documents. 
 Using accessibility and other information available to help models understand web pages better. 
 Image understanding via drag and drop. 
 

 Writing tools 
 
 Tools for filling in editable fields on web pages (such as formatting and generating text). 
 Grammar, spelling, and other suggestions. 
 Content suggestions, and content auto-completion. 
 

 Local model support 
 
 We’d like to offer locally running models, and even allow users to configure their own models. Doing so would open more possibilities for assisting users with their local, private Brave data (for example, making a better suggestion bar or autocomplete suggestions). 
 

 Brave Ads &amp; Brave Rewards integration 
 
 We may offer a privacy-preserving ad-supported option for those users who don’t want to buy a premium subscription, but still want premium features. 
 Thinking beyond display ads, we’d like the model to help users make purchasing decisions, via context such as detailed product information; this could entail an ad catalog and all knowledge about the products behind those ads, but not advertise or give you phony or biased information (for example, if you were trying to buy a TV, Leo could tell you it knows of a less expensive TV, or one that offers features not available in the TV you’re currently asking about). 
 We’d like to investigate how to tie this recommendation engine to Brave Rewards. 
 In these shopping scenarios, the model would always genuinely act first as the user’s agent. For instance, it might respond that a TV you were viewing had a better price elsewhere than in an online ad you may have seen. 
 
<p>With Leo by their side, users can interact with the Web in groundbreaking new ways. The future of Leo outlined in this roadmap is exciting to us. Unlike other AI assistants, Leo is not a simple chat interface. Leo is a companion for helping you make sense of the Web as you browse, while preserving your privacy and helping you stay in charge of your experience.</p>
