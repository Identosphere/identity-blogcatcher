<p>Multi-signature structures have been around for a while and are securing billions of euros in digital assets. But how do they work? And what are the main differences with a simple single-signature structure?</p>



<p>In this article we will discuss what multi-signature structures are, the use cases of multi-signature structures, and how multi-signature structures work.</p>



 What is a multi-signature structure? 



<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



<p>Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions.</p>



<p>Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance.</p>



<p>Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud.</p>



<p>Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval.</p>



<p>Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters.</p>



<p>Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings.</p>



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>



<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>



<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.

 ZenIP 42206 is open for voting. All ZEN holders have until 11/23/2023 00:00 AM UTC (11/22/2023 7:00 PM ET) to cast their vote via <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xc4bc560e7a88348b98ab5c4aa57f847169713cf9280ff164d72302b78d1ae4f2">Snapshot</a>. 
<br>
<p>We’ve noticed that regardless of the voting instructions and documentation that have been provided and positive sentiment towards this proposal, some of the community members may be still experiencing technical difficulties in the voting process. </p>
<p>We have identified four blockers that may be preventing some community members from being able to vote easily. </p>
<p>Here are the solutions for each of these blockers:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 1) Voting from a multi-sig wallet 
<p>If you have ZEN on a multi-sig wallet, you are not able to link it to Horizen EON as this is currently not supported. Multi-sig wallet users can still vote by proving the ownership of their wallet that contains ZEN. Follow these steps:</p>
<br>
 
 You have until the last block before 11/22/2023 08:00 PM UTC (11/22/2023 3:00 PM ET) to send a transaction of 100 zatoshi (0.00001 $ZEN) to this address znmJjX4QyLeZJFawTCP35T7tqfdhNQMNZEJ (Horizen faucet) with the multisignature address you’d like to link. 
 <a href="https://forms.gle/fC24DFkMjPZiZu3dA">Submit this form </a>to claim your multi-sig wallet address before 11/22/2023 09:00PM UTC (11/22/2023 4:00PM ET). 
 Right after that, we will collect, share and apply the allowlist of multi-sig wallets eligible to vote. 
 







 2) Voting from a non-Sphere wallet 



<p>If you have your ZEN in a wallet other than Sphere, such as Arizen or a hard wallet, you can sign a message right from the application/hardware wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your wallet doesn’t support signing custom messages, you can paste your private key at <a href="https://getzen.cash/sign/">https://getzen.cash/sign/</a>, and produce the signature. The procedure is the following:</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your private key making sure you are in a private location.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Paste your EON wallet address, and press on “Sign”.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Copy the signature you have generated.</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a>.</p>



<p>NOTE: Make sure no one can look at your screen, you may expose your private key. Do it at your own risk.</p>



 3) Voting with ZEN staked on a Horizen Node 



<p>If you have ZEN staked on a Horizen node, you can just sign the message with the command:</p>



<p>zen-cli signmessage %ZEN_ADDRESS% “%YOUR_EON_ACCOUNT%”</p>



<p>Then head over to <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">the linking page to link your wallet to Horizen EON</a></p>



 4) Voting with ZEN stored on an exchange&nbsp; 



<p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to vote using a ZEN balance that is stored on an exchange at the moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>NOTE: miners may experience a discrepancy between the balance available on the explorer and the one available as voting power. That’s because the new Coinbase output is not seen until it’s involved in the first transaction.</p>

<p></p><p>London, 20th November 2023 – The GBBC Digital Finance (GDF) team led engagements around the world last week. Whilst our policy team and Chair of the Board soft-launched GDF’s Digital Finance All-Party Parliamentary Group in London at Digital Assets Week, GDF CEO, Emma Joyce and GDF Head of Community, Madeleine Boys, made their way to Asia to join many industry leaders, regulators, and policymakers at Singapore FinTech Festival (SFF).</p>
<p>As a prelude to the Festival, Elevandi – a not-for-profit organisation set up by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) – curated and hosted Elevandi Insights, a day of thoughtful roundtable discussions focused on digital finance. AI and Financial Inclusion were both important themes of the day, alongside tokenisation, payments, and digital financial market infrastructure as prevailing discussion topics which set the tone for SFF.</p>
<p>Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised money took the centre stage for the Festival’s payments discussions. Several panels mentioned the crucial role of interoperability in the evolution of CBDCs. Speakers also emphasised its broader application in asset tokenisation, which was highlighted from both the public and private sector – find out more from MAS’ recent <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/guardian/interlinking-networks-technical-paper-vfinal.pdf">“Interlinking Networks Technical Whitepaper</a>”.<br><br>Central banks examined the role of CBDCs as drivers of financial inclusion and vehicles to minimise prudential risks once the onset technological risks are overcome. Large financial institutions and private sector representatives highlighted the importance of tokenised money – whether it be in the form of a CBDC or other forms of tokenised money – as the key to settlement as well as the broader scalability of the industry.</p>
<p>Building on these discussions, MAS published the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/development/fintech/project-orchid/orchid-blueprint-final.pdf">Orchid Blueprint</a> outlining the necessary technological infrastructure for future digital currency transactions in Singapore. This blueprint, derived from insights gained during the Project Orchid industry trials, identifies four essential building blocks to support the effective use of digital money in Singapore:</p>
 
 Settlement Ledger: This component is designed to record digital money transfers, featuring native programmability and the atomic settlement of digital tokens. 
 Tokenisation Bridge: Serving as a vital link, this bridge connects existing account-based settlement systems with ledgers that are compatible with tokenised forms of digital money. 
 Programmability Protocol: The blueprint proposes a common protocol, known as Purpose Bound Money (PBM), enabling the specification of conditions for the use of digital money. 
 Name Service: To enhance accessibility and verification, a Name Service is recommended, translating between complex wallet addresses and alternative name identifiers that are readable and meaningful. 
 
<p>The importance of resilient digital Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI) emerged as another theme in these discussions, emphasising its role as a key enabler to the broad adoption and growth of digital assets. The value of open and interoperable networks among global banks and regulators cannot be understated, and the SFF set the scene for another major announcement in this area.</p>
<p>MAS also unveiled a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiativeshttps:/www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2023/mas-partners-financial-industry-to-expand-asset-tokenisation-initiatives">Project Guardian</a>, which will delve into promising use cases of asset tokenisation on a public blockchain. The most significant aspect is the introduction of new initiative called Global Layer One (GL1), conceived as an open, digital infrastructure fostering cross-border transactions and global liquidity pools. Major institutions such as BNY Mellon, JP Morgan, DBS, and MUFG will participate. This marks a pivotal step toward integration across the entire capital markets value chain, encompassing listing, distribution, trading, settlement, and asset servicing. Key highlights include:</p>
 
 J.P. Morgan and Apollo are collaborating on leveraging digital assets to facilitate more seamless investment and management of discretionary portfolios and alternative assets. The collaboration also involves automated portfolio rebalancing and customization at scale, promising time savings and a reduction in manual processes related to asset servicing. 
 BNY Mellon and OCBC are engaged in a trial for a cross-border FX payment solution, aiming to facilitate secure and interoperable payment solutions across diverse networks. 
 
<p>GDF convened its members its members together on two distinct occasions, both characterised by the same positive atmosphere that resonated with the overall optimistic outlook of SFF.</p>
<p>Our dinner, which we hosted in partnership with Hogan Lovells, focused on the challenges to building digital trust, and facilitating tokenisation of real-world assets (RWAs), and the role regulators and policymakers have to play in balancing innovation with safe regulatory frameworks. Ken Coghill from the DFSA and Danny Russell from the Bank of England joined us and shared some opening remarks on behalf of their agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our lunch, which we hosted in partnership with Clifford Chance, brought together technologists and policy experts for a comprehensive discussion on challenges and essential components for institutionalising digital assets, emphasising ongoing technical efforts to enable financial institutions to leverage public blockchain technology. Malcolm Wright, OKX and former VARA regulator, and John Ho, Standard Chartered, opened the lunch with some optimistic remarks about the&nbsp;direction of travel for industry, with a keen focus on the APAC region.</p>
<p>We could not be more grateful for the continued support of our association’s mission to promote best standards of practice for the digital asset ecosystem, and look forward to continuing to bring together and building our community in the APAC region.</p>

<p>This article is based on a speech delivered at Shift’s Defense Ventures Summit in Washington, D.C. on November 15, 2023. It was <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/defense-tech-values-fight-for-america-boyle">first published</a> in The Free Press, where the article is available in its entirety.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I made a bold prediction, which is actually a bad thing for a venture capitalist to do because we’re so often wrong. During the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reaganfoundation.org/reagan-institute/programs/reagan-national-defense-forum/">Reagan National Defense Forum</a>, I tweeted “Time is Running Out with Silicon Valley.” We needed to figure out how to get the Department of Defense to transform its laborious, unproductive procurement process. If they didn’t, start-up companies with breakthrough ideas were going to abandon military defense and move to more fruitful areas of technology. We had to move faster. We had to act with urgency. Because American defense — and the defense of our allies — depended on us.</p>
<p>And then just a few months later, that prediction became a moot point: Russia invaded Ukraine and reminded us why defense technology is not merely something to debate in theory. We were living in a new geopolitical reality. Time wasn’t running out. The sand was at the bottom of the hourglass. History had begun again, and we understood we were entering a new, violent age that would look different from the recent past.</p>
<p>In that narrow window before the world changed, I also wrote a&nbsp;<a href="https://a16z.com/building-american-dynamism/#:~:text=American%20dynamism%20is%20for%20builders,are%20real%20and%20worth%20defending.">thesis</a>&nbsp;for a new category of technology company. At the time, this felt somewhat controversial, maybe even a little shocking, to my friends in San Francisco. In the essay I stated that my firm Andreessen Horowitz, one of the largest venture capital firms in the world, was unabashedly and proudly declaring its unanimous support for America. That we were betting on America. And that this wasn’t a marketing gimmick or some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20231114-how-esg-came-to-mean-everything-and-nothing">ESG-adjacent&nbsp;</a>nonsense, but a strategy. We’re in the business of value creation. Of taking bets on things that get very big, very fast. We concluded that America and our allies are best off when we’re building technology companies that support the national interest.</p>
<p>We believe a strong America means a strong world. A safer world. A more&nbsp;civilized&nbsp;world, which is a term we should use more. And that technology is the backbone of maintaining this order and civilization and always will be.</p>
<p>We called this movement American Dynamism.&nbsp;In the investing business, it’s all about calibrating risk and sometimes taking bets that others don’t see. But this bet was and is so obvious. It might have just taken a little bit of moral courage to say the word&nbsp;America&nbsp;out loud.</p>

 Episode Transcript 
<p>This transcript has been condensed and edited for readability and clarity.</p>
<p>Seema Amble:&nbsp;Why don’t you start by laying the context of sort of the founding story of Pilot.</p>
<p>Waseem Daher:&nbsp;Sure, so the founding story of Pilot is interesting. It’s very, very intertwined with our whole journey because my co-founders of Pilot were all folks that I met at MIT in undergrad. We’d all studied computer science together and this is actually the third venture for the 3 of us. And one consistent theme across all 3 of the ventures we’ve been up to is they’ve been about solving deeper personal problems. So the first startup was technology that could apply software updates without rebooting. For Linux, this was a problem that my co-founder, Jeff, had in administering Linux systems while at MIT. Our second startup was a group chat tool, which was born out of pain we had communicating with our team in our first startup. And then Pilot, as you noted, we do accounting, we do tax prep, we do CFO services for high-growth startups. The reason we started it is because this was such a pain for us in our previous ventures, and we had deep conviction that the problem could be solved, could be solved better, that the future did not look like what happens today, and we felt we were the ones who could build it.</p>
<p>Seema: And do you want to just walk us through what you thought about as the MVP product and what you wanted to start off going to market with?</p>
<p>Waseem: So we had a very firm opinion up front to say, look, the state of accounting is slow and unreliable and tedious and incredibly manual. We are gonna build a better software tool that will sell to entrepreneurs, it will sell to accountants. And our perspective was no, we’re not gonna do that because I have never ever in my entire life heard a founder or a business owner say, “I can’t wait to buy accounting software.” What the founder says is, “I really need someone to solve this problem for me. I need someone who feels like they’re on my team, someone that has my back that can take care of this for me.” So as a result, we’re a kind of weird-shaped company, right? We’re a tech-enabled service. From our customer’s perspective, we’re an accounting firm, essentially. But of course, when I close my eyes and think about the company, I think of it as a tech company. So, the minimum viable product on day one was, well, you need to be able to do the bookkeeping for your customers. And the good news about that is, they want it done, they don’t really care how it gets done. And what you can do on day one is the same thing any accounting firm anywhere else in the world does, which is you can do the accounting by hand in QuickBooks, which is exactly what we did.</p>
<p>Seema: I feel like a lot of companies in your shoes, the service or the software being provided or sort of the product being provided seems seamless and fully tech-enabled to the customer. However, in the back end, as people like to say, there’s a lot of bubble gum and duct tape. So I’m curious, on exactly what you were offering to their initial set of customers and then what was going on in the background.</p>
<p>Waseem:&nbsp;Absolutely. So we started the company basically in January, 2017. And the first thing we did is we called up startup founders in our network. And the conversation went something like this. It was, “Hey, what are you doing for your accounting or bookkeeping in today? Oh, nothing. Well, what if we do it for you?” And the answer was like, “Okay.” And so what happened is, Jeff and I are literally in QuickBooks doing the books for these companies. And then Jessica is looking over our shoulders and observing like, “Wow, this piece is particularly slow, this piece is particularly error prone, let me write the first few lines of software that will help do the most obvious, most tedious work more accurately, more reliably.” And that’s just like such an iterative process. So when we do it again the following month, well, we run Jessica’s Python script, some stuff happens, the humans do the rest, so on and so forth. And over time, you know, the computer is doing more and more and more. And the account manager, in this case me, is doing hopefully more of the high value, more of the white glove, more of the hands-on experience.</p>
<p>Seema: And did your customers have any sense of what was going on in the background or did they care?</p>
<p>Waseem: Yeah, my perspective is what the customer wants is for it to be done well, and to be done right, and to be done by someone who can intelligently answer the questions. And I think the customer does not really care how that’s achieved. And if that’s achieved via, as it is at Pilot, you know, a bunch of software and a bunch of really talented people, great. If as it is in other firms, achieved by a giant team, you know, in some other geography, as long as the work is good, I don’t think the customer really cares.</p>
<p>Seema: So you, you started with your MVP there and how many folks were working on it?</p>
<p>Waseem: We were fortunate in that basically right out of the gate we were able to raise a pretty large seed round, because it was our third venture, because we had two exits prior, etc., etc. So the first two hires we made were two early engineers. So it was the 3 co-founders and then our 2 initial employees, both of whom were on the engineering side.</p>
<p>Seema: Would love to walk through a little bit around your first customer set, who you targeted, etc. So, you know, tell me about who you first wanted to put Pilot in the hands of and how you thought about your first customer set.</p>
<p>Waseem: Yeah, so the interesting thing about the shape of the problem we’re tackling, accounting, or maybe I should say the back office generally, but if we limit ourselves to accounting, well, literally every business in the world has the problem, ranging from the tiny mom and pop operation to the pre-seed founder to the thousand person company to literally the Fortune 500. And so in a sense, like the TAM or the possible customer was everyone, and so obviously we needed to kind of scope that down considerably to have some hope of building something that had good appeal to an initial customer base we could serve well. And our initial target was technology startups, and in particular, early stage technology startups. And the reason for that is sort of threefold. One is we knew they had the problem, because they were us and we had the problem. The second is they have actually a quite hard version of the problem. And what I mean by that is the needs of the company when there are 2 people and it’s pre-revenue and they’re in the garage, and the needs of the 300 person startup with the VP of Finance and the controller and the full-time finance team are very different. And so if you can actually master the motion for the technology startup, what you know is that you can cover a wide range of scenarios. So intentionally we selected startup founders because we want to avoid over fitting on a particular size or shape or model of customer. And then the third and obviously like quite beneficial aspect of selecting technology startups is they were in network for us. We had good credibility there. It was just an easier on ramp to be able to attract and retain those initial customers.</p>
<p>Seema: How did you pick and choose among the potential startup customers you could be working with? Were there particular stage in terms of like series of funding, complexity of books, or how did you narrow that down further?</p>
<p>Waseem: We were pretty open-minded in the sense that I think we were in the process of discovering kind of where it best fit. And we found that there were sort of two paths. There was net new, like, okay, the company has just existed, they haven’t hired someone, they need a solution, like, we should plug in there. But the other, and it was a little bit maybe surprising that this was an option, is folks who were basically unhappy with their current providers. And the rate of sort of latent dissatisfaction here is actually pretty high. So we have a number of switchers as well. And I think that was an interesting insight in the early days because it actually has a lot to say about the motion with which you acquire companies, meaning if you have to be the first one in because you’re never gonna get ripped out and replaced, that’s very different than well every year potentially you can take a crack at winning the engagement depending on whether the&nbsp; customer is happy with what they’re doing or not doing. Like you’re probably not gonna rip out your payroll system or your corp card or your bank account, or your credit card processing system is just so onerous once those are in to remove them. But what we found is actually folks were very willing to switch from their existing accounting solution over to us in a way that frankly was a little bit surprising in the early days.</p>
<p>Seema: How did you think about that early messaging in the market?</p>
<p>Waseem: In the early days what we really positioned ourselves as like well, we are the tech enabled. We are the modern We’re the like forward thinking like for startups by startups option We really get what you’re about because we ourselves are a startup and like look at our founder startup track records like that was really sort of the narrative that we advanced in our customer base, which was accurate, by the way. And I think that’s what made it possible for them to trust us as a new company, which is like, okay, look, this is a seasoned team, they know what they’re doing, they’ve had this problem themselves, like, sure, I’ll give it a shot.</p>
<p>Seema: When you say sharing the message, what did that mean? I’m curious how much of it was just word of mouth.</p>
<p>Waseem: Extremely word of mouth driven and then we leaned very hard on our investors as well because that’s sort of a natural distribution channel for us which is like okay you have other companies in your portfolio, 100% of those companies have this problem, like can you make some interest for us? And then there’s also some natural like timing stuff like okay the end of the year happens like you have to think about taxes, there’s some times maybe that people are more in market than others and then we just ask our customers very regularly, look, if you’re happy with what we’re doing, are there other people you think we should talk to?</p>
<p>Seema: Did you have a formal referral program?</p>
<p>Waseem: For a long time, it was literally, I just would personally email you and I’d say, hey, Seema, I hope you’ve been having a good experience with Pilot, if you have any feedback from me, please let me know. Listen, if you’re happy, we’d love an intro to anyone else in your network who’s thinking about this. And then of course, eventually we introduced like our referral program that actually monetizes that in some way. But for longer than you would think, we were really kind of resting on the caliber just like that the experience was good. And in particular, the experience just felt a lot better than maybe what you were used to, you know, what you were used to getting from another provider.</p>
<p>Seema: On&nbsp;the investor side, anything that you did to nudge the investors, obviously like sitting in the investor side, we always wish we had the numbers faster and sooner, right? So there’s an aligned incentive, I would think, and that often drives the referrer to act faster. But I’m curious if there was anything you had to do on the investor side to nudge them to act.</p>
<p>Waseem: Yeah, we had a bunch of investors in our seed round, like a bunch of quite prominent angels, folks that honestly I would have paid money to get advice from, so it was nice to get both money and advice. And we used to do a thing in our monthly updates, back then we did monthly investor updates, where we basically had a referral leaderboard. We’re like, thanks to these people for sending XYZ referrals this month. So we tried to gamify it a little bit, which I think for some of our investors definitely did light the fire under them a little bit.</p>
<p>Seema: A common question that comes up is, did you charge the early customers? I’m curious how you guys thought about pricing early on and how much time you spent on it and now reflecting on it, what you think about that.</p>
<p>Waseem: We&nbsp;absolutely charged on day one. I think it’s super important too, because it is the clearest signal that you are actually solving a real problem that folks have. And now admittedly, like we’ve 10x’d the ASP since then. And there’s a lot of course that we do now, that we didn’t previously do, but very clearly we did not pick the correct price point necessarily, or perhaps we didn’t have the brand that allowed us to command the price point we can command now, or we couldn’t deliver the work at the quality that we can deliver right now. I think it is important to charge. I think in the early, earliest days, the pitch was something like, look, people plus software working together, tech enabled, it’s gonna be faster and cheaper and better. And like, I think a big part of the narrative was, technology allows us to make this cheaper. And we’ve pivoted pretty hard away from that, because it’s actually not what the customer wants, particularly… in this kind of high trust scenario. Like folks are willing to pay more if it’s better. Like they care a lot more about it being better than they do about it being cheaper. And if you’re better and comparably priced, that’s actually, I would rather pick that option than the cheaper and less good option. Or maybe the like cute way I like to say this is, you know, people are not looking for the discount surgeon. This is an area where you’re willing to spend a little bit to make sure it’s right.</p>
<p>Seema: Does that mean, you know, you guys ended up, there were people who were not good fits as early customers?</p>
<p>Waseem: Yeah, one class of customer that we still turn away today and a lot of the sales process at the moment is really about making sure that we’re going to be able to do a good job for you. Like you come to us, you’re like, we need accounting. We know we need accounting. You seem good. Like, let’s do it. You’re actually willing to buy in some cases where we’re not a very good fit for you and it’s actually interesting and difficult to kind of train the team to say, well, no, even though you want to, and you’re, you know, you’re willing, you shouldn’t because we won’t serve you well. And in particular, the place is one example today. It’s like there’s a whole class of kind of very small business, like solopreneur type operations where realistically they do not have the budget for any external accounting firm. And now my hope is at some point, you know, we will have advanced enough on the technology side. We will be, we’ll have been able to drive down the prices sufficiently that we can feel the high quality offering for those customers. But today it’s a If that’s kind of the bucket you’re in, the reality is we’re just not a very good fit for you. And we tell you that.</p>
<p>Seema: If you don’t mind me asking, how do you tell folks that aren’t a good fit? Like thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p>Waseem: Well, I mean, part of you’re able to do some of that via pricing, which is your price point is just there’s no intersection between your minimum price and the maximum price they want to pay. And the second is we’re very, we’re very blunt with customers who say, listen, we found that we work best for companies, you know, that spend at least 30 K a month or whatever it is, or that have revenue of a certain amount. And if your revenue is under that amount, you’re probably just like, you probably should not select us. Like our rule of thumb is basically you ought to be spending something like 1% of your total expenses on the accounting. And that kind of like passes the smell test too. Like to exaggerate it, if I were like, you should spend 10% of your expenses tracking that other 90%, like that feels wrong. Like it should not be the case that you’re spending a material amount of your money tracking the rest of the money. So we found that like one, 1.5%, like that’s good and healthy. If instead that number is 10% or 20% or whatever, it’s like, well, it’s just not a good decision for you as a business owner.</p>
<p>Seema: I’d love to talk a little bit about team, given that the team was really technical starting. How did you think about founder-led sales and how long you wanted to do that when you brought your first go-to-market hire in?</p>
<p>Waseem: I’m like the world’s biggest proponent of founder-led sales. I think it’s like the best thing ever. I still do a bunch of sales stuff myself personally now in year, whatever, six or seven of the company. I think people try to leave the founder led sales regime too early and I think it’s a big mistake. I was the pilot sales team for the first year. And then about a year, and basically like around September 2017, so you know, 9, 10 months of the company, we had about 60 customers, we were probably already doing about 250K of ARR, we made our first hire on the sales side, and I was still like quite, quite hands-on, quite directly involved, and then our second hire wasn’t until almost a year after that, it was until August 2018, we had 240 customers, we said, okay, fine, we now have built… enough of a scalable, repeatable process that it makes sense to try to build a professional team around this.</p>
<p>Seema: You waited to hire a go-to-market person.</p>
<p>Waseem: There are so many reasons for that. One is obviously it informs how you think about the product roadmap, there’s all sorts of feedback you get from tiny customers, helps you think about the messaging, because you’re the sales team, you’re the marketing team, you’re the customer success team. You need all of these inputs from the customer. And then also, if it doesn’t work and you’ve hired someone else to be the sales rep, When it doesn’t work, you don’t actually know whether it’s because something is off with the product or whatever, or maybe you hired the wrong sales rep, or maybe you gave the sales rep the wrong message. When you disintermediate yourself from that feedback, it just makes it harder to debug when things don’t work. And then also it makes it harder to improve because you’re not learning as rapidly. So I think folks, like founders should absolutely insert themselves into that stream of knowledge because that’s how you make the company stronger.</p>
<p>Seema: When you hired that first go-to-market person, any particular profile you looked for to kind of complement your background or were you open to different backgrounds.</p>
<p>Waseem: Yeah, so this was interesting because I had also done a bunch of the sales and marketing at our previous startups. So I felt like I knew how to do it, or I knew how to do it as well as a technical founder could. And so what I was really looking for was just a smart, talented generalist who wanted to get into sales. Because there was still a lot we were still learning about who we were selling to and how we were selling to them and kind of what they needed and exactly who we were gonna target. I think we were still kind of feeling like scrapier earlier. And so that first hire was the smart, talented generalist, this woman named Kate, who was awesome. And she and I just worked super, super closely together on all the deals from that point on. And it wasn’t until a year later, until that August 2018, when we hired our next rep.</p>
<p>Seema: Would love to just touch on advice or things you’ve done differently. And you’ve got the privileged position of having gone through this journey multiple times. Would love to hear any advice you have just in terms of what you might’ve done differently or what founders should be spending time on in the early days that maybe wasn’t obvious when you first went through it.</p>
<p>Waseem: Yeah, I think it’s not that this is not obvious, I think it is pretty obvious, but it’s uncomfortable, which is, look, you gotta go get customers. And the reason is because that’s the only thing that really validates whether you’re making something people will want, because ultimately, you’re in the business of, am I making something that people want that they’re willing to pay for? And the only way to determine that is to try and see by talking to people. whether in fact you have done something that they want that they’re willing to pay for. And so the piece of advice is, look, you have to just put yourself out there, and it’s awkward, and it’s uncomfortable, and people say no, and it hurts your feelings, and like, but it’s necessary.</p>
<p>Seema: Itsounds like the still the process of doing that cold outreach, whether it’s the computer club or account in Facebook groups, which we often see, or dental Facebook groups, which is often the way that people sell the dentist, surprisingly.</p>
<p>Waseem: The thing to remember is, in general, not always, but in general, people want to help you. Like, you’re a startup, people like startups, and saying “I’m a startup founder, we’re doing this new thing, I would really appreciate it if you could just spend 15 minutes talking to me.”</p>
<p>Seema: Anything you would just say, looking back, “don’t spend time on this in your initial customer development, it’s not a good use of time.”</p>
<p>Waseem: I think people can get very hung up on like having the thing be perfect, whatever the thing is. Like the product does not need to be perfect, the deck does not need to be perfect, the collateral does not need to be perfect. Like you just have to get things to good enough because the way that they’re going to get to perfect is by like interacting with the real world, not by your continuing to polish it like in your office. And so I think that’s probably just like, I think you got to put yourself out there earlier than you otherwise would and there’s a temptation, there’s an embarrassment that causes you not to do that, and I think it’s ultimately harmful.</p>
<p>Seema: Was there a way that you guys kept yourselves honest to make sure that you shipped and you got it out fast enough, or is it hard to do?</p>
<p>Waseem: It’s hard to do, and I think in the first company, we spent a year writing code before we talked to anyone, if I recall. I mean, this was 15 years ago at this point. So it’s very easy to fall into that trap. Well, oh, we really need this feature before we can whatever. And maybe you do need the feature before it’s a usable product that you can actually sell. But the first thing you’re going to do is not get the sale. The first thing you’re going to do is that market discovery. And you can do that. with nothing but like a little sketch on a napkin.</p>
<p>Seema: Well, thanks so much for joining me, it’s fascinating to hear the story.</p>
<p>Waseem: Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>Our healthcare workers need our help.</p>
<p>Our clinicians are burned out. After the Covid-19 pandemic, only <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/pandemic-s-wake-only-57-doctors-would-choose-medicine-again">57%</a> of physicians said they would choose the field of medicine again. Another recent study reported nurse burnout rates higher than <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37035777/">50%</a>.</p>
<p>Our clinicians are battling mental illness. Approximately <a href="https://chghealthcare.com/blog/physician-suicide-prevention">10%</a> of physicians have reported having thoughts of suicide, and physicians have one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6690303/">highest rates</a> of suicide of any profession.</p>
<p>Our clinicians are feeling less supported and it’s only getting worse. <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/zlnfaxb2lcqx/3VwxiU1yiBvKqZZkOujvy5/77e82d89ec0d3e420e5a3cdad2788cad/DR11373_ELS_COTF_REPORT-EDUCATION-EDITION_2023_V1aw-DIGITAL_WEB.pdf">25%</a> of medical students in the US are considering dropping out.</p>
<p>The implications are devastating and will affect patient care. Health systems face growing staffing shortages, with <a href="https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2022/bain-company-25-of-us-clinicians-want-to-leave-healthcare-and-33-want-to-switch-employers/">59%</a> of clinicians believing their care teams are not adequately staffed. <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/approximately-half-us-hospitals-end-2022-negative-operating-margin">Over half</a> of hospitals are already operating at a financial loss.</p>
<p>Given the burden we put on our healthcare workers, it’s perhaps no surprise that roughly <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752664">one quarter</a> of our nation’s $4.3 trillion in annual spending on healthcare can be characterized as “waste,” and that the largest source of that waste is administrative complexity. Our healthcare providers are being asked to do more with less: they are responsible for navigating complex billing and reimbursement systems, variable coverage schemes, and increasing documentation burden, all while taking greater responsibility for the proactive management of the health outcomes, quality of care, and patient experience of the populations for which they care.</p>
<p>This is not sustainable.</p>
<p>In many ways, the humane core of the profession is at risk. With so many requirements and distractions, the provider-patient relationship is less personal, more pressured, and far less satisfying for patients and providers than ever before.</p>
<p>How can we change this trajectory?</p>
<p>While it may seem ironic, AI solutions may be our best answer to the decaying personalization and humanity of care in the US; as Vijay <a href="https://a16z.com/the-new-industrial-revolution-bio-x-ai/">wrote</a> in 2021, “technology can make human healthcare more human.”</p>
<p>Our view is that 1) the latest advancements in AI offer a massive enablement opportunity to support our clinicians and 2) this can’t happen without the help of forward-thinking policymakers laying the payment infrastructure for AI-enabled care.</p>
 AI can make healthcare more human 
<p>By eliminating much of the mindless work and serving as an always-on copilot, AI tools can be an ever-present, always-ready teammate, freeing providers to spend their time on what matters most—communicating with and supporting the very personal needs and priorities of their patients.</p>
<p>To be clear—the goal in creating new AI tools is not to replace clinicians. It is to make them more successful, and to allow them to spend time on what matters: caring for patients.</p>
<p>We recently wrote about the AI <a href="https://a16z.com/commercializing-ai-in-healthcare-the-jobs-to-be-done/">jobs to be done</a> in healthcare and that building <a href="https://time.com/6274752/ai-health-care/">“specialist” AIs</a> to perform healthcare tasks offers the greatest opportunity for impact. We believe that specially-trained AI models can drive wasteful spending away from clerical and administrative work and towards delivery of care. AI could accomplish this through expert patient triage, clinical decision support, image analysis, care management, and more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The contours of the future are coming into focus. Technology is emerging for AI to augment and enable care. For example, a patient could present at a physician’s office and share symptoms with a nurse, who would “converse” about the symptoms with an infinitely knowledgeable and cheerful AI worker that could instantly risk-stratify the patient and predict the patient’s likelihood of experiencing an acute, time-sensitive event.</p>
<p>Once the patient is taken back to the clinician’s office, an AI physician’s assistant (PA) could listen in to the patient’s complaints as they share with the physician. That AI PA could automatically create a structured note allowing the human provider to focus on the patient during the visit, maintain eye contact and focus, and then review the note afterwards. The AI PA could also capture key documentation essential for coding and reimbursement, reducing the need for coding teams to assess the note and the back-and-forth with providers to optimize reimbursement.</p>
<p>Moreover, the AI PA could assist the physicians and nurses in diagnostics and treatment plan, by offering a thorough, evidence-based differential diagnosis and recommending best options for diagnostic testing that can pressure-test the clinician’s intuition. After the patient is treated, another AI PA could assist in identifying the most appropriate follow-up care for the patient, a task that, without AI, often requires manual and time-intensive phone calls.</p>
<p>For the patient, the AI PA could generate a report in plain English summarizing their diagnosis, treatment plan, and next steps, all using accessible language tailored to the patient’s situation.</p>
<p>In other words, the integration of AI into medical settings does not replace providers, it augments their abilities, allowing them to focus on the higher-order care that they’ve been trained to offer. Diagnostic ability, patient education, and bedside manner could take precedence over typing out medical records and managing billing processes.</p>
<p>From the patient perspective, this future isn’t one with automated, impersonal kiosks, but instead an experience that more closely resembles the ideal of one-on-one time with a trained, caring professional—concierge-level care at accessible prices.</p>
 The policy infrastructure for AI-enabled care 
<p>As this technology continues to improve, the policy infrastructure and evidence must as well. We waste approximately <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752664">$1 trillion</a> annually in the US healthcare system. As AI demonstrates the ability to <a href="https://a16z.com/the-economic-case-for-generative-ai-and-foundation-models/">do more human tasks at (orders of magnitude) lower cost</a>, particularly healthcare-related tasks, it offers tremendous opportunities to lower that bill. Clinicians should be able to drive better results while keeping more of their revenue. The health system must test and learn, and policymakers and regulators have an opportunity to help facilitate that learning.</p>
<p>CMS has taken meaningful strides in supporting new care pathways with the implementation of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) and Remote Therapy Management (RTM) Codes. By creating a vehicle for providers to be reimbursed for delivering virtual and continuous care for specific conditions, CMS is designing a sustainable pathway for investment and development. CMS has signaled an interest in expanding coverage to more conditions.</p>
<p>To further drive uptake and access, CMS should take additional steps to implement reimbursement policies that recognize the costs associated with the utilization of AI-assisted/augmented care. For example, CMS could examine and update the direct cost inputs and indirect practice expenses to assure reimbursement reflects the rapid pace of innovation in AI, and the cost to practices adopting these technological breakthroughs. Moreover, CMMI could recommend and empirically study the impact of AI-enabling interventions within the context of an accountable payment model.</p>
<p>With appreciation of the fact that AI can improve economics for clinicians and reduce waste for taxpayers, we anticipate a considerable expansion of experimentation. And with that expansion will come better evidence to foster inclusion of these technological advances into value-based models, driving better care and better outcomes at lower costs.</p>
<p>Our providers need help, and the technology exists to help shoulder the burden. Through thoughtful policy shifts and patient-centric AI integration, our providers will be able to work alongside AI teammates providing the assistance they need.</p>

 Deploy a bridged USDC token contract with optionality for native issuance  
<p>Permissionless composability is one of the hallmarks of Web3, contributing to the rapid growth of new applications and blockchain networks by leveraging existing open technology. Circle’s <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> is no exception, stemming from the innovations of the ERC-20 standard and countless third-party frameworks to become the trusted dollar-backed stablecoin that it is today.</p> 
<p>As of November 2023, USDC is issued and circulating natively on 15 blockchains – 7 more than last year – and yet it is also clear to Circle and the broader community that many more blockchains may emerge and rise to prominence over the next several years. These new blockchains could benefit significantly from having access to USDC.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to last week. Here's everything that transpired at Panther last week:</p> Marketing Updates  Extension of the Advanced Staking Program <p>Advanced Staking V4 is now live for the next four months and $ZKP holders can now stake their tokens again. This was made possible due to the successful approval of PIP-19 and the commendable efforts of our <a href="https://github.com/pantherprotocol/panther-core/pull/12/commits/eb1a943766befac076922ffd5f7d1d1ceac616fa?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">community members</a> for updating related smart contracts and deploying a new frontend on IPFS. You can learn more about how to stake your $ZKP <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/staking/advanced-staking-v0.5?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol’s CEO, Oliver Gale, at the European Blockchain Convention <p>Panther Protocol’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, joined a panel discussion on web3 privacy along with leaders from Secret Network and Zama at the European Blockchain Convention. This panel was part of the Secret Soiree side event on the final day of the convention. You can watch a recording of the session below.</p> Product Updates  Stage 2 Developments  Recharge Functionality <p>Making further advancements on Stage 2 of the protocol, the development of recharge functionality for Protocol Rewards has been completed and will be announced separately once the vesting of $tZKP is configured. The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>You can learn more about our reward structure <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a></p> Stage 3 Developments  Circuits <p>The main transaction circuit is ready for Stage 3 and the team will perform the unit testing of the Rewards Extended Circuit and Balance Checker this week. Panther Core dApp user interface is dependent on the smart contract interactions and the circuits designed for these interactions. The design of these circuits is planned in stages to cover basic scenarios first and then move to more complex handling of input parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Contracts <p>The main transaction function of the Pool contract which is the foundation for the stage 3 development has been implemented. We expect to complete integration testing by this week. The Vault V1 contract was delivered earlier and is in review now.&nbsp;</p><p>UI/UX DesignA new version of Panther V1 Design is being worked on and the community should expect a brand new design work to be released as part of Stage 3.</p> Community Questions <p>When will the team publish the updated roadmap?</p><p>The team plans to release an updated product roadmap this week. </p>  About Panther <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

Find out how to <a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">apply</a> for your mix nodes below. The winners will also receive dedicated mentorship from some of the Nym community’s most successful operators, including: Pawnflake, Noisk8, Supermeia, Unclelem.</p> Delegation Programme 2.0 — a step towards strong coverage and decentralisation <p>The Nym mixnet is completely powered by the individuals who run gateways and mix nodes. This is real decentralisation in action. But in order to support the upcoming NymVPN, it’s essential that the infrastructure is running as effectively as possible to accommodate large increases in&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>The goal of the delegation programme is to boost high quality nodes to reach saturation levels where they can start earning rewards. The programme will focus&nbsp;on:</p>  Improving the geographical spread of Nym nodes and redundancy of the&nbsp;network  Increasing the number of Exit&nbsp;Gateways  Ensure well-performing nodes are included in the active&nbsp;set  <p>Right now, more than 550 Mix Nodes operate across the world. Every epoch, 240 of these nodes are selected to the ‘active set’ to provide privacy and earn rewards based on their total stake (reputation).</p><p>However, many new nodes do not have enough stake to get them into the active set. Furthermore, the geographical coverage is somewhat uneven. (See: <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym Explorer</a>)</p><p>The Nym Delegation Programme will bring selected, high-performing nodes closer to the ‘stake saturation point’, therefore making them more likely to be picked for mixing traffic and earn rewards. This will ultimately improve redundancy and geographic coverage.</p><p>The Delegation Programme is about scaling and decentralising the Nym network and improving usability of Nym software. It is designed to improve redundancy by bootstrapping well-performing nodes, particularly those in locations with lower coverage.</p> Operators: apply&nbsp;now! <p>Applications are officially open today, 20 November and close on the 1st of December.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">Apply here</a> for the chance of a share in the 30M NYM delegations pot — and becoming a top mix node operator.</p><p>Requirements:</p>  Good uptime of your Nym mix&nbsp;node  Your node is currently under 30% stake saturation  You are willing to run a Nym Exit Gateway (preference given to node operators who already run both a mix node and a gateway. Nym Mix Nodes and Gateways will soon be “smooshed” into one binary. Read more&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/faq/smoosh-faq.html#overview">here</a>.)  Preference is given to nodes that are not using AWS, Hetzner, Contabo or Google Cloud VPS providers (check <a href="https://status.notrustverify.ch/d/CW3L7dVVk/nym-mixnet?orgId=1&amp;from=1697899456550&amp;to=1700491456550&amp;viewPanel=32">here</a> for distribution across VPS providers)  <p>Target geographies:</p>  Priority is given to nodes in countries with more than 15 million inhabitants where there are no&nbsp;nodes.  In particular, nodes are welcomed in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Philippines, Egypt, Nigeria, Turkey, Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bangladesh, South Korea, Algeria, Kenya,&nbsp;Ghana.   Key info   Applications open today — apply&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">here</a>  Applications close 1 December and winners will be announced 15&nbsp;December  A total of 15m-30m NYM in delegations up for&nbsp;grabs  Between 50 and 100 mix nodes will be selected for delegations  A delegation amount of 250,000 NYM from the treasury, to bring nodes to a saturation level that at minimum should get them into the active set approximately 80% of the&nbsp;time  Winning nodes will receive mentorship from successful Nym community operators  The programme will run for 1&nbsp;year   Final note: Nym node&nbsp;settings <p>Nym node operators set their own operator costs (which are redeemed first to cover the cost of operations) and their own profit margin (what the operator claims as profit). The rest of the node rewards are then distributed to people who have delegated stake to that&nbsp;node.</p><p>Now, what has been happening over the past few months is we have seen operators set their profit margin to the minimum in order to attract delegations, but then adjusting their operator costs to sky-high levels. This is considered dishonest behaviour as it tricks delegators and forces a race to the bottom, with operators competing on who has the lowest delegations.</p><p>In order to address this problem, a minimum profit margin will shortly be set to 7% and a maximum operator cost of 2,000 NYM&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>If you have any questions or comments — please get in touch via operator channels in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Element</a>, <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Telegram</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>!</p> Resources <p><a href="https://nymtech2.typeform.com/deleprog">Application form</a></p><p><a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym mixnet&nbsp;explorer</a></p><p><a href="https://status.notrustverify.ch/d/CW3L7dVVk/nym-mixnet?orgId=1&amp;from=1697899456550&amp;to=1700491456550">Nym mixnet stats</a> (brought to you by&nbsp;<a href="https://notrustverify.ch/">NTV</a>)</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/operators">Nym node operator&nbsp;guide</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/faq/smoosh-faq.html#overview">Project Smoosh</a> (technical roadmap for Nym&nbsp;nodes)</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/exit-gateway.html">Running an Exit&nbsp;Gateway</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">Nym is not a blockchain but is powered by one</a> (learn about the difference between a Nym node and validators)</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-delegation-programme-is-now-open-c371c74610c5">Nym node Delegation Programme is now open</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Plants have long produced potent human therapeutics and contributed to over 20% of drugs approved since the 1980s, including Morphine and Artemisinin. Although monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), a promising class of plant-derived compounds with unique pharmacological properties that have already produced drugs such as the chemotherapy vinblastine, could help to revolutionize treatments in mental health and pain management, obtaining sufficient quantities of MIAs for the development of new drugs remains a major challenge due to reliance on natural sources and difficulties scaling chemical synthesis, both of which severely limit the quantities of MIAs that can be produced.</p><p><a href="https://biomia.com/">Biomia</a> has developed a platform for mass-producing plant natural products, particularly MIAs, using engineered yeast. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-krogh-jensen-1a589b6/?originalSubdomain=dk">Michael</a> and <a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/jie-zhang">Jie</a>, now Biomia’s CEO and CSO respectively, led the collaborative research effort in partnership with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-keasling-6783754/">Jay Keasling</a>, a well-renowned researcher and entrepreneur in the field of synthetic biology and a Scientific Advisor for Biomia, funded with $10 million by the EU through the <a href="https://www.miami-project.eu/">MIAMI</a> project, a $3 million grant from the Bio-Innovation Institute in Denmark, as well as substantial soft-funding from the Novo Nordisk Foundation. Their breakthrough Nature <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05157-3">study</a> showcased de novo microbial biosynthesis of vinblastine (brand name Velban®), a clinically-approved cancer treatment molecule, achieving the longest biosynthetic pathway replicated in yeast. Expanding upon their initial discovery, the team has also achieved the ability to enhance natural molecules with chemical halogens, creating the possibility to develop novel drugs inspired by natural products with enhanced therapeutic properties — and potentially fewer side&nbsp;effects.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>MIAs are a promising therapeutic class to treat pain, mental disorders and substance abuse disorders, all indications with markets &gt; $10bn globally each, and with an urgent need to develop novel therapeutics. Alone the growing opioid crisis has amplified the need for novel, effective pain medication and therapies for substance abuse, and most anti-psychotics have severe adverse effects with no alternative treatments available. We believe Biomia has the potential to harness its drug discovery and MIA manufacturing platform to revolutionize the treatment landscape for numerous mental and physical disorders through countless novel, nature-inspired molecules.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing the Biomia team on their mission to mass-produce plant natural products from some of the world’s most intractable diseases and additions.

<p>Sales wants more features. Product gets bogged down with one-off requests. Progress and growth grinds to a halt. It’s a familiar story. In this conversation recorded at ELC 2023, Segment’s former CRO Joe Morrissey and former chief product development officer Tido Carriero discuss how they turned sales-product tension into a successful $3.2B acquisition.</p>
<p>Tido: Thank you. We’re excited to be here. Joe and I worked at the hip for several years at Segment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I hop into my part of the story, maybe I’ll, ask Joe a question.</p>
  Joe’s start as CRO 
<p>Tido: Joe, what were your first impressions of me? And feel free to tell some of the lower moments at the beginning of our relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe: The first time I met you was in the interview process. And for me, you were one of the big reasons I joined the company.</p>
<p>I thought, “wow, this is going to be a great engineering partner to work with. He really gets it.” And then when I joined the company, you and I had a meeting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And your feedback to me was, “look, this product is great. The problem is the sales team. The sales team don’t know how to sell the product. they could do it when we were small. Because when we were small, we could put every single salesperson through product training&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then they just went out and sold. And now that we’re big, we can’t do that anymore. So my advice to you is, put everybody through product training.” And immediately I thought, “Oh boy, this is going to be more difficult than I thought.: Because I fervently believed that salespeople shouldn’t be selling on product and features.</p>
<p>They should be selling on value. And we really didn’t do that at Segment. I think that was one of the root causes of our challenges. And so, as I went around and I interviewed some of the other executives, I heard similar things. But I also heard different things about what the product was, and I was totally confused. So at one of the first e-team meetings I attended, I asked everybody to write down the answers to 3 questions. What problems do we solve for our customers? How specifically do we solve them? And how do we do that differently or better than the competition? There were 6 people in the room, and when we went around the room to have everybody read out their answers, we got 6 different answers. And what was clear to me was like, &nbsp;we had built a great product. We’d actually built lots of great products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And at one stage, I think we came to the realization that we had built too much. Now, sales was partly to blame for that, as we’ll talk about later. But, we didn’t have a focus on who to sell to, what to sell to what to sell, and what value to articulate around that.</p>
<p>And so, that’s what I set to work on doing, in the first year: trying to drive some clarity around that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So now maybe you can talk about the low point.</p>
  The low point: annual planning 
<p>Tido: A little bit into Joe’s tenure, we were, tasked with doing annual planning together. And I have this memory, I was halfway on vacation in Tahoe, but trying to do annual planning. And I was so frustrated with Joe, and what I felt like were these impossible set of priorities.</p>
<p>The key piece, as I think about the story now years later, was this alignment around value drivers. And it was not the most fun session we’d ever done. It was 48 hours basically locked in a room.</p>
<p>But it was Joe, maybe 3 or 4 of his top- performing AEs, SEs, &nbsp;people who really had had a lot of success selling to different verticals and segments. We had several folks from my team, several of our longest-tenured PMs, all the co funders, most of the exec team. And we just sat there and asked ourselves these incredibly simple questions, which in retrospect, how we made it to tens or low hundreds of millions in ARR before we had ever really asked ourselves these questions blows my mind. But I think that clarity of, what the value was that we provide our customers, what they are really paying for, and what they care about was the thread that really started to unite us and started to bring us on the same page so that we could have a clear list of things to go after. A big piece of that and a partnership I hadn’t had on the go-to-market side was I finally had a partner who was really going to say: we do these 4 things incredibly well, and if you are not one of these 4 things, it’s actually revenue that we’re going to say no to. And so, once I realized that I could really rely on Joe to hold the team accountable to the boundaries we set together, that started to unlock, I don’t know, beautiful alignment and things we could go tackle.</p>
<p>Joe: So maybe I’ll let Joe tell a little bit of the story of the annual planning process and what we agreed on.Sure.And, you know, I remember I went at you really, really hard,&nbsp;but we had a huge number to do the next year and most of it–almost all of it–was coming from sales capacity, right? So I knew we were going to have to hire a lot of people.</p>
<p>It seemed like an impossible hill to climb. And historically, Segment’s growth had come from us building new things, launching new products. Before I arrived, the company was like launching products all the time. It had a tremendous product velocity, right? &nbsp;And now, all of a sudden, we weren’t able to build anything anymore. For my entire time there, we hadn’t launched a new product and a lot of what we had wasn’t quite working.</p>
<p>So as we started going through the annual planning process, Tido, you sent me a list of 25 things that you could build in the next year, and you asked me to rank them 1 to 25.&nbsp;And as I looked through the list of things like HIPAA compliance and cloud prem solutions that our customers were really, really clamoring for, I thought, “there’s no way we will build any of this,” right? And so I went back to you and I said, “Look. Just do three things, okay?”</p>
<p>Let’s get product quality nailed down. Two, let’s make the platform extensible, right? And that was really, really important because we had to build up professional services. We had partners who could do things themselves if we had made the platform more extensible. And that would mean that there would be less lift on the engineering organization. The engineering organization would then be able to build more product later. But if we didn’t do this, we would never get ahead of the ball. And then the third thing was multi-region support. Because a big part of the number that I had to deliver the next year was international expansion.</p>
<p>And without it, without multi-region support, all the people I had hired and all the investments we had made in EMEA and APAC, we would just have to let those people go. And I didn’t see any other way to make the number up. And so I felt pretty happy about myself, going, you know, “aren’t I a good guy? I’ve just said no to 25 things and I didn’t ask Tido to build anything new.” And instead you started pushing back on all of those things eventually. And I was so frustrated. I felt like I can’t make this number. The partnership is just not working.&nbsp;</p>
  Building a more focused product roadmap 
<p>Tido: Yeah, I had always, had in the back of my mind this spare capacity of 40–50% for customer emergencies. And so, I was still operating under that capacity assumption that there were just going to be all of these customer emergencies where someone had sold slightly outside of the lines. You know, 40-ish percent of capacity going to solve these little emergencies here and there, which are often were featurettes that no one had ever really said we did, but the marketing materials kind of said we did, and it was a reasonable assumption that we did it based on where we were with the contract.</p>
<p>And so, the big unlock for me, and I think what I needed to lean into more from a trust perspective, was that Joe was really going to be a different kind of go-to-market partner. We had zoomed way out. We had looked at a multi-year strategy, not just a list of 25 features and ordering them quarter by quarter by quarter, and we had really aligned that we can hit this plan together over the next 12 months and set us up for another good 12 months after that, if we do these 3 foundational things.</p>
<p>And so, a big piece of the puzzle for me was going back to the team. And the team had been accustomed, of course, to shipping several of these new features every year, at least, if not more often, and several of these customer emergencies, and saying, “pretend we don’t have to do any of that. Really, how fast can we do multi-region?” That was the really big one, multi-region. We had had a very senior engineering team look at that very closely and the estimates had come back several times that it was like a 24-month project. And that was delivered in, I think it was 13 months. That was because we had freed up all of this other capacity. </p>
<p>And so,&nbsp;the thing Joe brought to the table here was that we’re really going to tell customers if we do not do one of these things, that we don’t do it. We still would like them to be customers and, you know, here’s an SE workaround or here’s what you can do on the platform and build it yourself, or we can give you services to help fill in the gaps here.&nbsp;But we weren’t going to just endlessly promise that engineering will fill in the gaps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe: So just on that point, Peter later remarked that it was interesting that the best annual plan that we ever did, which came out of the struggle that you and I went through, was one that he was totally not involved in or there for. Which kind of spoke to me of, like, the learning is always in the struggle. You’ve got to go through this tension, you’ve got to embrace it, and you’ve got to find a way to resolve it on both sides. Because out of that comes platform for, driving growth. And I think one of the things that can happen is you avoid the tension, you avoid the conflict. You say yes to things that maybe you’re not comfortable with, both on the product and on the go-to-market side, and then the plan goes wrong.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But I’m curious, Tido, now that you are founder and CEO of Koala,&nbsp;you’re leading both engineering product and sales. What have you learned now that you’ve crossed over to the dark side?</p>
  Why GTM feedback is essential to building great product 
<p>Tido: You know, I think my biggest learning is to get someone to the point where they are so excited about your platform and they are ready to go and there is one little rough edge that seems like a pretty minor thing in the grand scheme of things of the platform, but it prevents their whole use case. And how frustrating that is as a seller to not be able to really learn from what’s going on in reality in the market. And you feel incredibly connected when you’re having dozens of these conversations a week with customers. And so, I wish I had realized what a valuable resource the go-to-market feedback was back at the time, because this truly is a megaphone that is blasting the message with 100 people or 200 people, and they’re also collecting all of this feedback about exactly what’s going right and what’s going wrong.</p>
<p>I just don’t think I had a appropriate appreciation for both how hard it is to get someone on the brink of really committing to a large deal with you, and I wish I had done things a little differently in retrospect. But the other big piece is just how valuable that feedback is when it can be synthesized.</p>
<p>Obviously, a platform can’t be everything to everyone, but that synthesis and those mechanisms for getting scaled feedback… I actually think the stuff we were getting from our sales engineering team—those were like Joe’s real product specialists—sales engineering team, CSM team, some of the best AEs, some of the best AEs in particular regions, some of the best AEs in particular segments, all of that stuff is just like A+++ feedback. And over time, I’ve come almost to appreciate it more than what a PM is going and getting. When I think about what a PM is doing, they’re randomly reaching out to 3 to 8 people. And often these go-to-market experts have spent, you know, 100 calls in the last quarter or 2 and just have a lot more breadth, and sometimes even depth, than what a PM team can go do.</p>
<p>So, a lot more appreciation for all of that feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cool. Should we open it up for audience questions?&nbsp;</p>
  Identifying value drivers in 48 hours 
<p>Audience: Thank you for the inspiring story, the struggles, and everything you shared.</p>
<p>Tido: You’re welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audience: I think you guys went from a lot of chaos to a lot of clarity in how you described the 25 items and then getting it down to the top 3. What kind of exercise or annual planning or rhythm did you use, or do you usually use, to get to those value drivers that you talked about?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe: We used an external firm to help us build this. I think that’s always valuable because they don’t have a dog in the fight and they can help facilitate. What’s super important here is you’ve got to bring the founders, you’ve got to bring the heads of product, you’ve got to bring head of marketing, head of sales, you’ve got to bring all of the executives around the table and they’ve got to be committed to that. And then, you go through a pretty deep discussion around what is it that we sell? What problems are we trying to solve? How do we solve them?&nbsp;And where have we done that? Because the customer feedback is super important. </p>
<p>And for those that don’t know what a value driver is, I should probably explain that. A value driver is the top-of-mind concern that your customer or your buyer has that is on their mind whether you show up or not, right? Whether you exist or not. And typically, all they’re thinking about is: how do I reduce cost? How do I avoid or mitigate risk? How do I grow revenue? Or how do I accelerate time to value? Every value driver maps to 1 or more of those 4 concerns, right? And if you can’t, as a company, articulate how your product can solve those problems for your customers, you’re not going to resonate with your customers. And then what you may end up doing on the product and engineering side is just responding to, very often, poor feedback from a go-to-market team, who tell you things like, &nbsp;“if you just do this thing for this customer, then we’ll close this big deal and we’ll make the quarter.” And then the next quarter comes along, and it’s another customer with another thing. And before you know it, now you’ve built a bunch of custom products for lots of different companies and your product roadmap is all over the place. And you find it very, very hard to focus and actually make progress on almost anything, right?&nbsp;And then you end up supporting lots of custom deployments.</p>
<p>And so, if you get very clear to begin with around what is it we’re going to solve, what types of customers then have those problems, and what will we say yes to and what will we say no to, then your product roadmap starts to evolve very clearly. And then where the sales leader has a big responsibility is, they’ve got to enforce discipline throughout the organization. They’ve got to stop the, you know, “I need this feature for this deal to close”-type of hero behavior.&nbsp;“If I sell this company that’s outside of our ICP (ideal customer profile), then we’ll be able to do a big deal there.” And it’s really hard when your sales leader saying no to that. But if you do that, you build trust with the product team, and then you can ask the product team to do things for you.</p>
<p>Tido: Yeah. I would just +1 how important the cross-functional thing was. Joe was very insistent on day 1 that it was a CEO, all founders, all exec team, and top performers from both the go-to-market and product org coming together for 2 days to do that. And I just think there’s so much information that gets locked up when you’re not having this free-flowing conversation between all of these parties. So that was one key thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the annual planning process that we actually ended up running was pretty similar to every other one we had run, but it was a couple months after we had just really deeply understood what it was people were using Segment for today and what they wanted to be able to rely on it for at a bigger, more enterprise-ready scale. And so it was pretty clear to us that all of the annual planning needed to come back to this value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audience: I’m just curious. The external company came up with the 3 values, right? When you did the 48-hour meeting, did they stay the same? Or did you completely change them? Or just make some changes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tido: Oh, we were writing them live in that 48-hour meeting. I mean, it was two days on site. So we started with a blank template that said, “you need to fill out 2 or 3 of these value drivers.” We had a bunch of customer research and inputs and then also people from the field. But we were actually sitting there with Google Docs open, writing the value drivers. &nbsp;It was an interesting process. We wrote too much and all of them kind of got a little bit bland. We said, “ugh, we need to really tighten this up.” And what’s the essence of the things we’re really trying to say?</p>
<p>And so it ended up being like a kind of diverge, converge, diverge, converge-type process. But yeah, it was collaborative writing, talking about customers, saying like, “does this fit what these 4 customers are doing with us?” Really trying to get to opinionated things that didn’t just sound like the least common denominator, but really something with specificity that we could go make a PMM campaign against. We could think it was really a differentiator in a sales call. And we could go to the product team and say, “Hey, this may not fully work yet, but this is what we think people want from us.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Joe had an interesting subtle point though, which is it really has nothing to do with your product, the value drivers exercise. You’re explaining problems that exist in the world that your product happens to solve really well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so that was one of the key things, because my head had always been like, “what’s the feature list?” And there’s only 1 very tiny spot in that value drivers exercise that the product even makes it in. It’s called “required capabilities.” But you need to describe the problem, the before consequences, what will be true about the business if this problem is solved, i.e., more revenue, or less cost, or less risk, or whatever. And it doesn’t even come until what’s required to do it where the product even shows up. And so you’re really talking more generically about problems and solutions in the world, but they don’t know the answers to these questions. It’s locked in the heads of your go-to-market team.</p>
  How technical should sales be? 
<p>Audience: That’s good to know. And the other question that is just something I’m curious about, is: I work with different organizations and we have this org where the sales team doesn’t dig into the product too much and has the sales engineer to do the demo. But on another team, the salespeople do the demo themselves. Just wondering Joe, how deep do you think a salesperson should go on the product?</p>
<p>Joe: I think that depends a lot on the product and the business. I’ve sold everything from very simple solutions to very complex ERP. But I generally think that the salespeople are better off not doing demos and trying to step back and talk about business problems and trying to get at what the customer’s value drivers are. Before you ever talk about the product, you want to understand: what is the pain of the company has? What’s the impact on the company’s performance because of that pain? What would the world look like if that pain was solved? What would all the positive business outcomes be? Then, what did the company think the required capabilities are to get there? And how are they going to measure success?&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s a lot to do discovery on. And only then should you talk about, “here’s how our product does it, here’s how we do it differently and better than the competition, and here’s where we’ve done it before.” Right? And so, the more you can delay that point of talking about your own product and focus on the customer’s pain, the better you’ll be able to sell, the more trust you’ll build with your customer, and the better positioned you’ll be to win.</p>
  How annual planning changed day-to-day operations 
<p>Audience: Thank you for a great story. While annual planning is a good forum to build that alignment, how did this change the day-to-day operations on the ground for the rest of the year?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe: That’s a really great question. Let me start on the sales side. So,&nbsp;once we got this clarity on who we were, what we wanted to be when we grew up, and how we were set up to sell, we started developing a, a multi-year roadmap for how the product should evolve. And in any startup, I think that’s so super critical because one of the areas that Segment got itself into trouble was it ended up going upmarket way before it was ready to do so.</p>
<p>And I think we landed a bunch of enterprise deals really early on that were very big. And we then assumed, “hey, we’ve got product market-fit in the enterprise with these giant deals.” But what we had was false signal. We had product-market fit in a very, very small part of a huge market. And it wasn’t going to be for years until we could do things in the product like, build machine learning into it, build marketing automation, journey orchestration, that we would truly be able to address the needs of the enterprise. And I’ve seen this happen at every company I’ve ever been at.</p>
<p>So that was the first thing I think we got really tight. And we both knew that we had a responsibility to evolve both the product roadmap and the go-to-market motion in tandem, because it’s not just about the product that you can deliver for your customers. It’s also about how you sell that product. Because you sell in the enterprise in a very different way than you sell in SMB. And in our case, our SMB customers didn’t need any help to get it implemented. But with our enterprise customers, we were probably part of $100M digital transformation project run by Accenture. And so we needed to build professional services and an SI relationship, a whole bunch of different things, to just to be able to sell and make those customers successful. So that’s the first thing. </p>
<p>The second thing I think, day to day, we just got way more customer-focused. I think both teams have been very inward looking previously. And to Tido’s credit—and I’ll give him all the credit for this—he drove a program called Lighthouse, which I’ll let him talk about.&nbsp;</p>
  Segment’s Lighthouse program 
<p>Tido: Yeah. Lighthouse was, I don’t know if it was my program, but, between us and the customer success team, we would, highlight 2 or 3, customers that were either having trouble or, sometimes, we’d do a positive one on a huge expansion opportunity. But we would bring to a weekly meeting 2 or 3 customers. The go-to-market team would prepare an awesome, maybe 10-minute presentation of what’s going well, context on why it was purchased, what problems we were hired to solve, context on what the needs were—either from the product side or sometimes the needs were actually more from the professional services side. Sometimes they needed an SE assigned to the account. It could be a lot of different things, but it was a forum that the account team, and sometimes there was a product manager working with the account team, could bring to product leadership, me, sales leadership, Joe, support leadership, this awesome guy named Steve DeVito.&nbsp;And this was the chance to discuss all of the most miserable and tough situations. And that was the way that, if we did need to do a shift to product planning for the quarter or for the month or for the week or for the day because some emergency was happening, we would funnel everything through Lighthouse.</p>
<p>What I loved about it is it really got the account team to be thinking very critically and strategically about what the status was, why we really need this thing. And then it let all of leadership together, not in separate meetings where separate things are happening, analyze and commit to a solution.</p>
<p>And so it wasn’t that we never deviated from those 3 annual planning things ever, ever, ever. It was that the volume of those things was much, much, much less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re not doing something like that today for your most challenging customers, your biggest upsell opportunities, I would highly recommend a program like that as the entry point for getting on the same page in a more weekly, tactical point of view.</p>
  Reorging to deliver on new product priorities 
<p>Audience: My question is: when you decided on these 3 goals, did you have to reorganize the organization to align to delivering? How did you reorganize your team? And also, how big was your team and how big was the company at that time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tido: Yeah, great question. I had a policy that I talked about with my team, which was: we’re going to do a reorg every February. Because we’re going to get the annual plan locked in by the end of January, and we’re just not going to have perfect alignment. I would say my goal with those kinds of reorganizations was to try to touch as few manager-report relationships as possible because I wanted as much continuity for the engineering team and engineering leaders to have similar reporting structures. I would say on any given year, it was usually about 10% to 20% of people would actually switch managers. &nbsp;This year was probably a little bit higher because it was a little bit more of a tectonic shift, but it probably wasn’t higher than 30%. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah, the team was probably about 200, 300 at the time, in terms of like eng, product, design, security. And then sometimes it was like, we’ll take this whole team and give them just a slightly different roadmap and purpose. And that was always the hardest thing because you’re canceling the thing that they were working on for a while, and it requires some finesse to explain why this other thing is even more important. One of the things I found, though, is once people really understood the vision that Joe and I had forged for the next year or 2 and how this specific team connected to that value driver—which was so important for the 2-year future—people were pretty malleable and pretty excited to go work on that thing.</p>
<p>The last thing I’ll say about once a year is that I was at another company where like it felt like there was as soon as a reorg ended, there was always another reorg starting up. It just gives the employees a ton to talk about and worry about and think about.&nbsp;I think just having a cadence, I think about once a year for like series B through D, is about the right time to revisit things. It helped prevent some of the distractions that I had experienced at other companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And not being afraid to do it is the other thing. I mean, if the company has a strategy and the team is not supporting that strategy, you should not be spending $20M, $30M, $50M a year on slightly wrong strategy because it’s uncomfortable to reorg. It took me a while to appreciate that, but I did get there eventually.</p>
  The role of engineering in developing the product roadmap 
<p>Audience: Thanks out for the lovely discussion. So how much were the engineering leadership involved during your, annual plan? It sounds like it was mostly between GTM and product. Maybe product played more of a bridge role, but how were the engineers involved?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tido: Yeah, engineers quite heavily involved.</p>
<p>I mean, as we had those 25 things that we were thinking about, we had engineering leadership heavily involved in sizing all of those things, giving us not an incredibly precise, but a rough swag of, comparative sizes.&nbsp;As Joe and I were talking about those and it became more clear that actually these 3 key goals to support this key value driver and this move into the enterprise was actually the thing, before I committed to anything, all of the engineering leaders needed to take a pretty good look and figure out exactly how long this was going to take. Their numbers came back a little bit longer than my own gut intuition was and what Joe really needed. And so part of my role was helping figure out ways to bridge the gap through reorganization or thinking about the problem differently or pushing on the eng leaders to get a little bit more aggressive with the timing,&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I would just say, more than anything, it was a lot of iterations. So it was like a conversation between me and Joe, and then it was like iterating on a first pass of like, “hey, let’s just see what we can come up with for 2 hours of brainstorming.” Let me show that to Joe quickly. Joe would be like, “oh, I don’t actually care about this and this, what I really need to be able to say is this in the positioning message.”</p>
<p>And so I thought of it as 20 iterations, where each iteration was 30 to 60 minutes of thinking about it. And then occasionally the eng team would be like, “okay, well, we need to really run down what it’s going to take to migrate these 50 services.” And so that was a little bit more time intensive. I would say it was about a month of planning, and we probably did about 20 iterations on this until all parties were comfortable. But I think the antipattern here is having eng go into a room for a week and figure something out without checking with the sales engineers.</p>
  Leading a platform initiative&nbsp; 
<p>Audience: Thank you for sharing such an authentic story. I work in a SaaS company and that really resonated with me. My question is a little bit of a follow up about your effort to build a platform. It’s easier said than done. I feel the pain of that already taxing my engineering team. Can you share a little bit more about the strategy and how committed the leadership needs to be to make that happen? Thank you.</p>
<p>Tido: These kinds of platform investments are always tricky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things I found is, when you’re really leading a true platform initiative, it kind of needs to be a “stop the world” moment One of the platform initiatives–and this isn’t actually the one Joe and I were just talking about—but we wanted to basically make it possible that anything you could do on the website, you could also do via API. We wanted a full control plane API. And that was just a tough one where I had to insert a top-down mandate that 1 of these 2 quarters—you could either do it Q3 or you could do it Q4—you needed to go follow the spec against the control plane spec, and you needed to build out all of your functionality to match that API.</p>
<p>For those kinds of initiatives, I like to lead with a really strong core team that goes and does it for the first couple product teams so that they really understand, almost as the customers of needing to use the API patterns they’ve set up. And so usually, you can get the core team to do about 40% of the work. But then at some point, you’ve got to go insist top-down from the rest of the product teams to go fill in some of that work. So those kinds of broad platformizations I found to be particularly challenging, and they needed to ladder up into those kind of year-long missions. Otherwise, it just felt like extra work no one could take on.</p>
<p>Maybe the other learning from the one that Joe and I were talking a little bit more about was having an internal customer. And so, first, having his sales engineering team, and then it was his professional services team, as the first customers was so powerful because what was happening was that some of our biggest logos had always come to my team to go build a couple of random integrations into whatever services. They could now go to Joe’s team. Joe could charge them $200,000 a year, and we would have a customer paying for the platform development against our own API, and all of that was happening internally. Obviously, we were very motivated if it was, like, Nike or whoever, to support both the 7-figure ARR contract, and then also sometimes the 6- or 7-figure services contract. And all of that was happening with Joe’s team acting as the customer into my team doing the platform stuff. And so as much as you can set up that kind of situation, which comes from having an awesome go-to-market leader who really is not afraid to ask customers to pay for the things that are not part of the vertical offering, but are things that they should be paying for. That was really the unlock for that sort of functions project that we were talking about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audience: That’s all the time we have for questions today. Thank you so much to our panelists for a very engaging session.</p>
<p>Tido: Thanks for having us.</p>

<p>We are firmly in the <a href="https://a16z.com/2017/06/21/jorge-conde-bio-fund/">century of biology</a>. The last two decades have seen explosive advancement in biomedical and therapeutic innovations, like the <a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project">Human Genome Project</a>, the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2020/10/popular-chemistryprize2020.pdf">discovery of CRISPR</a>, and the <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/company-and-platform-machine-that-made-vaccine-mrna-vaccines-sVOUwQOc">rapid development</a> of Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, to name a few.</p>
<p>This rapid innovation has been fueled by an unprecedented amount of investment. Despite the recent slowdown, venture capital investment in the biotech sector in the US ballooned to nearly <a href="https://www.svb.com/trends-insights/reports/healthcare-investments-and-exits/healthcare-investments-and-exits-annual-2022">$25 billion</a> in 2022 from just under <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/biotech-record-funding-in-2000-bolstering-research-now/article1179313/">$4 billion</a> in 2000. Pharma R&amp;D investment likewise increased from <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-04/57025-Rx-RnD.pdf">$38 billion</a> in 2000 to <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-04/57025-Rx-RnD.pdf">$83 billion</a> by 2019.</p>
<p>These investments have yielded an extensive array of new types, or modalities, of medicines. Each new modality—like gene therapy or RNA-based medicine—gives us new capabilities that expand our therapeutic armamentarium. As they enter our pharmacopeia, they enable us to tackle disease in new ways and even pursue previously intractable conditions.</p>
 <p>Source: Andreessen Horowitz research.</p> 
<p>Each new modality needs to find its <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/01/08/platform-disease-fit/">platform-disease fit</a>—the diseases it is uniquely suited for. But finding fit has increasingly turned into a fight; many have crowded into the same indications. With an expanding arsenal to treat disease, how will patients, clinicians, and the market determine what tool to use?</p>
 Herding class  
<p>Drug development is a competitive sport. Typically, the first drug to get across the finish line, wins: first-in-class drugs become the standard of care, dominate market share, and tend to maintain that advantage even after new entrants arrive. Companies with first-to-market drugs are better versed on the market, and treating physicians like prescribing what they know. They’re the ones to beat.</p>
<p>“If you’re not first, you better be bringing something worthwhile. We spend a lot of time talking to doctors trying to really get a flavor for how satisfactory is that first mover? If the answer is pretty darn good, then it’s gonna be very hard to displace,” says Josh Schimmer, MD, of Cantor Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>If you aren’t first-in-class, you need to raise the bar and become best-in-class. Fast followers have caused “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-023-00063-3">herding in the drug development pipeline</a>;” 68% of targets pursued by top 10 companies face at least five competing assets. Crowding stifles innovation and bottlenecks clinical trials—there are 56 PD(L)1s currently in development! But <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd4035">late entrants</a> have proven there’s opportunity in improvement, as demonstrated by the GLP-1 drugs vying for obesity’s massive market: Novo Nordisk’s first-in-class Wegovy and Ozempic will likely be overtaken by Eli Lilly’s recently approved and <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/27/eli-lilly-weight-loss-drugs-obesity-novo-ozempic/">more efficacious Zepbound</a>.</p>

 
	<a>

 Class warfare  
<p>The arrival of new modalities can dramatically shift these dynamics. Potentially curative approaches, like one-and-done gene therapies, have raised the prospect of last-in-class therapies. With a curative therapy, the market could become fully captured as patients are cured. Earlier this year, eight clinical programs were pursuing sickle cell disease. After Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics submitted their cell therapy for FDA approval, three rival programs were quickly shut down.</p>
<p>But the same rules may not apply when different modalities enter the same disease indication. The “best” therapy should win the market but it’s of course not that simple. Each modality brings its own pros and cons and different patient segments will weigh them differently. So in addition to bringing patients much-needed hope, these new medicines will offer them choice as well.</p>
<p>“Best” will become increasingly subjective, but here are some of the factors that can determine a new modality’s position on the commercial battlefield:</p>
 Affordability, accessibility, convenience 
<p>Drug affordability and access is a moral and economic imperative. New modalities are often challenging and expensive to develop and manufacture—gene therapy can be $2 million+ per dose! Many patients simply cannot afford or access them, so less expensive approaches like small molecules are more likely to reach those patients. Convenience matters too. Some may prefer a one-and-done gene therapy; others might find it more convenient to take a pill every day.</p>
 Curative potential and safety 
<p>The most safe and effective therapy should win. Gene therapy and editing approaches offer the promise of one-and-done cures, but they’re also permanent; patients cannot be taken off the drug if safety issues arise. Small molecules or oligonucleotides don’t have that same drawback but are less likely to be curative. Safety and efficacy can be two sides of the same coin.</p>
 Programmability 
<p>Traditional modalities like small molecules are highly bespoke; one molecule has little bearing on the next molecule that gets developed. Newer modalities like gene therapy are inherently <a href="https://a16z.com/what-is-a-medicine/">programmable</a>—they can reuse components, like the delivery vehicles used to target specific cells while swapping out the genetic cargo, enabling several programs to be generated from the same underlying engine. Companies with programmable modalities may be able to develop de-risked drugs, faster and cheaper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These dynamics are already playing out for a handful of indications crowded with differing modalities. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a real-time example.</p>
 Working classes: the evolving SMA market  
<p>Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a rare genetic disease that affects roughly 10,000-25,000 people in the US and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by mutation of the SMN1 gene and results in loss of motor neurons and progressive degeneration. Treatment was historically limited to supportive care. The prognosis was bleak. But in recent years, three therapies that target the underlying genetic causes of SMA—by making more SMN1 protein—have emerged, each a different therapeutic modality.</p>
 <p>Despite the massive impact of these three drugs on patients, there is still work to do in SMA. Patient access and newborn screening remain a priority.</p> 
<p>First approved in 2016, Biogen and Ionis’ Spinraza is an antisense oligonucleotide that <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/fda-approval-of-life-saving-sma-drug-is-hailed-by-its-researcher-inventor-at-cshl/">revolutionized</a> the treatment of SMA. Even though it’s administered through an invasive spinal injection every four months throughout the patient’s lifetime, Spinraza had a first-to-market advantage in a market with significant unmet need. In its first year after launch, Spinraza generated $884 million in worldwide sales, growing to ~$2.1 billion by 2019.</p>
<p>In 2019, Novartis’ Zolgensma became the second approved drug. An AAV-based gene therapy with potential for a one-and-done lifetime cure, it was approved for infants less than two years of age. But it comes with a hefty price tag of $2.1 million and questions about its <a href="https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/two-deaths-after-novartis-zolgensma-bring-gene-therapys-liver-safety-spotlight-again">safety</a> and <a href="https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-shares-zolgensma-long-term-data-demonstrating-sustained-durability-75-years-post-dosing-100-achievement-all-assessed-milestones-children-treated-prior-sma-symptom-onset">lifetime durability</a>. Regardless, Zolgensma emerged as the market leader in newly-diagnosed infants upon approval, generating $920 million in its first full year after launch. It became the physicians’ preferred medication; no doctor was inclined to wait before initiating treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2020, Genetech’s small molecule Evrysdi entered the treatment landscape. Evrysdi is taken orally daily and must be taken throughout the patient’s lifetime. It was an instant hit in the US—one year from launch, it became the most prescribed SMA treatment with over 16% market share. In the first full year after launch, Evrysdi generated over $650 million in worldwide sales, almost doubling its sales the following year.</p>
 <p>To understand the success of the launch of the three marketed medicines, we examined equity research analysts’ product projections within a year of launch and then compared it to the actual sales each one of them generated. Source: Annual reports and company filings; projections from equity research reports.</p> 
<p>What can be learned from the market dynamics playing out in SMA? The first-mover advantage was real for Spinraza. Biogen remains the revenue leader, having generated approximately $10 billion over Spinraza’s lifetime (as of YE2022)—value creation that resulted in a recent <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ionis-and-royalty-pharma-enter-into-royalty-agreement-for-up-to-1-1-billion-to-further-advance-ionis-genetic-medicines-and-commercial-readiness-301716470.html">$1.1 billion</a> royalty deal. New entrants with better long-term efficacy potential and convenience are catching up with Spinraza. Despite difficulties with patient access and its high cost, Zolgensma has become a blockbuster. Convenience of dosing helped Evrysdi quickly gain market traction. While the newer entrants took and will likely continue to take market share from Spinraza, the arrival of new modalities has expanded the total market by nearly 50% in just two years, from $3.0 billion in 2020 to $4.4 billion in 2022, as more patients get access to treatment with each new drug.</p>
 <p>Source: Annual reports and company filings</p> 
<p>SMA is just one example where different modalities battle for market share. Moving forward, we expect emerging competition within Factor XI anticoagulation, hypercholesterolemia, Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, CD19+ tumors and autoimmunity, among many others.</p>
 Class dismissed  
<p>The advancement of new therapeutic modalities is great news for patients. But how should company builders and investors think about indications crowded with modalities? Aside from identifying new and better targets to pursue, the easy answer is that it’s complicated and context dependent. But here are a few takeaways:</p>
 Efficacious and safe drugs win 
<p>Perhaps an obvious statement, but in a world with many different modalities, the best patient outcomes should always win.</p>
 It pays to be first, so get there quickly 
<p>There is immense value to be gained from arriving first to a market, even if your market share is eventually supplanted. </p>
 Your new modality could be last-in-class 
<p>A first modality on the market may not necessarily prevent other modalities from entering, but is positioned to become “first and last-in-class” within the same class (i.e. the first curative gene therapy may prevent other gene therapies from entering).</p>
 Don’t forget about the patient 
<p>The physician and patient experience is critical when developing an innovative new modality. Convenience, pricing, and patient/clinician risk tolerance should be considered from the outset.</p>
 Small molecules can do big things 
<p>A general rule of thumb: all things being equal, a small molecule is preferred. Convenience and price point are big factors. Newer modalities may raise the bar but small molecules are beginning to achieve many feats previously only thought possible by other modalities.</p>
 There’s room for multiple modalities 
<p>Due to differing patient risk appetite, physician preference, and affordability, several modalities could be viable in one space. To make a dent in an indication space, companies must be able to clearly articulate what value their new modality brings and why it is differentiated from others.</p>

Traditional VPNs know your identity and your browsing history. By using a VPN you might be somewhat shielded from the website or service you are using, but you are entrusting your online privacy to a centralised entity. This exposes you to a single point of control, leaving your data vulnerable to potential breaches, harvesting and surveillance. This creates a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>In short, there is absolutely no need for your VPN to know everything about you in order to provide a good service! In fact, holding all this user information puts both you and the VPN service at risk of data breaches and surveillance. The need for a truly decentralised, privacy-enhancing alternative is painfully evident with the increasing frequency of data breaches and cyberattacks.</p><p>Secondly, when you pay for your VPN, your transaction is routinely interconnected with your online activities, creating a trail of data that can be traced to your digital footprint. This linkage poses a critical privacy risk, as it not only compromises your anonymity but also opens the door for third parties to potentially connect your identity with your specific browsing history and internet usage patterns. The implication of such visibility is far-reaching, often resulting in privacy infringement, unwarranted surveillance, and targeted profiling.</p><p>The exposure of this sensitive information leaves users vulnerable to a range of security risks, including identity theft, data mining, and invasive advertising. There is an urgent need for a more robust and privacy-preserving payment solution that cannot be linked to your online activities, and instead preserves your digital integrity and autonomy.</p><p>And finally, encryption and secure transmissions are important but just not enough to safeguard online privacy. These might protect the content of your communications, but not the patterns of communications. To put it differently, the protection of metadata — the data about your data — remains a formidable challenge.</p><p>Metadata can reveal a great deal about your online behaviour, relationships, and even your state of mind, leaving you exposed to potential tracking and surveillance. Most existing technologies fall short of protecting metadata, leaving a critical gap in your privacy defences. Someone watching the entire network can use the metadata and analyse patterns of communication to deanonymise and learn a lot about you, your location, relationships and habits and what you are doing&nbsp;online.</p> Introducing NymVPN <p>The underlying technology used in NymVPN addresses each of these major vulnerabilities.</p><p>Firstly, NymVPN runs on the fully decentralised Nym network and uses a novel onion encryption such that the app and infrastructure simply cannot know anything about your online activity. Each packet you send looks exactly identical, and each hop through the network only knows the next hop and nothing else about the destination.</p><p>Secondly, the novel zk-nym scheme can be used to prove that someone has paid for the NymVPN, but delinking any wallet address or credit card details from usage of the app. This means you can fairly pay for the service without leaking any unnecessary data points. This will be a huge step and effectively the first live use-case of zk-nyms as a means to anonymously prove right of access to apps and services.</p><p>And last, but not least, NymVPN will have two modes in one app: a speedy 2-hop wireguard VPN and a mixnet mode for strong metadata protection. This will allow you to select different modes for different needs, so that your streaming, for example, can happen over the 2-hop mode uninterrupted, while more sensitive messaging, emails and transactions can take place over the mixnet for strong protection. R&amp;D into split-tunneling is currently also taking place, which would allow you to set your preferences per app. If there is enough demand, this will become a priority!</p><p>This is an open invitation to privacy experts and enthusiasts to join the NymVPN on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">Matrix</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/824256813200834580/1174608947697684480">Discord</a>.</p><p>Help ensure that NymVPN solves real-world problems and can confidently be launched as one of the world’s most trustworthy and privacy-enhancing technologies.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-an-invitation-for-privacy-experts-and-enthusiasts-63644139d09d">NymVPN — an invitation for privacy experts and enthusiasts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

      The Next Billion Developers         
	By David Cahn	 





Published November 15, 2023
        The developer revolution will be as important as the AI revolution.      



 
<p>Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is Silicon Valley’s latest obsession. Brilliant minds like <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/elon-musk-reveals-xai-efforts-predicts-full-agi-by-2029/">Elon Musk</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond">Sam Altman</a> believe achieving AGI is not just likely, but inevitable. Others disagree. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_i-think-the-phrase-agi-should-be-retired-activity-6889610518529613824-gl2F/">Yann LeCun</a>, one of the godfathers of machine learning, has said “there is no such thing as AGI.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23779413/silicon-valleys-ai-religion-transhumanism-longtermism-ea">Jack Clark</a> of Anthropic has described the “breathless enthusiasm” for AGI as a “misplaced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3M2DaQxTihc">religious impulse</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a lightning rod, AGI captures our imagination. AGI promises <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-altman-on-the-a-i-revolution-trillionaires/id1548604447?i=1000525043188">free education and housing</a>, the eradication of poverty with universal basic income, and a reallocation of human capital to science and art. These are worthwhile objectives.</p>



<p>But what if AGI is a distraction? What if there’s another path to this same future—one that does not require a technological leap of faith and is already underway?</p>



<p>There are more developers today than ever before. And the population is starting to snowball. Our thesis is that bringing 1B developers into the software economy could rival AGI in terms of its economic impact.1</p>



<p>Software engineering is one of the most powerful tools that humans have ever invented. If we can make it even more widely available—assisted and accelerated by AI—it could result in the automation of many non-tech industries, creating an economic surplus.</p>



<p>But is this target of 1B developers really achievable? Isn’t software engineering too hard to teach to so many people? And what would we do with all those developers?</p>



<p>Let’s start with the goal of 1B developers. This year, the developer population crossed <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">100M</a>, up from 24M when Github first started reporting the metric in 2017.2 In Github’s recently published <a href="https://github.blog/2023-11-08-the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/">State of the Octoverse</a> report, they shared that the global developer population grew 26% in the last year. Github added 21M new accounts in 2022.</p>



<p>We have three reasons to believe hypergrowth in the developer population will persist.<br></p>



<p>First, it’s been getting much easier to become a developer, and we expect this flywheel to continue. In just the last decade, Cloud abstracted away the server. Databases like MongoDB and Postgres simplified the back-end. Vercel and React reshaped the front-end. The best software engineers continue to focus on improving the discipline itself. By iteratively building better and better abstractions, software engineers have created a flywheel that reduces complexity while increasing potency. As a result, a 12 year-old in India can now build a web app in a matter of days, something that would have taken a professional developer weeks before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, market forces continue to attract more and more young people to become software engineers. Already, the best and brightest are disproportionately learning to code. Rather than dampening as more talent has entered the field, the economic returns to software engineering only seem to be expanding. What this means is that the productivity of software engineers, and the applicability of their skills, is expanding faster than the supply.</p>



<p>Third, AI has been an unanticipated accelerator. Today, <a href="https://github.blog/2023-02-14-github-copilot-for-business-is-now-available/">Github Copilot</a> is writing 46% of users’ code. <a href="https://zapier.com/ai">Zapier</a> enables developers to build automations with text descriptions. <a href="https://openinterpreter.com/">Open Interpreter</a> is turning the command line into a chat interface. With AI copilots, we may eventually be able to program computers using natural language alone.</p>



<p>Growth in the developer population enables the software economy to broaden its scope and impact. For example, companies like Stripe, Twilio and Plaid have created essential building blocks for payments, telecommunications and banking. Traditional companies in mature industries are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/despite-mass-layoffs-led-by-meta-its-still-hard-to-fill-tech-jobs.html">bringing on</a> more and more software engineers to drive internal digitization. Newer startups are also taking software and AI and applying these technologies to sectors like mining, robotics, construction, accounting and legal. The opportunity with 1B developers is to drive automation not just in the digital economy, but in the physical economy as well.</p>



<p>Unlike AGI, the promise of 1B developers is not about eliminating work altogether. Rather, it is about taking our resources—human resources—and leveraging them to have more and more impact. Thus, the story of the coming decades may be about the increased power of AI. But more quietly, the methodical march of the developer revolution will continue.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/replit-remix-the-internet">Amjad Masad</a> was one of the first visionaries to articulate this goal and has been at its forefront

 The internet and friends 
<p>You’ve most likely had an experience like this:</p>
<p>One day, you wake up with a hint of a headache and a sniffle. You sneeze. What do you do next? You Google it. You eventually land on WebMD. Was that sneeze a common cold or a bout of seasonal allergies? Or are you in fact dying from a rare form of nasal cancer? You determine you should see an allergist. But which one? How do you find a good one? Does your health plan require a referral? How much is this going to cost you? You text a friend who is a nurse, and another who works at the local hospital, hoping they’ll guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>If so, you’re not alone. <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/google-receives-more-than-1-billion-health-questions-every-day">1 billion</a> health-related queries are submitted to Google every day, and 7% of overall questions asked to Google are health-related. WebMD is frequented by over 180 million people every month. It turns out that a broad set of the population turns to the internet and friends to figure out what their health condition might be, and which doctor to go see for it. In industry speak: the internet and your friend are today’s “front door to healthcare.”</p>
 A better way 
<p></p>
<p>While the Google –&gt; WebMD –&gt; Friend protocol may be a common way to enter into the healthcare system, it is certainly not an optimal one. Most of us are not well-equipped to self-diagnose from a list of possible conditions, and our friends who work in healthcare often don’t have the exact expertise we need. But when we turn to this protocol, what we’re effectively looking for is:</p>
 
 Someone who knows enough to help us navigate to the right type of service (e.g. should we go to the urgent care clinic, or does this actually require a specialist?) 
 Someone who knows the inside baseball of which specific doctor to see, and how to jump the scheduling line to get a timely appointment 
 Someone who knows a little about how the insurance billing system works to prevent us from paying for something that we don’t have to 
 
<p>We’ve <a href="https://quorasessionwithjulieyoo.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-healthcare">long imagined</a> a version of the healthcare future in which every human has an all-knowing, empathic healthcare companion who fulfills these criteria based on personalized data—like a real life <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbKSvOfqxF0">Baymax</a>, the healthcare robot from the movie Big Hero 6.</p>
<p>But this isn’t entirely in the realm of fiction. The aforementioned tasks are what large language models (LLMs) are well poised to be tuned to do—e.g. exhibit college graduate-level smarts, follow some rules, send programmatic instructions to third-party software systems to take an action, and help provide empathetic, patient guidance to someone who is likely feeling stressed and confused due to uncertainty about a health issue.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they can escalate to a trained professional if they encounter a high-risk use case, or based on preference of the user. Hospitals and provider groups already hire hoards of their own call center agents to triage inbound consumers and make sure they are getting to the right site and type of care—because getting this wrong could mean wasting scarce appointment slots by sending the patient to the wrong type of doctor.</p>
<p>As such, we are optimistic about the opportunity for a specialist LLM to serve as a far more effective future front door to healthcare, integrating into a <a href="https://a16z.com/2023/04/07/healthcare-marketplaces-where-art-thou/">healthcare marketplace</a> to enable people to book appointments and pay for their care.</p>
<p>From a patient perspective, the experience would also be much smoother:</p>
<p>One day, you wake up with a hint of a headache and a sniffle. You sneeze. What do you do next?&nbsp;You turn to your Baymax-like app, input your symptoms, and after a few follow up questions, it predicts— given your current location, the weather, your recent sleep scores, your diet, and your personal trends—that you’ve got allergies. It offers you a same-day appointment with a nearby allergist covered by your insurance to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, it recommends you try an over-the-counter allergy medication, offering to have it delivered to your house. It orders extra tissues for you, for good measure.</p>
 The size of the prize 
<p>Not only is this business a great opportunity to improve human health, patient experience, and provider experience, but the business case is also very clear.</p>
<p>First, the traditional businesses mentioned above are quite lucrative today. Health information sites like Google and WebMD make the majority of their revenue through ads; in 2016, the year before WebMD was taken private, it did <a href="https://www.webmd.com/corporate/press/20170216/webmd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2016-financial">$561 million</a> in advertising revenue. The healthcare and pharmaceutical industry spends an estimated <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/235966/us-healthcare-and-pharmaceutical-industry-online-ad-spending/">$18 billion</a> a year on digital ads alone, usually advertising on condition-specific searches that indicate a consumer’s intent to engage with a specific healthcare product or service.</p>
<p>B2B revenue is also quite large for these businesses; WebMD offered “private portal” health information services products to health plans and employers that generated $114 million of revenue even back in 2016. Accolade, a comparable employer- and payor- sponsored navigation business, generated $300 million revenue in 2022.</p>
<p>Add to this the opportunity to monetize transactions once the LLM integrates into a marketplace of services that can be directly booked, and numerous revenue streams worth billions of dollars in aggregate become possible.</p>
 The next WebMD 
<p>While a big, white, puffy healthcare robot like Baymax is a possible manifestation of the future front door to healthcare, perhaps a more realistic one is an LLM tied to a healthcare services marketplace. We envision a not-so-distant future in which the daunting task of navigating the healthcare maze is significantly simplified for both patients and providers, with a viable business model to boot. When that happens, you’ll no longer need to self-diagnose, and your healthcare friends will thank you.</p>

      Finding Her Place in the Sun         
	By Harry Spitzer	 



Published November 14, 2023
        Lynn Jurich’s unwavering determination to unlock cleaner, greener energy powered the rise of Sunrun.      



 
<p>In March 2023, solar entrepreneur Lynn Jurich took the stage for the Stanford Graduate School of Business’s Climate, Business &amp; Innovation Summit. In the 15 years that had passed since she had attended the school herself, solar energy had come of age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time in history, the cost of solar energy has fallen below that of fossil fuels, and Sunrun, which Jurich co-founded in 2007, is now the largest installer of residential solar panels in the U.S., with more than 800,000 customers in 20 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico. Her unwavering determination to change energy infrastructure (and the world) is what brought Jurich back to GSB that day. But these achievements, and the survival of her company, were never a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich took her audience back to Sunrun’s early days, to a time when consumer solar was still the wheelhouse of “hippies and hobbyists,” and installation and hardware were expensive. Back then, Jurich and her co-founders had waded through the complexities of the green energy space without a clear sense for how to make their business model, much less the world, sustainable. And they were perilously close to burning through their venture capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our initial vision was that we would be pretty asset-light,” Jurich told the audience. “The existing solar installers out there would be doing the construction and selling to homeowners. We would raise the capital, and own and monitor the systems. So we’d only need a few employees. But we were wrong. Very, very wrong.”</p>



 



<p>The sun had already set, but the teenage Jurich refused to go back inside without sinking a few more shots. She wouldn’t feel content calling it a day until she was, according to her sister Tracy, “basically shooting NBA free-throw percentages.” Focus, which in this case earned Jurich a spot on the Pac-10 recruiting list for basketball by 8th grade, had been Jurich’s speciality since kindergarten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At five years old, Jurich had started writing to-do lists. “My list would be like, ‘invent something.’ Or, ‘make a scientific discovery,’” she remembers. At age six, reading biographies became her pastime of choice, an activity that suited her introverted nature. She’d go to the public library in her neighborhood near Point Defiance, a lush peninsula jutting into the Puget Sound, and work her way through their nonfiction section. She had lots of things she wanted to accomplish, and was looking for proofs of concept. “I was always attracted to people who mastered their craft,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her early favorites centered on strong women: Florence Nightingale, Betsy Ross, Anne Frank. But fittingly, no biography captivated her more than that of Thomas Edison, inventor of the lightbulb (and 1,000 or so other things). In a prescient 1931 exchange between Edison and Henry Ford, Edison notes, “We should be using nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind and tide.” (According to recent sources, the sun produces enough sunlight to power Earth’s electricity needs for a year every hour.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But truly mastering one’s craft was no easy feat—Jurich had internalized this from her biography obsession. It required resolve and concentration, which Jurich maintained through high school and then college at Stanford, where she earned top honors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After graduating, Jurich landed a competitive role at a prestigious private equity firm. Her job was to get in front of entrepreneurs by any means necessary—cold-calling, attending the same conferences as them, befriending their assistants so that she could sit next to them on a plane—and evaluate them for potential investment opportunities. This was daunting for the self-described “strong introvert,” but once she worked up the nerve she found that pushing herself had an important upside. Like her biography kick on steroids, she got to observe dozens of highly accomplished individuals modeling potential paths to success, an experience that made it clear to her that “if there’s a good company out there, it’s going to get funded.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After three years working on the investor side, she needed no further proof of concept. “It was just very clear to me that I wanted to be on the entrepreneur side,” says Jurich. This hard-earned clarity led her to return to Stanford for business school.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“How do we get people to give solar a shot?” It was January 2007, and this was the question Jurich, Ed Fenster, a Stanford GSB classmate, and Nat Kreamer, a childhood friend of Fenster’s, had been debating for weeks over pizza and Diet Coke in the living room of Fenster’s San Francisco apartment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’d filed the paperwork for their company Sunrun just a few days earlier, officially making this question of particular interest for the group. Jurich was fresh off a summer banking internship in Shanghai, where she had been struck by the density of construction and urban energy infrastructure. She couldn’t stop thinking about clean energy and how to make continued infrastructure development more sustainable. Kreamer was recently back from a tour in Afghanistan and motivated to seek energy independence after fighting in a war he’d concluded was mostly about fossil fuels. Fenster had connected the dots, uniting the team in his apartment to solve the challenge of solar expansion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fueled by cheesy carbohydrates and artificial sweetener, they concluded that the real opportunity lay not in developing cleantech, but in deploying it. “We saw that VC money was already being put toward making solar panels cheaper. We were quite certain that innovation was going to happen,” says Jurich. “So we thought, ‘Why don’t we solve the problem of convincing people to give solar panels a shot, and figuring out how to interface with the electric grid?’ That was gonna be the bigger challenge and the bigger area to add value.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer they settled on was to lower the barrier to solar adoption as much as possible for homeowners. Sunrun would offer ‘solar-as-a-service,’ leasing solar panels with a small upfront cost at a time when owning and installing one’s own solar panels was still logistically challenging, and prohibitively expensive for many. “The business model innovation was that we would put solar panels on your rooftop for very little money, and you would sign a 20-year contract to buy the electricity from us for X cents per kilowatt hour,” says Jurich. “So it was a long-term contract for us, the customer didn’t have to spend the money up front, and they could get cheaper power. Win-win all the way around.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going the consumer route, as opposed to leasing solar panels to corporations, was an added challenge, however. It meant figuring out how to install and operate panels on houses of all shapes and sizes in varying conditions around the country. But if they could manage all of that, Jurich believed this approach would ultimately make a more defensible business. “We believed costs would hit grid parity first at the consumer level because consumers pay the most money for power,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By narrowing their focus to homeowners, the founders were actually thinking bigger—not only would they be spreading clean energy, they could reduce inefficiencies in energy infrastructure. “What’s really innovative about solar is you can use an existing roof,” says Jurich. “You don’t have to acquire land. You don’t have to build big transmission lines. You don’t have to interrupt the ecosystem.” The value prop and climate impact seemed undeniable. They’d soon find out it wasn’t such an easy sell.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>Jurich’s voice was hoarse from hollering at passersby. This was her third county fair in as many days, dusty and hot, and a far cry from her time in private equity traveling on private jets (which, at least on an environmental level, felt like karmic justice). Again, Jurich had found herself in the challenging situation of having to talk to strangers. This time, Jurich was donning her company swag (an oversized white tee that read, “A penny for your watts?”) and standing next to an oversized pumpkin. She was desperate to make a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fenster, they decided early on, would take the role of CEO and focus on raising capital; Kreamer, as president, would take on installations, billing, and system monitoring; and it was up to Jurich as COO to build out their business pipeline (read: sales). She had deduced that the quickest way to sell consumers on solar panels was to go straight to the source. “This was 2007. There weren’t a lot of people online searching, you know, ‘I want a solar energy system,’” says Jurich. “So we were like, ‘Where do you find a homeowner who would be interested in Sunrun?’ I decided to go to places with lots of homes and lots of sun.”</p>



<p>From the rare fair-goer who agreed to chat, Jurich gleaned that “going green” still wasn’t enough—they were willing to consider solar only if it saved them money. Even after Sunrun’s upfront costs (initially about $10,000 for installs, still well below the cost of buying and installing one’s own panels), Sunrun would save them money, but only over the course of years—a commitment most consumers weren’t willing to make with a startup that had existed for just a few months. “What I always told them was, ‘If someone came to your house and said they would install a gasoline tank, and you could buy gas for $1 per gallon for the next 20 years, would you do it? That’s what we’re offering: Electricity at a fixed price for 20 years and it’s cheaper,’” says Jurich. “People thought it was too good to be true.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After dozens of refusals, Jurich finally caught the attention of a woman named Sue who ran a trucking company. Jurich made her pitch, highlighting the fixed, long-term rate, which was much lower than traditional electrical costs. She told Sue that Sunrun would own, operate and maintain the solar panels on her roof, but that they outsourced sales and installation to existing solar installers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sue, excited to bet on a young female entrepreneur, was convinced. And Jurich, after months in the summer heat hawking her solar wares, made her third sale (Sunrun’s first sale was to Fenster, and the second was to his therapist). “Seeing that there was actually consumer interest in this helped me so much,” says Jurich, “It gave me the conviction that this was gonna work, that all the hustle was worth it. That conviction can get you through some pretty hard times.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hard times turned out to be just around the corner, and she’d need all the conviction she could muster.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>“We’re done for,” Jurich thought as she read the headlines announcing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Bank. It was September 2008, and Sunrun was desperately in need of funding—money that suddenly seemed entirely unattainable.</p>



<p>Sunrun’s early sales had put its business model to the test. Since the company was covering most of the upfront purchase and installation costs, its ability to sell was contingent upon its ability to raise money. But banks wanted proof of sales before lending. “We had a chicken and an egg problem,” says Jurich. The co-founders were forced to use their seed money—a few million they’d managed to raise from contacts in private equity and banking—to finance their earliest installs. But with dwindling funds and no guarantee that they could secure investments to stay afloat, “it made for an extremely stressful time,” Jurich says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They had finally managed to raise $12 million in June 2008, a lifeline as sales were starting to take off—but nothing close to what they needed to scale. Just as new term sheets began to come their way, Lehman Brothers went under, signaling a complete collapse of the financing ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every day, another bank pulled out of negotiations. Sunrun’s point of contact would be fired, or the entire financial institution would dissolve. But then, in November 2008, there came a flicker of hope. The Sunrun founders received a callback from U.S. Bank, the rare financial institution that hadn’t been decimated by the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing this was likely their only shot, the founders negotiated a deal they hoped would be hard to refuse. “We were panicking,” Jurich says. “But at the same time, we were like ‘We are going to close this deal because we have no choice.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2008, Sunrun closed a $40 million debt financing round from U.S. Bank. “Looking back, we call this moment our big awakening,” Jurich says. Fenster agrees. “Had we not gotten that deal,” he says, “the company might not have made it another four months.”</p>



 



<p>Six years after bringing Sunrun back from the brink, Jurich’s sense of solar inevitability was feeling like less of a moonshot with every passing day. For one, Sequoia became a believer (and led Sunrun’s Series C), as did traditional energy giant, PG&amp;E, who had invested an additional $100 million to finance installations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which isn’t to say things were entirely sunny. Solar gaining traction threatened most other incumbent utilities, who did all they could to block Sunrun’s growth through lobbying. And then there were the government subsidies—hugely positive in the ways they pushed growth in a sustainable direction, but wildly destabilizing from a business perspective, with one subsidy or regulation unlocking a market one month, and an expiring subsidy making another disappear the next.</p>



<p>In 2009, the Obama stimulus package extended a solar tax credit to homeowners who bought their own system. This lowered the purchase price of solar panels overall, which made it harder for Sunrun to convince homeowners to buy into their leasing model, in particular paying for the company’s upfront installation costs. “That blew up our whole transaction model,” says Fenster. Jurich and Fenster, by then co-CEOs (Kreamer left the company in 2009), decided they needed to eliminate upfront costs entirely in order to remain competitive. To compensate, they increased their new customers’ monthly payments while still managing to stay below traditional utility rates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their new no-upfront pricing structure made it easier than ever for homeowners to give solar a shot, but not enough to edge out their competition. Elon Musk’s SolarCity had just gone public and was starting to outpace Sunrun. And SolarCity had something crucial that Sunrun lacked: their own operations and installation capabilities. Seven years in, Sunrun was still essentially operating as a management and financing company, relying on third parties for construction, installation and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If they wanted to scale, Sunrun would have to take over the third-party labor themselves. This, of course, required a huge amount of capital that Sunrun didn’t have. But, no stranger to complex negotiations, Jurich and Fenster managed to secure a massive acquisition of their largest installations partner, REC Solar’s Residential Division (AEE Solar and SnapNrack), in an all-equity deal as a workaround. Overnight, Sunrun grew from 150 employees to 550. That same year, signaling just how much Jurich had grown as a leader since her days of reluctant cold-calling, Fenster stepped down as co-CEO of Sunrun, and Jurich stepped into the role. “Lynn was a better head for the company than I was,” he says. “There are really smart people who are excellent at making decisions but who aren’t great at managing people. Lynn’s unique in that she can do both.”</p>



<p>Poised for expansion, and in the wake of SolarCity’s IPO, the pressure was on for Sunrun to follow suit. “I knew we needed to go public,” Jurich says. “There were a handful of solar IPOs that had just happened that we didn’t believe in, and we thought they were gonna spook the market. So I didn’t really feel that I had the luxury to slow down at any point in the process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not even when she learned she was pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jurich’s daughter Blythe was born just a few weeks before Sunrun’s IPO on August 5, 2015, and was in Jurich’s arms when she rang the Nasdaq bell. “I got on a conference call the day I got home from the hospital, and my mom moved in and helped me,” says Jurich. (While Jurich, who had her second child in 2018, didn’t take maternity leave, she expanded maternity leave benefits for the rest of the company, signaling that she didn’t expect others to make the same choice that she had.)</p>



<p>Sunrun’s share price dropped roughly 20% on its first day of trading, which only fed Jurich’s resolve to be as present at the company as possible. She started her investor roadshow when Blythe was just five weeks old, bringing her mother and a nurse along for support. “I was constantly pumping and shuttling milk back and forth between hotels and hedge fund offices,” Jurich says. “It was exhausting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2017, Sunrun had rebounded from its post-IPO dip to become the largest publicly traded rooftop solar company in the U.S. following Tesla’s 2016 acquisition of SolarCity. After years of fundraising, surviving a recession, battling incumbent utilities, navigating company altering climate legislation, IPOing and becoming a mother, Jurich felt like things were finally in a good place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s when the Wall Street Journal article came out.</p>

<p>In the May 2017 piece, former Sunrun employees claimed the company hadn’t reported order cancellations that may have affected sales data in financial disclosures leading up to the IPO. Jurich denied all wrongdoing, claiming the journalism was “not representative of the company and suspect.” Despite Sunrun’s assurances, the article triggered a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) of Sunrun and its competitor, SolarCity. Sunrun’s stock bottomed out. And shareholders filed a class action suit against Sunrun.</p>



<p>Jurich remembers this time, as her company’s reputation and her own integrity were called into question, as one dominated by a profound sense of grief and powerlessness. Ever since her days of writing her first to-do lists, she’d been laser focused on success. But suddenly, no amount of resolve, no degree of hustle could change the way the world perceived her and her company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, months after the initial article broke, Sunrun released a statement saying that after conducting an internal audit, the SEC didn’t find any evidence of manipulated sales data. Still, the company ended up making a $30 million settlement with shareholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although Sunrun’s name had technically been cleared, in the weeks following, Jurich continued to struggle emotionally from the toll the probe had taken. For the woman who had defined so much of her life by her achievements, this failure—which she certainly saw it as—felt existential. She faced a choice: “Your options are either to crumble because you can’t deal with it, or to figure out how to keep going and operate at a higher level,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the first time, she decided that “higher level” didn’t mean working harder. It meant “reflecting on my values, starting a meditation practice, keeping my fitness going, and not caring too much about what other people think,” says Jurich. She was able to let go, minding public perceptions less as her company slowly but surely regained its footing and earned back consumer trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then, from their all-time low in share prices, something surprising happened. “The WSJ article was an interesting inflection point for the company,” says Fenster, “because after it caused the stock to bottom, momentum started to come back.” Over the next two years, Sunrun’s stock rose roughly 400%, signaling to the world that Sunrun had staying power.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Just before Thomas Edison’s death, in that same 1931 conversation with Henry Ford, he said, “I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.” Today, Jurich feels closer than ever to paying out her hero’s bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2007, Sunrun has deployed 5.7 gigawatts of total solar capacity, making it one of the world’s largest sources of networked solar energy. In 2019, Sunrun overtook Tesla’s SolarCity as the leading installer of residential rooftop solar panels in the U.S. “We’re at this inflection point where consumers have wrapped their minds around solar power, and they accept it,” says Jurich, who stepped down as CEO of Sunrun in 2021, but remains the company’s Co-Executive Chair.</p>



<p>Part of that acceptance comes from a greater understanding of climate urgency. It comes from legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which, among other clean energy initiatives, reinstates generous tax credits for homeowners who install solar panels. And it comes from increasingly affordable solar hardware, a trend the founders predicted at Sunrun’s outset (today, solar panel prices are down nine times since 2006). An additional factor is technological advancement: “One of the challenges with solar was always that you couldn’t store it,” says Jurich, “but now, batteries have completely changed that. You can generate, store and distribute energy to the grid without building new plants, or even solar farms. You can just use existing roofs!” To that end, in 2020 Sunrun funded and helped found Lunar Energy, an independent company focused on building the next-generation home battery system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decade and a half working in clean energy has made Jurich a realist about the magnitude of her company’s undertakings. Which is why, more than ever, she’s looking to others to share the burden, and in part why she returned to her alma mater in March 2023. This was a chance to speak to a new generation of potential clean energy leaders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I do worry that the United States broadly has lost the skillset to develop large-scale infrastructure,” Jurich said toward the end of her keynote. “But I encourage all of you to help. I’ve already talked to a couple of you who have great business ideas around trying to make labor more efficient, making large-scale construction more efficient. And I do think we will get there.”</p>



<p>By “there,” Jurich means a sustainable future of clean energy abundance. And on a personal level, she hopes for a future with more balance, filled with more of the hard-earned equanimity on display at the GSB climate summit. “One of the things I’ve come to appreciate in life is that in order to be most effective, you need periods of both intensity and periods of rest and renewal,” says Jurich.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rest, as always with Jurich, is a relative concept. She’s Co-Executive Chair of Sunrun, Chair of Lunar Energy, and she’s launching a women’s health institute and writing a novel—imagining different worlds while working to improve our own. But at the very least, “I’m no longer trying to do it all at once,” she says. That simply wouldn’t be sustainable.</p>

 Episode Transcript 
<p>This transcript has been condensed and edited for readability and clarity.</p>
<p>Seema Amble:&nbsp;It’d be great if you could just walk us through how did you found Mercury and what was the background to starting the company?</p>
<p>Immad Akhund:&nbsp;Sure. So I had this idea for Mercury in 2013, but it didn’t start until 2017. So it was kind of in the back of my mind for a long time. All of these tools that were useful as startups for running your business had improved a lot. When I first started in 2006, everything was really bad. There was no straight there was no Gusto, there was no Rippling, there was no Slack. Everything was quite painful as an entrepreneur. And then there was this kind of 10-year period where things had generally improved. Every one of these categories had had a really strong product, but banking was still exactly as they had been forever. And it just seemed obvious to me that someone would make a better bank product for for startups and for entrepreneurs. It wasn’t until 2017 that I could do it myself since no one else had, and that’s where the idea came from.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Like so many of our founders, you had the pain point yourself and decided to go tackle it head on. So when you got started, how did you think about the MVP?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Banking is a utility, right? And there is a pretty high bar of existing players there. And I always had in my mind that I wanted to be your primary bank account. So we slightly simplified it. But I focused on a very specific ICP, ideal customer profile, which was an early stage startup. So we didn’t need to go build all the things that a public IPO company would need from their banking product, we needed it for a smaller set, but it’s still a fairly high bar. But I felt like I very deeply understood what that bar was. I was very stubborn about a certain set of features that no other bank had done before.</p>
<p>I felt we needed both domestic and international wires. Now there are other new banks that have done that, but back in 2017, no one had done that. And I was also fairly stubborn about wanting to have immigrated immigrant founders support. Because I was an immigrant to the U.S. and I wanted to be able to support people like me. I always felt, yeah, immigrant founders are a pretty large set of founders and I didn’t want to disqualify that segment. So, I had a very specific kind of feature set and spec in mind. It took us a year and a half to launch because we were quite stubborn about hitting all of those features, which were not all trivial to get.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;So you your MVP was actually fairly robust in terms of feature set. It sounds like that was pretty intentional. Was that because this was what you were hearing from potential customers, that they needed a whole set of features or how did you end up making that decision?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;I think it’s important to understand what you’re trying to achieve. I think there’s a set of companies that are trying to do some thing new in a new market that there isn’t an alternative product or there is an alternative but it’s super different. And then there’s a set of things like Mercury, where there are lots of incumbents. And it’s not like we were serving a set of customers that didn’t have bank accounts, we were very deliberately serving a set of people that had alternatives so and then the bar is just much higher. You have to catch up with everything that exists. And you have to be 10x better than that, which is very different from a kind of new market, new idea. Then , what you’re really testing is does this idea have any legs at all? And does anyone care?</p>
<p>I think as long as you understand who you are, you can kind of decide what makes sense. If you take Mercury or Figma, or those types of things where there are incumbents, it’s a complicated issue problem. You have to spend a reasonable amount of time, sometimes years, developing. I mean, it kind of still is an MVP, I prefer minimum delightful product, but that minimum is just way higher than in a new market.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I love the minimum delightful product. I love that phrase. So you were working on this for a year and a half, during that time what did what did the company look like?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;We kept it pretty small. 7 engineers, if you include me, one designer and one kinda product slash everything else, who’s my co founder. I’m a big fan of keeping teams fairly lean at the start. We actually raised 6 million upfront, so we had a lot more money, but I think pre-product market fit, it’s better to be sub 10 people.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Let’s shift gears a little bit into how you found your initial customers and who you decided to target?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;So during that year and a half, I talked to about 100 startup founders. Part of it was like, “Do people actually want this?” and it was actually kind of funny, it was a little disheartening. A lot of them were like, oh yeah, this sounds cool. But they weren’t that excited about it. That’s one of the slightly funny things about talking to customers before you have something like that. It’s actually hard to really learn because if you have a big enough market, actually if 2% really, really love it that’s actually big enough to have like this kind of early adopter thing, even though you might be wondering whether you’re even doing the right thing at that point.</p>
<p>And we really focused on going to the startup community, the people I understand and they tend to care about product. And obviously, in the startup space, if you want a new product, you want to initially focus on the earliest startups just because they’re the easiest to win. We did a beta, before we launched, a lot of time during the beta, it just basically didn’t work. But we were kind of testing it with some real customers. And they weren’t putting all their money into it or anything, but it was useful. A lot of those people were people that I invested in, so I had a little bit of an unusual thing where I’d invested in, I guess, by that point, about 90 startups. They’re all like, perfectly in the ICP, they were all early stage seed stage companies. And obviously, they, to some extent, they liked me, so they were willing to kind of try out the product.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;You said you weren’t necessarily getting super strong feedback from a lot of the initial customer conversations. What empowered you to push through?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;There’s this concept of vitamin and painkillers, which actually don’t love that concept, but it kind of plays to that as well, right? Like, if you look at, if you look at the reason people use things, sometimes people use something new, because it’s a super strong pain point for them. And then they can often describe that pain point and say, if you could solve this for me, I would pay you this much money. And there’s definitely like a class of startups that are in that kind of group.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say Mercury’s in that group. Some people really hate their banks. Obviously, we can relate to that. But most people have a bank account, and at the point before Mercury launched, I don’t think many people could imagine a much, much better experience. And I actually feel that a lot of successful companies, they are in that bucket. Take Slack or Zoom. All of those things existed. There was plenty of instant messaging and plenty of web communication things, they just all kind of sucked. So when you came out with a much, much better product, it got people really excited. But I think you kind of need to see that.</p>
<p>Whereas if someone describes a much, much better product, it’s hard to get that excited about the description of a better product. That’s kind of my thinking about why it wasn’t as exciting to people as it was to me. Like, I could imagine a product and I would use that product. And that was what like pushed me through it.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;You ended up having an amazing launch. What would you attribute to, to that? And how did you convince customers to trust you, with their money?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;There’s a few things actually, like the trust question and why the launch was successful is like the same question to some extent. I think the hardest part of Mercury is always winning people’s trust, because using a startup to do your banking is quite a difficult thing to convince people of. So there’s a bunch of factors. Number 1, in 2019, the fact that we were launching a full bank product was very unusual, like no one had really done that in the business setting. So the meme of the idea was very shareable and likeable and people were very frustrated with their bank.</p>
<p>Number 2, we had a very credible set of investors. So yeah, Andreessen Horowitz was a seed investor. But along with Andreessen Horowitz, we had about 60 initial angel investors and some funds. So we had these people that lended us their credibility and brand to some extent. And then number 3, we had a lot of time to polish things, partly because we were trying to get these cards working. And we had to do like two bank partnerships. So we had a lot of time to make it. So the front page was very compelling, the initial signup experience was very fluid and easy. So the initial people that went through that experience wanted to share that, because it was such an unexpectedly nice experience. And it was the first impression they got. So that helped continue this kind of sharing cycle.</p>
<p>Lastly, we were targeting this fairly tight knit community, right? Founders follow each other on Twitter, we are in WhatsApp groups, in Slack groups. There’s a lot of ways that founders and investors talk to each other. If you go and sell something to a bunch of dentists, they probably don’t have that many dentist friends. Whereas, every founder has 20+ founder friends that they’re connected to in some way, because it’s just a fairly tight knit community. So all of those factors lead to like a pretty successful launch, and something that compounded the trust.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;And how did you think about the, you know, sign up of customers and collecting feedback? Was there a first batch that you got off the first launch that you signed up and then you sort of pulled up and got feedback? Or was it more fluid over time?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;If you have a successful launch, like we did, it seems very obvious what is like hair on fire? And I would say that say the first six weeks, we thought sending international wires was working, but it wasn’t working. And so we obviously we were trying to fix it from day one, it but it took 6 weeks for it to actually become a smooth working process. So a lot of the initial 6 months was like, you rank all the things that are broken and you try to fix the most important broken thing first. It was very much like that. It wasn’t like, oh, let’s get subtle feedback. It was just like, Okay, here’s all the crazy broken things, let’s just go fix them one by one.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Let’s shift gears a little bit and talk a little about scaling up. So you’ve got your initial number of customers. I’m curious when you actually started investing in a go-to-market effort?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;So for the first year or so, it was kind of this organic growth. I struck up some partnerships and we did some stuff but there wasn’t strong kind of leadership or even that many hires around sales partnership or marketing. And that was still working fairly well for us even a year later. The first hire shouldn’t be a head of sales. I think you should just go hire some salespeople and see if there’s a repeatable process that you can come up with together. So, we hired our first salesperson and we hired our first brand marketing person, and it was much more with the idea that they would also become managers as things worked. And then we just kept kind of incrementally adding. It was only about a year ago that we hired a VP of revenue, and a year and a half ago that we hired our VP of marketing.</p>
<p>Taking a function from zero to one is something that I think should be founder-led. And then once you’ve built out some of that function, then you can think about more like leadership roles.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I’d be curious to learn a little more about the pricing journey you guys had at Mercury and how you made those decisions on what to charge customers?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Yeah, pricing is kind of weird for Mercury. So the way we have pricing is actually, for the revenue we do make, how much do we pass over to people? So the rewards on credit card, for example, we have 1.5% cash back and that’s kind of like a pricing question or interest rates on deposits. And we have a treasury function, and we do have fees around that.</p>
<p>I think it’s good to have a philosophy around pricing. Amazon has this famous philosophy, right, your margin is my opportunity. So they always wanted to be the cheapest out there, that was always their philosophy. For Mercury, our philosophy was always, I don’t want to be the best pricing. I think it’s one of the mistakes that fintechs make is they become differentiated through pricing power, like we’re gonna give away the most margin possible. Whereas Mercury’s main thing was, hey, we want to be a really good deal. But we mostly want you to use us because of product. We want to be the best and most easiest to use product. And then we want to be a reasonable pricing deal, but we don’t necessarily want to be the best pricing out there. And I think that’s a much better take personally, because it gives you enough margin that you can do distribution and all this other stuff. Whereas, if you are all about just giving away as much as possible without making money on it, then it’s just a much harder position, in my opinion. But you know, obviously worked for Amazon.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;There are two interesting things that you mentioned there. One, when Mercury launched, it was a time when a lot of other a lot of the other card products in the market were focused on rewards and just giving away product for free. And to your point, it almost seems like it’s a much stronger signal of product market fit or just that you’re truly delighting customers. If they’re saying, it’s not the price that is the reason I’m adopting this, I actually love the product.</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;I mean, that’s one of the problems with pricing first companies, someone else will come across and come by and undercut you. Then you have a set of customers that are extremely price sensitive, so they’re much more likely to like go to the next company that undercuts you on pricing. Yeah, I think pricing is a very dangerous kind of methodology to compete on, it’s much better to compete on some other dimension.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;You’ve done this multiple times before, if you were to compare it against rough map or one of the other startups, what have you learned through the journey. We’d love to hear any advice that you have for early founders.</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;To build a really big company, you really need a lot of customers. So you think that’s much easier to do when the demand is so high that people are coming to you. And it’s much harder to do when you have to kinda convert one person at a time and force them to use you, people really have to want to use you. I mean, obviously not every sale is going to be easy. But you have to have this kind of groundswell of demand. So you really have to think about, what can I do do have such a good product that creates that groundswell, which is I think product and distribution have to always kind of come together to some extent, especially when you’re really early.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I’d be curious how much did you actually think about unit economics and the CAC? Or was it more like, let’s get this product out into people’s hands and figure that out later?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;No, I did the spreadsheet. I don’t know how convincing these things are really before you, you’ve tried them. I really think it’s very hard to know, things until you try it, like is the conversion rate of your sales pipeline gonna be 5% or 1%? And, obviously, the numbers are completely different between the two of them. But I mean, the other problem with any of these distribution mats is what you can do at Day Zero is not going to work when you have 10 million ARR.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;I’m curious if you have you looked back at the spreadsheet. And how correct was it?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;I mean, I’ve looked at my seed deck quite a few times. And, I mean, it’s mostly accurate. There’s some assumptions that were incorrect. But yeah, I haven’t looked at the projection math.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Last thing to wrap up. If you had to give one piece of advice to your earlier self on finding and winning your initial customers, what might that be?</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Depends on how much earlier we go to my earliest self. I was very much an engineer and kind of worried about running sales processes and things like that. I think the thing that I would tell that person and I tell other founders is, I think it’s better to think about sales as a numbers game. It’s like how many people do talk to? How good is your conversion rate? And that equals how many sales you make. I think when you think about as an engineer, at least when you think about it more as a numbers game, rather than a kind of an emotional sales game, I think that’s when you can be more successful at sales. You need to run a process, you need to run a pipeline and that’s just what you have to do to be successful.</p>
<p>Seema:&nbsp;Well, thanks so much. It was great to chat with you. And thanks for sharing all these pearls of wisdom.</p>
<p>Immad:&nbsp;Thanks for having me, Seema.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Monday 4th December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>In mid-December the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2024.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2024. </p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis. </p>



<p>From January, Committee members will receive a nominal stipend of $650 per calendar month from ZF (paid as shielded ZEC). This stipend may be subject to review, given the budgetary constraints that ZF currently faces.</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>As a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the Zcash Foundation is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority.. </p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

 The Horizen DAO increases community involvement in decision-making for improvements to the protocol and ecosystem. 



<p>The Horizen community is excited to announce the Horizen DAO is now open for all $ZEN holders to participate in governance and take an active role in the direction of the project!</p>



<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. A strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is informed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on the <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/guiding_values">Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 How to Participate in Voting 



<p>Voting for the Horizen DAO is done on Horizen EON, an EVM-compatible sidechain on Horizen. The Horizen DAO uses <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot</a> and <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a> for governance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain including the $ZEN you have staked with the Horizen EON validators. Therefore, the more $ZEN you hold,&nbsp; the more voting power you have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


 
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image.jpg"></a> 


<p></p>



<p>The voting period for any given proposal will have a specified start and end date and will last 72 hours. For more information about the process of voting, please start <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Introducing the Horizen DAO Special Council 



<p>What is the Horizen DAO Special Council?</p>



<p>The Special Council serves as a steward for the Horizen DAO and provides oversight of the Horizen Foundation with security of the Horizen DAO and ecosystem as its paramount focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What exactly does the Special Council do?</p>



<p>Special Council members serve as a DAO committee and function as a liaison between the Horizen community and the Horizen Foundation. In practical terms, this means providing review and oversight during the improvement proposal process, calling emergency operational meetings as needed to discuss and address security threats to the Horizen DAO, any protocol utilizing the Token, the Tokenholders, or the Foundation, and serving as signers on the Horizen community multi-signature wallet.</p>



<p>Who are the Special Council members?</p>



<p>Initially, the Special Council will be made up of 7 individuals initially appointed by the Foundation Director(s):</p>

It is an easy to use interface so ordinary people don’t have to struggle to install and run the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/clients/socks5-client.html">nym-socks5-client</a> themselves.</p><p>NymConnect is plug-and-play. The app is already integrated with <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://electrum.org/">Electrum</a> Bitcoin wallet, <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/">Monero wallet</a> (desktop and CLI) and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/element-matrix-over-the-nym-mixnet-private-decentralised-and-secure-messaging-ac7f47bc47af">Matrix</a> (Element app), enabling these apps to automatically run your traffic through the mixnet, protecting it from any prying&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>To use Firo over NymConnect, here’s what you need to&nbsp;do:</p><p>1. <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/nymconnect">Download</a> NymConnect.</p><p>2. If you are not on Linux skip to the next step. Otherwise, make executable by opening the terminal in the same directory and&nbsp;run:</p> chmod +x ./nym-connect_1.1.* <p>This will make executable any NymConnect above version 1.1 in that directory.</p><p>3. Download Firo Electrum wallet from<a href="https://github.com/firoorg/firo"> Firo’s repository</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/firoorg/electrum-firo/releases/tag/4.1.5.2">Github release page</a>. To connect to the mixnet, follow these&nbsp;steps:</p><p>4. Start and connect<a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/nymtech/docs/feature/updates/documentation/dev-portal/src/tutorials/firo.md#nymconnect-installation"> </a><a href="https://nymtech.net/download/nymconnect">NymConnect</a> (or<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/clients/socks5-client.html"> nym-socks5-client</a>).</p><p>5. Start your Firo Electrum wallet, then navigate to: Tools -&gt; Network -&gt;&nbsp;Proxy</p><p>6. Set Use proxy to ✅, and choose SOCKS5 from the drop-down menu.</p><p>7. Go to NymConnect to copy your IP and Port&nbsp;values.</p><p>8. Go back to Firo and add the values from your NymConnect application.</p><p>Your Firo Electrum wallet now runs through the mixnet! This also means it will be connected and online only when your NymConnect or nym-socks5-client are connected.

<p>Leading decentralised perpetual exchange, dYdX V4 recently migrated to Cosmos to build its own sovereign appchain, in order to provide its users a much better trading experience, while continuing to deliver DeFi innovations (e.g. permisionless markets). By having full control over the appchain’s parameters, the dYdX DAOs can shape the future of the protocol, starting from the very bedrock, ensuring proper distribution and incentives for the validator set. From early adopter of L2 zero knowledge proofs (STARKs), to building its own Cosmos appchain, dYdX has proven once again to be a trailblazer for new technologies.</p><p>We were joined by Charles d’Haussy, CEO of dYdX Foundation, to discuss dYdX V4’s recent migration to a Cosmos appchain and what challenges it solves in terms of: order book decentralisation, validator distribution and user experience.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Charles’ background, from Asia to CEO of dYdX  dYdX’s history and V4’s transition to a Cosmos appchain  How perpetual futures work  dYdX supported assets and permissionless markets  DeFi innovations vs. CEX UX  The current state of dYdX V4’s alpha mainnet  dYdX validator dynamics &amp; order book decentralisation  dYdX’s DAOs &amp; governance  Mitigating MEV (feat.

<p>This post describes work done by Principal Engineer Anthony Tseng and Staff Engineer Anirudha Bose. We also thank Anxo Rodriguez from the CoW Swap team for his code-review on our work done for CoW Swap.</p>
<p>Written by Anirudha Bose.</p>

 Summary 
<p>With our recent Brave browser release version 1.60, we are excited to introduce two powerful features for the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE) gets a major overhaul, with first-class support for parsing ERC-4361 messages, and a brand new UX. We also extend our redesigned signing experience for Brave Swap to CoW Swap orders. Both these features enhance the security and UX of signing messages in Brave Wallet.</p>

 Sign-In With Ethereum 

 What is Sign-In With Ethereum? 
<p>Sign-In With Ethereum (or SIWE for short) replaces traditional login credentials with wallet-based sign-in functionality. Imagine a world where your wallet can help you login stamped with the indelible ink of an Ethereum wallet address of your choosing. This functionality shifts the role of authentication away from large centralized identity providers, into the hands of the individual.</p>
<p>The Sign-In With Ethereum protocol defines a method by which Ethereum accounts can sign in to external services by signing a standard message format as defined in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361">ERC-4361</a>.&nbsp; Thanks to this standard, you get the power of self-custodial identity while remaining portable across wallet implementations.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Next-level SIWE 
<p>Brave Wallet always had basic support for SIWE. Since SIWE uses <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191">ERC-191</a> (Signed Data Standard), we’ve been able to display SIWE prompts as human-readable plaintext messages, but without any validation by the wallet.</p>
<p>In this latest update, we’re introducing a significant improvement to Sign-In With Ethereum support with our implementation of an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/19443">ABNF parser</a> for ERC-4361 conformant messages. This allows us to not only interpret SIWE messages and present them with a better look and feel, but also to improve the safety of signing into third-party apps and services. However, since there may still be cases where the SIWE message does not conform with these specifications, we fallback to legacy ERC-191 signing for maximum interoperability.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Safety features 
<p>Once a SIWE message is successfully parsed, we verify the message for binding of domain, account, and chain ID fields, and display an appropriate error message if there’s a mismatch. This measure is designed to prevent phishing attacks, where a malicious actor may obtain a valid authorization to a legitimate third-party service. This is particularly important for SIWE, since the sign-in action is basically producing a signature for a message, which is susceptible to spoofing by a motivated attacker.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 CoW Swap 

 What is CoW Swap? 
<p>Coincidence of Wants (CoW) is a concept from the field of economics, particularly related to the barter system. It describes a situation where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they agree to trade these items directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://swap.cow.fi">CoW Swap</a> leverages this idea for trading on-chain assets. It is an interface built on top of the CoW Protocol—a fully permissionless trading protocol that leverages batch auctions as its price finding mechanism. CoW Protocol enables batch auctions to maximize liquidity via CoWs in addition to tapping all available on-chain liquidity whenever needed. Users express off-chain intents as signed <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712">EIP-712</a> typed messages through the CoW Swap interface. The CoW Protocol gathers these intents into a batch auction, to be settled by solvers that compete to find the most optimal CoW. The winning solver then executes all intents in a single on-chain transaction, maximizing trade surplus and saving on network fees.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    

<p>A CoW settlement transaction</p>

 The dangers of off-chain messages 
<p>Signing off-chain messages, such as CoW orders, is unfortunately not the most friendly UX on any wallet. While off-chain messages significantly improve usability by providing a reliable way to exchange data through a gasless experience, such messages are largely opaque and unreadable to users. This is very similar to blind-signing of transaction calldata (which we have discussed in depth in a <a>previous blog post</a>). Because signing off-chain messages does not incur a gas fee, users are very likely to blindly approve a signing request without verifying the details. A maliciously crafted message is more than capable of draining assets from users’ wallets, without raising any suspicion because of its verbosity.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/Serpent/status/1604074440941506560">December 2022</a>, a scammer stole 14 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">BAYCs</a> worth over 852 ETH ($1.07 million USD) at the time, through a sophisticated, month-long social engineering scam. The victim was tricked into signing a gasless <a href="https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview">Seaport</a> message, which actually created a private bundle listing all of his BAYCs to the scammer for 0.00000001 ETH. Such attacks are becoming increasingly common due to the massive adoption of off-chain messages in NFT marketplaces, DEXs, etc.</p>

 EIP-712 to the rescue 
<p>EIP-712 proposed a standard for signing typed structured data as opposed to bytestrings. While typed messages are easier for machines to read, they are still not user-friendly enough for most people. For users to be able to confidently approve signing requests for CoW orders, they need to clearly see all the order details such as formatted amounts, token symbols, logos, etc.</p>
<p>We conceived the idea to solve this problem at <a href="https://www.dappcon.io">DappCon 2023</a> in Berlin where we met CoW Swap’s engineering team. After brainstorming together, we came up with the <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/20203">solution</a> to implement a message parser for CoW orders, to be able to extract the relevant parameters, and render them in a familiar way that’s easy to understand. The parser is tied to the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#rationale-for-typehash">type hash</a> of the specific order struct used by CoW Swap, to prevent the parser from being used on non-CoW messages. We’ve also implemented calldata parsers for cases where the swap involves an on-chain transaction like, for example, when the user is swapping a native asset (such as ETH, or XDAI). Here’s what the final result looks like:</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 Conclusion 
<p>In the 1.60 release of the Brave browser, we have completely revamped the experience of Sign-In With Ethereum using Brave Wallet. We’ve added safety features and UX improvements that make the SIWE experience comparable to signing in on websites with traditional login credentials. You can try it out at <a href="https://login.xyz">https://login.xyz</a>, which also has developer documentation for supporting SIWE on your websites.</p>
<p>We have extended similar improvements to the signing of CoW Swap orders, turning the unreadable off-chain messages into something that users can easily audit. You can try it out at <a href="https://swap.cow.fi">https://swap.cow.fi</a> on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.</p>
<p>We intend to bring similar improvements to the signing experience in Brave Wallet, in order to protect users from inadvertently signing malicious messages and transactions. Stay tuned for major updates on these improvements coming soon to Brave Wallet.</p>

It wraps into packets and mixes together IP traffic from many users inside the mixnet. It encrypts and mixes <a href="https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf">Sphinx packet</a> traffic so that it cannot be determined who is communicating with&nbsp;whom.</p>  Use mixFetch — it’s just like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> API, but via the&nbsp;mixnet  <p>MixFetch is a drop-in replacement for the fetch API, used to send HTTP requests over the Nym mixnet. It does this by grabbing the same arguments as ‘vanilla’ fetch, then constructing a SOCKS5 request which is made to the destination host on the internet via a <a href="https://nymtech.net/developers/quickstart/socks-proxy.html">SOCKS5</a> <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/nodes/network-requester.html">Network Requester</a>.</p>  Use CosmosKit to run Cosmos-based components via Nym infrastructure  Create and spend <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/zk-nyms">zk-nyms</a> — the anonymous credentials system based on the <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/coconut.html">Coconut</a> cryptographic signature scheme.  <p>This is currently a work in progress, and will soon be added and documented. It lets application programmers concerned with resource access control to think and code in a new way.

<p>Despite the many alternative flavors of NoSQL databases that have caught the attention of developers over the years, relational databases remain the de facto standard for storing and retrieving digital information. Every technology worker from the back-office IT personnel to the modern Web developer has been trained to use, manage, and query relational databases. SQL, the language used to interact with relational databases, is the lingua franca of data management. Yet, while blockchains can be thought of as decentralized databases, they are not geared for the same storage and query tasks as relational databases, making them too slow, too expensive, and decidedly foreign for the average developer to interact with. This creates a paradoxical and undesirable situation in which developers of decentralized technologies choose the path of least resistance for their data storage needs: traditional, centralized, relational databases.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://tableland.xyz/">Tableland</a>, a multi-chain relational database network that brings SQL to smart contracts. Using this foundation, Tableland is developing Basin — a product for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) projects. With a focus on user-friendly tools and cryptographic data formats, Basin is designed to make data secure and usable for generations to come. Provenance tracking ensures a transparent data lineage, while Filecoin guarantees decentralized data accessibility and permanence. With Basin, Tableland is <a href="https://mirror.xyz/tableland.eth/UJMDvy8vAqekOGpPmspRGzdl2-osjPeGVaIv2Lv4Oh0">solving a critical pain point </a>for DePIN projects by creating a more secure, efficient, and transparent decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Tableland launched their community in Q2 of 2022 with 3000 <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/tableland-rigs">utilitarian NFTs</a> with their metadata stored in relational tables in Tableland itself, showcasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAc0xDyQDZbo-PnGBbv1aBTVMVwd4qncL">tangible use case</a> for the product. The NFTs sold out in under 5 minutes. Since then, they’ve launched on Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and other L2&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As crypto continues to grow and quickly evolve, developers will lean toward tools and technologies that make them more productive. Tried and true, widely adopted patterns such as relational tables and SQL will continue to play an important foundational role, even as applications become decentralized. With growing momentum behind DePIN projects, Tableland can position itself as a foundational building block for a world where crypto-economic incentives are used to coordinate physical infrastructure. We are excited to be backing the entire Tableland team on their&nbsp;mission.</p>

With the upcoming release of NymVPN — the evolution of NymConnect into a consumer product — this is changing to a ‘deny list’ in order to enable privacy for the broadest possible user base, with the widest available range of web services.</p><p>In short, this means that gateways will now block known malicious traffic, rather than only allowing the traffic of a select few services. This is a much more permissive setup to enhance appeal and accessibility for end&nbsp;users.</p><p>To protect operators, an <a href="https://nymtech.net/.wellknown/network-requester/exit-policy.txt">exit policy</a> has been introduced so known malicious actors are blocked by default.

Note: only members of the general or node operator rooms may access the Legal Forum on&nbsp;Element.</p><p>While Nym core team cannot provide comprehensive legal advice across all jurisdictions, work is ongoing to build knowledge and experience with the help of the community and legal&nbsp;counsel.</p><p>That said, Nym core has now published preliminary findings from legal counsel on Nym exit gateways in two jurisdictions, <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/swiss.html">Switzerland</a> and the <a href="https://nymtech.net/operators/legal/united-states.html">United States</a>. These should not be viewed as comprehensive legal counsel and are presented unedited.</p><p>Given the legal similarity between Nym exit gateways and Tor exit relays, it is also recommended that operators acquaint themselves with <a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/community-resources/tor-exit-guidelines/">Tor community exit guidelines</a>.</p><p>Nym core team cannot provide operators with definitive answers regarding the potential risks of operating open gateways, but there is evidence of some considerations that may arise, from operating Tor exit&nbsp;relays:</p>  From a technical perspective, Nym node operators may need to implement additional controls, such as dedicated hardware and IP usage, or setting up an HTML exit notice on port&nbsp;80.  From an operational standpoint, node operators may be expected to actively manage their relationship with their ISP or VPS provider and respond to abuse requests using the proposed templates.  Legally, exit relays are typically considered “telecommunication networks” and are subject to intermediary liability protection. However, there may be exceptions, particularly in cases involving criminal law and copyright claims. Operators could seek advice from local privacy associations and may consider running nodes under an entity rather than as individuals.  <p>Nym node operators are strongly encouraged to join operator channels on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#operators:nymtech.chat">Element</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Telegram</a> to share best practices and experiences.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-galaxy-update-has-just-completed-c54beea6c01a">Nym node ‘Galaxy’ update has just completed</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.4.0.</p>



<p>This release includes support for mining RPC methods in all release builds, bundles the Zcash verification parameters into the zebrad binary, and updates Rust dependencies to match the zcashd 5.7.0 release.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some notable improvements from our previous release include <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7772">better recovery from brief network interruptions</a>, and mitigation of potential network and verification denial of service and performance issues. We have restored our macOS tests in CI, and now support macOS on a best-effort basis.</p>



<p>We have also changed our documentation website URL, and are considering deprecating some Docker image tags from release 1.5.0 onwards.</p>



 Mining RPCs in Production Builds 



<p>Since the 1.4.0 release, Zebra’s mining RPCs are <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/7740">available in release builds</a> so that any Zebra instance can be used by a solo miner or mining pool. With this release, we are providing production level support to 12 mining related RPCs, including getblocktemplate,&nbsp; submitblock, getmininginfo, getnetworksolps, [z_]validateaddress and getblocksubsidy. Do <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">let us know</a> if your mining pool requires any extra RPC methods or fields!</p>



 Zcash Parameters in zebrad Binary 



<p>zebrad now bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly into its binary. This increases the binary size by a few megabytes, but reduces the size of the Docker image by around 600 MB because the parameters don’t contain the Sprout proving key anymore. We have also removed the “zebrad download” command as it is no longer necessary. If you have upgraded zebrad to 1.4.0 or later, and zcashd to 5.7.0 or later, you can delete the zk-SNARK parameter files to save approximately 700 MB disk space. For more details, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.4.0">release notes</a>.</p>



 macOS Support 



<p>We have restored support for macOS x86_64 on a best-effort basis. macOS builds and some tests run in Zebra’s CI. You can check out the list of Zebra <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/supported-platforms.html">supported platforms</a> for more details on the different tiers of support we provide for the listed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



 Deprecation Warnings 



<p>In an effort to remove redundancies and simplify things, we would like to share the following deprecation warnings.</p>



 DockerHub Image Tags 



<p>Zebra currently publishes 11 DockerHub tags for each new release. We want to reduce the number of DockerHub tags we publish in a future minor Zebra release. Based on usage and user feedback, in release 1.5.0 we could stop publishing:</p>



 
 The 1 tag, which updates each release until NU6 



 The 1.x tag, which updates each patch release until the next minor release 



 The 1.x.y tag, which is the same as v1.x.y 



 The sha-xxxxxxx tag, which is the same as v1.x.y (for production releases) 
 



<p>We also want to standardise experimental image tags to -experimental, rather than .experimental.</p>



<p>This means that, for release 1.5.0 onwards, we are considering only publishing the following tags:</p>



 
 latest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 latest-experimental (a new tag) 



 V1.5.0 



 v1.5.0-experimental 
 



<p>Please let us know if you need any other tags by <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=C-enhancement%2CS-needs-triage&amp;projects=&amp;template=feature_request.yml&amp;title=feature%3A+">opening a GitHub ticket</a>.</p>



<p>We recommend using the “latest” tag to always get the most recent Zebra release.</p>



 Documentation Website URL Change 



<p>We have replaced the API documentation which was previously available on the doc.zebra.zfnd.org website with <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>. Zebra’s API documentation can now be found on:<br></p>



 
 <a href="https://docs.rs/releases/search?query=zebra">docs.rs</a>, which renders documentation for the public API of the latest crate releases; 



 <a href="https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org/zebrad/">doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org</a>, which renders documentation for the internal API on the main branch. 
 



<p>This API documentation is in addition to the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/">Zebra Book</a> user documentation, which is still available as usual.</p>

These are something called the ‘vesting schedule’ or vest dates — in simple terms, this is where more tokens are released into the&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Let’s quickly take a look at when the remaining vest dates are and what this&nbsp;means.</p><p>For NYM holders already familiar with the token economics, scroll below for the latest supply figures plus parameter changes (spoiler alert: there are no changes at time of publication).</p> How does the Nym vesting schedule&nbsp;work? <p>For newcomers to the Nym universe, the granular details of how the token operates might feel a little confusing.</p><p>But the main thing to remember is unlike many tokens in the Web3 world, the NYM token is deflationary. This is similar to Bitcoin and means there is a finite number of NYM tokens that exist and will ever exist: 1&nbsp;billion.</p><p>However, not all of these tokens are yet in circulation.</p><p>Instead, there are two important mechanisms that affect the number of tokens in circulation.</p><p>They are each tied to a ‘smart contract’ hosted on the Nyx blockchain. They&nbsp;are:</p>  Token rewards for Nym nodes. These are distributed monthly from the ‘mixmining pool’. This is facilitated by the mixnet smart contract.  Token vest. This is where tokens that have been allocated to Coinlist buyers, backers, and the Nym core team are released on a quarterly basis. This is facilitated by the vesting smart contract.  <p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">A breakdown of the smart contracts that run the Nym token economics</a></p><p>The overall vesting schedule began in 2022, the year the Nym mainnet went live and the NYM token was publicly listed. There are quarterly vests over the course of two years ending in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>The most recent vest dates were 2 November to Coinlist buyers, then 4 November to validators, and then on 5 November to backers and advisors, who hold the most NYM tokens out of any&nbsp;group.</p><p>See below for the vest schedule through to May,&nbsp;2024:</p><p>It is important to remember that because NYM tokens are deflationary, large vest dates may have a temporary impact on the value of the NYM&nbsp;token.</p><p>This is to be expected, according to the laws of supply and demand. Token price movements around vest dates tend to rebalance and recover afterwards.</p> What does the token supply look&nbsp;like? <p>Openness and transparency are essential to the Nym mission, so the core team publishes regular updates on the number of tokens currently circulating.</p><p>Anyone can check the current token supply at any time using <a href="https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/circulating-supply">this&nbsp;API</a>.</p><p>At the time of writing, the total circulating supply is 607.4m&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Additionally, 22.4% of tokens remain in the mix-mining pool, essentially a bootstrapping mechanism to reward node operators for good&nbsp;mixes.</p><p>As paid usage begins with the upcoming NymVPN, the fiat or crypto that VPN subscribers pay for access will be converted to NYM tokens and distributed as rewards to the various entities that make the service possible. This leads to a circular flow of NYM tokens with sustainable demand.</p><p>Furthermore, the zk-nym zero-knowledge protocols enable subscribers to unlink their payment from their credentials and usage of the service, thus protecting their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>See also: <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-2023-24-2466711e1fad">Nym roadmap update — 2023–24</a></p> Staking parameter update <p>Tied to the vesting schedule and the token economics is something called a staking parameter update. This entails adjusting the target staking supply to account for the increase in overall staking supply. An increase here, in turn, affects node stake saturation point and therefore the APY of nodes and delegators.</p><p>Before diving into that, here are the current parameters:</p>  Circulating supply: 607 million NYM&nbsp;(<a href="https://validator.nymtech.net/api/v1/circulating-supply">API</a>)  Locked staking supply: 168 million&nbsp;NYM  Max staking supply: 657 million&nbsp;NYM  Target staking supply: 230 million&nbsp;NYM  Mix node stake saturation point: 960,000&nbsp;NYM  <p>Let’s walk through these one by one and explain why they&nbsp;matter.</p><p>The NYM tokens that are released during the vests entail a significant increase in the circulating supply of tokens. In addition to this, token holders can also stake some of their locked tokens (concretely, 10% of their original locked amount can be&nbsp;staked).</p><p>The circulating supply plus locked staking supply determines the max staking supply, meaning the total amount of NYM tokens that could in theory be staked on Nym&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Now, it is highly unlikely that all tokens will be staked on Nym&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>For example, right now 150 million NYM, representing 23% of the max staking supply, are&nbsp;staked.</p><p>For this reason, a target staking supply is set at a reasonable number between the max staking supply (657m) and actual current level of staked tokens&nbsp;(150m).</p><p>The target staking supply parameter is set to maximise APY, or rate of return, for currently staked tokens, while nevertheless incentivising further&nbsp;staking.</p><p>This determines the stake saturation point of Nym nodes. The stake saturation point is found by dividing the target staking supply by the number of rewarded mix nodes: 230m / 240 = 960k saturation point.</p><p>The saturation levels of a node signify its reputation, and this affects whether the node is selected to the active set (or ‘epoch’) in the mixnet, and earning rewards. If all nodes reach saturation too easily because the target is set very low, then the incentive algorithm no longer works, and staking loses its significance in the selection process.</p><p>In short: setting a target lower than the current level of staked tokens would disincentivise people from operating nodes and delegating stake. But setting the target a lot higher could raise the saturation point to unreachable levels. This would harm the APY of mix nodes, and also disincentivise operating and&nbsp;staking.</p><p>So, in order to offer a good APY to operators and stakers, the target staking supply for rewards is higher than the current level of staked tokens, but lower than the current maximum of 657m, and set at&nbsp;230m.</p><p>And those all together are the ‘parameters’.</p> Parameter update — no&nbsp;update! <p>Changes to the parameters are only necessary when the level of staking in the mixnet is approaching the&nbsp;target.</p><p>This number might increase with rewards being released every month from the mixmining pool. And it is even more likely to increase with the quarterly vest, as this releases a large amount of tokens that can be&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Having said all that, the target staking point of 230 million NYM is still a way off, therefore none of the parameters need to&nbsp;change.</p><p>The parameters will be revisited with the next vest to assess whether the total staked in the network is nearing the&nbsp;target.</p><p>Whew: deep breath.

<p>Bootstrap Org, the nonprofit parent organization of Electric Coin Co., has added long-time Zcash community contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/michlai007">Michelle Lai</a> to its Board of Directors. Michelle joins members Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Zaki Manian, and Zooko Wilcox.</p>



<p>“Michelle has worked hard to support Zcash and the cause of financial freedom for years,” Fairless said. “We love her insight and imagination on tech product use cases.”</p>



<p>A graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2007), Michelle has spent half her career in crypto and half in financial services, including stints at Anchorage Digital, Bitpay, Credit Suisse, a private equity buyout fund, and as a consultant to CEOs of large financial services companies. She’s performed a wide range of roles, including COO, BD and product roles, and says she most enjoys solving tricky business problems and managing high-stakes negotiations.</p>



<p>She is passionate about crypto-related technology as “a means of achieving a fairer and freer world.”</p>



<p>In Michelle’s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My journey with Zcash started in 2018 when I worked at a crypto asset custodian and we were looking to support $ZEC. Since then, I’ve fallen further down the privacy money rabbit hole, becoming a member of the first grant organization in 2021 (the Zcash Open Major Grants committee) and then staying involved as someone who actively advocates for privacy and freedom applications in crypto.</p>



<p>My vision of tomorrow’s Zcash is one that earns its place back as a leader of privacy tech in crypto so that we can keep supporting the universal values of privacy and freedom. We did it once with the best talent in ZK and engineering, and we can do it again.</p>



<p>Today, as the crypto privacy community faces several challenges, including market sentiment and regulatory onslaught, I join the Bootstrap team to navigate the turbulent waters we find ourselves in. I have had professional experience in turnaround situations and hope to bring that to bear in this new role on the board of Bootstrap.</p>



<p>The road ahead is strewn with both extremely difficult questions and compelling opportunities for all ZK and privacy projects, including us. It will take a grand effort for us to arrive at a new horizon, but this is the moment where we dig in, gear up, and keep marching on in service of humanity.</p>

<p>The very nature of Ethereum addresses, expressed as random hexadecimal character strings, represents a big hurdle for mass adoption, as they are not human-readable. ENS domains were envisioned to not only solve this and provide a seamless UX, but to also be the cornerstone of on-chain identities. However, in the current multichain landscape, a plethora of decentralised naming services arose, which led to a heterogeneous domain name pool. As a result, ENS aims to expand to L2s and non-EVM chains, attempting to provide consistency, in order to further reduce user friction and limit conflicting domain names.</p><p>We were joined by Nick Johnson, founder of ENS, to discuss the current state of decentralised naming services from a multichain and L2 perspective, and how these ultimately tie into decentralised identities.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Nick’s background and ENS history  The plethora of decentralised naming services  ENS use cases  Interacting with Web2 DNS  L2 compatibility for ENS via CCIP Read  ENS wrapper and subdomains  CCIP Read  Bridging ENS to non-EVM L2s  Coinbase’s cb.id  ENS and on-chain privacy OPSEC  Account abstraction  The future of ENS  Governance   <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick Johnson on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains">ENS on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture.

Also included were details on forward security and replay attack detection to further safeguard both users and the network. Ania teased the new Outfox packet format, a simplified but faster format derived from Sphinx, which is currently used by the mixnet. Keep your eyes peeled for an Outfox explainer on this blog&nbsp;soon.</p>Presentation slide about the Nym $300m Innovation Fund from Ade Molajo, Head of Business Development, Nym<p>Ade Molajo, Head of Business Development detailed the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-300m-innovation-fund-opens-for-applications-this-november-ad82f06a060b">$300m Innovation Fund programme</a>, which will foster growth in the privacy ecosystem specifically for projects that leverage the Nym tech stack. He discussed <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-partners-with-near-foundation-bringing-web3-privacy-to-users-and-validators-844966df7f0b">the recent partnership with the NEAR Foundation</a> to bring the privacy protections of the Nym mixnet to Near’s L1 blockchain, and encouraged builders to apply for open grants&nbsp;now.</p>Presentation slide on the three Shipyard tracks from Huxian, Nym community contributor (featuring visuals from&nbsp;<a href="https://linktr.ee/Poppel">Poppel</a>)<p>Huxian, Nym community contributor updated viewers on <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-level-1-unlocked-87e79da32f67">Nym Shipyard</a> and detailed his vision for Nym community squads — what he describes as a ‘social mesh’ system of ‘autonomous collective intelligence agents, weaving trust into the fabric of the mixnet’. He urged viewers to form their own squads, or join existing ones, whether ‘Builders’, ‘Operators’ or ‘Visionaries’, to contribute to the health of the mixnet and build the future private internet.</p> Community Q&amp;A <p>The following Q&amp;A session was compiled from the questions received after each individual core team member’s presentation, as well as the open Q&amp;A at the end of the Town Hall. The questions and answers have been lightly edited only for grammar, clarity, and readability.</p><p>Are there any specific types of applications you think are more or less appropriate for integrating and using the mixnet at this point, and in the&nbsp;future?</p><p>Mark Sinclair, Head of Engineering, Nym: I think for any applications that are written in JavaScript, and that use the Fetch API, mixFetch is a really easy&nbsp;drop-in.</p><p>Currently, because of the allow list [for the network requesters], there are only a few hosts on the internet that you’ll be able to&nbsp;use.</p><p>But as we go live with the ‘smooshed’ gateways and network requesters from project Smoosh, this obviously opens it up to a much wider piece of the internet. Definitely React applications — say React Native, anything written in TypeScript, or JavaScript, Node.Js. All of those are really good candidates for mixFetch and should be pretty easy to integrate with.</p><p>Are there any limitations with the mixnet to be wary of, such as&nbsp;latency?</p><p>Mark Sinclair: Obviously, the main purpose of the mixnet is to hide people’s traffic from a global adversary.</p><p>Because of the cover traffic — some of the traffic will be cover traffic and some will be real traffic —there will be delays. I think it’s not really appropriate for doing things that are really timing specific. That’s just the sacrifice that you have to pay for things that are private, so please don’t use it to do things that are really time sensitive. The performance will never be as good there because it specifically adds delays to add&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Can Nym work on&nbsp;Solana?</p><p>Mark Sinclair: Well, that’s quite a question! I think the thing is that it depends on which bits you’re trying to do. If you’re trying to make sure that any kind of transactions that you’re sending are hidden from a global adversary, and you’ve got a way — like in those diagrams that I showed — to hide portions of the infrastructure from a global adversary, then&nbsp;yes.</p><p>Otherwise, there really are two kinds of use cases here: user traffic, and things that have to do with say, consensus or validators. And then the validators themselves would need to have Nym built into them. Because if any part is sticking out, then you’re maybe not getting the benefits&nbsp;there.</p><p>So the answer would be yes, but it depends what exactly you’re trying to protect. And I suggest looking at the integration guide on <a href="https://sdk.nymtech.net/">sdk.nymtech.net</a>.</p><p>Do you suspect any issues paying for NymVPN on iOS devices, since Apple doesn’t like payments that bypass the app&nbsp;store?</p><p>Marc Debizet, Lead Product Manager, Nym: When you buy the subscriptions for Nym directly on the iOS app, you’ll have to follow the rules set by Apple. So if you want to bypass that you will have to subscribe to NymVPN directly on our&nbsp;website.</p><p>After NymVPN is launched and efficiently working, is there anything stopping the team from giving us a Nym antivirus?</p><p>Marc Debizet: The Nym mission is to enable privacy for everyone. So we’re not into cyber security, we are into&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Are there any plans to make the e-cash system interoperable with other blockchain or payment ecosystems? How would this impact user privacy and cross-platform transactions?</p><p>Ania Piotrowska, Nym cofounder and Head of Research: In general, the whole scheme which we designed, which was published at PETS, is quite generic. We use them in Nym for paying for using the Nym network. But they can be used in many other scenarios. They could be used by other blockchains. They could be used by CBDCs, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>So it’s a very generic protocol, which could be deployed in many, many situations. That’s really a little bit up to imagination and the needs of people from other projects.</p><p>Right now, we’re not planning to do any big-scale integrations, we’d rather focus on using them within our network. But once we’re gonna polish this, and we’re happy with how this works with Nym, who knows where we are going to&nbsp;look?</p><p>What are the benefits that the Nym community can see in the long from the Nym-Near partnership?</p><p>Ade Molajo: That’s a really good question. So for the Nym community, obviously, once the Near partnership is live, once the integration has been done, that it means that we’re going to be having more traffic going through the mix nodes, which invariably means there will be more awards for our node operators, as well as validators. So that’s the immediate benefit that we’ll&nbsp;see.</p><p>It’s evidently an incredibly exciting time for Nym and the Nym community. We in the core team hope you found the Community Town Hall as enjoyable as we did. See you in&nbsp;Q4!</p><p>As always: for more updates as they happen, keep your eyes on this blog, follow Nym on socials, and join the Nym community.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-community-town-hall-q3-recap-c2f78c981493">Nym Community Town Hall Q3 — recap</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>A busy month just went by! Here’s everything we did and what’s on the horizon for Panther.</p><p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>October has been a productive month for us, and we’re excited to share our progress in many areas as we work towards Panther v1. <br>Without further ado, let’s dive in.</p> Tech Updates  Stage 2 <p>The latest development sprints were focused on solving a bug related to an external library used for Stage 2, an external factor that has caused a delay. <br><br>Our Incentivized <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Testnet Stage 2 </a>is now officially underway, bringing a wave of features and rewards to the Panther community. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">Stage 2</a> is critical as it puts our user interaction and reward mechanisms to the test, laying the groundwork for Panther Protocol’s privacy-preserving features. Our protocol’s privacy is intricately tied to unique game-theoretical features that encourage active user participation, making this stage a pivotal moment for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Stage 2 includes creating and activating your Panther Account, finding your onboarding bonuses, and claiming your vouchers. <br>Your participation and feedback are crucial as we move closer to our v1 release. Thank you for being a part of Testnet Stage 2, and don't hesitate to share your thoughts through our community channels!</p> V1 redesign <p>Over the past weeks, we have done some UX refinements too. The focus was reviewing what we have learned from the previous design iterations and expanding on it further while also elevating the user experience. Another objective was to revamp and update the onboarding process for more seamless account setup.</p><p>You can take a look at a quick preview below:</p> Ecosystem  Panel with PureFi Protocol <p>Just in case you missed our last update, on October 2nd we hosted <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1zqKVqmnqaaxB?s=20&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a great conversation via Twitter Spaces</a> with our partners at PureFi.

<p>Now and through the end of January 2024, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) objectives center on delivering an improved ZEC user experience, primarily through the Zashi wallet. Across teams — Product; Engineering; PeopleOps; and Communications and Advocacy — ECC employees are focused on work that either directly contributes to the wallet or in some way makes ZEC and Zashi adoption more viable.</p>



<p>Background: ECC uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKR process</a> for prioritizing and delivering measurable work on four-month cycles. In October, teams met and finalized planning for T3 2023-24 (October-January).</p>



<p>Priorities were developed to accomplish or make meaningful progress on the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Release the next version of the Zashi app including a new UX and UI 



 Transition more responsibilities to the wider Zcash community so ECC can focus on building Zashi, starting with the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/decentralizing-zcash-digital/45349">Decentralizing Zcash Digital</a> effort.&nbsp; 



 Take meaningful steps in the effort to transition Zcash from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), Zashi’s eventual consensus mechanism, by publishing a design with security arguments, and a protocol simulator. 



 Maintain policy efforts to ensure Zashi and Zcash are (1) accessible and usable by people in the United States and (2) considered socially beneficial. Continue hosting notable policy events and publishing episodes of the PGP for Crypto Podcast. 



 Support select ecosystem teams and projects that directly benefit Zashi users
 
 Support Brave’s integration of Zcash and encrypted media/files. 



 Support Edge, Unstoppable, and Nighthawk’s use of the ECC mobile wallet SDKs. 



 Build and/or improve Zashi features (e.g., implementing ZIP-317 and Orchard). 
 
 
 



<p>Each ECC team has built their OKRs to support these company objectives.</p>

 Intro <p>Panther community,</p><p>As we conclude Testnet Stage 1 with a number of learnings and upgrades, we are thrilled to announce the commencement of Stage 2 of our Testnet.</p><p>This second phase is designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. As Panther’s privacy is built upon unique game-theoretical features fostering user activity, Stage 2 is key for the upcoming Panther Protocol v1.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Stage 2. It comprises three main categories of reward mechanisms: Rewards, Recharge pool, and Vouchers.</p> 1. Rewards <p>Rewards or protocol reward points (PRPs) are created as an incentive for users to join and continuously use Panther Protocol. This implies converting the ‘Available PRP’ to ZKP which is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps/single-side-automated-market-maker?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">single-sided AMM</a> (automated market maker) pool. It is one-sided because users can only convert their PRP to ZKP and not vice versa. The exchange rate of this conversion is dynamic in nature and depends on several factors, including the amount of ZKP in the pool and the total available PRP held by users at any given point in time, among other factors. For details on how Panther Rewards works, please see <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/fees-and-rewards-structure/prps?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p><p>There are two types of PRPs:</p>  Available PRPs which can be exchanged to zZKP (ZKP within the MASP) immediately.  Pending PRP is the accrued rewards that are not realized yet because a user has not spent those UTXOs. To make it available, the UTXO's should be included in transactions that a user performs within Panther.<br>   2. Recharge Pool  <p>The Recharge function is the cornerstone of the protocol’s reward system and allows protocol rewards vested on Mainnet to be injected into the reward distribution process on Polygon (viz the one-sided AMM launched in Stage 2). This dynamic interplay with the AMM pool through the Recharge function fosters active user participation while maintaining a responsive and adaptive reward structure within the protocol. </p> 3. Vouchers <p>Vouchers are a reward mechanism that can be used by the Protocol to incentivize certain functions that have to be triggered by Users. We refer to them as Admin functions. Those could include but are not limited to functions such as:</p>  Recharging Reward Pool  Trigger conversion of token&nbsp;  <p>Note: the onboarding reward voucher issued atThe voucher this Stage is only for testing purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When a new account is created and activated successfully, a user gets (a) 100 zZKP onto his zAccount and (b) 1 voucher which is worth 500 PRP. This is valid for all new users and the users who have created accounts during Stage 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: it can take up to a minute to get the voucher screen updated to let a user find his onboarding voucher.</p><p>The voucher has a stable predefined value which can be different depending on the type of performed action (onboarding = PRP 500, triggering recharge the reward pool = PRP 100). The voucher is nominated in PRP.&nbsp; To get those PRP, one should claim a voucher - it is about submitting a transaction “burn a voucher - get the corresponding PRP”.&nbsp;</p><p>Vouchers are grouped per type of action performed. Stage 2 will have two such groups - (1) Onboarding bonus voucher and (2) Recharge bonus voucher. Vouchers can be claimed by group only, which means a user gets the total PRP for all vouchers in a given group. When claiming is completed successfully, a user will see an updated balance on his (a) Dashboard → Panther Rewards Points section → Available PRP amount and (b) Rewards page → Redeem PRP screen → Available PRP section. &nbsp;</p> STAGE 2 TESTING <p>As we progress through our Testnet stages, we want to express our gratitude for your continued support, feedback, and enthusiasm. To start testing Stage 2, please visit Panther docs <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a> to get the most updated test link and follow the steps:</p>  New user creates and activates Panther Account (existing users go through the same step but the onboarding process bypasses the KYC verification) - see <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">the Stage 1 functionality and instructions</a>.&nbsp;  <p>Note 1.1: both (a) new accounts and (b) previously created during Stage 1 Panther accounts both are valid.&nbsp;</p><p>When your account is successfully created, you will find a success screen:</p>  Find the first part of your onboarding bonus on your dashboard. This bonus is in the form of Panther Account zZKP which is expected to fuel all types of transactions within Panther such as paying Protocol fees, paying to Relayer for gasless transactions, paying Miner’s fee etc. Users are expected to maintain a sufficient balance of this account in zZKP using transfer functions available in later stages.&nbsp;&nbsp;    Find the second part of your onboarding bonus - an onboarding voucher,, which equals 500 PRPs. The voucher should be claimed to get the PRPs into your account. To find the second part, please follow the Rewards menu item =&gt; Vouchers screen =&gt; Onboarding Reward Vouchers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  <p>Note 3.1: It takes time to detect and reflect the corresponding group of vouchers so there can be a case when the screen is empty before the data is updated:</p><p>Note 3.2: It takes time to make your voucher available for claiming, as the zAccount UTXO must be mined in advance. The UI will reflect your bonus voucher. Please be aware that claiming the voucher may take a few minutes in the test environment (due to lower mining activity which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The claim button is disabled until claiming is available.&nbsp;</p>  Claim your voucher via the Vouchers screen functionality. After Voucher is claimed successfully (Voucher screen will go back to the state mentioned in Note 3.1 upon a successfully claimed transaction), you can find the corresponding amount of PRP on the Redeem PRP screen, Available PRP field&nbsp;  <p>Note 4.1: Sometimes, it may take a few minutes to display the PRP available for redeeming (due to lower mining activity in the test environment, which impacts transaction processing in the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/ecosystem-roles/miners?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Bus Queue</a>). The button is disabled until Redeem is successful.&nbsp;</p>  Redeem your PRP from the Redeem PRP screen to get your zZKP. This zZKP will now be available in your Private zAssets section and zAssets Summary section balance in the Dashboard screen.  <p>6. Recharge the reward pool of PRP/zZKP AMM:</p><p>Step 1: Go to the Rewards page and click on recharge pool.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to the Goerli network. The recharge triggers the Vesting contract on the Goerli testnet (Ethereum on production). This requires users to switch networks if they are not on Goerli. This can be done using either in-dApp functionality (Switch Network option) or via Network Management modal (when you are already connected to the product), or via MetaMask functionality. </p><p>Step 3: Check available $ZKP for recharge. Checking that there is enough $ZKP for recharge helps make the decision to trigger the function. The Recharge button will be active only when the ‘Recharge size’ field is non-zero, however, it is not recommended to trigger this function for a smaller recharge amount. </p><p>Also, a zero or a low ‘Recharge size’ means that the recharge was done by other users.&nbsp;</p><p>Step 4: Check and top-up your Goerli ETH balance - this is required to pay for gas to trigger this functionality. To get a test Goerli ETH use the faucet e.g. <a href="https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://beyondfaucet.com/goerli/</a>.<br></p><p>Step 5: Complete the recharge-triggering transaction on the Goerli side by pushing the Recharge Reward Pool button.</p><p>Note 6.1: The recharge executes through bridging functionality which moves $tZKP from Goerli (Ethereum) to Mumbai (Polygon). This operation is dependent on the bridge and may take up to 20 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 6: Check the updated current recharge ratio field. Recharging the pool means injecting more rewards into the Reward AMM, hence, it impacts the ZKP:PRP ratio. The new ratio can be viewed here: </p><p>Note 6.2: Smaller recharge size value will make an insignificant impact on the rate. Testnet allows for multiple recharge to test functionality and bridging. However, it is advised to propose a maximum of once per day recharge in production which will also have a positive impact on the rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Step 7: Check the Vouchers screen. The protocol rewards users for performing the recharge function. Switch to the Mumbai network to view and claim your Recharge Reward Voucher.</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks not just an advancement in the protocol's capabilities, but gets us a step closer to our v1 release.

  Partnering with Factory: Autonomous AI for All  <p>Matan and Eno are building fully-autonomous programming “Droids” to unlock creativity within and beyond engineering teams.</p>   
	By Shaun Maguire	 



Published November 2, 2023
  



 
<p>Like any VC partner, I get a lot of cold emails. But when Matan Grinberg’s note appeared in my inbox in March, it got my attention right away. Just from the subject line—”Chat with a fellow former hep-th physicist”—I knew we shared a background in the same tiny sub-field of high-energy physics theory. And as I read on and Googled a bit, I discovered that what he humbly described as having “worked with Juan” actually referred to co-authoring a paper with Juan Maldacena—a professor at the elite Institute for Advanced Study and arguably the world’s best-known living physicist—when Matan was still an undergrad.</p>



<p>I wrote back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>A few days later, Matan and I went for a walk. He’d been working at the intersection of physics and AI at Berkeley and pursuing a PhD, but was considering a transition from academia to a start-up—and though he hadn’t yet settled on a specific idea, it was clear that he wanted to build a company. It was also clear that he had a high EQ to match his exceptional background. I encouraged him to take the leap.</p>



<p>He started iterating, and within a week was working on the autonomous coding project&nbsp; that would become <a href="https://www.factory.ai/">Factory</a>—and working with a co-founder who, as it turned out, was in Sequoia’s orbit as well.</p>



<p>Eno Reyes, who grew up in Atlanta and first met Matan at Princeton, had recently accepted a job as an ML engineer at Hugging Face and moved to San Francisco’s Mission District—just a block from where his grandparents had settled down and set up a restaurant after immigrating from Puebla, Mexico. Shortly before he and Matan reunited at a hackathon and started building Factory, the Sequoia team met Eno at AI Ascent, a small gathering of the leading minds in AI that we held in March. Just a year out of college and a few months into his new role, he had already impressed enough to join CEO Clem Delangue at the event.</p>



<p>Matan and Eno’s idea was to build on the historic momentum in AI and unlock even more creativity in software development—and not just among engineers. In the face of a persistent tech talent <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/cracking-the-code-on-digital-talent">shortage</a>, with many Fortune 500 companies still running infrastructure built decades ago simply because they don’t have enough people to update it, these two co-founders understood that handing off time-consuming tasks like code review, documentation, testing, project management and debugging to fully autonomous “Droids,” or agents, would indeed be a game-changer for engineering teams. But they also understood that for every software developer, there are another 100 people who don’t have highly technical backgrounds—but do have great ideas that software could bring to life.</p>



<p>It is a next-generation vision for AI, and just a year ago, it would have been too ambitious. But Matan and Eno’s timing is perfect—and they are perfectly suited to the task, not only because of their deep domain expertise in ML, AI and physics, but also because they move at lightning speed. Once they’d landed on an idea, it took them a day to sign a term sheet, incorporate the company and start to build.</p>



<p>Six months later, Factory is delivering value to early customers that include two public companies and two decacorns. Meanwhile, Matan and Eno have more complex functionality on the roadmap, and they are <a href="https://www.factory.ai/careers">growing</a> an amazing team to build it. It has been a joy to welcome them to the Sequoia community, and we look forward to supporting them over the months and years to come as they work toward a world where programming capacity no longer limits our collective creativity.</p>

No longer: pick whatever you need in the NymVPN app and use the internet with confidence.</p><p>Features will include a built-in ‘kill switch’ failsafe so if your VPN or mixnet connection drops, your internet access is blocked too. In time, the VPN will also have split tunnelling features, so users can select exactly which application traffic to route through the mixnet or the VPN, so that they don’t have to switch between the two&nbsp;modes.</p><p>With the shifting sands of censorship and anti-digital rights legislation sweeping across the planet right now, a VPN will be an essential tool for anyone who wants to securely access the internet services that they require. And the Nym R&amp;D team is also <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-censorship-resistance-update-d2f5e08e66d1">exploring proven censorship resistance technologies</a> to further cloak mixnet traffic and make it indistinguishable from anything else — so that any person on the planet can enjoy the privacy protections that are their&nbsp;right.</p><p>With NymVPN, the privacy protections are without parallel.</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf">Read the Litepaper now for an ultra in-depth deep dive of NymVPN, including competitor analysis and the wider privacy landscape. Learn how NymVPN stacks up against traditional VPNs — and even&nbsp;Tor.</a></p><p>With NymVPN, you get real privacy — made&nbsp;simple.</p> Why does the world need NymVPN? Because traditional VPNs aren’t really private. NymVPN&nbsp;is. <p>The VPN market is enormous and growing — in fact, a third of all internet users worldwide use a VPN. That’s billions of people who know they need privacy, integrity, and security. Unfortunately, the vast majority of VPNs do not actually protect your&nbsp;privacy.</p> Traditional VPNs bleed&nbsp;metadata <p>Although they mask traffic from your internet service provider, traditional VPNs are able to see your unencrypted traffic in&nbsp;full.</p><p>Even with your encrypted traffic, your metadata — data about data — remains exposed, and this metadata can be even more revealing than the content of messages&nbsp;itself.</p><p>As the former General Counsel of the NSA, Stewart Baker, once said: “Metadata absolutely tells you everything about somebody’s life. If you have enough metadata, you don’t really need content.”</p><p>NymVPN uses its powerful mix network to obfuscate metadata, preventing powerful adversaries from conducting traffic analysis attacks and de-anonymising users through observing the network. Cloaking metadata is a complex problem and it is one that every existing privacy-preserving technology, even great projects like Tor and Signal, fail to address — until&nbsp;now.</p> Traditional VPNs are centralised — you have to trust the technology and the business, completely <p>Many centralised VPNs, even privacy-focused VPNs, claim they have a “no log policy” — but when push comes to shove, even supposedly private VPNs have turned over information to third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>What’s more, centralised VPNs have a central point of failure, putting them at grave risk of data breaches — <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/whats-the-truth-about-the-nordvpn-breach-heres-what-we-now-know">possibly allowing observers to view&nbsp;traffic</a>.</p><p>When VPNs are centralised, you have to trust their business structure, too, and sometimes this is complicated <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-nordsec-the-company-behind-nordvpn-wants-to-be-your-one-stop-privacy-suite/">by many stakeholders who are not visible at first glance</a>. In the case of ‘free’ VPNs, the user is the product — your every movement being tracked and then sold on to faceless data brokers for&nbsp;profit.</p><p>The question is: why risk entrusting any of this data to an unknown third party at all? It’s better to eliminate the risk of holding unnecessary data at all. This is what decentralisation via the Nym network&nbsp;offers.</p> Zk-nym credentials — solving the paper trail problem with real&nbsp;privacy <p>It is no secret that peoples’ financial lives are not exactly&nbsp;private.</p><p>When users pay for access to traditional VPNs, they leave a digital, financial paper trail behind, linking their payments to their&nbsp;account.</p><p>To solve this problem, NymVPN uses something called <a href="https://nymtech.net/about/zk-nyms">zk-nyms</a> to shred that paper trail and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-unveils-zero-knowledge-anonymous-credentials-zk-nyms-at-sxsw-6d56bd31802a">ensure full privacy from the moment a user&nbsp;pays</a>.</p><p>Zk-nyms are a credentials system based on zero-knowledge technologies. The user can be confident that their payments are private, but to understand exactly why, let’s take a look at what goes on in the background.</p><p>Essentially, zk-nyms are an access token that allow users to access the Nym network. They are issued by Nym-API nodes on the Nym network, after validating a user’s subscription and payment. The current implementation is based on the Coconut scheme, a cryptographic protocol that enables the issuance and verification of anonymous credentials, but optimised for use cases specific to Nym. For a deeper dive head to the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/011">Cryptology ePrint Archive&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>By exchanging fiat to native NYM, not only do zk-nyms preserve the users’ privacy for the whole stack, but this also guarantees the health of the NYM ecosystem, creating a steady stream of fiat to NYM that then circulates in the decentralised network.</p><p>Learn more in Nym Head of Research Ania Piotrowska’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nLmdsZ1BsQg?feature=shared&amp;t=1714">masterclass</a> on&nbsp;zk-nyms.</p> The global decentralised infrastructure behind the&nbsp;NymVPN <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym Explorer</a> for the current distribution of nodes — at present, there are 637 mix nodes in total along with 240 nodes in the ‘active set’, currently mixing traffic, in more than 60 countries.</p><p>While the NymVPN encrypts traffic, the actual nodes that this traffic is mixed through are run completely independently by node operators in order to guarantee decentralisation. With the VPN mode, users will have their traffic run through two hops of these nodes. With the mixnet mode, users will have their traffic run through five hops of these nodes with ‘mixing’ performed in the inner three nodes of the&nbsp;flow.</p><p>This decentralised system is the result of a great deal of academic work designed to create a self-sustaining privacy system. Contrary to privacy projects like Tor which rely on community goodwill, the Nym network is incentivised and governed democratically by its own community. It is the fastest, most reliable mixnet in existence today, making real the idea first conceptualised by legendary cryptographer David Chaum decades&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">original Nym whitepaper</a> and the brand new <a href="https://nymtech.net/nymvpn_litepaper.pdf">NymVPN litepaper</a> for an even deeper dive on the Nym token economics.</p><p>Everyone is invited to participate in the health of this democratic, decentralised system. NymVPN users can, for instance, ‘delegate’ their NYM tokens to mix node operators — a vote of confidence in the quality of service of that node, and an investment, because delegators will receive a share of that node’s&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Node operators and delegators therefore have a symbiotic relationship. Uptime and good quality mixes are rewarded, whereas if nodes perform poorly, the community can remove their NYM tokens from that node at any time, and place them in a competing node.</p><p>The whole system is carefully designed to promote community self-governance, along with an incentivised anti-surveillance business model — one that’s completely at odds with the current pro-surveillance business model of web 2.0. And with the payment conversion from fiat to NYM detailed above, Nym core expects an increase in activity in this ecosystem as more NYM tokens are acquired.</p><p>Below are the two main key entities in the underlying NymVPN network. Note there are more entities in the wider ecosystem specifically relating to our blockchain, smart contracts, economics including vaildators on the Nyx blockchain etc.</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-is-not-a-blockchain-but-it-is-powered-by-one-4bb16ef16587">See also: What is Nyx? Nym mixnet is not a blockchain — but it is powered by&nbsp;one</a></p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/a-breakdown-of-the-smart-contracts-that-run-the-nym-token-economics-3a61b4139f95">See also: A breakdown of the smart contracts that run the Nym token economics</a></p>  Mix nodes/relay nodes: These nodes form the backbone of the Nym network. They are responsible for routing users’ internet traffic through multi-hop paths, adding layers of privacy and security to online activities. Relay nodes are operated by independent individuals, each contributing to the network’s powerful decentralisation.  Gateways: These are the entry point and the exit points for&nbsp;traffic.  <p>Again, in VPN mode, the data goes through two hops — via an entry gateway and an exit gateway, both encrypting traffic and located in different geographies.</p><p>In mixnet mode, the data goes through 5 hops. That’s the entry gateway, three intermediary ‘mix nodes’, where traffic is shuffled or ‘mixed’ so it’s indistinguishable, and the exit&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Together, these entities form a decentralised, private environment where users can enjoy online activities without compromising their personal data or security.</p><p>By the end of 2023, NymVPN Beta will be available for testing to the Nym community. The paid version of NymVPN will launch very, very&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Keep an eye on this blog and Nym socials for updates as they happen.

<p>Brave is also introducing Leo Premium, a paid plan featuring Anthropic’s Claude Instant with faster response times</p>
<p>Three months ago, Brave previewed <a>Leo—the browser-native AI assistant</a>—on its Nightly channel for developers and testers. Since then we’ve seen great adoption, with tens of thousands of users globally. With user feedback, we’ve been able to improve much faster than we’d hoped—on response-times, the quality of responses, even the product UI. Today, we’re excited to announce that Brave Leo is ready for all Brave users, available in desktop release 1.60.</p>
<p>With that testing, we also received requests for new features. The most common one has been to add different AI language models in Leo. To that end, we’re bringing our users advanced conversational AI experiences through <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">Brave Leo Premium</a>—our new paid option featuring Claude Instant, Anthropic’s state-of-the-art AI assistant.</p>


    
    

    


    



    
    


 What is Brave Leo? 
<p>Leo, Brave’s browser AI assistant, can help with all sorts of tasks. It can create real-time summaries of webpages or videos. It can answer questions about content, or generate new content. It can even translate pages, analyze them, rewrite them, and more. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, or creating content, Leo can help.</p>
<p>Leo combines this easy, free access to AI with the privacy focus of Brave. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. With cutting-edge technology and privacy, Brave Leo pushes the boundaries of typical AI chatbot services.</p>
<p>“It is increasingly common today to use AI to ask questions and get assistance. AI can be a powerful tool but it can also present growing concerns for data privacy and there’s a need for a privacy-first solution,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder of Brave. “Brave is committed to pairing AI with user privacy, and will provide our users with secure and personalized AI assistance where they already spend their time online. We’re also thrilled to work with Anthropic to bring Claude’s exceptional conversational abilities to the millions of Brave users worldwide.”</p>

 Introducing Leo Premium 
<p>By default, Brave Leo is free for all users, with easy access to the Llama 2 large language model from Meta. For users who want additional models, Brave is also releasing a premium version of Leo for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$15/month</a>. Leo Premium subscribers will get access to Claude Instant, Anthropic’s faster and lighter model that excels at logical reasoning and coding. The current version of Claude produces longer, more structured responses, follows instructions better than previous versions of Instant, and shows improvements in math, coding, multilingual abilities, and question answering. Additional models will be available to Leo Premium users, as well as access to higher rate limits, higher-quality conversations, priority queuing during periods of peak usage, and early access to new features and improvements.</p>
<p>This integration represents a milestone in delivering sophisticated natural language conversations powered by AI directly within the browser environment. With Claude’s advanced capabilities and Brave’s focus on user privacy and control, we hope to set a new standard for helpful, responsible, and context sensitive AI interactions. Anthropic used <a>Brave’s Search API</a> to train their latest model, Claude 2, on high-quality data to help optimize Claude’s outputs for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) queries.</p>
<p>“We’re excited that Brave is going to bring our state-of-the-art large language model Claude Instant directly into their browser. Integrating access to Claude seamlessly within Brave gives users assistance whenever they need it, right in the context of the page they are on,” says Matt Bell, Head of Product Research at Anthropic. “Whether Brave users are analyzing text, editing documents, or writing code, they can now benefit from having personalized help from Claude at any time. This integration unlocks the potential for AI to enhance people’s browsing and productivity in an intuitive, contextual way.”</p>

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo is no different:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymized server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 Accessing Brave Leo 
<p>Leo is now available to Brave desktop users with version 1.60. It will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today. It will be available on mobile (Android and iOS) in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more at <a>brave.com/leo</a>, and see details about Leo’s roadmap <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it is built right into the Brave desktop browser, and no extra apps or extensions are required. It provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or also as a sidebar, a chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage.</p>
<p>To access Leo, existing Brave users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in Brave Sidebar.</p>

<p>A journey that began in the late summer of 2022, has finally come to a joyful end. Third-party Zcash wallets are working again, and Electric Coin Co. (ECC) is exiting Emergency Mode.</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



<p>Before going further, we need to give the hugest THANK YOU to our wallet partners Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



<p>The ECC engineers deserve special recognition —&nbsp;and possibly a vacation — after putting in long hours over many months on complicated discovery and development. Working through the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">ECC restructure</a> and battling tough deadlines, while tackling other crucial emergencies like the <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">Halborn disclosure</a>, they delivered groundbreaking technology that elevates ZEC user experience.</p>



 Background 



<p>Starting in June 2022, the Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction volume. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable wallets from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. These three wallets rely on ECC’s mobile SDKs.</p>



<p>Wallet syncing processes required scanning the entire blockchain before funds were available to be spent. And when the wallets wouldn’t sync, users couldn’t access or spend their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2022, ECC went into Emergency Mode and put aside all other roadmap priorities. From our blog in March 2023:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a complicated challenge to address, and at minimum, it requires developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that will give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. As mentioned, the solution comprises changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>
</blockquote>



 Emergency Mode exit criteria 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could access and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world private digital cash.</p>



<p>Speed and reliability are also critical to Zcash user experience, and these were our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>With the release of new mobile wallet SDKs 2.0 in September, ECC delivered the final piece in our efforts to mitigate third-party wallet performance issues. Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable quickly implemented the SDKs, and as of today, we are pleased to report that the criteria above have been met.</p>



 What is Spend Before Sync and why is it important? 



<p>Available now in Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable, Spend Before Sync (SBS) introduces non-linear sync, which allows wallets to scan chunks of the blockchain out of order and/or in parallel. This makes it possible for users to spend their existing funds without requiring the wallet to fully sync the entire blockchain.</p>



<p>Separately, but also important, the data structures that enable SBS substantially improve the performance of note commitment tree updates. As an example, Zingo! didn’t adopt SBS, but just by using the updated data structure that wallet got a better than 10x improvement in linear scanning speed.</p>



<p>Aditya Bharadwaj, better known as Adi, founder of Nighthawk, called SBS “a groundbreaking advancement that promises to revolutionize Zcash’s peer-to-peer usage for payments and shielded app interactions.”</p>



 What we learned during Emergency Mode 



 
 Our mobile SDK code did not meet the needs of a typical Zcash user. The syncing UX was confusing and the API design precluded wallets from spending funds until the wallet had fully synced the chain. 



 Before Emergency Mode, and to some extent before the ECC restructure, our team was spread too thin and trying to focus on too many things, which allowed issues like transaction load impact to surface. 



 We knew long ago that a transaction-load issue was possible, but we prioritized other Zcash features and improvements. This challenge of prioritizing new feature improvements versus making the existing system more resilient or robust is always present. In this case we underestimated the likelihood of this problem and the amount of effort it would take to mitigate it. 



 We chose to address the issue in the most thorough manner by making wallets function during high transaction load, rather than the expedient of short-term interventions to lessen the transaction load. We believed those short-term interventions would lead to more complexity without fully resolving the issue in the long run. We still believe our approach was best for the long-term robustness of the Zcash ecosystem, yet we underestimated the time and effort and the overall disruption to Zcash users in the interim. 



 We also learned about comms. It took us too long to define Emergency Mode and communicate a concise explanation and plan, both internally and externally. 



 Having our own wallet in development (Zashi), which uses our SDKs, was key to speeding up the process because it allowed us to test our solutions before deploying and/or sharing with third-party wallets. 
 



<p>With Emergency Mode complete, ECC is turning its attention to our main focus areas: proof-of-stake Zcash, development of the Zashi wallet, continued improvements to SDKs and Zcash Core Libraries, and US Policy work.</p>

      Battling the Trojan Horse in Open Source         
	By Ananya Menon	 



Published November 1, 2023
        Chainguard’s Dan Lorenc is taking on software supply chain security.      



 
<p>Dan Lorenc was at a restaurant in downtown Austin with friends when he received an unusual text. It was the summer of 2021, and the message was from his former coworker, Matt Moore. Lorenc was a software engineer at Google, and he and Moore had worked together on its cyber-security team. The past year had been especially challenging, as the security industry as a whole had faced a reckoning.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2020, SolarWinds reported that its network monitoring platform had been hacked by operatives suspected of working for Russian intelligence. The attackers had planted malware in SolarWinds’ code, which allowed them to access the data of thousands of SolarWinds’ clients, from Microsoft to the U.S. government. The hack exposed a critical flaw in the security of software supply chains. Just as in real-world manufacturing, software is assembled from components created by developers all over the world. At some point during SolarWinds’ development process, malicious actors inserted malware into two software updates, which were then installed by customers all around the world. SolarWinds’ data breach was a wake-up call. Without verifying the integrity of software at every stage of its lifespan this type of hack could and would happen again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moore had left Google earlier in the year, and Lorenc had called him every month since, hoping to convince him to return. Moore was one of the finest software engineers Lorenc knew, and if anyone could find a solution to supply chain security, it was him. That night, Moore’s text to Lorenc said he was ready to get back to work—but not at Google. “Let’s start a new company,” Moore texted. Lorenc didn’t need to think twice. He was in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next day, Lorenc put in notice at Google, bought a new laptop and began work on Chainguard, a company focused on software supply chain security. Although technically the company was born that night in Austin, Lorenc had been preparing for this moment for years.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>The late 2000s ushered in a fundamental shift in the way tech companies approached security, as alarm around new types of digital threats grew. In what became known as Operation Aurora in 2009, Chinese hackers attempted to access and change source code in a series of attacks against companies like Google and Adobe. In the Snowden leaks in 2013, a contracted employee for the NSA hacked its database and leaked classified documents.</p>



<p>Lorenc joined Google in 2012, working on the company’s efforts to secure its own code and protect its databases from external or internal attackers. In 2016, after he and his team had implemented Google’s new, refined security system, Lorenc shifted focus to work on Minikube, a tool for open-source Kubernetes container management. This was Lorenc’s first time working predominantly with open-source code—code that’s freely available for anyone to download, modify and exchange. As Lorenc was building and shipping Minikube to users all over the world, he realized he could have easily slipped malware into the software. The container’s label would read “Minikube,” but few would take time to comb through the thousands of lines of code in every directory of the program to determine exactly what was inside. Proper verification was something that would take an engineer days, weeks or even months to complete—bandwidth they almost certainly didn’t have, and therefore a task that would fall by the wayside.</p>



<p>Lorenc was terrified. Wasn’t it just a matter of time before someone packaged up open-source software that secretly contained code that could put an entire company and its community at risk? “I realized how much damage I myself could do, and how easily,” Lorenc says. “And if I could do that, so could anyone.”</p>



<p>The concern over how to protect software from hidden malware isn’t a new one. In 1984, an engineer named Ken Thompson wrote an article called “Reflections on Trusting Trust” that demonstrated how easy it was to hide Trojan horse viruses in a computer program. Thompson’s point was that you could never fully trust any code you hadn’t written yourself. According to Lorenc, 90-98% of code used today is open source. Most companies focus resources on making sure the tiny amount of code they write themselves is secure, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. “The 2% of proprietary code is the only part you see over the water, but beneath that is the 98% of code you’re not responsible for yourself,” Lorenc says. “In some ways, open-source code is amazing. It’s enabled all this innovation and velocity and reuse. But it’s also scary because that means 98% of your code is written by strangers on the internet. Which is great when people are well-intentioned, but not everyone on the internet is nice.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite evidence of the risks open-source code can pose to a company’s security, Lorenc learned that managing these risks wasn’t something widely prioritized. When he spoke with engineers at other software companies, supply chain security wasn’t a top concern. “Being a software engineer is like playing Whac-A-Mole. There are so many issues you have to deal with on a constant basis that you can’t spend time on preventive measures,” Lorenc says. “You only pay attention to a problem when it rears its head. At this point, there hadn’t been large instances of open-source vulnerability being a problem, so no one seemed to think much about it.”</p>



<p>No one but Lorenc. That is, until December 2020.</p>
 



Lorenc with fierce Chainguard mascot, Charlie



 
<p>Lorenc was at home when he received a news alert about the SolarWinds attack. Thousands of companies were reporting their data, networks and systems compromised—exactly what Lorenc had been worried about. He stood and walked to his car. Lorenc’s house in Austin was close to SolarWinds’ headquarters. He drove there and took a picture of himself in front of its sign. It would serve as a reminder of how important it was that he continue to raise a red flag about the software supply chain. But it was also a moment of validation—he had seen this coming, and he felt vindicated that his concern was justified. Maybe now people would take the problem seriously.</p>



<p>Although Google was not affected by the breach, Lorenc and his coworkers were intimately familiar with the type of attack that SolarWinds fell victim to because they had spent years building internal systems at Google to prevent it. Dan and team would end up working closely with engineers from SolarWinds to help them do the same. (The following year, when Chainguard held a conference to announce its launch, a SolarWinds engineer spoke about how instrumental Lorenc’s team had been in designing its new security system.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the question of how to entirely prevent these attacks remained: When programs are built on hundreds of thousands of lines of open-source code, how do you ensure that every line is as advertised and secure? It’s a problem so large in scale that it feels almost impossible to figure out. Luckily, that’s kind of Lorenc’s thing.</p>



 



<p>Lorenc’s love of solving difficult problems began when he was a kid, fixing up damaged stock cars with his grandfather. They’d spend hours after school and on weekends tinkering together in a small garage. Once the cars were up and running, Lorenc’s grandfather (and after he got his license, Lorenc himself) would race them in community events. When the cars would break down, they would take inventory of the problems and fix them up again. This was the part Lorenc loved most—looking at the engine as a system of parts, understanding how each one functioned and then using that knowledge to fix what wasn’t working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In college, Lorenc pursued mechanical engineering. During his junior year he took a programming class and was hooked. “I was building stuff, but it was a lot faster,” Lorenc says. “You didn’t have to order parts and wait a week for them to ship. You could build those components yourself with a laptop, anywhere.” Software engineering offered the same thrill as fixing up old cars. “It’s that loop of trying to solve a problem, and then either seeing it work or seeing it fail miserably and getting to debug it live. You keep going and get real-time feedback until you solve it. That’s why I liked the computer world. I could do more of that in a lot less time.”</p>



<p>One of the first pieces of code he wrote was a program to solve Rubik’s cubes. The program didn’t work—it kept running without ever arriving at a solution. One of his peers laughed when he saw the code and showed Lorenc how to fix it. It was an important moment. “That’s when I realized, with programming, there’s always a solution,” Lorenc says. “It might not be obvious at first, but it’s there. You just have to find it.”</p>



<p>Lorenc began working at Microsoft soon after he graduated college. He remembers the environment as rewarding, but also stressful. There was a weekend when he and his colleagues were working overtime for an upcoming release, and during a particularly tense moment, his manager pantomimed a Monty Python sketch. Lorenc and his team broke into fits of laughter, and the mood instantly brightened. This left an impression on Lorenc: the need for a work environment that balanced hard work with humor.</p>
 



Chainguard founders Kim Lewandowski, Ville Aikas, Dan Lorenc and Matt Moore.



 
<p>“You’re doing what?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bogomil Balkansky, Chainguard’s partner at Sequoia, sat across the table from Lorenc and Moore, not sure he was hearing them right.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the months since Moore’s initial text to Lorenc at the restaurant in Austin, Chainguard had officially launched, and its founders had begun building its product and seeking out investors. Lorenc says starting a company at the beginning of 2022 wasn’t easy. Inflation was rising and a wave of layoffs at tech companies meant Lorenc would pitch Chainguard to software engineers—potential customers—one day, only to learn the following week that they had been laid off. After months of meetings, they finally gained traction. The need for supply chain security tools was too great, and companies realized they couldn’t handle the job alone.</p>



<p>Lorenc and the Chainguard team first met with Sequoia in the spring of 2022. Balkansky was impressed by Chainguard’s initial product in development, Chainguard Enforce, a program that scans containers and produces an itemized list of the code inside. Engineers can then review the list for malware and loopholes that might make the containers vulnerable to hackers. And so Balkansky was surprised to learn, just days after Sequoia’s partnership with Chainguard was finalized, that, according to Lorenc, Chainguard was in the midst of building out a far more ambitious product: Chainguard Images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In computing, a “container image” refers to a static collection of executable code. Chainguard Images would be a library of these files, made from open-source code that Chainguard engineers would verify, sign, patch and secure. With Chainguard Images, customers would no longer have to opt for open-source code they’d found on the internet and hope for the best. Instead, they could select an image from Chainguard’s library and feel confident that their code was as advertised and could not be edited by bad actors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a massive undertaking, which explained Balkansky’s incredulity when he first learned of it. To execute Chainguard Images, Lorenc and his team would first have to build a Linux distribution, an operating system on which Chainguard Images could run. Balkansky had worked with other companies who had endeavored to do this but hadn’t succeeded; he knew it was an incredibly complex task that could take years to complete, and even then there was no guarantee it would work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky wasn’t the only one who was skeptical. Other software companies with thousands of engineers struggled to believe that Chainguard, with only 25 engineers, could not only build a Linux distribution, but also comb through and verify numerous libraries of code. “Yes, it seemed impossible,” Lorenc says. “Yes, just based on the sheer numbers, the lines of code we would need to pore over and adjust to make secure, it was daunting. Everyone else looked at it and saw it as too hard of a problem, too massive to actually solve. But it seemed obvious it was something we needed to do.” Lorenc shrugs, “To me, it didn’t seem impossible, it just seemed hard. And I’m okay with hard.”</p>



<p>“Hard” paid off. Lorenc and his team spent a year working tirelessly on Chainguard Images. To motivate and energize his team during long days and even longer nights and weekends, Lorenc pulled from the lesson learned at Microsoft, making sure that hours of focus were interspersed with jokes, lighthearted stories and plenty of room for laughter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balkansky was sitting in a conference room in early 2023 when Lorenc let him know Chainguard Images was live. Balkansky’s first thought: “Pretty damn impressive.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Chainguard has rebuilt around 80% of the open-source code most companies use, and because Chainguard is the only company offering access to this type of library, they’re racing to keep up with demand for the remaining 20%. Chainguard also takes custom orders—if a company needs a certain container specific to their product verified, Chainguard will take it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As time consuming and challenging as building out Chainguard Images continues to be, Lorenc recognizes its payoff for users. It’s akin to building a house—yes, you can use cheap and readily available materials for construction and deal with a rickety staircase or a toilet that won’t flush later, but Chainguard’s philosophy is that it’s worth the extra time, money and labor to start with high-quality products. Lorenc believes in taking every measure possible, no matter how complicated it might be, when it comes to keeping software and its users safe.</p>



 



<p>Working in security necessitates a certain amount of paranoia—the fear of what you’ve missed, of an unseen crack or fatal flaw, is relentless. Lorenc’s use of humor to assuage the high-risk, high-anxiety environment has paid off in more ways than one. He regularly makes his own memes, many of which have gone viral within software development communities. One meme shows Ken from the Barbie movie, with the caption “My job is just CVEs.” (CVEs meaning “Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.”) Another depicts Ned Stark from “Game of Thrones,” with a caption that reads “Brace yourselves. VEX is coming.” (VEX is an open platform for sharing information about software vulnerabilities.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lorenc’s goal in creating memes was originally to provide levity and form a community with people working in security, so he was surprised when his social media presence ended up being one of Chainguard’s most successful marketing strategies. Lorenc regularly sees his memes making rounds on LinkedIn and X, formerly Twitter. Chainguard’s TikToks are also popular among engineers, many of which feature Lorenc, in his trademark backward baseball cap, speaking to viewers as though he was guiding a friend through a casual tutorial on software security. Lorenc attributes the love for Chainguard’s social media to his users’ desire for authenticity. He’s not some faceless CEO of a corporation; he’s a software engineer, just like his customers, and he speaks their language. It’s not a traditional avenue for a security company to market itself, but Chainguard has always done things its own way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his numerous duties as CEO, Lorenc’s favorite part of the job is still working with other engineers to solve complex and granular problems. He thinks Chainguard was able to attract some of the best engineers in the industry precisely because the company has such lofty goals. “The people on our team were drawn to the difficulty of our mission,” he says. “Smart people want to work on hard problems.” Often when people encounter what seems like an impossible series of problems, they get overwhelmed, but not Lorenc. He knows every inch of this engine, and working on it part by part, he’s confident he can get it to run.</p>

This partnership will integrate the Nym mixnet into the NEAR ecosystem, providing unparalleled privacy to all traffic transmitted across the blockchain — allowing users to access their favourite NFTs, DeFi protocols, and dApps away from the prying eyes of malicious actors like cyber-criminals.</p><p>NEAR Protocol is a leading layer 1 blockchain that operates with many ‘shards’, each acting like its own independent blockchain. Because transactions take place independently of one another, NEAR Protocol is able to provide ultra-high speed, throughput, and scale to projects in its ecosystem.</p><p>Earlier this year, the NEAR Protocol unveiled the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.) to create the ideal entry point of the Open Web, and to seamlessly bridge the gap between web 2.0 and Web3. B.O.S. addresses critical challenges around building frontends for Web3 apps, including access, security, composability, and time to market. With B.O.S., the code for Components is permanently stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, version control, and easy exploration.</p><p>The NEAR ecosystem supported Nym early in its development path via Nym’s participation in the Open Web Collective in 2021, a Web3 incubator sponsored by the NEAR Foundation.</p><p>However, the open, transparent nature of public permissionless blockchains means that transaction data is visible to anyone who cares to look, and even off-chain information like IP addresses and geolocation data can be vulnerable to being exposed. This opens users and validators up to surveillance, targeted attacks, and cyber&nbsp;crime.</p><p>Nym and the NEAR Foundation share the same vision for the future of privacy in Web3. The future of the internet can only take shape successfully provided that it is private, and does not repeat the same mistakes of the legacy internet — namely, monopoly, surveillance, and putting user privacy at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>“Blockchain technology is a large change in digital communications but it’s an open secret that by their very nature, blockchains are not private,” said Harry Halpin, cofounder and CEO at Nym Technologies. “Only weaving privacy into the fabric of Web3 can ensure its success. Nym is highly modular and the mixnet can be plugged into any blockchain, giving users and builders the confidence that they’re not being tracked and followed across the internet or painting targets on themselves for cyber criminals.”</p><p>To make this vision a reality, the Nym mixnet will integrate into NEAR Protocol to encrypt and cloak traffic across the whole ecosystem. By masking off-chain metadata traffic, not only is transaction data protected in transit, but this makes it much more difficult for adversaries to de-anonymise users via their public IP addresses.</p><p>To protect these traffic patterns from analysis, the Nym mixnet splits data into identical encrypted packets and disperses these in three hops to ‘mix nodes’ worldwide via the mixnet. Cover traffic is then inserted into the mix at randomised times to further obfuscate the nature of the communication. This makes tracking metadata patterns impossible, even for powerful adversaries with a global view of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Chris Donovan, CEO of the NEAR Foundation said: “Privacy is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of the Web3 vision to create a more secure, user-centric and user-empowered web. We are proud to support Nym and its innovative technology, which will help developers and users across the NEAR ecosystem maintain their privacy.”</p><p>By integrating the Nym mixnet into any ecosystem, partners can have confidence that their developers, operators, and users are able to enjoy real privacy, shielding them from surveillance and cyber criminals.</p><p>The Nym mixnet is layer-0 privacy infrastructure: it is chain-agnostic and can be integrated into any blockchain to obscure traffic, protect privacy, and secure users and validators. By partnering with Nym, Near joins other Web3 projects like <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/new-mixnet-integration-nym-for-monero-f0a3068e803f">Monero</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-partners-with-aztec-to-provide-integral-infrastructure-privacy-in-ethereum-chains-694963c55192">Aztec</a>.</p><p>For more information about Nym please visit <a href="https://nymtech.net/">https://nymtech.net/</a></p><p>About Nym Technologies</p><p>Nym Technologies is a trailblazing leader in privacy and blockchain technology. With a mission to empower individuals and organizations with privacy-enhancing solutions, Nym develops cutting-edge technology that conceals sensitive data and enhances digital privacy. Backed by visionary investors and renowned validators, Nym Technologies is at the forefront of a more private and secure digital&nbsp;future.</p><p>About NEAR Foundation:</p><p>NEAR Foundation is a non-profit that supports the growth and development of the NEAR ecosystem and the Blockchain Operating System (B.O.S.), a full stack Web3 development and app distribution platform at the heart of an open web.

 Introducing PIVX Perspectives:<br>Engaging conversations with remarkable contributors to the PIVX community. Get ready for insightful dialogues about PIVX’s journey and future. Stay tuned for inspiring stories from various individuals who have played an important role in the PIVX ecosystem. <p>Our first guest is Jeffrey, PIVX Business Development Lead and a key driving force behind the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Can you tell us a little about yourself please?<br>Hey everyone, my name is Jeffrey, I currently live in South Africa but I have also lived in Indonesia and Singapore. I’m an extremely passionate and energetic person when it comes to digital finance and privacy, advocating for secure and efficient financial solutions in a digital age. My academic journey took me to Singapore where I completed my Bachelors in IT with Distinction. During this time is where I became deeply interested in the world of digital finance, as Singapore is a hub for&nbsp;fintech.</p><p>I’ve been a proud member of the PIVX family since early 2017, joining right around the time of the rebrand. It’s been a fortunate journey, allowing me to witness the remarkable growth of the project and actively contribute to its&nbsp;success.</p><p>When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?<br>My cryptocurrency journey goes quite far back and is actually thanks to a stranger, I was part of a social group where people share discounts or deals on servers. Someone wanted to pay on this particular website for a linux VPS but they wanted PayPal. So in return he sent me my first ever Bitcoin and I paid using PayPal. I believe this was back in late 2012 or early 2013. The wallet at the time I used was called MultiBit if I recall correctly. During this time I also experienced so many issues with online payment methods especially since I am from South Africa and many at the time did not provide their services or had lengthy and often privacy invading verification processes. Bitcoin was so fast, I remember being like wow I received this already and didn’t need to register or provide any of my information. My passion grew and I loved superior technology. Sadly I did end up using it as my main payment method for online goods and services lol so could not really enjoy the extreme growth over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>When and why did you choose to get involved with PIVX?<br>Cryptocurrency was starting to go really viral in 2017, It was at this time myself and some online friends were all looking to invest and buy more. The best way to find new cryptocurrencies to invest in at this time was to browse BitcoinTalk. I was lucky enough to find the PIVX post in 2017 on the forum. I read it was a coin dedicated to privacy which piqued my interest. The forum post also provided a Slack invitation link so PIVX ended up being the first cryptocurrency that I joined the official community for. So I guess initially my first finding out about PIVX was for investment purposes however the community was so helpful. I learned so much in just a week there amongst all the “Purple Rain” showers of PIVX tips flying out to everyone. I dedicated so much time that I ended up assisting with the support team by providing technical assistance as well as hosting calls to show people how to trade&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the market?<br>For me it’s the human touch. PIVX is the only community where anyone can just join in and discuss openly and share ideas with developers, graphics designers, moderators and others from many backgrounds. PIVX may be a privacy coin but it’s extremely human-centric. What I love most is the aim to redefine privacy to its root. That privacy is not for criminals but simply a human right to protect oneself from malicious parties. PIVX makes this privacy option dubbed “SHIELD” completely optional therefore giving the user complete control over how they spend their PIV. PIVX also is a DAO with a treasury guaranteeing constant development and growth therefore PIVX in my opinion has a stable future and is here to secure your digital financial footprint.</p><p>How do you envision PIVX’s role in the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies?<br>PIVX has an ambassador program as well as community members that are introducing PIVX for the first time to many people, many of which will be their first ever crypto and therefore the beginning of their cryptocurrency journey. PIVX sets a benchmark through their meticulous development process that ensures the safety of their blockchain and privacy protocol.</p><p>This unwavering commitment to user safety and the protection of their assets sets a noteworthy example for other cryptocurrencies to follow almost like a benchmark. By establishing such high standards, PIVX contributes to the creation of a safer and more secure environment for newcomers, ultimately fostering increased adoption.</p><p>Can you share any success stories or notable achievements during your time at PIVX?<br>Honestly my biggest achievement in my cryptocurrency career with PIVX is getting feedback from our community on their experiences with PIVX and seeing how positive it is. I work as the lead of business development, I secure new listings and integrations. When I come across fellow Pivians enthusiastically sharing how they’ve started accepting PIVX through platforms like NowPayments, booked flights on Travala using PIVX, or found joy in trading on exchanges such as WhiteBit and LBank, it represents the pinnacle of success for me. More recently, learning how PIVX is enabling our community to make a difference by assisting families in need through the purchase of gift cards on Coinsbee is both humbling and inspiring. It’s not just about me, it’s about the collective impact my decisions make and how they can help others. I hope all my work and achievements combined empowers our community and fellow PIVX holders to explore new possibilities with&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>How do you approach building strong relationships with exchange platforms and integrating PIVX into their trading systems?<br>I begin this first with market research, identifying areas that we lack. For example an exchange that doesn’t require KYC or perhaps provides GBP withdraws to a bank, Once I establish a decent list of exchanges that provide our needs I proceed to contact&nbsp;them.</p><p>The most important thing is a mutual understanding of the objective. Once we establish that we would like a relationship that is more than just trading PIVX but actually engaging with both communities and building together then I can proceed to discuss listings. Exchanges and cryptocurrencies work hand in hand in securing the future of Crypto. Not everyone supports centralised exchanges however it is thanks to them that cryptocurrency is thriving and vice versa. If an exchange wants to foster a relationship that involves us potentially collaborating on future marketing events or conferences then this is a good sign. If an exchange simply wants a listing fee and nothing more then that is a red flag in my&nbsp;book.</p><p>Obviously I will always advise anyone to do their own research on the exchange before trading however if an exchange is positive and wants to highlight the growth of PIVX and be apart of it, I will do my part by making this known to our communities and giving them the thanks they deserve as well as collaboration on any marketing from our&nbsp;side.</p><p>Thank you for reading our PIVX perspectives, stay tuned for more exciting insights and future&nbsp;updates.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/introducing-pivx-perspectives-engaging-conversations-with-remarkable-contributors-to-the-pivx-bcc9f0698ed8">Introducing PIVX Perspectives:

<p>Introduction:<br>In the world of cryptocurrency, liquidity plays a crucial role in ensuring smooth and efficient trading. PIVX has experienced significant improvements in liquidity thanks to the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on Binance. Over the past seven weeks, this program has not only enhanced trading opportunities but also increased the chances of reintroducing a USDT pair on the exchange.</p><p>Enhanced Liquidity on Binance:<br>Since the launch of the <a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/market/76?snapshotTimestamp=1698515760000&amp;interval=1">Hummingbot Liquidity Program, </a>PIVX has witnessed a notable improvement in liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance. The sufficient liquidity provided by HummingBot has allowed for a more stable market that meets the supply and demand of services such as payment gateways that use Binance as an exchange. Sufficient liquidity provides a better market for traders and service providers.</p><p>Positive Results and Future Prospects:<br>During the campaign, Hummingbot miners have traded over $1.5 million worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair. The campaign has consistently ranked among the top three in terms of performance, with an average of 15.5 active bots, $9.93k in open order volume, and $35.1k in daily filled order volume. These figures account for nearly 6% of the total traded volume for PIVX/BTC on&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>The success of the campaign has prompted a proposal to extend it for another eight weeks on the PIVX/BTC pair. If this extension proves fruitful, there are plans to introduce a longer campaign with increased rewards in both PIVX and HBOT tokens, the native crypto of Hummingbot.</p>First 8 weeks of Hummingbot Liquidity Program on&nbsp;Binance.<p>About Hummingbot:<br><a href="https://miner.hummingbot.io/">Hummingbot</a>, developed by the Hummingbot Foundation, is an open-source market-making bot that aims to democratize high-frequency trading. It provides a platform for token projects, trading firms, and individual traders to own their liquidity and earn rewards through liquidity mining. Hummingbot has evolved from a simple market-making bot into a powerful platform that allows users to create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots running various trading strategies.</p><p>The Importance of Liquidity:<br>Liquidity is a crucial metric for financial assets and trading venues. Traditionally, market making, the provision of liquidity, has been limited to a few participants such as quantitative hedge funds and large financial institutions. However, the Hummingbot Liquidity Program enables anyone to become a market maker and contribute to liquidity provision in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>A Marketplace-Based Approach:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program takes a marketplace-based approach to promote consistent liquidity provision, improve matching efficiency, and mitigate the risk of manipulative practices. Inspired by successful two-sided digital marketplaces in other industries, this approach tackles the liquidity fragmentation problem in the crypto market, benefiting both exchanges and token&nbsp;issuers.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>The Hummingbot Liquidity Program has proven to be highly beneficial for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX</a>, enhancing liquidity on the PIVX/BTC pair on Binance and fostering increased trading opportunities. With impressive results and a positive outlook for the future, continuing the program will contribute to the long-term growth and success of PIVX. By leveraging the power of Hummingbot and its marketplace-based approach, PIVX can further strengthen its position in the crypto market and attract more liquidity providers, ultimately supporting a USDT pair too, perhaps with its own Hummingbot Liquidity Program, benefiting all stakeholders involved</p>Miners on Hummingbot have traded over 1.5 million dollars worth of PIVX on the PIVX/BTC pair during the first campaign. <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/the-beneficial-impact-of-the-hummingbot-liquidity-program-on-pivx-b2cd2734b75e">The Beneficial Impact of the Hummingbot Liquidity Program on PIVX</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While competition fosters innovation, the proliferation of different blockchains has resulted in the fragmentation and isolation of liquidity within each ecosystem. Early attempts to address this issue primarily involved bridges and wrapped assets. Unfortunately, these solutions were often vulnerable to hacks and exploits, and the value of wrapped assets was contingent on the security of the wrapper contract, rather than the underlying asset. Cross-chain swaps of native assets hold the promise of resolving liquidity fragmentation, but numerous technological challenges must be overcome to make them as seamless as same-chain swaps.</p><p>We were joined by Simon Harman, founder of Chainflip, to discuss multi-chain liquidity fragmentation and how Chainflip’s JIT AMM (Just in Time) aims to solve this, by providing cross-chain native swaps.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Simon’s background  (Legacy) Bridging vs. Threshold Signature Scheme  Chainflip’s Just in Time (JIT) AMM vs. Uniswap’s V3/X  Providing liquidity on Chainflip  Slippage and UX  Deciding trading pairs  Chainflip validators  Validator stake auctions  Governance  Roadmap and bootstrapping liquidity  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/SimonAHarman">Simon Harman on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Chainflip">Chainflip on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

 Embrace the Web3 Revolution 



<p>Horizen EON’s foundation rests on the belief that the path to web3 adoption involves enhancing the web2 experience. It is not looking to reinvent the wheel but to optimize it, ensuring that the unique features of web3 (like Tokenization, Authentication, and Interoperability) seamlessly integrate into applications that are familiar and user-centric.</p>



<p>Across cutting-edge verticals, EON aims to support innovative application ideas that can bring the next generation of builders and consumers to web3.</p>



<p>As the world has been ushering in a new era of decentralized applications, Horizen invites developers, innovators, and users to join the Horizen EON ecosystem and work together to drive mainstream adoption of web3 technologies, foster a more connected multi-chain world, and create solutions that cater to users at every stage of the Web3 journey.</p>

  Partnering with Chkk: Your Kubernetes Co-Pilot  <p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are helping devops catch problems before they lead to downtime.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky	 



Published October 25, 2023
  



Awais, Bogomil, Fawad and Ali at Sequoia.



 
<p>If you’re building an application hosted in the cloud today, there’s a very good chance it’s running on Kubernetes. In fact, a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">survey</a> by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) found an impressive 96% of organizations using or evaluating K8s—and as ever-more business-critical apps land on the platform, its uptime and availability have become a top concern for Platform Engineering, SRE and DevOps teams. But some of Kubernetes’ main strengths, its flexibility and its vibrant ecosystem of add-ons, come with a price: complexity. Navigating the multiple configs and tracking intricate dependencies, across multiple layers and multiple add-on solutions, is not for the light-hearted. A typical Kubernetes footprint is not a single platform or product; rather, it is a complex environment built using components from add-ons in the CNCF ecosystem, many of them open source, and some of them commercial products. Each add-on has its own release and upgrade schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The seams between these products are where failures most often occur, and most current tooling is designed to address problems after the fact—meaning devops and SREs get stuck in fire-fighting mode. This reactive troubleshooting is both painful and resource-intensive, with even mundane config changes and upgrades taking a lot of time and effort.</p>



<p>But what if you could add a proactive tool to your toolbelt, to warn you about potential issues—and help you fix them—before they ever lead to downtime? That tantalizing possibility is now a reality with <a href="https://www.chkk.io/">Chkk</a>, a first-of-its-kind platform that allows enterprises to identify and address availability risks and upgrade their Kubernetes deployments safely, quickly and with confidence. Think of it like the X-ray that diagnoses your health issue early on—so it doesn’t land you in the ER.</p>



<p>Chkk co-founders Awais Nemat, Fawad Khaliq and Ali Khayam took inspiration from best practices in cybersecurity, where security vulnerabilities are reported publicly. Similarly, Chkk is building a database of availability risks by tracking the behavior of hundreds of Kubernetes projects. Powered by this innovative Collective Learning technology, the platform then continuously scans your environment to find and prioritize risks and prevent disruptions—and even creates pre-verified plans to reduce upgrade time from weeks to days. Teams learn from other’s mistakes so they don’t repeat them, and developers spend far less of their valuable time putting out fires.</p>



<p>Awais, Fawad and Ali are a founding dream team who worked together for more than a decade, including at AWS and on the team that built Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and they understand the challenges Platform, SRE and DevOps teams are facing firsthand. Now, they’re on a mission to solve those same problems for all developers, and we at Sequoia are thrilled to support them and lead this seed round. With their Kubernetes Availability Platform now in general availability and with more infrastructure teams adopting Kubernetes every day, we believe this is just the beginning—for Chkk’s growing team, and for the indispensable technology they’re building.</p>

 Noir comes to the&nbsp;browser! <p>Today we’re releasing NoirJS- a Javascript package for <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> developers who want to build real applications that generate zero knowledge proofs in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>Web development within the Noir ecosystem has historically been, uhm, complex. Practically, that meant Noir developers couldn’t really build applications that ran in the browser. And we want people to build applications with our software!</p> Y u no&nbsp;browser <p>A browser is an application used to access the World Wide Web and interact with Internet applications. It turns out most people like using browsers.</p><p>Before today, Noir didn’t really let you build applications that could run in-browser. Instead, developers were forced to run applications locally in a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>In simple terms, that meant Noir couldn’t actually support real applications.</p><p>But now Noir does support applications with&nbsp;NoirJS.</p><p>The goals of NoirJS are&nbsp;simple:</p>  Enable Noir applications to work in web&nbsp;browsers  Simplify package management  Improve DevEx from “oh God” to “oh&nbsp;good”   Reminder on what Noir&nbsp;is <p>Noir is a zero knowledge circuit-writing language that works with multiple crypto proving back-ends. That means the front-end (the language) remains the same but Noir can be modularized to support the latest and greatest in zero knowledge proving research.</p><p>We do this through the ACIR (abstract circuit intermediate representation). Learn more about the ACIR&nbsp;<a href="https://noir-lang.org/#whats-new-about-noir">here</a>.</p><p>NoirJS lets developers build around the core concept of client-side compute: the ability to harness user hardware-phones, laptops, tablets-through the browser in order to compute proofs of execution.</p><p>And client-side compute in turn allows for fully private and trustless blockchain systems.</p><p>…sound familiar??</p><p>That’s the core philosophy of Aztec-giving developers the tools to develop programs with private data and compute while remaining fully trustless.</p>  Users download encrypted data  They decrypt and manipulate the data locally (unbeknownst to anyone&nbsp;else)  They furnish a proof of computational correctness  They submit the&nbsp;proof  <p>In English: do blockchain things without anyone knowing! Cool,&nbsp;right?</p><p>And for developers’ convenience, NoirJS is packaged with Barretenberg-the same Plonkish backend used by <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec Labs</a> in the Aztec rollup. No need to go shopping for a proving system unless you like, really want&nbsp;to.</p> Quality of Life Improvements <p>NoirJS does a lot of other things, too! Developers were previously burdened by the need to manage multiple components like `bb.js`, `acvm`, `noirc_abi`, and future components like `noir_wasm`.</p><p>But managing component libraries and balancing version compatibility is not our idea of&nbsp;fun.</p><p>To install NoirJS you simply run `npm i @noir-lang/noir_js` in your Javascript directory</p><p>Install your proving backend of choice (ahem, probably Barretenberg), and you’re good to&nbsp;go.</p><p>NoirJS handles all Noir dependencies, exposing them through one clean interface, allowing you to focus on building rather than fiddling with packages.</p><p>Here are some other advantages:</p><p>Immediate Access: Browser-based applications don’t require additional software, making it easier for developers to reach a wider audience.</p><p>Improved User Experience: By enabling Noir functionality in the browser, users can interact with applications in real-time. That means fast&nbsp;apps.</p><p>Enhanced Security: Operating in the browser allows for client-side cryptography, offering an additional layer of security for applications that require cryptographic proofs.</p><p>Developer Flexibility: NoirJS enables developers to build rich, client-side applications with cryptographic functions, providing a broader toolkit for web development.</p><p>Community Building: Browser-based Noir enables rapid prototyping and sharing among the developer community. This is especially useful for teams who focus on in-browser applications and use-cases.</p><p>In-Browser Tooling: NoirJS fits seamlessly with in-browser IDEs like VSCode for web, allowing for a streamlined development process in which Noir programs can be compiled and proven directly in the&nbsp;browser.</p><p>So to summarize, by bringing Noir to the browser,&nbsp;we’re:</p>  simplifying development  expanding the scope and capabilities of what can be built with&nbsp;Noir  <p>Siiick.</p> Use-Cases and Applications <p>Less development pain means more time for building new applications. Here are some use-cases we’re excited to&nbsp;see:</p>  Pseudonymous identity web apps: Projects like <a href="https://www.noxx.xyz/">Noxx</a> are focused on building pseudonymous identity web&nbsp;apps.  In-browser ZK games: Tonk.gg’s NES emulator <a href="https://tonk-gg.github.io/dappicom-site/">Dappicom</a> can now incorporate Noir functionalities seamlessly.  Proof of solvency: prove solvency or liquidity without exposing the underlying assets or&nbsp;trades  On-chain poker: play poker with its hidden card dynamics without a trusted third&nbsp;party  zkEmail: decentralized e-mail with no trusted&nbsp;servers   Conclusion <p>NoirJS lets you build real Noir applications that run in the browser. It also makes your life easy breezy beautiful CoverGirl.</p><p>If you don’t know what Noir is, read <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/introducing-noir-the-universal-language-of-zero-knowledge/">this announcement</a>, scan <a href="https://noir-lang.org/">these docs</a>, and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AHsyRkd2is&amp;ab_channel=ETHGlobal">this&nbsp;video</a>.</p><p>If you do know what Noir is, install NoirJS <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right now</a>. <a href="https://noir-lang.org/dev/noir_js/">Right&nbsp;now</a>.</p><p>And if you end up building something cool, <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">come ask us for&nbsp;money</a>.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="http://aztec.network/blog/announcing-noirjs-noir-applications-in-your-browser">https://aztec.network</a> on October 25,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-noirjs-privacy-preserving-zk-applications-in-your-browser-d7d78692f15a">Announcing NoirJS: Privacy-Preserving ZK Applications In Your Browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Due to this oversight, a malicious sequencer-and only a malicious sequencer-could exploit this computation via Aztec Connect’s escape hatch, a mechanism for individuals to exit funds directly to L1 Ethereum.</p><p>The primary challenge emanated from the inherent complexities of executing integer arithmetic within ZK circuits. These circuits are designed to operate over finite fields, making integer operations particularly tricky.</p><p>The crux of the problem was tied to the system’s handling of integer division and the subsequent remainders. In the absence of proper constraints, a sequencer could manipulate the `user_output` value, adjusting the remainder to ensure the primary equation still held true. This opened up avenues for multiple valid decompositions for a single value, making it a target for exploitation.</p><p>The remedy involved introducing stringent constraints to ensure a consistent and direct mapping between the original values and their decomposed counterparts. Furthermore, to prevent any undue advantage to the sequencer, the remainder value was also carefully constrained.</p><p>This incident with Aztec Connect serves as a poignant reminder of the complexities and potential pitfalls inherent in developing large-scale projects, even with extensive auditing. It underscores the necessity for continuous scrutiny, highlighting the invaluable role of bug bounty programs in maintaining the security and reliability of such&nbsp;systems.</p> Conclusion <p>Our $450,000 bug bounty payment to <a href="https://github.com/lucash-dev">lucash-dev</a> is our largest ever, and a reiteration of our commitment to open source software development.</p><p>We appreciate him and the broader ZK community for maintaining a high degree of vigilance over complex crypto&nbsp;systems.</p><p>We strongly encourage all users of <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> and third party Aztec Connect products to withdraw funds as soon as possible. Support for <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> will be sunset in March 2024, after which individuals will have to withdraw funds by running their own sequencers.</p>  Navigate to <a href="http://zk.money">zk.money</a> to withdraw&nbsp;funds  Read our full technical breakdown <a href="https://hackmd.io/OrsPExbWTJaJAX5A8dCvGw">here</a>  Full withdrawal documentation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aztec.network/misc/aztec_connect_sunset">here</a>  <p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/aztec-connect-postmortem/">https://aztec.network</a> on October 24,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/aztec-labs-announces-our-largest-ever-bug-bounty-of-450-000-434ab2477b3a">Aztec Labs Announces Our Largest-Ever Bug Bounty Of $450,000</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Stablecoins represent a safe haven against crypto’s volatility, allowing participants to remain in the market, without off-ramping to fiat. While the major stablecoins are centrally issued (e.g. USDT, USDC, BUSD), there is a pressing need for an algorithmic variant or a synthetic dollar asset. (DAI is somewhere in between since approximately 50% of its collateral is USDC). After Luna’s collapse, many jumped to point out its design flaws, yet such a concept would be crucial for crypto’s decentralisation and self-sustainability. Arthur Hayes proposed an interesting concept of NAKA synthetic dollar (NUSD), backed by Bitcoin and its inverse perpetual swap short. However, yield generation on $BTC is significantly lower than that of $ETH. A sustainable yield would help balance the cases in which funding rates would be negative (a minority in crypto).</p><p>We were joined by Guy Young, co-founder of Ethena, to discuss the stablecoin landscape and their synthetic eUSD, backed by staked ETH and its inverse perpetual swap.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Guy’s background and founding Ethena  The history of stablecoins  The stablecoin trilemma and transparency  eUSD synthetic dollar mechanics  Ethena’s insurance fund and hedging  Minimising the impact of depegging  Leveraging centralised liquidity while maintaining self custody through MPC  User experience  Risk factors  CEX vs. DEX: liquidity, infrastructure, UX  The potential of fixed return rates  Supply &amp; rates equilibrium  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/leptokurtic_">Guy Young on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ethena_labs">Ethena Labs on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/dust-on-crust-300d4b5cf3ec">Arthur Hayes' article proposing the Naka synthetic dollar</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Felix Lutsch.

    <p>Q3 2023 was full of growth and exciting milestones for the Horizen ecosystem! The Horizen DAO went live and the core team launched the Alpha version of Horizen’s EVM sidechain, EON on mainnet. This alpha launch has activated increased developer activity and&nbsp; BD partnerships – watch out for more news in the coming weeks!</p>
<p>We look forward to another fruitful and productive quarter!</p>
<p></p>
 Launch of the Horizen DAO 
<p></p>
<p>Last month, the Horizen DAO officially launched, marking the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!<br><br><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">Learn more about the Horizen DAO launch in our blog post.</a></p>
 Horizen EON Alpha Launch&nbsp; 
<p>On August 1st, Horizen EON Alpha was activated on mainnet, marking the beginning of the on-boarding phase for launch partners &amp; early builders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Horizen EON documentation can be found in our <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/">documentation hub</a>, featuring content around different network environments, developing and deploying smart contracts, staking, service providers, and tutorials.</p>
<p>The core team has also worked to release a new software upgrade that adds a new voting power contract for the Horizen DAO governance, improved the node synchronization speed, and enhanced security&nbsp; features.</p>
 Horizen EON Q3 Partnerships and Integrations 
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-partners-with-wanchain-to-expand-cross-chain-interoperability-for-eon-horizens-evm-compatible-smart-contracting-platform/">Wanchain Expanding Cross-Chain Interoperability for EON</a></p>
<p>Wanchain is an R&amp;D-focused blockchain interoperability project whose mission is to drive blockchain adoption through interoperability by building fully decentralized bridges that connect the world’s many siloed blockchain networks.</p>

 Horizen EON Welcomes NTT DATA, Joining The Network As A Certificate Signer Node To Support The Growth And Security Of The EON Network 
<p>Last month, a leading IT service provider and global innovation partner, NTT DATA, is deploying a Horizen EON blockchain Certificate Signer Node on the NTT DATA infrastructure, which will contribute proactively to the credibility, security, and robustness of the Horizen EON network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen EON chain will have a total of 47 certificate signer nodes. These signer nodes provide credibility to the transactions on the EON chain and ensure decentralization. They are responsible for signing backward transfer requests allowing the flow of ZEN from the EON chain to the Horizen mainchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-welcomes-ntt-data-joining-the-network-as-a-certificate-signer-node/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=marketing+EON">Learn more about this announcement here.&nbsp;</a></p>

 ZenIP 42206 – Redirecting Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON 
<p></p>
<p>Horizen’s Community Council has recently submitted <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42204-draft/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a>, which proposes a redirect of the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. The purpose is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zendoo has increased the requirements of mainchain nodes so that the Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen chain. Furthermore, with the removal of the shielded pools on the mainchain, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.</p>
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more about ZenIP 42206 </a>and let us know what you think by submitting the community survey:</p>

 Community Voting Proposals 
<p>During Q3, the Horizen ecosystem saw a few different community voting proposals ongoing. Featuring a proposal for <a href="https://debank.com/proposal/15639">Rabby Wallet to support the EON chain</a>, Tally, a leading DAO tool to join the EON chain, and a request for Phantom Wallet to integrate with EON.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also saw a proposal to deploy Synapse on Horizen EON, this deployment aims to establish connectivity between the Horizen Ecosystem and a wide range of popular Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains connected to the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hype of web3 in marketing has entered the chat. More and more businesses from various industries turn towards leveraging web3 opportunities within their marketing campaigns. To put this into reality, so has the <a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/how-loreal-is-gearing-up-for-the-metaverse/">L’Oréal Group</a> utilised the variety of web3 in several of their latest marketing campaigns, especially the metaverse, gamification as well as NFT drops. As more companies seek innovative ways to connect with audiences, the marketing department often takes the lead in experimenting with these modern approaches. Let’s dive in and explore what web3 means for the future of marketing.</p>



 Traditional vs. Web3 Marketing: Effectiveness&nbsp; 



<p>In the dynamic landscape of marketing, two distinct paradigms emerge: web3 marketing and traditional marketing. Web3 marketing harnesses cutting-edge technologies like blockchain to empower users with greater control over their digital presence. In contrast, traditional marketing relies on established channels and centralisation. Web3 marketing is an unchartered field with creative means of disrupting traditional marketing models. The characteristics of web3 marketing are (logically) close to what benefits web3 can offer in general:</p>



 
 Decentralisation  



 Transparency  



 Tokenisation  



 Community  



 Ownership  
 



<p>Especially decentralisation is the pillar that differentiates web3 marketing from traditional marketing practices. Decentralisation is giving individuals control over their data. This shift creates a cooperative and mutually beneficial environment, strengthening the bond between brands and consumers.</p>







<p>When evaluating the effectiveness of web3 marketing in both the short and long term, one key aspect stands out: customer loyalty. Ultimately, it’s the bedrock of long-term success in web3 marketing. Without a loyal customer base, your marketing endeavors lack purpose. While many aspects of web3 may currently seem like mere buzzwords, the cultivation of a strong community sets apart effective web3 marketing from fleeting traditional campaigns (through e.g., print, radio, TV, or social media), as the latter often yield only short-term results. By embracing the user-centric essence of Web3 technologies, businesses can lay the foundation for long-lasting effectiveness. This approach enables them to cultivate trust and engagement with their consumer base, and forge meaningful connections with their target audience, ultimately leading to sustainable marketing success in the long run. One of many ways to achieve this is through, e.g., the introduction of loyalty programs, to keep customers hooked and committed.</p>



 Community-centricity: Reinvented brand-customer power dynamics 



 The community 



<p>“Commonality is a purpose, meets frequency of touch” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qu5KQJGCs">Swan Sit – web3 developer</a>). Establishing meaningful connections between a brand and its customers is a fundamental objective in marketing. This involves not only targeting customers who align with the brand’s values but also striving for maximum customer engagement. What sets web3 marketing apart is its participatory nature, where customers are not only part of a group but actively engage within that collective. Furthermore, the notion of tangible value comes into play, as the community can receive incentives or rewards from the brand they support, fostering a sense of pride in being part of that specific community. How these incentives could look like, is touched upon later in the article (see NFTs).</p>



<p>Navigating the integration of web3 into your marketing practices may encounter resistance from existing communities that are resistant to change. To overcome potential backlash, open and transparent communication is essential. Engage with your community, address their concerns, and emphasise how the shift to web3 benefits them. Demonstrating a clear understanding of their needs and a commitment to preserving what they value can help ease the transition. Additionally, gradual implementation and education about the advantages of web3 can mitigate resistance and pave the way for a smoother transition, ultimately ensuring the long-term success of your brand’s evolution.</p>



 New power dynamics  



<p>In today’s evolving landscape, we can witness a shift in power dynamics, where the consumer takes a central stage and wields a more significant influence on brand decisions. This represents a stark departure from the traditional paradigm where brands held the upper hand, often due to information imbalances. Web3 technology is a game-changer in this context, offering the potential to rebalance these dynamics. What’s particularly noteworthy is the active involvement of brands in these online communities, signifying a fundamental transformation in how businesses approach marketing.</p>



<p>In this new era, understanding your audience and constructing strategies tailored to their preferences and behaviours becomes paramount. It’s a shift towards a more consumer-centric approach, where the community’s voice plays a crucial role in shaping brand decisions and forging stronger, mutually beneficial relationships.</p>



<p>Web3 technology, thanks to its transparent and authentic nature, helps build trust between brands and consumers. Using blockchain, brands can provide proof of where their products come from, their authenticity, and their sustainability, giving consumers the information they need to make informed decisions. In this context, deceptive marketing practices struggle to gain traction, highlighting how important transparency and authenticity are in web3 marketing. This shift represents a significant departure from traditional marketing, fostering a more genuine and accountable connection between brands and their audiences.</p>



 The web3 marketing trends 



<p>Web3 marketing allows for various new trends, which enrich ways of doing marketing:&nbsp;</p>



 
 NFTs 



 Virtual experiences 



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  
 



 NFTs 



<p>A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a one-of-a-kind digital asset, which replicates real-life items in the form of e.g., art or music and can be sold or bought online. NFTs have gained popularity as a means for brands to enter the web3 marketing space, and hold the promise of serving as valuable bridges between brands and their communities.</p>



<p>NFTs serve a dual purpose:</p>



 
 NFTs can expand the current audience of the brand, and reel those in, that show a clear interest in the web3 space.&nbsp; 



 Additionally, they can also be harnessed for branding and communication strategies. Businesses can use NFTs as a means to incentivise their fans and followers. Within the NFT ecosystem, the range of possibilities is vast: this includes providing discounts, delivering rewarding products, or crafting unique digital items exclusively available to members of the NFT community. 
 



<p>To put this into reality, <a href="https://raritysniper.com/news/adidas-tokenproof-partnership-to-reward-loyal-nft-holders/">Adidas</a> has explored web3 marketing through NFTs. They recently collaborated with Tokengate, where an NFT loyalty program grants access to exclusive Adidas sneakers. Furthermore, Adidas has also teamed up with the Doodles collection and had a partnership with Pharrell &amp; Adidas for an exclusive Samba sneaker drop.</p>



 Virtual experiences 



<p>One of the major trends within web3 marketing revolves around creating virtual experiences, primarily through the metaverse or Virtual Reality (VR). The core concept of such, in a marketing sense, is to offer a fluid experience that seamlessly bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds. This enables users to engage with both one another and digital elements in real time, soaking up the person into the action. As previously mentioned, consumers are part of a brand experience, giving them a sense of belonging to the particular brand, as well as active participation in the experience. This emotional side of marketing can often be more important than the actual physical product being sold.</p>



<p>In November of 2021, Nike solidified its position in the nascent metaverse with the launch of <a href="https://www.nike.com/kids/nikeland-roblox">Nikeland</a>, a branded virtual interactive space, marking a significant step in blending sales, marketing, and gaming.</p>



 Decentralised (social media) platforms  



<p>Worries regarding privacy and the handling of personal data have surged, and the demand for replacing platforms is growing. Think of web3 as the rebel of the internet world, challenging the status quo. It’s all about giving you, the user, the reins to control your online experience. Unlike those traditional social media giants that hoard your data on their servers, web3 rides on blockchain technology, creating decentralised networks where you are the data owner. Privacy, anonymity, security, and ownership are redefined in web3 (social media) marketing, creating a more trustworthy digital ecosystem.</p>



 Conclusion: Embrace the shift  



<p>As we navigate the evolving landscape of marketing, it’s crucial for brands to adapt and embrace the shift towards integrating web3 into their practices. This means staying true to your brand’s core values while modifying your existing products or services to align with the futuristic space. In this context, experimentation is not an option; it’s a necessity. Embracing web3 in your marketing strategies is the path forward to ensure your brand remains relevant and competitive in an ever-changing digital world.</p>

<p>In 2021, the US Department of Defense spent $142 billion on procurement and $106 billion on developing new technologies (RDT&amp;E) — while global defense spending reached over two trillion dollars. Yet the US and its allies are potentially dangerously wrong-footed by having over-spent on legacy hardware systems (eg aircraft carriers etc) while neglecting what could be the defining battlefield of the future: the control of the radio spectrum, otherwise known as electronic warfare. In a world where societies and markets run on electronics and signals — this is the ultimate defense&nbsp;line.</p><p>Much of electronic warfare is out of sight of the public and media, but since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93U.S._RQ-170_incident">Iran captured and then reverse engineered a sophisticated high-end US UAV</a> using its electronic warfare capabilities — it has become evident just how dangerous these capabilities will become. Since this incident and others like it, the US DoD has made significant investments in electronic warfare capabilities. However these have come from legacy providers, grown through M&amp;A with no cross system or modular capabilities — severely holding back the US’ and NATO’s electronic warfare capabilities. The lack of composability has created a frustration among end users and demands for open standards.</p><p>AnySignal is building open-core radio software for satellite communications, UAVs, and other next generation defense capabilities. The company sits at the core of a more compatible, modular and fast scaling electronic warfare approach.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>In the future, control of radio spectrum will be used to project power instead of aircraft carriers or ICBMs. NATO will continue to make massive investments in this field, but existing defense contractors are not well positioned to deliver what their clients need. A vibrant startup ecosystem, built with open source components that will be maintained long after the company producing the product is gone, will replace slow moving defense prime contractors. The team’s past experience building radio systems at SpaceX &amp; Kepler Communications puts them in a unique position to help define industry standards and open source implementations through their usage of GNU Radio, a widely used, 21 year old, open source project. With this, AnySignal has the potential to provide many of the performance defining components in this emergent ecosystem.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the AnySignal team on their mission to master the radiofrequency (RF) domain through end-to-end solutions that cover communications, radar, navigation, and RF sensing for advanced aircraft, satellites, and national security. Read more about their recent seed financing <a href="https://anysignal.medium.com/anysignal-closes-seed-round-to-build-multi-domain-radio-platform-ab8aa6844bc8">here</a>.</p>

While Metamask still maintains the largest market share, a multitude of wallets have emerged, promising additional features and a better UX.</p><p>We were joined by Evgeny Yurtaev, co-founder &amp; CEO of Zerion, to discuss the challenges of building a Web3 wallet and how Zerion aims to improve user experience, while still maintaining security.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Evgeny’s background  The motivation behind building a Web3 wallet  Zerion UX and security  Seed phrase storing  Zerion user profile  Challenges in building a new wallet app  Protecting users and potential attack vectors  Supported blockchains and (seamless) bridging  Account abstraction and MPC  Business models for Web3 wallets  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/evgeth_">Evgeny Yurtaev on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zerion">Zerion on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Friederike Ernst.

 This article gives instructions on how to use the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website and Verus Desktop and Verus Mobile to preconvert ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH. <p>First I recommend to read: <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/bridging-done-right-verus-ethereum-bridge-launches-now-1b2ca42939b2">Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!</a></p><p>✅ We will show&nbsp;you:</p>  How-to bridge ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus  How-to enable vETH, DAI.vETH &amp; MKR.vETH on Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile  How-to preconvert into Bridge.vETH with Verus Desktop &amp; Verus&nbsp;Mobile    Download the latest <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Verus Desktop</a> or Verus Mobile (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/verus-mobile/id6447361908">iOS App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.autonomoussoftwarefoundation.verusmobile.android&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Android Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  If on Verus Desktop make sure you are on native mode and fully synced. (And remember to always backup your wallet.dat file!)  Visit the Verus-Ethereum Bridge website here: <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">https://eth.verusbridge.io/</a>   Bridging ETH, DAI &amp; MKR over to&nbsp;Verus <p>First thing we need to do, before we can preconvert, is to bridge over. To bridge ETH, DAI or MKR over you need to visit the <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io/">bridge website&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Then connect your Metamask or WalletConnect wallet. Follow the steps they give&nbsp;you.</p><p>Then fill in the address (R- or i-address) you want the bridged ETH, DAI or MKR to end&nbsp;up.</p><p>Then choose what you want to bridge over (ETH, DAI, MKR or VRSC). And then the destination. After that choose the amount and click&nbsp;send.</p><p>Metamask or WalletConnect will guide you through the next steps. ⚠️ It can take up to 45 minutes before your bridged ETH, DAI or MKR arrives on the Verus blockchain and in your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>⛽ Also, the gas fee calculation is quite high, it could be that you pay a lot less, but this is never a guarantee.</p> Getting Verus Desktop to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>Go to the “Multiverse”-tab, click on Verus on the left. You can see that Bridge.vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH &amp; vETH or not “added” yet. Click on one of the currencies.</p><p>When clicking on one of the currencies you can see a button “Add Currency”. Click on it, and do it for all if you&nbsp;want.</p><p>You can now go back to the “Wallet”-tab.</p><p>You can now see the added currencies in the dropdown in your Wallet-tab (when Verus is selected).</p> Getting Verus Mobile to show vETH, DAI.vETH &amp;&nbsp;MKR.vETH <p>For this step we assume you already have the wallet installed and are ready to go. Now that you have sent over ETH, DAI or MKR to your R- or i-address, we need to make sure you can actually see them in Verus&nbsp;Mobile.</p><p>Click on the big plus button in the right bottom corner. Then click “Add PBaaS Currency”.</p><p>Then you can type in vETH (or DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH depending on what you want to add). (not capital sensitive). Btw, you can also already add Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Follow the steps and the currency will be added to your main&nbsp;screen.</p> Preconverting to Bridge.vETH  Verus Desktop <p>To actually start preconverting currencies to Bridge.vETH click on “Convert Currencies”.</p><p>Now go to “Advanced”.</p><p>You only need to fill in the highlighted parts of the form. See&nbsp;below:</p>  Amount: how much of vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH you want to convert to Bridge.vETH  From Currency: Fill in vETH, DAI.vETH or MKR.vETH (not case sensitive)  To Currency: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  Destination Address: Fill in where you want to receive the Bridge.vETH (on Fri 20 Oct). Can be a R-address, i-address or&nbsp;VerusID.  Send as pre-convert: Check&nbsp;this  Refund Address: Sometimes a currency has a minimum or maximum amount to preconvert before it launches. For example, when the minimum preconversion amount is not met, and thus the currency not launched, you will receive your funds back. In this case there isn’t a minimum or maximum but you still need to fill it in. Can be the same as your Destination Address.  <p>Now click on “Convert Currencies” and confirm the transaction. You have now preconverted funds into Bridge.vETH!</p> Verus Mobile <p>Now we want to preconvert currencies (vETH, DAI.vETH, MKR.vETH) into Bridge.vETH.</p><p>Click on the currency you want to preconvert into Bridge.vETH. Go to the correct tab where you have the currency stored. Click “Send”, then “Convert or Cross-chain”, then click “Pre-convert”.</p>  Recipient address: This is the address where you will receive the Bridge.vETH, you can click on “self”, or choose something else.  Amount: choose the amount of the currency you want to convert into Bridge.vETH.  Currency to convert to: Fill in Bridge.vETH (not case sensitive)  <p>Then click send and follow the steps. You have now preconverted currencies into Bridge.vETH!</p><p>On Friday 20 Oct you will receive an amount of the 100,000 initial supply of Bridge.vETH in your destination address.</p><p>You can always check <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a> for statistics on Bridge.vETH</p> Join the community.

 Bridging Done Right — Verus-Ethereum Bridge Launches&nbsp;Now!  The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is the first non-custodial and trustless bridge in the industry, and where the accounting of funds is proven and verified by consensus. And you can participate in its launch right&nbsp;now!  ⏱️ Verus-Ethereum Bridge launch: block height 2,758,800 (Fri 20 Oct,&nbsp;2023).  ✅ Start preconverting to the bridge currency Bridge.vETH (with an initial supply of 100,000) NOW for a 10 day period. 👉 <a href="https://eth.verusbridge.io">Connect to the&nbsp;bridge</a>  👀 The first ever truly non-custodial, trustless and consensus proven cryptocurrency bridge.  How it&nbsp;Works <p>You can already start to preconvert VRSC, ETH, DAI and MKR into Bridge.vETH.</p>  Bridge ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus network. 👉 <a href="http://eth.verusbridge.io">Go to the bridge website</a> <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-participate-in-the-verus-ethereum-bridge-launch-73aeeae1c76a">How-to guide for bridging &amp; preconversion</a>  Preconvert vETH (ETH), DAI.vETH (DAI), MKR.vETH (MKR) or VRSC into Bridge.vETH.  See Bridge.vETH statistics on <a href="http://www.verus.io/eth-bridge">verus.io/eth-bridge</a>  <p>When the bridge currency launches on 20 Oct the initial supply of 100,000 will be distributed by the protocol among all preconverters.</p><p>If you move ETH, DAI and MKR over to the Verus blockchain before the bridge is launched your cross-chain fees are subsidized. Around 5000 VRSC is used to subsidize the fees on the Verus side. When the bridge currency gets launched, the VRSC that is left will be put into the reserves.</p> Dynamic Supply <p>The Bridge.vETH supply is dynamic (after the preconversion has finished and the bridge currency is launched). The currency gets minted when people convert to it from VRSC, vETH, DAI.vETH and MKR.vETH, or gets burned when people convert out of&nbsp;it.</p>After the bridge currency is launched you can convert into any direction.<blockquote>Worth noting: Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant. There is no front/back-running since all conversions are simultaneously solved within a block. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency/">More details on docs.verus.io</a></blockquote><p>The Bridge.vETH currency function is to make the bridging of assets simple. From wherever you send it converts the fees that you need seamlessly.</p> The Bridge Accrues&nbsp;Fees <p>The bridge currency accrues fees with the cross-chain functions, conversions and&nbsp;.vETH VerusID registrations, making it more valuable the more it’s&nbsp;used.</p><p>Dai holders get 5% interest (at the time of writing, the rate is subject to change by MakerDAO) automatically when holding in the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) contract. DAI in Bridge.vETH and in the complete Verus ecosystem get this savings rate. The DSR is being passed through 100% to the DAI reserves of Bridge.vETH.</p> Use the&nbsp;Bridge <p>After Bridge.vETH is launched and the initial supply is distributed you can now use the bridge as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Convert into any direction after the currency is launched and out of preconversion mode.  Export launched currencies on Verus as an ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Launch currencies on Verus that are 1:1 mapped to any ERC-20. 👉 <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">Learn&nbsp;how</a>  Send currencies, tokens and liquidity pools cross-chain.  Send <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/">ERC-721</a> &amp; <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/">ERC-1155</a> NFTs to Verus, and export tokenized ID currencies from Verus to Ethereum as ERC-721 &amp; ERC-1155.   Present Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges <p>Let’s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.</p>  The custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.  The smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security&nbsp;issues.  Smart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.  <p>These problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.</p> Why the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different <p>The Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone’s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>Every 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called “notarizations’’, contain, among other things: the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> for Verus, <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Merkle Patricia Trie</a> for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.</p><blockquote>👉 <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-internet-protocol-vip-provable-decentralized-cross-chain-communication-8d9414a429c5">Read more here</a> on how the Verus Protocol handles cross-chain communication (PBaaS-chains and more) in a decentralized and provable&nbsp;way.</blockquote> Safeguards Against Bridge&nbsp;Hacks <p>Threats caused by malicious notary witnesses, or stolen keys to drain funds are not viable against the Verus-Ethereum bridge. To successfully mount an attack on the bridge, if a majority of witnesses were colluding or got their private keys stolen the following would need to&nbsp;happen:</p>  Colluding, malicious witnesses.  Fake block producers with more combined hash and stake power than the publicly validated Verus blockchain.  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain.  <p>These requirements are very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain. The bridge even provides a way to defend against such an unlikely scenario.</p><p>The notary witnesses are also monitoring notarizations, and if they were to sign for something that they themselves do not agree with, they can auto-revoke their identities, using the VerusID protocol, which cannot be stopped by an attacker unless they have stolen both the keys for the notary ID and those for its revocation ID as well. This serves as a prevention for stolen key attacks, ensuring that notaries are extremely hard targets to compromise.</p> Bridgekeeper <p>The two blockchains, Verus and Ethereum, are fundamentally different from each other, but still need to be able to communicate. A translator is needed. This translator is a program called Bridgekeeper. Notary witnesses have to run the program. Miners and stakers are also encouraged to run it, and for doing so they receive&nbsp;fees.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verusbridgekeeper">Bridgekeeper for CLI</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/kyEqBX_erJo?si=UOajk4TnSD0ToRY4">How to become a Bridgekeeper — video</a></p> Verus ➡️&nbsp;Ethereum <p>Let’s consider a scenario where a user wants to move or convert assets from Verus to Ethereum. This transaction gets recorded on the Verus blockchain. When there are enough, or a certain time period has passed, these cross-chain transactions are rolled up into something called a ‘CCE’ (cross-chain export). This CCE is then added to a block by a miner or staker and they are rewarded a fee for doing so. The CCE is now officially part of the blockchain, and is linked to the “stateroot” (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a>, which is an unchangeable overall summary of the blockchain at that block, and anything preceding it).</p><p>Meanwhile, as the transactions (CCE) are being mined (or staked) in, the notarizations are also being mined or staked in, confirmed by miners and stakers, and only then, signed by the notary witnesses. The notarizations can occur as often as every 10 blocks, depending on how many miners and stakers are running Bridgekeeper. Before a notarization is used as proof, it has to be on the blockchain for 10 blocks, confirmed by another notarization, and also signed by at least 8 of 15 notary witnesses worldwide.</p><p>Then when the notarization is confirmed on Verus, it’s sent over to Ethereum and becomes pending on Ethereum. Once confirmed on Ethereum by receiving another notarization, the transactions (CCE) in that block are sent over to the Ethereum smart contract, along with the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range</a> proof. If valid the assets are sent to the users Ethereum&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Anyone can roll up the transactions into a CCE and mine it in to get a reward, but also the notary witnesses paying the ETH fees to send it to Ethereum get a share of the fees to subsidize their transaction costs.</p><p>If there is no traffic from Verus to Ethereum, the notarizations are continued to be mined in on Verus but do not need to be sent to Ethereum, so when the traffic is light, there is minimal&nbsp;cost.</p> Ethereum ➡️&nbsp;Verus <p>The above part explains going from Verus to Ethereum, but the other way around is actually a little bit different. It is not the notary witnesses that send the group of transactions over, but any miner and staker can, and thus also get part of the&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Notarizations made on Verus always contain a stateroot from Ethereum that is a minimum of 30 blocks old (blocks on Ethereum take ~15 seconds) to make sure it is stable. Then after Verus has confirmed the notarization with a new one, Verus can accept transactions (CCE) from Ethereum, along with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">Ethereum Merkle Patricia Trie</a> proof that relates to the new confirmed data.</p> A Giant Leap&nbsp;Forward <p>The delayed sending of transactions is an important security mechanism that is not present in any other cross-chain bridge. To recap: before any real transactions happen, the Verus network sends proofs to the Ethereum network and vice versa. These proofs are checked and agreed upon by everyone in the network. Only then the actual moving of assets happens. Because of this delayed system, no single entity ever gets control over the assets. Also there are safeguards in place for the community notaries that protect users from&nbsp;hacks.</p><p>This system is decentralized, which means it’s controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It’s a giant leap forward for the entire cryptocurrency industry, and everyone can be a part of&nbsp;it!</p> Join the community. Learn about the protocol.

<p>Dear Panthers,</p><p>It’s the end of the month again! Here’s a round-up of everything that went down this September.</p> Tech Updates  v1 Testnet update <p>Stage 2 of our v1 Testnet is still in the making. This Stage is predominantly about converting Panther Reward Points to $zZKP. The introduction of an additional feature ("vouchers") will enable users to test this conversion while remaining in a testnet environment, an addition that slightly differs from this Stage's original design. The function is still undergoing internal testing.</p><p>Concurrently, Stage 3 work has already started and is in progress. This Stage will be centered around depositing assets into Shielded Pools.</p><p>We're excited to get Panther v1 in your hands. Look out for more updates on the Testnet launch in the coming weeks!</p> Update to the Stage 1 Testnet’s url <p>As we progress on the above, we have updated the link for Stage 1 on our Testnet information repository. The new version contains a few tweaks and upgrades.</p><p>To access it, go to: <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages</a></p> Comparing Panther’s approach to ‘Privacy Pools’ <p>The recent <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;download=yes&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Privacy Pools paper</a> struck a chord with the Web3 community.

<p>Danny Ryan is a coordinator at the Ethereum Foundation. He’s been on Bankless many times before. Usually, we’re talking about the Ethereum roadmap and what’s coming next. This time we’re talking about something different…a risk to Ethereum that Danny sees. A little over a year ago, Danny wrote a blog post titled “The Risk of LSDs”... discussing the various risk vectors that a dominant LSD presents to Ethereum…even naming Lido specifically in the process.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ ✨ DEBRIEF | Ryan &amp; David unpacking the episode: <a href="https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan">https://www.bankless.com/debrief-danny-ryan</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ A lot of people have decided that liquid staking with Lido is the place to do it. At the time of recording Lido has over 30% of all staked Ether. Does this present a systemic risk to Ethereum?</p> <p>We did an episode called, “In Defense of Lido” with researcher Hasu who argued that Lido does not pose a systemic risk to Ethereum. In fact, Lido’s dominance is better than many other alternatives. We left that conversation half-finished when we published it in August 2023.&nbsp;</p> <p>In today’s episode, we cover part two of that debate with Ethereum researcher and guest Danny Ryan who argues the opposite. Lido is a systemic risk to Ethereum and what to do about it.</p> <p>We believe our role as podcasters for issues like this is to voice both sides of the argument in long-form conversations and healthy debate. It is exactly the kind of thing you don’t get on Twitter. That’s why we’ve given voice to both sides of this issue.&nbsp;</p> <p>We think there are good actors who care about this ecosystem at Lido and in the broader Ethereum community and we’re sure this episode won’t be the last word on this subject.</p> <p>----- 🏹 Airdrop Hunter is HERE, join your first HUNT today <a href="https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT">https://bankless.cc/JoinYourFirstHUNT</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 📣 a16z Startup School | Apply Before Oct. 20th <a href="https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school">https://bankless.cc/a16z-startup-school</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE ⁠<a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2%C2%A0%20%E2%81%A0">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2&nbsp; ⁠</a></p> <p>🦊METAMASK PORTFOLIO | MANAGE YOUR WEB3 EVERYTHING <a>⁠https://bankless.cc/MetaMask&nbsp;</a></p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a></p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/Toku">https://bankless.cc/Toku</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE ⁠<a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap&nbsp;</a></p> <p>🔗 CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:41 Is Lido a Threat to Ethereum 8:57 &nbsp;Blog Post Thinking Change? 19:30 Uniswap 21:20 Theoretical Main Risks 25:45 God Mode&nbsp; 27:20 Practical Main Risks 34:00 Hasu Counter-Arguments&nbsp; 38:25 Permissionless Validator Set Mitigation 42:30 Veto Power Mitigation Argument 46:55 How Likely is the Lido Risk? 51:26 Client Team Positioning&nbsp; 55:00 How Special is the Lido Case?&nbsp; 57:45 One LST Inevitability &nbsp; 1:02:30 Solutions&nbsp; 1:06:55 Profit Maximization&nbsp; 1:09:00 Action Steps For Ethereum Decentralization&nbsp; 1:11:53 Can Ethereum Devs Do Something?&nbsp; 1:20:10 Hasu Questions Answered by Danny&nbsp; 1:22:45 Magnitude of the Lido Threat 1:24:20 How Can Lido Fix This?&nbsp; 1:25:59 Stick &amp; Carrot for Lido 1:26:27 Silverlining of Lido Threat 1:29:05 Next Conversations&nbsp; 1:32:16 Closing &amp; Disclaimers &nbsp;</p> <p>----- RESOURCES</p> <p>Danny Ryan <a href="https://twitter.com/dannyryan">https://twitter.com/dannyryan</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Danny Ryan Blog Post <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd">https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/risks-of-lsd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Hasu’s Bankless Interview <a href="https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY">https://youtu.be/IfuUdIblfrY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Back in 2017, there was no DeFi as we know it today, yet MakerDAO were already envisioning and building towards what they thought to be a certainty. The backbone of DeFi is represented by stable coins, and MakerDAO quickly understood this: they set out to build a decentralised stable coin, $DAI (and its precursor $SAI). Being collateral-backed, the smart contract needs to know the value of that collateral, but any off-chain price data is not readily available on-chain. This is where oracles come in and provide data feeds on-chain. MakerDAO’s internal oracle has been active since 2017 on Ethereum and has recently branched out, forming Chronicle. By using aggregated Schnorr signatures, Chronicle solves the problem of oracle cost-efficient scaling.</p><p>We were joined by Niklas Kunkel, founder of Chronicle, to discuss the challenges and tradeoffs that oracles regularly face, and how Chronicle is solving them, continuing the ethos of early MakerDAO.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Niklas’ background and the early days of MakerDAO  How MakerDAO evolved over time and the adoption of DAI  MakerDAO’s core principles  Why Chronicle branched out from MakerDAO  Oracle challenges &amp; tradeoffs  Oracle validators  Business model for oracles  Providing oracle services to different blockchains  Schnorr signatures  Chronicle’s supported chains and oracle offerings  Real-world assets (RWA) and credit delegation  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/nomos_paradox">Niklas Kunkel on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ChronicleLabs">Chronicle on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO">Maker DAO on Twitter</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Sebastien Couture &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p><code>zcashd</code> 5.7.0 deprecates <code>fetch-params.sh</code> and <code>zcash-fetch-params</code> and bundles zk-SNARK parameters directly so they do not need to be downloaded or stored separately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless you need to generate transactions using the deprecated Sprout shielded pool, you can delete the parameter files stored in these directories to save space, as they are no longer read or used by <code>zcashd</code>: </p>



 
 <code>~/.zcash-params</code>&nbsp;(on Linux); or 



 <code>~/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Mac); or 



 <code>C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams</code>&nbsp;(on Windows) 
 



<p>If you do wish to use the Sprout pool, you will need the <code>sprout-groth16.params</code> currently available for download <a href="https://download.z.cash/downloads/sprout-groth16.params">here</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, 5.7.0 reports new mempool metrics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All node operators, which include our mining and other ecosystem partners, should upgrade to this latest version as soon as possible. Please note that version 5.6.1 will expire on or around Wednesday, October 11.</p>



<p>Additional changes have been included in this release. For technical details, please read the full release notes available at <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/releases/tag/v5.7.0</a>.</p>

			 by the Zcash Foundation Board 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Over the past few months, members of the Zcash community have begun discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. The Zcash Foundation (ZF) looks forward to supporting the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>As a party to the Zcash <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">Trademark Donation and License Agreement</a>, ZF is committed to enacting the clear consensus of the Zcash community when it comes to approving and implementing proposed changes to the Zcash protocol (aka network upgrades). The introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund falls within this remit, as it would involve a change to the Zcash protocol.</p><p>Therefore, ZF proposes that we follow a similar approach to the tried and tested process that resulted in the creation and adoption of ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 History Lesson: How the first Dev Fund was created 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>During 2019, the Zcash community began discussions about what should happen after the end of the Founders Reward in late 2020. In August 2019, the Zcash Foundation set forth a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcash-foundation-guidance-on-dev-fund-proposals/">process and timeline</a>, and described how it would assess community sentiment towards proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community members drafted <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/future-of-zcash-dev-funding-megathread-everything-in-one-place/34063">twenty proposals</a>. Following extensive community debate, these twenty were whittled down to thirteen (preserved in the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/">Zcash ZIPs repository</a>, as ZIPs 1001 thru 1013), which were presented to the community in November 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community sentiment was gathered using three mechanisms:&nbsp;</p>
 
 a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/68dcd8ba-08b5-11ea-95c2-1a34a475f69c/view">poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> (previously known as the Community Governance Panel or CGP), in which 48 people voted, 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/community-sentiment-collection-poll-on-nu4-dev-fund-zips/35439/">forum poll</a>, in which people who had joined the forum before March 2019 were eligible to vote, and in which 71 people voted, and 
 a <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/7">staked poll</a> of coinholders (in which <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHq-KoiE0mKmllcr_LTwS5tNacf5HHt_VFKPL_tYlHU/edit#gid=0">over 105,000 ZEC was staked for polling purposes by 17 distinct Zcash addresses</a>).&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
<p>ZF also <a href="https://zfnd.org/restarting-community-sentiment-collection-for-dev-fund-proposals/#on-miner-signaling">invited miners to signal their sentiment</a> but no miners did so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of the ZCAP (CGP), forum (F), and staked poll (CH) can be found <a href="https://electriccoin.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dev-Fund-Results.pdf">here</a>&nbsp;(with credit to ECC for creating the graphic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZF and ECC worked together to draft a new, mutually-agreeable proposal based on the proposals that had received the most support from the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result was a draft of <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">ZIP 1014</a>, which proposed instituting a Dev Fund, consisting of 20% of newly minted coins and lasting until the next halving event (projected for late 2024).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In January 2020, two mechanisms were used to assess community sentiment regarding ZIP 1014, and to decide on some final details, including how the Dev Fund should be divided among its recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Zcash Foundation conducted a <a href="https://zfnd.org/polling-community-sentiment-on-zip-1014/">combined poll</a> of users who participated in the forum poll during the first round of community sentiment gathering, alongside the pre-existing Zcash Community Advisory Panel. This combined group numbered 119, and <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/43b9bec8-39a1-11ea-914c-b6e34ffa859a/view">88 voted in the poll</a>, which approved ZIP 1014 by 77 votes to 11.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/staked-poll-on-zcash-dev-fund-debate/34846/111">staked poll</a> of coinholders was coordinated by Zooko and Andrew Miller, in which 24 distinct Zcash addresses staked over 119,000 ZEC for the purposes of the poll. All but one of the participants in this poll (representing 99.9% of the staked coins) voted to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSlHXhA_NoJy0RW3Gc6YY3bmYcKT_YF8oS_BrSkBnvEGGaJ56WYo7iL_9shuoh-z_DZMYojA6FpLoJv/pubhtml">approve ZIP 1014</a>.</p>
<p>ZF and ECC subsequently agreed that ZIP 1014 should be implemented in the Zcash protocol, and it duly activated in November 2020.&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			  Process and Timeline for Submitting Proposals 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Both ZF and ECC agree that it is desirable to gain clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem sooner, rather than later. Therefore, we aim to conduct a first round of community sentiment gathering by polling ZCAP in December (alongside the Zcash Community Grants election).&nbsp;</p><p>With that in mind, teams and organisations that are interested in receiving protocol funding should publicly announce their interest as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As with the process that led to ZIP 1014, we invite community members to post proposals to the Zcash community forums, in the form of a draft ZIP for review and discussion by the community.</p><p>We will consult with the ZIP editors on whether they are willing to provide editorial feedback on the draft ZIPs (something that Daira and str4d did last time, and which was very useful in clarifying the proposals), and, if so, what deadline would be appropriate for submitting pull requests to the ZIPs Github repo in time for a December round of community sentiment gathering.&nbsp;</p><p>We will host community calls where specific proposals can be discussed, and the community can ask questions of those who are putting forward proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first round of voting, we will assess the results and, if necessary, do further rounds of proposal revision and sentiment-gathering, in order to zero in on a proposal that we are confident represents the clear consensus of the Zcash community</p><p>While we don’t currently intend to formally analyze sentiment beyond the ZCAP poll, we are interested to hear suggestions and ideas&nbsp; for other means of assessing community sentiment, and we will consider other forms of community feedback collected by other parties if it is valuable and informative, and was collected in good faith.</p><p>If you have suggestions or ideas, please post them to the Zcash Community Forum, in the Governance category.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 A Note on Impartiality 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>We at the Zcash Foundation believe that the work we have carried out over the past few years has been of benefit to Zcash and the Zcash community. We hope that the Zcash community agrees, and is willing to continue funding the work of the Foundation.</p><p>However, for the avoidance of any doubt, if the Zcash community decides that the Dev Fund should end and not be replaced (or that it should be replaced but that ZF should not receive any funding), ZF will support that decision, and do what is necessary to enact it (including implementing the new consensus rules in Zebra).&nbsp;</p><p>If the Zcash community does decide to create a new Dev Fund, ZF recommends furthering the decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem by increasing the number of Dev Fund recipients, with at least one recipient in a jurisdiction outside the United States. We also recommend that any new recipients should be nonprofit entities with tax-exempt status, that are subject to legally-enforceable governance requirements similar to those required of&nbsp; 501(c)(3) organizations (e.g. prohibition of private inurement, restrictions on excessive executive compensation, financial disclosure requirements to ensure transparency and accountability).&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to helping the Zcash community reach consensus on this important decision, which will have a far-reaching impact on the future of Zcash!</p>

This program is aimed at individuals and teams who are seeking funding of up to $25,000 for work that benefits Zcash, or other approaches to financial privacy, in line with our charitable purpose. The total budget for this round of Minor Grants is $75,000.</p><p>Minor Grant applications are submitted to a poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). To be eligible for funding, applications must receive greater than 50% approval in the poll, and grants will be funded in order of priority determined by the level of ZCAP’s approval, and as the total budget ($75,000) permits.</p><p>We’re pleased to present 20 applications that were submitted to this round of the Minor Grants program.

<p>When we compute a ZK circuit we are not just executing some code, but proving that we have executed the code correctly.</p><p>Take a program that computes x + y = z. It's not enough for a ZK program to simply output z, the program also needs to prove that x + y was executed correctly to arrive at the value&nbsp;z.</p><p>Producing the proof requires establishing constraints.</p><p>In other words, circuits are comprised of constrained functions -meaning ZK programs that generate proofs based on a set of constraints.</p><p>So why then, would you need a function with no constraints — an unconstrained function? You might think unconstrained functions would be unsafe, given their name — like taking the guardrails off of a ZK circuit. And you’d be&nbsp;right!</p><p>Circuit code without constraints can be “proven” to create any outcome! Rather than creating a proof that deterministically proves the validity of a piece of code, unconstrained functions allow you to execute code that would otherwise be very expensive or difficult to compute inside the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>But being able to execute logic outside of a circuit is critical for both circuit performance and constructing proofs on information that is external to a&nbsp;circuit.</p> When to&nbsp;use <p>Generally, we want to use unconstrained functions whenever there’s something that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>An unconstrained function simply executes code as you would expect in a normal programming execution environment.</p><p>In this post we want to make sure that developers who are tapping into the performance benefits of unconstrained functions aren’t incorrectly implementing unconstrained functions in a way that leads to worse security for their programs. Incorrect usage of unconstrained functions could lead to bugs, and zk development overall is a newer, scarier paradigm. We want to make it easy for developers to use <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a> to write performant and secure ZK programs, and unconstrained functions can help them optimize their circuits when implemented correctly.</p> Simple division <p>Assuming proving divisions in ZK is costly while proving multiplications is easy, and we want to prove the computation of 100 /&nbsp;5.</p><p>Proving 100 / 5 = x directly in ZK would be inefficient:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;6<p>Instead, we might use unconstrained functions to optimize our circuits. A more optimized approach would&nbsp;involve:</p><p>1. Computing 100 / 5 = x in an unconstrained manner</p><p>2. Proving x * 5 = 100 in&nbsp;ZK</p><p>Here’s a way to optimize the same division operation:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;7<p>Cautious readers however might notice both the code excerpts above yield approximately the same number of constraints in Noir’s abstract circuit intermediate representation (ACIR) given the optimization is simple enough to implement in Noir’s compiler.</p><p>The key intuition here is that in a ZK execution environment, proving multiplications is cheaper than proving divisions.</p><p>Given all Noir programs compile to an intermediate representation called the Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation (ACIR), we can judge circuit optimization on both ACIR opcodes and the ultimate number of backend circuit&nbsp;gates.</p><p>This simple division case has 2 ACIR opcodes and 7 final backend circuit gates. The unoptimized version where we check assert(x == 20) has 3 ACIR opcodes and 8 final backend circuit sizes. Our optimization reduced the final backend size by one gate. Given this is a super simple example, let's dive into a more complex case where the optimizations are more meaningful.</p> A more complex&nbsp;example <p>Colin Nielsen, developer in the Noir community wrote the following code for converting unsigned integers (uints) to u8 arrays, without the use of unconstrained functions.</p><blockquote>👀 See Colin’s <a href="https://twitter.com/colinrives">Twitter</a> +&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/colinnielsen">Github</a></blockquote><p>Here’s the unoptimized code:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;8<p>This code has 91 total ACIR opcodes and a circuit size of 3,619. A lot of the operations in this function are already optimized away by the compiler (e.g., all the bitshifts turn into divisions by constants).</p><p>However, we can save a bunch of gates by casting to u8 a bit earlier. This automatically truncates the bitshifted value to fit in a u8, which allows us to remove the XOR against&nbsp;0xff.</p><p>This is what the slightly-optimized code looks&nbsp;like:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;9<p>ACIR opcodes generated: 75</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;3,143</p><p>Already, this saves us ~480 gates in total, but we can do&nbsp;better.</p><p>This code is all constrained, so we’re proving every step of the calculation using num. But in fact, we don't actually care about how we make the calculation, just that the computation is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>This is where unconstrained functions come&nbsp;in.</p> Optimizing with unconstrained functions <p>It turns out that truncating a u72 into a u8 is hard to do inside of a SNARK. Each time we do this operation to truncate down into u8, we lay down 4 ACIR opcodes, which get converted into multiple&nbsp;gates.</p><p>It’s actually much easier to calculate num from out, rather than the other way around. All we need to do is multiply each element of out by a constant and add them all together, both of which are relatively easy operations to do inside of a&nbsp;SNARK.</p><p>So, instead of truncating u72 into u8, we can run u72_to_u8 as unconstrained function code in order to calculate out. Then, we can use that result in our constrained function and assert that if we were to do the reverse calculation, we'd get back&nbsp;num.</p><p>An example of what this looks like is&nbsp;below:</p>Unconstrained Functions in Noir&nbsp;10<p>Total ACIR opcodes generated: 78</p><p>Backend circuit size:&nbsp;2,902</p><p>This usage of unconstrained functions ends up optimizing our circuit even further and taking off another ~250 gates from our&nbsp;circuit!</p><p>We’ve ended up with more ACIR opcodes than before, but these are easier for the backend to prove (resulting in fewer gates overall). This is the beauty of using unconstrained functions — optimizing code that’s easy to verify but hard to compute within the&nbsp;circuit.</p><p>Put differently, unconstrained functions allow you to reformulate certain pieces of code that are easier to check than to execute directly in a ZK&nbsp;circuit.</p> Resources <p>For more on unconstrained functions, see this post by Tom French in the official Noir docs: <a href="https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/">https://noir-lang.org/language_concepts/unconstrained/</a></p><p>Are you a developer interested in getting started with&nbsp;Noir?</p><p>Jump into the <a href="https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-starter">noir-starter Github repo</a> and when you’re ready <a href="https://aztec.network/grants/">apply for a Grant</a> — we’re currently supporting Noir use-cases through the end of&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/unconstrained-functions-in-noir/">https://aztec.network</a> on September 26,&nbsp;2023.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/unconstrained-functions-in-noir-b6884d697679">Unconstrained Functions In Noir</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol">The Aztec Labs Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p><p>Horizen EON Forger Nodes will soon be available to the public for anyone who wishes to participate in the EON network.</p>



<p>Available on the Proof-Of-Stake Horizen EON chain, these nodes are different from the Proof-Of-Work Horizen mainchain nodes. How do these two types of nodes differ, and how do they each play a critical role in securing the network?</p>



<p>Before understanding the importance of these forger nodes, it’s important to first remember or learn some blockchain terms.</p>



 What is the Horizen mainchain and the Horizen EON sidechain? 







<p>The Horizen mainchain is a <a href="https://www.horizen.io/academy/layer-0/">layer 0</a> chain whose native cryptocurrency is ZEN. It doesn’t natively support smart contracts but natively supports the creation of sidechains.</p>



<p>A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to the Horizen mainchain and inherits its security. Sidechains can be used to extend the capabilities of the mainchain, for example by enabling smart contracts, token minting, voting, etc. In addition, ZEN can be transferred back and forth between the mainchain and sidechains (as a gas token) using the forward and backward transfer mechanism.</p>



<p>The Horizen sidechains and the mainchain are independent of each other. A sidechain can have its own consensus and does not rely on the mainchain to grow and add more blocks.</p>



<p>Horizen EON is a dedicated sidechain that implements an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This brings smart contract capabilities to the Horizen ecosystem.</p>



<p>Thanks to the forward and backward transfer mechanism, it’s possible to mint ZEN on Horizen EON by locking an equal amount of ZEN on the mainchain and vice versa. This is important for two reasons:</p>



 
 ZEN are required to pay gas fees on Horizen EON. 



 Horizen EON brings programmability to ZEN. Once ZEN are transferred to Horizen EON, it’s possible to operate on them with all the flexibility enabled by smart contracts.&nbsp; 
 



 Why does the Horizen EON sidechain need forger nodes? 







<p>Horizen’s mainchain operates on a proof-of-work consensus, meaning that it is the miners (in this case, ASICs) who compete to add new blocks to the blockchain and validate transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, The Horizen blockchain has a block reward system where the miner who completes the block receives 60% of the reward for this work. Then 10% goes to the Secure Nodes operators, 10% to the Super Nodes operators, and 20% to the ecosystem Treasury.</p>



<p>Secure Nodes and Super Nodes may sound like a hybrid POS/POW system, but they’re not. On Horizen, Secure Nodes and Super Nodes were created to add an extra layer of security to the network by allowing the community to keep a copy of the blockchain and be compensated for verifying transactions validated by miners.</p>



<p>This multi-layer node system has been in place since 2018. In the meantime, the needs of the network have evolved, particularly with the release of Zendoo and Horizen EON, Horizen’s EVM-compatible sidechain. As a result, the current Secure Node minimum requirements are no longer sufficient to provide any benefit to the Horizen network. Furthermore, with <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/upcoming-deprecation-of-the-horizen-mainchain-shielded-pools/">the removal of the shielded pools on mainchain</a>, the need for Secure Nodes is diminished. The subpar performance and the lack of usage of Secure Nodes pose a burden to the chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is a strong need for forger nodes in the EON chain. The Horizen EON chain is consensus and scalability-independent. To achieve consensus independence, it is necessary for the chain to have its own nodes to validate the transactions taking place on its chain.</p>



 Forger nodes permit to secure the network 



<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>



 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 



 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 



 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss if they behave maliciously. 



 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 



 Sybil attack resistance: PoS networks are less vulnerable to Sybil attacks, where an attacker creates many fake nodes to gain control. 



 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved. 
 



<p>There is an open Zen Improvement Proposal (ZenIP) for redirecting Secure Node block rewards to EON forger node. The purpose of this proposal is to drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization through forger nodes. The current Secure Node operators are well-equipped to provide this type of support. For more information about this ZenIP, please visit “ <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">ZenIP 42206 Explained: Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards Into Horizen EON</a>”.</p>

 The launch of the Horizen DAO marks the beginning of a new era of participatory governance for the Horizen community. 



<p><a href="http://horizen.io">Horizen</a> is an open-source, public protocol with a broad and diverse ecosystem that includes developers, miners, node operators, and $ZEN holders across multiple blockchain networks. The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>



 About Horizen DAO 



<p>DAO stands for “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” which has emerged as the standard for decentralized governance in the blockchain space and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Horizen has always been a community-driven project and has long recognized that a strong social layer is crucial for maintaining integrity across the ecosystem. This approach is directed by the guiding values of:</p>



 
 Transparency 



 Accountability 



 Security 



 Community involvement 



 Continuous improvement 



 Social responsibility 
 



<p>Read more about the Horizen guiding values on<a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about"> the Horizen governance page</a>.</p>



 Proposal Phases and Voting Process 



<p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Protocol Improvement Proposals (IPs) are an established mechanism used to select and implement new features and core protocol changes in many blockchain projects. In Horizen’s case, this IP process is the key tool for the Horizen DAO’s community-led governance. With Horizen’s native token, $ZEN, serving as the governance token for both the Horizen mainchain and the EON sidechain, IPs for each are called, respectively, ZenIPs and EONIPs.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>


 
 


<p>$ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detailed information about Horizen DAO, including the improvement proposal phases, voting process, Constitution, and more, can be found on <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/overview/about">the Horizen Governance page</a>. So check out the site and get involved to help shape the future of Horizen–we’re glad you’re along for the journey!</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/node-software-upgrade-zen-4-1-0-is-available-to-download/">hard fork that was activated at block 1426200</a> (September 26th 2023), private addresses can no longer receive ZEN from transparent addresses. This affects both Secure and Super Nodes’ ability to continue to perform challenges, and the ability to set up new nodes which currently requires a balance in a shielded address.</p>



<p>Starting September 26, 2023, challenges in both systems are suspended indefinitely. The increased requirements of successfully validating certificates introduced with the registration of EON will serve as a substitute for challenges in the interim.</p>



 Steps for Node Operators 



<p>Existing Nodes<br>There should be no effect on any existing nodes unless the node’s wallet is replaced. See New Nodes below.</p>



<p>Any API calls from a node operator requesting a manual challenge should be stopped.</p>



<p>New Nodes<br>If a new node is created (or a new wallet is created) it will need to follow the current guide. One private address will still need to be created and a very small amount of ZEN sent to it to give the private address a balance. The ZEN will need to be sent from another private address. This is a workaround until a new version of the Nodetracker is published.</p>



 System Changes 



 
 An updated version of the Nodetracker software that removes the check for private addresses will be available for new nodes once testing is complete. 



 An updated version of the tracking server software that disables challenges (instead of just suspending) will be rolled out once testing is complete. 
 



<p>After the system changes have been implemented, Node Operators are free to start withdrawing funds previously required for challenges from their shielded addresses to transparent addresses.</p>

  Partnering with PartyKit: Everything is Better with Friends  <p>Sunil and his team are turning lonely online tasks into collaborative multiplayer experiences.</p>   
	By Bogomil Balkansky

Team PartyKit: CXO Sylwia Vargas, Founder Sunil Pai and CTO Jani Eväkallio.



 
<p>I am a student of antiquity. At age 10, while many of my peers in the tech industry were learning how to code, I was buried somewhere between the sixth and fifth centuries BC, learning Latin and ancient Greek. (To this day I have some highly marketable skills—like reciting Virgil in the original.) One lesson that stuck with me from those studies is something Aristotle said many centuries ago: that we humans are “social animals.” As markets and technologies have come and gone, this part of our nature has been slow to change; <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/this-study-of-300000-people-reveals-1-secret-to-living-a-longer-healthier-life.html">dozens of studies</a> on health and longevity show that no matter what we do in life, it is better with friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By that measure, the Internet is not an ideal environment for us—because our digital experiences are so often lonely. We spend 8-10 hrs a day in front of our screens largely alone. Collaborative editing in Google Docs, collaborative design in Figma, and multiplayer video games are the rare exceptions that give us a taste of what the good life on the internet could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The view that all business apps require multiplayer collaboration is not necessarily universally held. The skeptic might ask how many Google Docs and Figmas there can be, i.e., how many apps truly require real-time, multiplayer collaboration?</p>



<p>Such skepticism is a failure of imagination, anchored in how things have been rather than how things can be. The fact is very few business processes are truly single-player; even something as mundane as expense reports requires collaboration, as does every other workflow that involves approvals. But these naturally multiplayer experiences have been artificially constrained into sequential, asynchronous workflows that can take weeks to complete.</p>



<p>Imagine instead you could just tag your manager or colleague in finance—or your friendly AI-driven finance copilot—to review your expense report, and they could flag anything that needs fixing on the spot. Historically, creating that kind of collaborative experience required a lot of hard work and technical sophistication. The likes of Google could do it, but your average SaaS startup could not. And while some new technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDT</a> libraries have been inching us closer to multiplayer experiences, they still require a lot of technology integration and many hours of engineering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <a href="https://www.partykit.io/">PartyKit</a>, a developer-friendly platform for real-time human-to-human and human-to-AI collaboration. PartyKit does the heavy lifting for you, enabling multiplayer experiences with a few lines of Javascript code. It is easy to customize; it includes all the analytics, and other tools you need to build production apps; and because it is open source, it can run on your organization’s own infrastructure—or even your own laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first met PartyKit founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunil-pai-a47732253/">Sunil Pai</a> earlier this year, we fell in love with his velocity and can-do attitude. Case in point is the way he got hired at Cloudflare: after he complained on X (formerly known as Twitter) about certain aspects of the developer experience, they invited him to join the team and fix it—which he did. During <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sequoia-arc/">Sequoia Arc</a>, we got to know Sunil very well, and were impressed with his contagious enthusiasm for his creation; he was quick to show anyone who was interested a demo on his phone. As they say, ABC—always be closing!</p>



<p>During the beta period, we were also impressed with the diversity of applications users found for PartyKit, from a <a href="https://www.tldraw.com/">drawing app</a> to a <a href="http://v/">state machine</a> to an <a href="https://sitegpt.ai/">LLM-based customer service agent</a>. And those are just small hints of what’s to come; as we celebrate the general availability of the platform, we will no doubt be surprised in the weeks and months ahead by the multitude of use cases PartyKit enables! We are proud to support Sunil and his team as they continue to grow, and we look forward to the better, less lonely internet we’ll all enjoy as they work to make collaborative multiplayer experiences the norm.</p>
