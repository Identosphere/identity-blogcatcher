The core objective is to curb the invasive data practices that have become commonplace in the age of social media and online&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>The proposed bill outlines several key provisions:</p>  Ban on Targeted Advertising: Children and teenagers would be shielded from the relentless barrage of personalized ads that track their online behavior.  Data Minimization and Erasure: Companies would be compelled to collect only the essential data needed for their services and to promptly erase personal information upon&nbsp;request.  Enhanced Consent Requirements: Internet companies would be prohibited from gathering data from 13- to 16-year-old users without their explicit&nbsp;consent.  <p>This isn’t a new battle. Senator Markey, a long-time advocate for children’s online safety, has championed similar legislation for over a decade. While previous iterations of the bill faced roadblocks, COPPA 2.0 gained significant momentum in the last Congress, passing the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.</p><p>The urgency of this legislation is underscored by the growing chorus of support from children’s advocacy groups, educators, and medical professionals. They argue that the unchecked data collection practices of Big Tech pose a serious threat to children’s privacy and well-being.</p><p>The digital landscape has become a surveillance state for children. Recall that the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) already began an <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/big-techs-dirty-secret-your-kids-privacy-doesn-t-matter-d1e3eabe9921">investigation</a> into how social media platforms such as TikTok, Reddit, and Imgur processed children’s data.</p><p>Senator Cassidy emphasized the parental anxieties driving the legislation, “Every kid has an iPad or smartphone […] COPPA 2.0 is the tool that will give parents the peace of mind they need and keep their children’s personal information secure.”</p><p>The reintroduction of COPPA 2.0 marks a critical juncture in the ongoing debate over online privacy. As the digital lives of young people become increasingly intertwined with their real-world experiences, the need for robust safeguards has never been more apparent. The question remains: will this Congress finally deliver the protections that children and parents so desperately need?</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>Brave presents the Rewards 3.0 Partner Program, expanding BAT utility while giving Web3 brands premium visibility. Launch partners include Bandit’s Badchain, CHOMP, Decentraland, GuanoCoin, Karate Combat, Pudgy Pop, and SOL Incinerator.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards 3.0 is the next evolution of Brave’s unique in-browser rewards program, allowing users to support content creators and earn <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">Basic Attention Tokens</a> (BAT) for viewing privacy-respecting ads. Rolling out in phases over 2025, Rewards 3.0 introduces a new Offer Wall experience, more earning opportunities, self-custody payout options, and exclusive benefits from partners for <a>Brave Rewards</a> users and BAT holders.</p>
<p>Learn more about Brave Rewards 3.0 in <a>BAT Roadmap 3.0: The On-chain Era</a>.</p>
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program will be a key part of the Rewards 3.0 rollout, ensuring users can continue earning BAT with their attention while unlocking even more ways to earn, spend, and interact with BAT in the broader Web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>The program offers unique opportunities that only Brave—and its 82 million monthly active users—can provide. Partners will gain high visibility exposure to new audiences, along with valuable insights into messaging and incentives that resonate most with loyal Rewards users. By integrating BAT utility into their platforms and activations, participating partners will drive engagement and adoption across e-commerce, gaming, digital content, DeFi, and beyond.</p>
<p>For Brave Rewards users, this means direct access to real-world benefits like discounts, premium goods or services, and Web3 experiences—all directly through the browser.</p>

<p>Karate Combat-sponsored Brave New Tab Takeover</p>
<p>Partners gain visibility across and beyond Brave’s ecosystem:</p>

 Brave Ads exposure through the New Tab Takeover (NTT), Notification, and Newsfeed ad units, all part of the privacy-preserving Brave Ads platform 
 Program promotions through updates, social promotions, and community activations 
 

 The Partner Program will grow BAT and Brave 
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program enhances BAT’s utility while advancing Brave’s mission to build a privacy-first Web that empowers users. Partners contribute to BAT’s ecosystem by paying for the program in BAT, and integrating new secondary BAT utilities, which will ultimately drive adoption across Web3.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards and BAT were first made available to users in 2017. Rewards 3.0 builds on that foundation by bringing added value to Web3 within Brave’s expanding user base and in the broader multichain attention economy.</p>
<p>Rewards 3.0 also leverages BAT’s growing adoption:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Over 99% of the 1.5B total BAT supply is already in circulation 
 BAT ranks as the 14th most distributed token by on-chain holders on Ethereum 
 1.5M+ verified creators accept BAT contributions 
 600+ advertiser campaigns have leveraged Brave Ads, cementing BAT’s role in a thriving, user-first ad economy 
 
<blockquote>
<p>“In a space that’s become tired with hype cycle after hype cycle and fly-by-night engagement farming, we’re aiming to do something different with the Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program. We’ve created a program for product teams that provides a mix of exposure, duration, and addressable lead users needed to experiment and find early market fit in Brave. We welcome partners to the program that want to grow with the Brave Rewards ecosystem, and that share our interest in bringing useful products, value, and Web3 adoption to millions of new users.”</p>
<p>— Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations at Brave</p>
</blockquote>

 The first Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program members 
<p>Over the next six months, a new group of partners will be announced and added to the program each month. Partners in the program will be adding and updating offers throughout the duration of the program. To kick off the program, Brave welcomes our first group of partners:</p>

 Bandit’s Badchain 
<p><a href="https://earn.badchain.org/">Bandit’s Badchain</a> is a satirical blockchain by Bandit Network, designed to poke fun at the hype-driven world of Web3. Embracing the hilariously terrible, it turns epic fails into an art form—because sometimes, being bad is the whole point.</p>
<p><a href="https://bandit.network/">Bandit Network</a> is a leader in white-labeled quest solutions that drive engagement through interactive experiences. In addition to powering quests for Rewards users, Bandit will be featuring Brave as a B2B channel partner to grow the Rewards Partner Program.</p>

 CHOMP 
<p><a href="https://app.chomp.games/application">CHOMP</a> is a subjective oracle wrapped in a gamified quiz experience. It harnesses crowd wisdom to determine the best answer, using research-backed algorithms that analyze user responses. Players share opinions, predict how others will answer, and earn rewards.</p>
<p>As part of the program, CHOMP will feature a weekly BAT or Brave-themed deck, exploring core values like privacy, attention, and community. Brave Rewards users can put their instincts to the test, ‘CHOMP the deck,’ and compete for BAT rewards.</p>

 Decentraland 
<p><a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a> is a social virtual world. From community-built landscapes to immersive events, Decentraland offers a vibrant open-source playground where anyone can dive into a world of endless creativity, exploration, and connection.</p>
<p>Decentraland will collaborate with the BAT Community on activations and engagements within Decentraland, exclusive rewards, and bringing both communities together through joint community calls and X Spaces.&nbsp;</p>

 GuanoCoin 
<p>Created by a group of dedicated fans and developers from the BAT Community, <a href="https://www.guanocoin.com/">GuanoCoin</a> ($GUANO) is a memecoin designed to help grow BAT’s ecosystem on Solana. The team recently launched the GuanoCoin Cave, where BAT holders can lock their BAT to earn GUANO over time—now holding over 160,000 BAT. Through the program, GuanoCoin will offer incentives and quests to help Rewards users maximize their on-chain rewards.</p>

 Karate Combat 
<p><a href="https://karate.com/">Karate Combat</a> is the world’s premier full-contact striking league, blending live-action martial arts with immersive CGI environments powered by the Unreal Engine. Broadcast in over 100 countries, it delivers high-energy combat sports with a futuristic edge.</p>
<p>Karate Combat’s involvement builds on an ongoing media partnership with Brave, with plans to use the program to experiment with activations involving BAT and Karate token utility, and new ways to bring both communities together.</p>

 Pudgy Pop 
<p><a href="https://www.pudgypop.com/">Pudgy Pop</a> is a tile-matching game set in the adorable Pudgy Penguins universe. With strategic challenges, charming characters, and a community-driven spirit, it offers a fresh twist on a classic puzzle experience.</p>
<p>Pudgy Pop will collaborate with Brave to promote Web3 gaming through social campaigns and in-person events throughout the program.</p>

 SOL Incinerator 
<p><a href="https://sol-incinerator.com/?gad_source=1">SOL Incinerator</a> is a Solana-based platform that lets users permanently burn unwanted tokens and scam NFTs from their wallets while reclaiming SOL—or BAT—in the process. Designed to keep portfolios clean, it turns burning junk into a rewarding experience.</p>
<p>The program provides a great opportunity for Brave Rewards users to learn and utilize SOL Incinerator to burn unwanted tokens for BAT for added value.</p>

 How interested partners can get involved 
<p>The Brave Rewards 3.0 Partner Program is just getting started. Each month, we’ll share updates on new partners and exclusive offers for Brave Rewards users.</p>

  Wiz and Google: Securing the Cloud  <p>Congratulations to Assaf and the team.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/doug-leone/">Doug Leone</a>	 



Published March 18, 2025
  



 
<p>Before we partnered with Wiz in February 2020, our history with Assaf Rappaport and his co-founders Yinon Costica, Roy Reznik and Ami Luttwak already went back almost a decade.</p>



<p>We learned in 2013 that a team of alumni from Israel’s elite 8200 cybersecurity unit were starting a company together. We look for outliers at Sequoia—a founder coming out of 8200 was noteworthy, but a whole team was very special. They weren’t looking for financing. But after our Tel Aviv-based partner Gili Raanan secured a meeting, we convinced them to partner with Sequoia and we led the first financing for Adallom. (I later learned that Assaf thought I was Don Valentine when we first met, which may be why he agreed to the meeting.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>After selling Adallom to Microsoft and leading Microsoft’s Cloud Security Group for five years, the co-founders left to once again start something new. We were thrilled to hear they wanted Sequoia and Gili (who by then had his own firm, Cyberstarts) to be their first partners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They didn’t know exactly what the something new would be, but they now had a proven track record and the ambition to build an enduring company. Before they even had a product, we led their initial financing round alongside Cyberstarts in early 2020 and I joined the board.</p>



<p>The team quickly hit on the insight that cloud security needed a simpler, agentless architecture for an increasingly complex digital world. Once the vision for Wiz became clear, they <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/wiz-spotlight-with-a-little-help-from-their-friends/">accelerated like no company I’ve ever seen</a>: My partner Bogomil Balkansky, who also works with Wiz, says that in the early days the team strategically leveraged their Israeli time zone, working 9-5 on the product and then working late into the night on sales calls to the U.S. and Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we helped recruit team members, we were consistently impressed with the caliber of talent joining Wiz and their ability to move quickly. Wiz set a record, reaching $100 million in annual recurring revenue in just 18 months, faster than any software company in history, and quickly became a leader in cloud security.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-joining-google">Today’s milestone</a> marks the start of an exciting new chapter. Wiz and Google Cloud share a vision to improve security by making it easier and faster for organizations of all types and sizes to protect themselves, end-to-end, across all major clouds. This will help spur the adoption of multicloud cybersecurity.</p>



<p>The future is bright for Wiz inside of Google Cloud. Just as we believed Google would change the world when we first partnered with the company in 1999, we believe Wiz is transforming cloud security.</p>



<p>At Sequoia, we partner with founders who want to make a dent in the universe. We couldn’t be prouder of Assaf and the team in reaching this milestone. It’s been an honor to be your partner for over a decade. Thank you for letting us be a part of your journey.</p>

<p>It’s no longer a secret that Big Tech companies generally prioritize profits over privacy. You’ve probably heard the saying: “If it’s free, then you are the product.” What’s even more alarming is that while we navigate the complexities of raising kids in a hyper-connected world, these tech giants are quietly amassing vast troves of data, often with little regard for the long-term consequences.</p><p>The veneer of child-friendly interfaces and educational apps masks a relentless data collection machine. From seemingly innocuous games to social media platforms designed for “younger audiences,” children are being tracked, profiled, and targeted with alarming efficiency. This isn’t just about collecting basic demographic information; it’s about building intricate dossiers that can influence their behaviours, shape their preferences, and even predict their future&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Earlier this month, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2025/02/investigations-announced-into-how-social-media-and-video-sharing-platforms-use-uk-children-s-personal-information/">announced</a> that it had begun investigating how TikTok, Reddit, and Imgur processed children’s data. Although the outcome of the investigations is yet to be made public, the privacy watchdog was examining whether TikTok’s use of children’s data leads to them being fed inappropriate or harmful&nbsp;content.</p><p>Separate inquiries are being conducted to determine the validity of Imgur and Reddit’s practices regarding the use of UK children’s personal data for age verification purposes.</p><p>“We welcome the technology and innovation that companies like social media bring to the UK and want them to thrive in our economy. But this cannot be at the expense of children’s privacy,” John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner said.</p><p>In 2023, TikTok was slammed with a £12.7M <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/04/ico-fines-tiktok-127-million-for-misusing-children-s-data/">fine</a> by the ICO for illegally using children’s data, including allowing 1.4M UK kids under 13 onto the platform in 2020. Meanwhile, over 42% of UK parents feel helpless when it comes to social media and video platforms collecting their kids’ data, according to a new ICO&nbsp;study.</p><p>In conclusion, the digital landscape is not inherently harmful, but the current practices of Big Tech companies are creating a dangerous environment for children. It’s time to demand transparency, accountability, and a fundamental shift in how these companies prioritize the well-being of our&nbsp;kids.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

Their vision is to leverage Israel’s unique cadre of “technowarriors” to help defend the Western world order.</p>

Team Kela and Team Sequoia, together in Tel Aviv.



 
<p>Israel is unusual in the West: It still has a draft. At the end of high school, instead of applying to colleges, students make bids to join elite units in the military. From the paratroopers to the combat divisions to the elite intelligence group Unit 8200, competition to get the best assignments is fierce.</p>



<p>Israel’s startup ecosystem has thrived by leveraging this talent to build tremendous businesses: post-draft, the country’s “technowarriors” staff many of its most successful tech companies. Veterans of 8200 and other units founded Sequoia portfolio companies Wiz, Island, Cyera, Eon and Decart, among others—and today, about <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-01-18/ty-article/half-of-global-cybersecurity-investment-has-been-in-israel-pm-bennett-says/0000017f-e3f8-d38f-a57f-e7fa23050000">half</a> of global cybersecurity investment goes into Israeli companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.kelasys.com/">Kela’s</a> mission is to redeploy this technowarrior talent back into the defense sector. The vision is two-fold: in the short term, to upgrade Israel’s internal defense capabilities. The company’s initial focus is border protection, an urgent priority post-October 7th. In the long term, the ambition is to convert Israel into a defense tech hub for Western militaries—a source of strategic advantage for NATO and the U.S. as they seek to deter their adversaries.</p>



<p>As conflicts become more tech-native—we have seen previews of this in Ukraine—the Israeli skillset is becoming increasingly important for the Pentagon and for NATO countries. Cyberwarfare, AI, autonomous systems, jamming and counter-jamming techniques, and GPS-denied navigation are just a few of the ways modern defense is becoming technologically sophisticated. Historically, a nation’s industrial might determined its military power. If technology begins to play a co-equal role, then Israel should evolve an even more critical role in defending the Western alliance: as a major exporter of advanced defense technology.</p>



<p>Kela’s founders share a deep expertise in military intelligence. Alon Dror graduated from Israel’s highly selective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot program</a>, which accepts only 25 to 60 cadets per year. After Talpiot, he served as a Tank Platoon Commander and in MAFAT, Israel’s R&amp;D directorate, where he won the Israel Defense Prize. Hamutal Meridor served in Unit 8200 before entering the private sector, where she was General Manager for Palantir’s Israel business. Alon and Hamutal share highly complementary skillsets: Alon is a mission-oriented R&amp;D leader and Hamutal is a business-oriented strategist. Both see Kela as their life’s work.</p>



<p>We at Sequoia had independently formed a thesis around Israeli defense tech, and were primed on this idea when we re-connected with Alon and Hamutal, both of whom we had pre-existing relationships with, during a trip to Israel in April 2024. We were so invigorated by the team’s plans that we extended a breakfast meeting into a full-day conversation. We also traveled to Jerusalem to meet Jason Manne, the company’s third co-founder and an algorithms team leader (Major) in an elite combat-focused R&amp;D unit. Jason was accurately described to us as “the guy you come to when you need something built in two days that usually takes two months.” We were privileged to lead Kela’s $10M seed round shortly thereafter.</p>



<p>The final dominos fell into place over the summer: Omer Bar-Ilan, a technical genius known for his work on Israel’s Iron Dome, joined as Kela’s fourth co-founder. We also partnered with Lux Capital’s Brandon Reeves and Josh Wolfe, who led the company’s Series A and brought on a fantastic angel coalition. The former deputy commander of Unit 8200 was an early advisor to Kela, and numerous retired generals helped to hone the vision and value proposition.</p>



<p>Since its founding, the Kela team has been relentlessly focused on product R&amp;D. Kela’s product is an open architecture platform to integrate sensor data for defense. The company aims to leverage existing commercially available and military-grade technology. It does this by 1) militarizing existing commercial technology (e.g., drones), 2) integrating disparate military technology systems (e.g., specialized sensors), 3) delivering these capabilities to personnel through a single, easy-to-use command center interface and 4) embedding advanced intelligence and AI.</p>



<p>Seven months into building, Kela’s product is now live in the field with multiple active projects. The team’s speed has been a critical differentiator, allowing Kela to achieve in days what legacy companies might require weeks, months, or even years to accomplish. This has earned it early plaudits from both generals and soldiers, who value Kela’s deep understanding of their mission, the company’s technological rigor, and the team’s quick, seamless execution.</p>



<p>With strong demand in Israel and early market pull from American and NATO customers, Kela is now scaling up. The company has recruited 20 elite individuals, each of whom is standalone brilliant, and who collectively have become a force to be reckoned with. We are excited to announce our new venture to the world. Calling on all technowarriors—come <a href="https://kelasys.com/#positions">join</a> us!</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-protocol-establishes-swiss-foundation/">The newly established Panther Protocol Foundation, based in Switzerland</a>, will launch a Limited Mainnet Beta before the end of the month on Polygon Network. Closely resembling Panther’s intended mainnet setup, the beta test will operate as a fully self-contained environment using real assets. The beta will serve as a final phase of testing, ensuring functionality and collecting valuable feedback leading up to Panther’s full mainnet launch. This will be the foundation’s first action taken as owner of the Panther codebase.&nbsp;</p> Why a Limited Mainnet Beta? <p>Panther’s beta will be a controlled, self-contained production environment in which features are tested with a limited group of users before full deployment. Unlike traditional testnets, the beta test will use real assets. This will allow the Foundation to fine-tune functionality using actual user interactions and real-world conditions, creating a seamless experience when Panther’s full mainnet launches.</p> Zone Manager <p>Panther Protocol’s Shielded Pool will be divided into Zones, each managed by a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Manager</a>, a licensed operator who will oversee user access and compliance. For the beta test, Eurobit, a Spanish crypto exchange and licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP), will be the Zone Manager. Separately, the Panther Protocol Foundation had previously <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/09/2993959/0/en/Panther-Protocol-and-Eurobit-Partner-to-Pioneer-Compliant-and-Confidential-DeFi.html?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">announced</a> that it would work with Eurobit to support its application to become a Zone Manager for Panther’s mainnet.</p> Preparations underway <p>The <a href="https://github.com/pantherfoundation/trusted-setup-ceremony?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">trusted setup ceremony</a> required for the Limited Mainnet Beta has been successfully completed. The process involved having members from the tech team, Panther Foundation, Purefi (compliance partner), Eurobit and the Panther community contributing sequentially, each adding cryptographic randomness to generate the final parameters securely. This ensures the integrity and security of Panther Protocol's Zero-Knowledge circuits ahead of the beta.</p> What’s Next? <p>In the coming days, Panther will release more details about the exact timing of the Beta network, including how users can participate, potential rewards, the sign-up process, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay informed by following Panther on<a href="https://twitter.com/PantherProtocol?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> </a><a href="http://x.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">X</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord </a>and <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>. </p>

 PIVX Weekly Pulse (Mar 7th, 2025 — Mar. 13th,&nbsp;2025) <p>Stay informed on PIVX: we’re recapping the week’s market movements, privacy advancements, and community wins.</p> Top Stories   New Listing: PIVX is now available on Guardarian, a non-custodial on and off-ramp platform for cryptocurrency swaps. Users can easily buy, sell, and swap PIV with over 50 fiat currencies and 1000+ cryptocurrencies.   Market Pulse   Masternode Count: The PIVX network experienced a decrease in active masternodes, dropping from 2,058 last week to the current count of 1,975. This decline may be related to a recent temporary fork on the chain, which has since been resolved.    Price Check: PIV’s Daily USD Value experienced a noticeable dip this week, with trading activity between $0.14 and $0.17. This resulted in a weekly average of $0.16, a decrease from the previous week’s average of $0.175. In general, PIV has continued to trade within a relatively narrow range, indicating sideways movement, while facing increased selling pressure amid the general market downturn.    Trading Buzz: The total Weekly Trading Volume was approximately $14.75 million, a decrease from the $15.5 million recorded last week. Furthermore, daily transactions fell below the consistent $2 million threshold, a shift not seen in several&nbsp;weeks.  <p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>The internet has become an indispensable part of our daily lives, facilitating everything from work and education to social interaction. This pervasive connectivity, however, amplifies the potential for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities across our growing array of online accounts and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Here are a few five safety tips to help you protect your privacy&nbsp;online.</p> 1. Create Strong Passwords <p>With virtually every website wanting you to create an account, your passwords are the first line of defence against unauthorized access. Creating strong and unique passwords for each online service is fundamental to maintaining your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Not all accounts require maximum security. Protect your most sensitive logins, like email and banking, with unique, robust passwords. For lower-risk sites, a shared, strong password offers a practical balance.</p><p>A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information such as birthdays, names of family members, or common words. Instead, consider using passphrases — longer combinations of words that are easier for you to remember but difficult for others to&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Additionally, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an authentication app.</p> 2. Don’t Overshare <p>I bet you know someone who lives out their entire lives on social media. From eating out at a famous restaurant to bungee jumping, leaving college, and even taking a dump, the urge to share every aspect of our lives can lead to overexposure, jeopardizing our personal security.</p><p>Exposing too much personal information — location, birthday, hometown, even seemingly innocuous details — creates a digital footprint that can be exploited.</p><p>Take control of your privacy by meticulously reviewing and adjusting your social media settings. Understand who can see your posts, and exercise restraint when divulging sensitive data. Remember, the online world retains information indefinitely, and what feels transient today may have lasting consequences tomorrow.</p> 3. Secure Your Browsing&nbsp;Habits <p>Ever wonder why those sneakers you browsed suddenly follow you across the web? It’s not magic, it’s tracking. Platforms use algorithms to analyze your browsing history and target you with&nbsp;ads.</p><p>Your browsing activity reveals significant information about your interests, shopping habits, health concerns, and more. Taking steps to secure your browsing can substantially improve your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Consider using privacy-focused browsers that block trackers by default. Extensions like privacy badgers, ad blockers, and cookie managers can provide additional control over what information websites collect about you. Regularly clear your browsing history, cookies, and cached data to minimize the digital trail you leave&nbsp;behind.</p><p>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) encrypt your internet connection and hide your IP address, preventing your internet service provider and potential eavesdroppers from seeing what websites you visit. When choosing a VPN, research reputable providers that have clear privacy policies and don’t log your activities.</p><p>Private browsing modes (such as Incognito in Chrome or Private Browsing in Firefox) offer limited privacy by not saving your browsing history locally, but they don’t prevent tracking by websites or your internet service provider. Use them as one tool in your privacy toolkit, not as a complete solution.</p> 4. Free Wi-Fi? Think&nbsp;Twice <p>Public Wi-Fi networks, often found in cafes, airports, and other public spaces, typically lack robust security protocols. This creates a vulnerable environment where malicious actors can easily intercept your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Imagine conducting online shopping, entering your credit card details, or accessing sensitive financial information while on such a network. Without adequate encryption, your activity becomes an open book, easily accessible to anyone with the right&nbsp;tools.</p><p>To protect your financial and personal data, exercise extreme caution when using free public Wi-Fi. It’s best to postpone sensitive transactions until you are connected to a secure, password-protected network, such as your home Wi-Fi or a trusted mobile&nbsp;hotspot.</p> 5. Verify Before You&nbsp;Click <p>You probably received an email from a distressed Nigerian prince — I am from Nigeria, by the way. This is a classic example of phishing. Cybercriminals excel at deception, crafting phishing scams to mimic legitimate communications from trusted entities like banks and utility companies.</p><p>These fraudulent emails often contain malicious links or attachments, posing a significant threat to your security.</p><p>Be vigilant for telltale signs of phishing, such as spelling errors, unusual sender email addresses, or requests for sensitive information. By recognizing these red flags, you can protect yourself from falling victim to these insidious attacks.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

<p>In this episode, Matt Prewitt sits down with Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s Cyber Ambassador-at-large and 1st Digital Minister, as well as the star of the new short documentary Good Enough Ancestor. It is a fascinating conversation exploring the profound intersections of technology, spirituality, and democracy.&nbsp;<br><br>Topics they cover include:&nbsp;</p>  Daoism and spiritual practice – and their favorite Leonard Cohen lyrics.  “Laser blended vision” as a metaphor for democracy – integrating different perspectives into a coherent whole.  “High-bandwidth, low-latency” democracy – allowing for real-time collaboration.  January 6 vs. Taiwan’s Sunflower Movement – contrasting two parliamentary occupations.  Marshall McLuhan’s “hot and cool media” – and what it means for how we should build and use AI.  The role of education in democracy – and how spirituality’s place in learning differs between the East and West.  AI’s moral tradition gap – why today’s models lack cultural and ethical grounding.  Trade, sovereignty, and democracy – how to balance open societies with national autonomy.  RadicalxChange – how the movement is like “conservative anarchism” and Daoism in transcending left-right divides.  <p>Watch Good Enough Ancestor at<a href="https://www.combinationsmag.com/good-enough-ancestor/"> combinationsmag.com/good-enough-ancestor</a>.</p><p><br>Bios:<br><br>Audrey Tang, Taiwan’s Cyber Ambassador-at-large and 1st Digital Minister (2016-2024), is celebrated for her pioneering efforts in digital freedom. Named one of TIME’s “100 Most Influential People in AI” in 2023, Tang was instrumental in shaping Taiwan’s internationally acclaimed COVID-19 response and in safeguarding the 2024 presidential and legislative elections from foreign cyber interference. Tang is now focused on broadening her vision of Plurality — technology for collaborative diversity — to inspire global audiences.<br><br>As the first nonbinary cabinet member globally, Tang identifies as “post-gender” and is comfortable with any pronouns. She is a respected community leader and a founding contributor to g0v, an initiative promoting transparency by making information about Taiwan’s economy, history, politics, and culture accessible.</p><p>Tang has been key in developing participation platforms such as Join.gov.tw, leading to practical improvements like enhanced access to tax software and revised cancer treatment regulations. A “conservative anarchist,” Tang is dedicated to boosting digital competence and safeguarding information integrity online through collective intelligence.</p><p>A child prodigy, Tang excelled in advanced mathematics by age six and computer programming by age eight. By 19, she had held significant positions in software companies and worked as an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley. Growing up in a large family following Christian and Taoist traditions, Tang embraced pluralism and the internet’s potential to connect people based on shared interests rather than geography, fueling her drive for global impact.</p><p>In Taiwan, Tang’s generation has always intertwined politics with the internet, striving for a more transparent and inclusive society. Despite Taiwan’s martial law history, Tang and her fellow civic technologists have achieved internationally acclaimed progress toward greater governmental transparency.</p><p>During the 2014 Sunflower Movement, Tang played a crucial role in livestreaming protests against a trade agreement with Beijing, facilitating real-time communication that led to more peaceful negotiations and the movement’s success.</p><p>“Democracy can evolve.” Tang says. “We can create innovative policies by simply asking the people, ‘What should we do together?’”</p><p>There is also promising news behind Tang’s grand plan: more than half the world’s population – over 4 billion people – are holding elections in 2024. That’s over 70 countries.</p><p>Says Tang, “I want to be a good enough ancestor for future generations.”</p><p>Audrey’s Social Links:&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://x.com/audreyt">⿻ Audrey Tang 唐鳳 (@audreyt) / X</a>  <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/audreyt.org">⿻ Audrey Tang 唐鳳 (@audreyt.org) — Bluesky</a>  <a href="https://www.threads.net/@digitalminister.one">唐鳳Audrey Tang (@digitalminister.one) • Threads, Say more</a>  <a href="https://www.plurality.net/">Plurality.net</a>&nbsp;  <p>Matt Prewitt (he/him) is a lawyer, technologist, and writer.

<p>Bitcoin’s security and reliability as a store of value are undeniable. However, its liquidity remained untapped for too long due to a lack of trustless bridges and native smart contract capabilities. As BTC is only native to Bitcoin’s L1, any attempt to include it in DeFi relies on the trust assumptions of third party custodians that wrap it. Build On Bitcoin (BOB) aims to expand Bitcoin’s functionality by integrating it with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. BOB operates as an OP Stack L2 with a hybrid design incorporating ZKPs, Bitcoin staking, and Ethereum for data availability. By functioning as a rollup, BOB processes transactions off-chain and batches them for settlement on Bitcoin and Ethereum, significantly improving transaction speed and reducing costs compared to Bitcoin’s base layer.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Alexei’s background  Setbacks for Bitcoin DeFi  Bitcoin bridges  BitVM  BOB operators and trust assumptions  BOB architecture &amp; Bitcoin staking  Bitcoin LSTs  The future of Bitcoin DeFi  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/alexeiZamyatin">Alexei Zamyatin on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/build_on_bob">Build on Bitcoin on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Faced with a UK government demand for a backdoor into encrypted iCloud data, Apple has opted to remove its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for UK users and pursue legal action against the government. The fuss is nothing short of a significant setback for digital&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The crux of the conflict revolves around encryption, the technology that scrambles data, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties. Apple employs a robust end-to-end encryption known as&nbsp;ADP.</p><p>Introduced in December 2022, ADP puts encryption keys solely on user devices, denying Apple decryption capability. This contrasts with standard iCloud, where Apple holds the keys for recovery and can decrypt your data under legal orders, as seen in the 2023 political investigation. While privacy advocates lauded the opt-in feature, it was upsetting to law enforcement.</p><p>In January 2025, using its amended Investigatory Powers Act, the UK government ordered Apple to create an iCloud backdoor, citing unconfirmed counterterrorism reasons. This marked the beginning of an ongoing digital privacy&nbsp;battle.</p> Encryption Clash: Security vs.&nbsp;Privacy <p>The UK government, like many others, argues that strong encryption hinders law enforcement’s ability to investigate and prevent criminal activity, including terrorism and child sexual abuse. They contend that tech companies should provide “backdoors” or “exceptional access” to encrypted data under&nbsp;warrant.</p><p>Apple, however, vehemently opposes this notion, arguing that creating such backdoors would compromise the security of all users. They maintain that any vulnerability introduced for law enforcement could be exploited by malicious actors, putting everyone’s data at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Rather than creating a “backdoor” that could compromise security for all users globally, the tech giant chose to remove the feature entirely for UK users. This decision, while maintaining the integrity of their general security architecture, reduces the protection afforded to UK users. While Apple hasn’t set a hard deadline, UK users who had enabled ADP began receiving notices on February 21, 2025, requiring them to turn it off or risk losing iCloud access. New UK users attempting to enable ADP now encounter error messages.</p><p>The removal of ADP means that several categories of iCloud data are now subject to standard encryption, where Apple holds the keys and can be compelled by legal requests to decrypt the information. This includes iCloud backups, photos, notes, voice memos, and Safari bookmarks.</p><p>The drama is heating up as Apple has appealed to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, an independent court that reviews claims against the Security Service, according to BBC&nbsp;sources.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK’s order also triggered strong reactions from the US administration. President Donald Trump, speaking to The Spectator, likened the demand to ‘something that you hear about with China.’ US head of intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also expressed her anger at not being informed, calling it an ‘egregious violation’ of US citizens’ privacy rights and vowing to investigate potential breaches of the US-UK data agreement.</p> The Complexities of Balancing Security and&nbsp;Privacy <p>The Apple vs. UK showdown exposes the inherent tension between national security and individual privacy. Governments argue that they need access to encrypted data to protect their citizens, while tech companies and privacy advocates argue that such access would create a slippery slope toward mass surveillance and undermine the very security it purports to&nbsp;protect.</p><p>This debate is further complicated by the global nature of the internet and the challenges of jurisdictional boundaries. What constitutes “reasonable” surveillance in one country may be considered an egregious violation of privacy in another. The lack of international consensus on these issues makes it difficult to establish clear rules and regulations.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

  Partnering with Reflection: Toward Superintelligence, with Autonomous Coding  <p>Misha, Ioannis and their team are building the AI dream: superintelligent agents capable of doing knowledge work, starting with autonomous coding.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a>	 



Published March 7, 2025
  



Reflection co-founders Misha Laskin and Ioannis Antonoglou.



 
<p>“It’s not a human move. I’ve never seen a human play this move … so beautiful.”</p>



<p>That was Go champion Fan Hui’s reaction to Move 37—a moment that left the world in awe. It was the move that defined the 2016 showdown between Go legend Lee Sedol and DeepMind’s AI agent, AlphaGo. In that historic match, AlphaGo dominated, winning four out of five games, marking a pivotal milestone for artificial intelligence: that AI could reach superhuman levels of capability.</p>



<p>Ioannis Antonoglou, Reflection’s cofounder and Deepmind founding engineer behind AlphaGo, recalls the moment vividly: “Move 37 was spectacular … a brilliant, unconventional move that showed the system had a deep understanding of the game. It had creativity. It could think of things that people hadn’t thought of before.”</p>



<p>Ioannis continued pushing the frontier. He extended AlphaGo’s capabilities with AlphaZero—an AI that learned entirely from self-play, mastering the game without human guidance. Then, he led the development of MuZero, an even greater breakthrough: an AI that conquered Go, chess, Shogi, Atari and more—all without even being told the rules of the game.</p>



<p>These weren’t just incremental advances. They were seismic shifts in AI that showcased the significance of reinforcement learning in building superhuman agentic systems. Even today, AlphaGo, AlphaZero and MuZero remain amongst the most powerful AI agents ever created.</p>



 From AlphaGo to Reflection AI 



<p>At DeepMind, Ioannis went on to play a key leadership role in post-training efforts for Gemini, where he met Reflection cofounder Misha Laskin, who was leading reward model development. Together, they continued to push the boundaries of two of the most critical fields in AI: reinforcement learning and large language models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their shared vision for superintelligence, and their elite domain expertise in building both the most capable agents and the most powerful LLMs, led to the birth of <a href="https://www.reflection.ai/">Reflection AI</a>.</p>



<p>The vision of Reflection is to build superintelligent agents to conduct all knowledge work. Crucially, Reflection is built on two core beliefs:</p>



 
 That autonomous coding is a crucial step toward superintelligence. 



 That real-world evaluations—not just benchmarks—matter most. 
 



<p>The company’s first focus? Building autonomous coding agents.&nbsp;</p>



 Autonomous coding agents 



<p>We’ve seen the incredible benefit of coding assistants in enabling developers to work with 10x speed and productivity. In parallel to this, we believe that the next leap forward is autonomous coding agents that handle workloads autonomously.</p>



<p>Reflection’s autonomous coding agents integrate directly into an organization’s codebase and engineering workflows, and autonomously tackle well-scoped engineering tasks entirely end-to-end. They read, write, test and deploy code, handling all the infrastructure on your behalf, relieving the burden of entire engineering workloads from developers and teams.</p>



<p>The reality is, rather than writing new code, most engineers spend the majority of their time buried in refactoring, debugging and fixing bugs; code reviews, standups and sprint planning; updating documentation and learning new tools, languages and frameworks; and managing infrastructure, devops and testing. Reflection’s autonomous coding agents start with these sets of tasks: important, yet tedious, time-consuming work that often sits in an engineering team’s backlog.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crucially, Reflection is centered on reliability. To start, Reflection’s agents are not all-encompassing software engineers. Rather, they are agents that engineering teams and leaders design to handle specific sets of tasks and workloads, with trusted performance:</p>



 
 Refactor legacy code safely, without breaking dependencies 



 Generate and run test cases automatically 



 Optimize memory usage across pull requests 



 Find and fix security vulnerabilities before they cause problems&nbsp; 



 And more! 
 



<p>As the team advances model intelligence to increase its scope of capabilities, Reflection’s agents take on more responsibilities. Imagine autonomous coding agents working tirelessly in the background, handling workloads that slow teams down. These agents understand your entire codebase, no matter how large or complex. They execute autonomously: planning, writing, testing and deploying code independently. They work continuously, spotting and solving problems proactively, and they improve over time, learning from real-world use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These are superintelligent coding agents, deployable instantly and in parallel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a fundamental shift in how software is built and maintained. It’s one massive leap towards a future where developers become directors of autonomous coding agents who build and maintain code on our behalf … and long term, a future where we all become directors of superintelligent agents that conduct knowledge work on our behalf.</p>



 The elite team building this future 



<p>In just one year, Reflection has assembled a world-class team—made up of the very researchers and engineers who pioneered some of AI’s greatest breakthroughs:</p>

<p>Telegram, often touted as a bastion of secure messaging, appears to be making radical changes to its data sharing policy. Recent reports indicate a dramatic surge in data disclosures, raising serious questions about the platform’s commitment to user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Following a September policy update, Telegram’s 2024 <a href="https://te-k.github.io/telegram-transparency/">Transparency Report</a>, along with 404 Media’s <a href="https://www.404media.co/telegram-hands-u-s-authorities-data-on-thousands-of-users/">reporting</a>, revealed that the app fulfilled 900 U.S. government requests, affecting 2,253 users, with most occurring in the final quarter of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>Telegram saw a spike in data requests during the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom. U.S. requests skyrocketed from a mere 14 in the first three quarters to 886 in Q4, an increase exceeding 6,000%. Similarly, the UK saw a rise from 3 to 139 requests, representing an increase of over&nbsp;4,500%.</p><p>India, which enacted stricter data laws in 2022, saw the highest volume of requests, with a major spike in Q4, culminating in a total of 14,641 requests for the year, impacting 23,535&nbsp;users.</p><p>Although the platform has long emphasized its encryption and commitment to user security, these figures suggest a significant shift in its operational practices.</p><p>Telegram’s data-sharing policy has undergone a notable shift, following the August arrest of CEO Pavel Durov in France for refusing to assist in a child abuse investigation. The platform now provides user phone numbers and IP addresses under valid legal orders, a change from its previous focus on terrorism-related cases.</p><p>This policy adjustment comes as Telegram faces scrutiny for its role in facilitating criminal activity, including the trading of stolen data, cryptocurrency laundering, and the sale of illegal goods, as well as the presence of unlicensed crypto exchanges advertising <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/criminal-networks-southeast-asia-flourish-telegrams-underground-markets-un-says-2024-10-07/">money laundering services</a>.</p> Navigating the&nbsp;Divide <p>While it is crucial to apprehend those who use Telegram for criminal purposes — from trading stolen data and laundering cryptocurrency to facilitating the distribution of illegal goods — the line between necessary surveillance and unwarranted intrusion is thin. The risk is that in the pursuit of criminals, the privacy of law-abiding users may be compromised.</p><p>The challenge lies in finding a balance that allows for effective law enforcement while safeguarding fundamental privacy rights. Transparency and accountability are paramount. Clear guidelines, strict oversight, and robust legal frameworks are needed to ensure that data requests are justified and proportionate. Without these safeguards, the fight against crime could inadvertently lead to a gradual erosion of privacy, affecting not only those suspected of wrongdoing but also the broader user&nbsp;base.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/telegrams-data-sharing-so-much-for-secure-messaging-637fc03796eb">Telegram’s Data Sharing: So Much for Secure Messaging</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Partnering with Freed: An AI-Powered Clinician’s Assistant  <p>Erez and his team are transforming medical scribing to give doctors more time for their patients—and their lives.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a>	 



Published March 5, 2025
  



Team Freed.



 
<p>Imagine a gifted student whose goal in life is to help people. Her path takes her to med school, and eventually to residency. She begins to see the patients she had always dreamed of helping. But instead of devoting her energy to their care—and to her life outside work—she finds herself buried in documentation and administrative tasks, spending hours charting over late nights and weekends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was the experience of Dr. Gabi Meckler, a family physician in Santa Rosa, California. She wasn’t alone. <a href="https://pnhp.org/news/physicians-spend-two-hours-on-ehrs-and-desk-work-for-every-hour-of-direct-patient-care/">Studies</a> show that for every one hour of patient interaction, clinicians devote two hours to documentation. Almost 50% of doctors reported symptoms of burnout in a <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/physician-burnout-rate-drops-below-50-first-time-4-years">recent AMA survey</a>, and <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/physician-health/6-specialties-desire-step-away-or-scale-back-common">nearly one-third</a> are considering leaving the field altogether.</p>



<p>Dr. Meckler knew there had to be a better way—and so did her husband, Erez Druk, then an engineer at Facebook. Erez wanted to free his wife and other clinicians to spend less time on paperwork, so he and co-founder Andrey Bannikov designed a solution: <a href="https://www.getfreed.ai/">Freed</a>, an AI-powered clinician assistant. That solution quickly took off, growing in a product-led motion among small- and medium-sized independent practices around the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Freed completely transforms the daily lives of clinicians. During a patient visit, clinicians use Freed to transcribe audio and generate draft medical notes. They can quickly review and edit the output, and the platform learns as they go, adapting style and terminology for each user—including preferences for phrasing, template layouts and specific medical vocabulary. After the patient leaves, Freed charts the visit and integrates the record into the EHR system. Doctors get less after-hours paperwork, more time and attention for their patients—and more space in their lives. The reviews are glowing: “Thanks to Freed,” one doctor said, “I close my computer and I’m done for the day. My kids get all of me.” Another: “I can focus on what really matters—my patients.” In many ways, Freed is a love letter from Erez to his wife Gabi, giving her—and doctors like her—precious time back.</p>



<p>When we first met Erez and Andrey, we were impressed by their customer obsession and velocity. Erez does everything with 200% intensity. Learning the saxophone at the age of 10 led to a scholarship from the Berklee School of Music; at the Israel Institute of Technology’s prestigious Technion University, he was at the top of his class. After graduation, he joined the team at Facebook—where he and Andrey met on his first day on the job. Their shared passion for innovation led to a years-long partnership, and now to a shared mission to help clinicians and their patients.</p>



<p>Today Freed serves more than 17,000 providers in small- and medium-sized practices across nearly 100 specialties, from mental health to pediatrics, giving doctors peace of mind and hours of time for what matters most. We at Sequoia are proud to support Erez, Andrey and their <a href="https://www.getfreed.ai/careers">growing team</a> by leading their Series A.</p>

<p>The Zcash ecosystem is embarking on a new chapter, and with it comes both challenges and opportunities. As we navigate this transition, I want to take a moment to express gratitude, outline our immediate priorities, and share my approach to ensuring the Zcash Foundation (ZF) operates at the highest level possible throughout this process.</p>



 Thank You, Jack 



<p>First and foremost, I want to extend my sincere thanks to Jack for his four years of service to ZF and countless contributions to the Zcash ecosystem since inception. Leadership transitions are never easy, but Jack’s dedication to ZF and the broader Zcash ecosystem has left an indelible impact that will ensure ZF’s momentum continues as we move forward.</p>



 Appreciation for the ZF Team and Ecosystem Partners 



<p>Also, I am incredibly grateful for the ZF engineers who continue to push forward each day, solving complex challenges and keeping Zcash at the cutting edge of privacy technology. Your expertise and dedication are critical to the success of Zcash, and I deeply appreciate your work.</p>



<p>Beyond ZF, I want to recognize the contributions of other key engineering teams and community organizations in the ecosystem. Zcash’s success relies on collaboration, and the work happening across the broader network of contributors is invaluable. Thank you ECC, Shielded Labs, ZCG, grantees, Zcash communities around the world, and individual contributors for your efforts in making privacy-preserving financial tools a reality.</p>



 My Role and Priorities as Interim Executive Director and COO 



<p>As Interim Executive Director and COO, my primary focus is ensuring that ZF operates smoothly and effectively during this transition period. With the support of the ZF board, I am committed to providing the resources and structure needed for the team to continue their important work without disruption.</p>



<p>One of the most critical tasks ahead is co-leading a strategic planning process with the ZF board. Before we can recruit a new Executive Director, we need to clearly define what skills and experience are required to lead ZF into the future. This process will be collaborative, thoughtful, and designed to ensure the best possible outcome for ZF and the Zcash community.</p>



<p>Additionally, the board seat vacated by Jack will remain open until the new Executive Director is in place, ensuring that the future leadership of ZF is properly aligned with the organization’s long-term vision.</p>



<p>During this interim period I will continue to provide transactional support to ZCG and ZecHub via FPF and I will no longer hold a leadership role within the organization. As of March 1st, the FPF board of directors is solely responsible for all future-focused decision making and strategic planning to ensure there is no conflict of interest across my roles.</p>



 My Approach: Coordination, Communication, and Execution 



<p>I strongly believe that Zcash does not have the time or resources to waste on inefficiencies or misalignment. My approach to leadership during this period is guided by three key principles:</p>



<p></p>



 
 Coordination – We need to maximize the impact of our efforts across the Zcash ecosystem. That means avoiding duplication of work, streamlining decision-making, and ensuring that every resource is used as effectively as possible. 



 Improving Communication – Both within ZF and across the broader Zcash community, communication must improve. ZF will be taking a closer look at how we share information and coordinate efforts, making necessary adjustments to ensure clarity, timeliness, and a cooperative approach to tackling challenges, both new and longstanding. 



 Execution – If you’ve worked with me over the past three-plus years, you know that I take a “get shit done” approach to everything I do. This transition period is no exception. We will move forward with focus, ensuring that ZF remains a strong, reliable, and effective organization. 
 



 



<p>While transitions like this inevitably come with uncertainty, I am committed to ensuring that ZF not only remains stable but continues to move forward with clarity and purpose. We are not here to dwell on the past—we are here to build the future.</p>



<p>To everyone in the Zcash community: I appreciate your work, your effort, and your commitment to our shared mission. Let’s move forward together.</p>



<p>—Alex Bornstein, Interim Executive Director</p>

<p>My first involvement in Zcash was nearly ten years ago. At the time, Zooko was trying to raise funding to build Zcash, and I gave him some feedback on his investor pitch. We stayed in contact, and I became an advisor to the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company (as ECC was then known). About a month before Zcash launched, I joined the ECC team full-time, and so I was there when we launched Zcash from the kitchen of an Airbnb in the Bay Area, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/business/dealbook/zcash-a-harder-to-trace-virtual-currency-generates-price-frenzy.html"></a>The New York Times’ coverage of the Zcash launch



<p>For the next four years at ECC, and then for another four years at the Zcash Foundation, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside some of the smartest and most dedicated people I’ve ever met. In that time, I’ve watched the Zcash ecosystem grow and become decentralised. As well as ECC and the Foundation, we now have QEDIT, Shielded Labs, the Financial Privacy Foundation, ZecHub, ZingoLabs, and a bunch of other teams that are funded by the Zcash Community Grants program, all of whom contribute to or support the Zcash mission in a variety of ways.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the Zcash ecosystem and community grows and evolves, so must the institutions that steward and support it, and that is especially true of the Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Executive Director, it has been my responsibility and privilege to serve the Zcash Foundation team, the Zcash community, and the Zcash mission for the past four years. One of my responsibilities as ED is to recognise when the time is right to step aside, to allow someone else to take the helm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe that time has come, and so I am stepping down from the role of Executive Director of the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alex Bornstein is taking over as interim ED. Alex is eminently qualified, with prior experience as ED of a 501(c)(3), and nearly four years as ZF’s COO. In that role, he has ably supported and advised me, and I look forward to returning the favour while the ZF Board begins the process of recruiting a permanent ED who will lead ZF through the coming evolution of its role.</p>



<p>I want to thank the Zcash Foundation team and Board members — past and present — for granting me their trust, support and patience over the past four years.&nbsp;I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work full-time on a project that aligns as strongly with my principles as Zcash does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To preempt any speculation or rumours: I am not leaving to take up another role, and there is no rancour or disagreement between the ZF Board and me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I will continue to support the Zcash Foundation in any way I can, and I will continue to support and contribute to the broader Zcash mission as a community member.</p>

<p>Panther Protocol has established a new Swiss-based foundation, replacing its previous Gibraltar-based entity. This strategic move positions Panther within a jurisdiction renowned for its stability, regulatory clarity, and leadership in blockchain innovation, privacy protection, and self-sovereignty, providing a solid foundation for long-term growth and development.</p><p>Why Switzerland?</p><p>Switzerland has built a reputation as a leading global hub for blockchain and financial innovation. It offers a well-defined legal framework that supports decentralization and privacy-conscious technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond regulation, it is home to a deep ecosystem of blockchain pioneers, institutional players, and research initiatives that drive industry advancement. The Foundation’s new home places Panther in an environment that fosters compliance and meaningful innovation, ensuring it remains at the forefront of confidential DeFi infrastructure and global adoption.</p> Key Developments:&nbsp;   Establishment of a Swiss-Based Foundation – The Panther Protocol Foundation will drive the protocol’s long-term development.  Intellectual Property Transfer—In the coming days, ownership of Panther’s codebase will be transferred from Panther Ventures Limited (PVL) to the new foundation.  Asset Consolidation – Resources from the Gibraltar-based foundation will be merged into the newly established Swiss entity.  Canary Network—Amongst the Foundation’s earliest priorities is the launching of Panther’s inaugural Canary Network, introducing real tokens to Panther’s platform for the first time. The Canary Network will provide valuable test results and insights under real-world conditions.  Leadership Appointments—Panther welcomes Reuben Yap and John Marshall as council members. Together, they bring a wealth of expertise in privacy-preserving blockchain systems, decentralized governance, regulatory strategy, data ethics, and cybersecurity.   What This Means for Panther <p>With the new framework in place, Panther is now well-positioned for privacy-focused DeFi innovation. The move to Switzerland provides an optimal regulatory framework for PF’s future growth and helps to sustain focus on privacy and compliance in DeFi.</p><p>The foundation will oversee the protocol’s ongoing development with more updates to follow.</p> About the Panther Protocol Foundation <p>The Panther Protocol Foundation is dedicated to supporting the adoption and sustainability of the Panther Protocol across the decentralized Web. The Foundation works to anchor Panther Protocol for DeFi and blockchain ecosystems, empowering users, builders, and licensed operators to participate in tomorrow’s internet while maintaining privacy.

<p>While legacy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are steadily carving their niche within mainstream finance, privacy coins are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>This divergence raises a critical question: in an era where data is king and surveillance is commonplace, can we realistically reconcile the need for robust regulation with the preservation of individual financial privacy?</p> The Core Conflict: Privacy vs. Surveillance <p>While Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous (linked to public addresses rather than identities), they remain traceable on the blockchain. Privacy coins like Monero and PIVX employ various technologies to obscure transaction details.</p><p>Monero, for instance, uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) to hide sender, receiver, and amount information. PIVX, on the other hand, employs its famous SHIELD, an implementation of zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge). However, these inherent privacy features, while appealing to individuals seeking financial autonomy and anonymity, raise serious concerns for regulators.</p><p>There have been countless assertions from critics suggesting that cryptocurrencies are primarily used for fraud, a claim that has already been <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/money-laundering-facts-fiat-vs-crypto-810a4ad29771">debunked</a> with facts. Sadly, this has done little to stop regulators from clamping down on digital assets, with privacy coins getting a tighter&nbsp;leash.</p><p>Regulators generally argue that the anonymous nature of privacy coins can facilitate illicit activities by making it harder to trace the flow of funds used for criminal purposes. Tax authorities also struggle to track cryptocurrency transactions for tax purposes, especially when privacy features are employed.</p> Global Regulatory Approaches <p>Different countries and regions have taken a different stance on privacy coins. While some have remained silent on the tech, others have issued an outright ban or rolled out measures to checkmate the activities of privacy-centric projects.</p> United States <p>U.S. regulatory pressure on privacy coins has intensified significantly in recent years. In May 2019, FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) issued a binding guidance mentioning “anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies” as potential AML risks. Under the rules, any exchange or business handling privacy coins must register as a Money Services Business (MSB) and implement full KYC/AML compliance.</p><p>In 2022, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) awarded a $1.25 million contract to Chainalysis for developing Monero tracing capabilities. The agency also offered bounties of up to $625,000 for contractors who could break Monero’s privacy protections.</p><p>The next year, the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned Tornado Cash mixer, demonstrating a willingness to target privacy-enhancing technologies. While not directly targeting privacy coins, this action signaled increased scrutiny of anonymizing technologies.</p><p>In general, major U.S. exchanges have systematically avoided or removed privacy coins. Coinbase has never listed Monero, citing regulatory concerns. Kraken delisted Monero, Zcash, and Dash for U.S. customers in December&nbsp;2023.</p> European Union <p>Unlike the United States, the EU has implemented a comprehensive regulatory framework affecting privacy coins. Implemented in July 2024, MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) requires Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to implement risk-based procedures for privacy coins. While not explicitly banning privacy coins, MiCA mandates transaction monitoring that contradicts privacy coin features.</p><p>Similarly, the implementation of the “travel rule” in October 2024 requires exchanges to collect and share sender/receiver information for transactions exceeding €1,000, directly conflicting with privacy coin functionality.</p><p>On the exchange side, many European crypto trading platforms have implemented tiered verification systems. Binance Europe, for instance, requires video verification for privacy coin trading above&nbsp;€1,000.</p> Asia-Pacific <p>In the Asian-Pacific region, countries like Japan have placed a ban on privacy coins. No licensed Japanese exchange currently offers privacy coins. After the Special Financial Transactions Information Act took effect in March 2021, all major Korean exchanges delisted privacy coins. The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) explicitly requested the removal of coins that “pose high money laundering risks.”</p><p>In Hong Kong, the SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) implemented a licensing regime for exchanges in June 2023 that effectively prohibits privacy coin trading through strict AML requirements.</p> The Privacy vs. Compliance Conundrum <p>We are already witnessing growing tension between regulatory compliance and privacy. On one hand, regulatory compliance emphasizes transparency and traceability, especially in areas like financial transactions. Privacy, on the other hand, prioritizes anonymity and control over personal information. Privacy, on the other hand, prioritizes anonymity and control over personal information. These goals can inherently clash.</p><p>However, the possibility of coexistence exists through the development and implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies that allow for selective disclosure of information, balancing transparency with anonymity. A risk-based regulatory approach, focusing on high-risk activities rather than blanket surveillance, can also minimize privacy intrusions.</p><p>Privacy-centric projects like PIVX excel in this regard by giving users the option to turn on&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Clear legal frameworks that define the boundaries of both regulatory compliance and privacy are also essential to establish a balance. Ultimately, the successful coexistence of regulatory compliance and privacy will depend on ongoing dialogue, technological innovation, and the development of legal frameworks that adapt to the evolving digital landscape.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>In the digital networked age, people’s attention often overlooks local problems in favour of global ones, which don’t necessarily impact them in their daily lives, or over which they don’t have a say due to the skewed Pareto distribution of power in modern day societies. Puja Ohlhaver, in her recent research paper ‘Community currencies’, proposes a dual-currency model that prices attention and influence in each community, with the ultimate goal of creating a Gaussian distribution of power, either locally, or globally through the dynamic interaction of multiple local communities. This model allows community members to stake their currency to earn non-transferable governance rights, creating a substrate for decentralised societal coordination that favours social innovation.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Puja’s background  Web3 research  ‘Community currencies’  Pareto vs. Gaussian distributions  Global vs. local power distributions  The community currencies model  Meritocracy vs. influence  Quadratic funding  Governance, bribery and the crisis of legitimacy  Experimenting with community currencies  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/pujaohlhaver">Puja Ohlhaver on X</a>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5136037">'Community Currencies' Research Paper</a>  <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">'Decentralized Society' Research Paper</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

  Last year we launched Brave Search Ads in multiple countries. Today we share an update and upcoming plans for expansion.

<!-- todo: use sanitize or simplify or whitelist

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Last year we launched Brave Search Ads in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Today we share an update on our rapidly growing advertising business on Brave’s independent and privacy-preserving search engine, and preview our plans for expansion in the coming year.</p>
<p>From January to December of 2024, Brave grew search advertising clicks by 15x alongside organic search query growth of 80% (656 million in January to 1.19 billion in December). This initial customer success is the result of targeting the top 1% of paid search advertisers in our primary target regions. These are brands that are hitting the limit of efficiency with Google Ads, and who see Brave Search as a means to unlock additional reach. In most cases, the added conversion volume is in line with Brave’s market share in the region, but in some cases brands see as high as 5% growth on total paid search spend while maintaining their target rate for return on ad spend (ROAS).</p>
<p>Today, over half of the top 20 largest paid search advertisers worldwide are customers of Brave Search Ads, including Amazon Ads Sponsored Products, B&amp;H Photo, Booking.com, CompareCredit, Nerdwallet, Stubhub, and Wayfair. Partnering with these leaders in paid search has been of tremendous value to the development of Brave Search Ads. With their help, we’re discovering new ways to achieve scale and improve the effectiveness of our advertising platform.</p>
<p>Our customers have been overwhelmingly supportive of our entry into the paid search market. Brands unanimously agree there should be more competition. At 90% of market share, Google wields pricing power that their customers have no choice but to accept. Our customers know that by buying on Brave Search, they are contributing directly to the development of a more competitive and fair search advertising market, and reaching engaged users and tech early-adopters who value privacy and independence. Importantly, first-movers on Brave Search Ads have benefited from category exclusivity in what is otherwise a highly saturated market, giving them an edge over competitors who exclusively buy Google Ads.</p>
<p>Overall, Brave Search advertisers are extremely satisfied with their experience; 9 out of 10 customers who started Brave Search Ads campaigns in 2024 have continued to advertise in consecutive months.&nbsp;</p>

 What’s driving success at Brave 
<p>The two key forces behind our success in 2024 were the continued growth of the Brave browser (where in most regions Brave Search is the default), and the effectiveness of search engine advertising for all kinds of businesses.</p>
<p>Brave browser and Brave Search are growing at a sustained pace each month. In January, the Brave browser counted 80 million active users worldwide, and 1.29 billion Brave Search queries. The latest numbers are <a href="https://x.com/BrendanEich/status/1886617512353390979">shared regularly to the public by our CEO Brendan Eich</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search advertising is a well-established market where ads help users find products they show clear intent for with their search keywords. Advertisers on Brave Search are seeing available keyword volume passively increase each month, with conversion rates remaining steady at 100, 1,000 or 10,000 monthly clicks. Brave Search has achieved a predictable and gradually-growing stream of new Web traffic, and thus conversion volume for advertisers. For the first time since Bing, there’s an independent search engine with high-quality search results that convert customers as well as or better than Google Ads.</p>
<p>While the formula itself is simple—a growing search engine plus good ads equals more advertisers—Brave Search didn’t appear overnight. The project began nearly two decades ago <a>with Cliqz, which became Brave Search</a> with a 2021 acquisition, and that tremendous effort is now bearing fruit. We’re very optimistic for the future given Brave Search’s global growth as well as its new features that make it hugely popular with users, such as <a>Answer with AI</a>, the answer engine with an integrated chatbot, and <a>ReRank</a>, which enables users to customize their search rankings.</p>

 About Brave and Search Ads 
<p>Brave builds a suite of tools—starting with the Brave browser and Brave Search—that give people better choices online with leading privacy and security protections, independence from Big Tech, tools to reduce distractions, and access to innovative features like generative AI.</p>
<p>Search Ads are sponsored results on the Brave Search results page. They are currently available to select advertisers in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, and Germany. To learn more and inquire about advertising on Brave Search, visit <a>brave.com/brave-ads/search</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:adsales@brave.com">adsales@brave.com</a>.</p>

 通过迁移到Base,Horizen立即与高度活跃的DeFi和dApp生态系统连接,为$ZEN提供了更大的实用性和可访问性。    <p>该提案的目的是增强Horizen的Base设施,采用潜力和生态系统范围,同时保持其隐私和零知识（ZK）创新重点，迁移到Base的主要好处包括:</p>  <p>前所未有的可扩展性和低费用</p>  Base利用了Optimism的OP Stack,并计划将交易速度缩减到1秒以下的最终结果,而成本低于1美分—是ZK驱动的应用程序的理想选择，    <p>开发人员成长与CoinBase支持</p>  Base提供了蓬勃发展的开发人员社区,丰富的流动性和强大的营销支持,使Horizen具有竞争优势。    <p>机构级安全与信任</p>  作为Coinbase支持的网络,Base增强了ZEN的机构信誉,巩固了其在Grayscale和Coinbase生态系统中的地位,并保持了$ZEN持有人的合规优势。    <p>未来证明和更大的网络效应</p>  预计2025年将有100个+应用在Base上使用,Horizen可以早期采用,更深的流动性和更大的互操作性。    <p>在可扩展的生态系统中增强隐私</p>  Horizen将可扩展性与先进的隐私创新相结合,将保护隐私的技术带入了Superchain。    <p>优化的ZK集成</p>  Base灵活的模块化架构使Horizen可以利用现有的汇总Base架构,同时专注于ZK创新的开拓性。    <p>跨链互操作性</p>  Base强大的桥接功能可促进与其他L2和L1的互操作性,从而扩展了$ZEN的范围和可组合性。    <p>成本效率</p>  与维护独立的基于基板的链相比,Base已建立的Base架构降低了开发成本。      为什么要搬到Base-为什么现在呢？ <p>迁移到Base的建议不仅是技术上的转变,而且是使ZEN的采用,实用性和长期价值最大化的战略举措，</p><p>一年前,此举是不可能的-但今天,区块链景观发生了重大变化:</p>  <p>Base已发展成为一个繁荣的生态系统,超过了TVL和开发人员参与度的主要竞争对手，</p>  <p>第3层解决方案已成为改变游戏规则的缩放模型,可实现超低成本交易和更大的灵活性，</p>  <p>Horizen Labs在L2 / L3生态系统方面获得了第一手经验,有助于将Base确定为Horizen未来的最佳选择，</p>  <p>通过迁移到Base,Horizen可以与Coinbase支持的快速扩展的网络保持一致,同时保留其利用零知识证明实现可信赖的数字未来的愿景。</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  最终思想:视野的确定时刻 <p>此举的目的是巩固Horizen在隐私和可伸缩性方面的领导地位,确保我们保持竞争力,创新性并深入以太坊生态系统。</p><p>Horizen一直致力于为未来建设,这一过渡标志着朝着实现我们的使命迈出大胆而必要的一步。</p><p>保持联系并加入对话:</p>  <p><a

 <p>这种向Base的转变是否会影响Grayscale提供的Horizen $HZEN信托？</p><p>没有，Grayscale已经将Coinbase Custody用于资产存储,与Horizen迁移到Coinbase支持的生态系统Base非常吻合，这一战略转变进一步巩固了ZEN的机构地位,并增强了其在更广泛的Coinbase和Grayscale网络中的知名度，</p>  <p>ZEN Holders&amp;Tokenomics呢？</p><p>本附录仅侧重于评估向&nbsp;Base是Horizen的最佳部署环境&nbsp;并且不包括其范围内的代币更改，但是,必须强调&nbsp;ZEN的固定2100万供应量将保持不变，</p><p>尽管细节仍在最后确定中,但主要考虑因素包括:</p>  <p>激励:&nbsp;与以前的Base设施相关的代币学组件可以进行调整,以优化激励措施并增强实用性,采用性和长期价值，</p>  <p>无缝迁移:&nbsp;现有的ZEN余额将无缝迁移到新的L3结构,从而确保用户的连续性，</p>  <p>交流协调:&nbsp;我们正在与主要交易所（例如Binance,Coinbase）紧密合作,以确保平稳过渡，</p><p>此过渡旨在将Horizen更深入地整合到Base和Optimism中,并利用其生态系统来扩展可访问性和采用性，</p>    <p>这会影响Horizen 2.0路线图和时间表吗？</p><p>尽管我们预计可能会加速,但很快就会提供详细的时间表以确保透明度，</p>  <p>Horizen还会专注于隐私吗？</p><p>是，Horizen致力于启用隐私优先应用程序的承诺保持不变，Horizen在ZKP和隐私保护技术方面的专业知识将成为其在Base生态系统中差异化的核心部分，</p>  <p>为什么Horizen现在采取这一行动？</p><p>Horizen一直将可扩展性,隐私和长期可持续性放在首位,而现在过渡的决定是由技术准备,生态系统成熟度和战略时机共同驱动的，</p><p>此前,第3层（L3)生态系统仍在形成,关键Base设施,最佳实践和工具仍在构建中，现在,随着OP Stack和Base变得更加强大,L3Base架构得到了改进,集成途径更加清晰,确保Horizen可以有效地进行此过渡的时机恰到好处，此外,更广泛的以太坊和乐观主义生态系统已经达到成熟水平,采用和流动性可以更好地支持新的L3,从而降低早期风险，</p><p>通过现在移动,Horizen有机会成为&nbsp;已建立项目中的先行者,利用新兴但快速扩展的生态系统,同时确保无缝且得到良好支持的过渡，</p>  <p>此举将如何影响$ZEN流动性？</p><p>集成到Base中可以使ZEN更接近高度流动的生态系统,从而使用户和开发人员更容易访问和贸易，Base与Coinbase的紧密联系提高了知名度,并增加了进行更深入的交换整合和机构支持的可能性，</p>  <p>Horizen还会支持EVM和Solidity智能合同吗？</p><p>是！移至Base可确保完全的EVM兼容性,从而使现有开发人员可以更轻松地在Horizen上进行部署,而无需学习新框架，</p>  <p>Base的体系结构如何使Horizen开发人员受益？</p><p>Base的体系结构为Horizen开发人员提供了强大,可扩展且对开发人员友好的Base,从而可以更快地部署,降低成本并访问不断发展的工具和Base架构生态系统，</p><p>Horizen开发人员的主要好处:</p>  <p>降低开发开销:&nbsp;Base建立在OP Stack上,提供了BaseBase架构,从而降低了启动和维护L3的复杂性，开发人员可以利用现有的工具,SDK和框架,而无需从头开始构建自定义解决方案，</p>  <p>可扩展性和成本效益:&nbsp;Base的体系结构可实现高吞吐量和低交易成本,非常适合需要频繁交易的应用程序,例如DeFi,游戏和隐私保护技术，</p>  <p>访问与Coinbase连接的Base架构:&nbsp;Base与开发人员工具,法定设备和安全增强功能进行了深度集成,使构建者可以利用简化用户入职和增长的资源，</p>  <p>未来证明的生态系统:&nbsp;随着Base的不断发展,Horizen开发人员将从正在进行的Base架构改进,安全升级以及整个生态系统对缩放解决方案的支持中受益，</p>  <p>通过在Base上建造,Horizen&nbsp;开发人员可以专注于创新而不是Base架构,加速创建可扩展的,保护隐私的应用程序,同时确保与以太坊不断发展的生态系统长期保持一致，</p>  <p>Horizen EON上现有的dApp和合同会怎样？</p><p>我们正在评估最佳技术方法,我们的初步评估表明,可能需要在Base appchain上重新部署Horizen EON上的现有dApps和智能合同，虽然可能需要进行一些调整,&nbsp;这一转变为开发人员提供了宝贵的机会,使他们可以访问Base的更广泛生态系统,更深的流动性和更低的交易成本,增强可扩展性并采用其应用程序，</p><p>为了支持这一过程,我们将提供明确的指导和帮助,包括技术资源和迁移支持,以确保平稳过渡，此举使Horizen社区在增长最快的区块链生态系统之一中蓬勃发展,为dApp和开发人员释放新的机会。</p>  <p>移至Base是否意味着Horizen放弃了权力下放？</p><p>没有，Horizen致力于分散化,同时利用Base来实现可扩展性和可访问性，Base本身建立在遵循以太坊权力下放原则的OP Stack之上,随着时间的流逝,Base的治理和Base设施有望进一步分散，</p><p>此外,Horizen将通过社区治理和对分散式隐私保护技术的持续研究,继续促进权力下放，</p>  <p>为什么要基于Base和OP Stack而不是其他新兴技术？</p><p>Base和OP Stack由于其强大的开发人员生态系统,可扩展性以及与以太坊安全模型的集成而成为主要的L2 / L3Base架构选择，</p><p>Horizen与蓬勃发展的,得到良好支持的技术堆栈保持一致,以确保长期的可持续性,互操作性和持续的创新，此外,Base在Coinbase的大力支持下提供了长期的信誉以及对生态系统增长的明确承诺，</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Taylor Hornby and Ted Hoffmann have joined the Zcash Foundation board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taylor and Ted’s considerable expertise, along with their perspective as community members will enhance the Foundation’s ability to better support and serve the Zcash community.</p>



<p><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/earthrise-for-the-zf-board/49274">Taylor Hornby</a> (earthrise on the Forum) brings extensive experience to the Zcash ecosystem, having worked at the Electric Coin Company (ECC) during Zcash’s pre-launch, later returning to ECC in 2018 as a security engineer, before leaving in 2022 and becoming the Zcash Ecosystem Security Lead through 2023. His stated focus is aligning engineering efforts with product improvements and adoption, fostering unity among community leaders through constructive dialogue, and promoting a culture of collaboration and accountability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/boggerster-for-the-zf-board/49271">Ted Hoffmann</a> (boggerster on the Forum) is a European citizen fluent in French, German, and English, with nearly a decade of experience in cryptocurrency. He’s particularly passionate about Ethereum and Zcash, valuing open finance and permissionless financial privacy as essential safeguards against authoritarian financial controls. He believes Zcash’s privacy features are critical for fostering a democratic society. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Cosmos, Bitcoin, and Zcash, Ted advocates for a community-first approach to advancing Zcash, prioritizing effective communication, streamlined technology, robust onboarding, and a transition to proof-of-stake (PoS).</p>



<p>Taylor and Ted’s arrival coincides with the departure of Peter Van Valkenburgh and Amber Baldet from the board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter has been a remarkable board member and visionary. Over the past eight years, his steadfast dedication has been instrumental in shaping the Foundation into what it is today. From boldly advocating for the Foundation’s unique charitable mission to ensuring that our new trademark policy supports greater decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, he has set a high standard for our mission of building financial privacy infrastructure for the public good. His commitment to privacy, decentralization, and open-source innovation has left an indelible mark on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As he settles into his new role as Executive Director at Coin Center, we thank him for many years of service and wish him continued success in defending the rights of developers and advancing privacy for all.</p>



<p>Amber’s involvement in Zcash dates back to her time at JP Morgan, where she was responsible for establishing a partnership with the Electric Coin Company that triggered a huge amount of interest in Zcash’s technology. She was one of the first ZF board members appointed based on the community’s feedback, and she has been steadfast in ensuring that the Foundation stays focused on its mission. Her experience in technology leadership roles, and as a startup co-founder and CEO, has been invaluable to the Board and to me personally, often bringing a much-needed dose of reality to our discussions. Her presence on the board will be sorely missed but she will continue to serve the Zcash community and mission as a founding member of the Financial Privacy Foundation’s board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On behalf of the board, the Zcash Foundation team, and the entire Zcash community, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to Peter and Amber for helping guide me through the past four years, and for their vision, dedication, and lasting impact on the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>— Jack Gavigan, Executive Director</p>

<p>Welcome to the Empeiria’s first development update of 2025! We're kicking off the year with our mainnet launch around the corner, technical updates and ecosystem advancements to set the stage for a transformative year for the Empeiria ecosystem!</p>Intelligent Digital Product&nbsp;Passport 1. iDPP: Intelligent Digital Product&nbsp;Passport <p>As featured by the World Economic Forum, Empeiria has been selected for the TradeTech Regulatory Sandbox. This initiative, launched by the World Economic Forum in partnership with the Ministry of Economy, UAE (MoE) and Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED), aims to drive regulatory innovation in cross-border digital&nbsp;trade.</p>  TradeTech Regulatory Sandbox: <a href="https://www.tradetechglobal.org/sandbox">https://www.tradetechglobal.org/sandbox</a>    WEF Linkedin Announcement: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum-trade_tradetech-global-tradetech-forum-activity-7288556517350363137-V2rd">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/world-economic-forum-trade_tradetech-global-tradetech-forum-activity-7288556517350363137-V2rd</a>  <p>As part of a pilot for the World Economic Forum we’ve developed a new product based on Empeiria’s infrastructure — iDPP, a Verifiable Credential-based system for product authentication.</p> What is&nbsp;iDPP? <p>A next-gen product designed for a framework of trust to verify the authenticity, origin and compliance — without compromising privacy.</p><p>Key Features</p>  Decentralized &amp; Verifiable — Uses blockchain-backed credentials instead of self-reported data.  Cost-Efficient &amp; Scalable — Off-chain storage (IPFS) minimizes blockchain fees.  AI &amp; Blockchain Integration — Automates trust-based interactions, making verification seamless.  <p>Why does it&nbsp;Matter?</p><p>In an age of deepfakes, counterfeiting, and opaque supply chains, verifiable data is the missing trust layer. iDPP ensures manufacturers, regulators, and consumers can verify products instantly.</p> 2. Mainnet Launch&nbsp;Progress <p>Mainnet is in its final stage of development, with key optimizations ensuring security, performance, and scalability.</p> Key Technical Milestones <p>✅ 400% Efficiency Boost<br>The document update process is now faster and more scalable — A major DID module refactor improves storage compression &amp; processing speed.</p><p>✅ Expanded Simulation Testing<br>We’ve expanded our simulation tests to catch rare edge cases and unexpected interactions to catch edge cases before they happen, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p><p>✅ SoftNodes — A New Mechanism for Long-Term Participants<br>A feature designed for those who want to stake and validate over the long run. Users can easily manage staking, select validators, receive rewards, and monitor their node activities.</p><p>✅ Network &amp; Automation Preparations<br>We’re actively configuring servers and automation scripts for the mainnet launch to ensure network stability ahead of&nbsp;launch.</p><p>✅ Comprehensive Developer Docs<br>We’ve completed an extensive documentation set, covering standard blockchain interactions and our custom features. Developers and users can quickly understand the chain’s capabilities and operational guidelines</p> 3. Additional Development Updates  OneClick Deployment Portal <p>We continue to refine the OneClick Deployment Portal, which recently went live. Our focus is on optimizations and security reviews to ensure safer and more straightforward deployments across the ecosystem. Given our role as a trust layer, these audits help us maintain top-tier reliability standards.</p> AI Agent Integration &amp; Use&nbsp;Cases <p>We’re building tools where an AI agent interacts with users and leverages verifiable credentials. For example, an AI agent can conduct user assessments, issuing credential-based certifications for those who meet certain criteria — ideal for exams, training, or automated skills verification. Another application involves AI-based credential verification, where an AI system validates credentials such as employment records or certificates — useful in job interviews or background checks.</p> Telegram Game&nbsp;Updates <p>We continue expanding our Telegram-based game (gEMPE) with new missions, improved gameplay, and additional features. The goal is to keep the experience engaging and fresh for our community while rewarding users for participation.</p> Summary <p>Thank you for being part of our journey! 2025 has already seen a flurry of innovation: from the iDPP rollout to wrapping up preparations for our mainnet launch. We’re committed to delivering impactful solutions for decentralized data and digital identity.</p><p>We look forward to an exciting year of growth, collaboration, and pioneering new possibilities in verifiable data and blockchain technology!

 ShadeX — Cosmos Encrypted Money&nbsp;Market <p>The Cosmos is going through ATOM realignment, the process of protocols prioritizing ATOM and its community as a critical asset to achieving collective success.</p><p>Shade as an encrypted DeFi suite, rapidly embraced ATOM alignment by accruing and liquidity-providing ATOM and stATOM on ShadeSwap. Shade currently holds ~16,000 ATOM in its treasury.</p><p>Beyond just accruing ATOM, Shade is launching ShadeX — the world’s first encrypted money market. Users are empowered to lend out their crypto assets, passively earning interest fees and yield from users who borrow their assets from a lending pool. The ShadeX money market maintains solvency via a system of liquidations of collateral from insolvent borrowers, returning the borrowed debt back to&nbsp;lenders.</p><p>ShadeX will feature ATOM and stATOM as both lendable and borrowable assets. Additionally, ATOM and stATOM will be usable as collateral on ShadeX to borrow other popular assets (i.e. BTC, ETH, USDC, SILK,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>Historically, money markets throughout crypto expose all lending and borrowing data.

  Partnering with OpenEvidence: A Life-Saving Healthcare Revolution  <p>This AI-powered search engine for doctors could be one of the most important companies of the next decade.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/pat-grady/">Pat Grady</a>	 



Published February 19, 2025
  



OpenEvidence co-founder Daniel Nadler.



 
<p>Choosing the right medicine for a prostate cancer patient, based on the latest efficacy research. Accessing expert guidance in a rural area, where sub-specialists are scarce. Uncovering overlooked studies in a review of OCD treatments. Identifying the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism before it’s too late.</p>



<p>These are just a few of the millions of ways more than a quarter of U.S. doctors have used the specialized medical search engine <a href="https://www.openevidence.com/">OpenEvidence</a> in the roughly one year since it launched. Already, the scale of its impact is a prime example of AI as a force for good. But if co-founders Daniel Nadler and Zachary Ziegler and their team achieve what we believe they can, the lives they help save could soon be measured in the millions.</p>



<p>This transformative technology comes as the U.S. healthcare system reaches a breaking point. With just one million active physicians for a growing—and aging—population of 340 million, doctors are stretched thin. On top of clinical work, they spend countless hours sifting through journals, to ensure their life-and-death decisions are based on the latest research. But a new PubMed article is published every <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266638992400076X#:~:text=Over%201.5%20million%20scientific%20articles,the%20PubMed%20database%20every%20year.">three minutes</a>, and medical knowledge doubles every <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3116346/#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20the,0.2%20years%E2%80%94just%2073%20days.">73 days</a>. It is impossible to keep up.</p>



<p>Like a ChatGPT for doctors, OpenEvidence automates this information hunt. The platform searches across 35 million peer-reviewed publications—and, thanks to a new content partnership, is trained on The New England Journal of Medicine. There are no hallucinations; if the literature is inconclusive, OpenEvidence simply doesn’t respond. And it communicates just like healthcare professionals do—conversationally, and complete with medical charts and graphs.</p>



<p>A second-time founder, Daniel was already well ahead of the AI curve when he launched the financial technology platform Kensho, which was acquired by S&amp;P in 2018 and is credited with the company’s AI evolution. When COVID-19 hit, he couldn’t stop thinking about applying what he’d learned to healthcare. So he founded OpenEvidence with a mission to organize the world’s medical knowledge—and help physicians quickly surface the latest and most effective treatments for their patients. Daniel has proven to be a magnet for talent, attracting top AI researchers to the OpenEvidence team—including Zachary, a brilliant computer scientist from Harvard—and assembling a world-class medical board to ensure the platform gives physicians exactly what they need.</p>



<p>The response has been remarkable: in less than a year, OpenEvidence became perhaps the fastest-growing healthcare business in history, with more than 35,000 verified doctors registering each month. Aside from the iPhone, we believe no technology has been adopted by doctors so quickly. Even more remarkable is that it all happened via word of mouth; the engine of OpenEvidence’s growth is trust. And because the app is free to every doctor in every U.S. care center, it’s assisting not just doctors in top hospitals, but also small, independent practices in hard-to-reach communities across the country.</p>



<p>Sequoia is proud to lead the Series A for OpenEvidence and partner as their first institutional investor, and we look forward to supporting them as they continue to grow. The work Daniel, Zachary and their team are doing has the potential to create one of the defining companies of the next decade—and to revolutionize medicine for doctors and their patients alike.</p>

        How a life of shredding down mountainsides at unruly speeds put Roman Hölzl on a path to start one of Europe’s most promising robotics companies.

<p>Tilman Tschoeke’s first day at RobCo was in the spring of 2022. The small-scale industrial robotics company was still tiny, with just 25 employees in their Munich office. It was a challenging time for European startups—the characteristic precarity of early-stage entrepreneurship was exacerbated by rising interest rates and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Companies were counting every euro carefully.</p>



<p>RobCo’s 28-year-old cofounder Roman Hölzl gave Tschoeke a laptop, informing his new head of finance that he’d have to bring his own charger. A few days into the job, Tschoeke was given access to the company’s bank account as he prepared to issue salary payments. At first glance, the numbers he saw there made no sense. He asked Hölzl if he could give him access to the second bank account, to which Hölzl replied, “Oh, there is no second account.” Tschoeke’s stomach sank. He could only choose to trust Hölzl’s seeming unflappability, which proved to be a sound judgement call when a well-timed payment from the company’s seed round arrived days later.</p>



<p>Tschoeke was beginning to appreciate that flirting with the boundaries of sensible and possible was just another weekday for Hölzl. It wouldn’t take long working with him before Tschoeke, like so many others who know the young CEO, came to understand that Hölzl views the world as a series of obstacles to surmount, odds to overcome and races to win. It’s a trait that has defined Hölzl’s triumphs. In the most immediate, physical sense, it has also led him to the edge of disaster.</p>



 



<p>Hölzl comes from a long line of competitive skiers. His paternal grandfather was a skier, having picked it up during an apprenticeship in post-World War II Switzerland. He eventually settled in Munich and ran a small butcher shop—exhausting manual labor that reliably put food on the table even during times of scarcity. Their three sons eventually took up teaching skiing to pay their way through school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When they weren’t skiing, both of Hölzl’s parents ran a small car dealership in Neuburg an der Donau, a calendar-pretty Bavarian town an hour north of Munich. In the winter, they would drive their sons, Roman and Florian, the three hours to the alps. By the time Roman was a teen, he was an instructor himself—a family vocation that Florian now sees as surprisingly apt preparation for his big brother’s work as a founder. It required keeping a cohort (of kids, usually) motivated to brave any sort of dreadful weather or scary terrain. Roman had to present himself as fearless to instill confidence in those who counted on him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Hölzl brothers built their nerve by throwing themselves, often literally, into sports—tennis, swimming, trampolining, skateboarding, whatever. Roman was a stronger skier and more intense competitor than his younger brother, a trait Florian believes grew out of Roman’s obsession for optimizing his performance. Skiing, a sport where the smallest mistake can turn into a personal disaster, became Roman’s prime testing ground for visualizing a plan, experimenting at top speed, and applying learnings to future runs.</p>



<p>Most German school days ended at lunchtime. After school, when they lacked the hours necessary to drive to the slopes, they would scour the internet to find videos of new tricks, refine them on their trampoline, and then later experiment on the mountain. In the snowless summer they would lay down wooden pallets covered with fake grass near their home and lather soap on the pipe of a bicycle rack so they could slide on a rail.</p>



<p>By Roman’s mid-teens he was jumping, freestyling and competing constantly against the best skiers in Europe. “We did these 70-foot jumps—that’s double flips, three-and-a-half rotations, corkscrews,” he said. “Basically rotations out of your natural axes and back into it.” He was strong enough that he earned sponsorships from two French companies and was winning competitions with titles such as King of Shred. Well into secondary school, Germany’s education system still allowed him to manage his time as he saw fit. He would show up to class mainly just to take exams, while skiing close to a hundred days a year. His enviable LinkedIn summary of this professional period of his life reads, in part: “Backflips, deep snow, and great times!”</p>



<p>His grades were adequate but certainly not fantastic, and in the winter of 2012, his father challenged his then 18-year-old son to get better marks. If he could, they’d take a ski trip to Canada. Hölzl accepted and got the grades. The day before they were set to depart on their trip, they went skiing. That was when Hölzl took the worst fall of his life and suffered a compression fracture in two spots in his lower back.</p>



<p>He spent a night immobilized in the hospital in an awkward position that made his feet fall asleep. As he lay awake, he contemplated what his life would be if this was, in fact, paralysis. Years later, in hard moments with his startup, he would reflect on that long, numb night.</p>



<p>“If things go south at RobCo, I’m benchmarking against that,” Hölzl says, “which puts everything so much into perspective that company-building becomes a bit of a different beast. It will never be as bad as it was that night in March 2012.”</p>



<p>That next morning, imaging showed that his spinal nerves were fine; he would recover. His family moved his bed upstairs from the basement to the living room. There, as he convalesced, Hölzl had to remain still, really for the first time in his life. He had a lot of time to consider a future in which he might not ever be able to ski. “Having an injury where maybe there’s not going to be a next time,” his brother says, “it’s terrifying. But maybe for Roman, it was necessary to learn patience.”</p>
 



Hölzl on the slopes in Hochzillertal and Kitzbühel, Austria



 
<p>After his injury, Hölzl spent weeks wearing a stabilizing exoskeleton to hold his spine in place. He spent the next season easing back onto the slopes but was far from competing. So what did he do with the other 80-or-so days that he otherwise would’ve been skiing? “That’s when I first started pouring energy into uni,” Hölzl said.</p>



<p>Over the course of the next few semesters, he went from the bottom 25% of his class to the top 3%. School was the new arena where he sized up the competition and was determined to come out on top. “You want to have that same feeling,” he says, “even if it’s an engineering event.”</p>



<p>For as long as he could remember, Hölzl was fascinated by the way his skis, boots and bindings enabled him to do things like launch himself down a mountain at explosive speeds and jump vast distances. “What I always found the most interesting was the intersection of humans and technology,” Hölzl said. “In skiing I witnessed how great it can be if things work out well with you and your technology. But also if it doesn’t go well, with a big crash.” Keen to explore that intersection, Hölzl pursued human factors engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2016 he enrolled at the Technical University of Munich, one of Europe’s best engineering universities. During those studies, he also completed a research fellowship at Harvard. His research tended to focus more on user experience—in robotics and autonomous driving—than on back-end engineering.</p>



<p>He met Constantin Dresel and Paul Maroldt when he began a Ph.D. program back at the Technical University of Munich in 2019. Together they ran a practical lab course in robotics and drilled into what they saw as the promise of modular robotics: developing industrial robots that were nimble, safe and able to be reconfigured quickly, thus opening a potentially huge market of smaller manufacturers that historically hadn’t been able to afford to automate manual tasks. The three men were able to plug into Munich’s hub of industry, taking advantage of weekly feedback from advisor companies and deploying prototypes, which gave them practical testing opportunities that validated their otherwise abstract mathematical work.</p>



<p>When the trio launched RobCo in 2020, it was a seamless move into commercializing the work they’d already been doing in the lab. From their time immersed with industry leaders, they understood that manufacturers were fretting over labor shortages that only promised to worsen in the coming years. RobCo aimed to create a robot capable of alleviating that labor shortage and drastically increasing productivity. Picture a programmable arm, perhaps about the size of a human arm or larger, that can do fine, complex manual tasks on repeat ad infinitum.</p>



<p>Two weeks after they claimed the name, they learned that the hit video game Fallout contains a multibillion-dollar robotics company called RobCo. Hölzl just thought it was short, easy and punchy. Now their YouTube videos are peppered with appreciative fan comments—“Ay when y’all releasing zeta invaders”—which gives the cofounders occasion to smile, to think how their startup is blurring the lines with science fiction.</p>
 







 
<p>The early-stage “kind of garage-style” company that Tilman Tschoeke took a chance on in 2022 was powered in large part by Hölzl’s sheer zeal. Hölzl’s fire impressed Tschoeke. “That’s clearly one of his key character traits—he’s very competitive, in a positive sense,” Tschoeke says.</p>



<p>Today, Hölzl’s typical pitch to potential clients begins, he says, with them pitching him. Companies want to know: Can you really do this? Can you install a robot that can laser-cut aluminum bicycle parts, for instance, or pack hearing aids and stack the boxes onto pallets? So RobCo’s opener is simple enough. You’re having trouble finding people. It’s only going to get worse. Let us automate some basic tasks for you. Hire our robots.</p>



<p>Roughly 70% of their customers had never used physical automation before. But all of a sudden the 150-year-old manufacturer de Crignis had RobCo arms molding sheet metal into cladding for machines, and Frank Präzisionsteile, a company that manufactures parts for aerospace and medical devices, had RobCo arms filling the overnight shifts no human workers wanted. And on and on.</p>



<p>RobCo’s modular arms are small enough that they don’t need to be bolted to factory floors. They can be up and running in a matter of a couple of days rather than weeks. “Many of those companies are really just lacking those people,” Hölzl said. “And we’ll see the labor time bomb basically ticking faster and faster in Germany between 2025 to 2028. That’s when the most people will go on pension ever in the history of the country.”</p>



<p>A RobCo robot costs a customer between 2,000 and 4,000 euros per month, or about a third of the cost of the two shift workers its labor can replicate. The size, speed and scale of their robots are what Hölzl calls, in a manner befitting a former elite athlete, “superhuman, but only a little bit.” The RobCo arms can move something that weighs 40 kilograms a few thousand times a day. Greater weights and distances require much more robust robots, the sort that larger factories have used for decades. RobCo has carved its niche in taking over discrete, standalone tasks that would usually require a human operator.</p>



<p>As for the humans building these machines, Hölzl and his cofounders have complementary strengths. In the early days, Dresel focused on the back-end software (the founders built their platform on C++, running on Linux). Maroldt was the hardware guy, the prototyper. Hölzl focused on user interfaces, designing them to be as seamless as possible.</p>



<p>“The best user interface is one that doesn’t exist, in a sense,” Hölzl said. “The key really is, which parts of the overall teaching of the user interface can you just abstract away?” For example: Their perception mechanism is so refined that a user can indicate to the robot a pickup point and a dropoff point for a part, and the robot can detect the rest—what the parts are, how to find and grab them, and how to place them where they need to go. Hölzl says that such a process would have previously required a programmer to feed the machine 50 separate instructions.</p>



<p>Sequoia came across RobCo in 2022 when a scout forwarded Luciana Lixandru the company’s deck. The premise was, essentially, “UiPath for the real world.” Lixandru, who had led the Series A for UiPath—a Romanian company that automates digital tasks, and which is now worth nearly $8 billion—latched onto the thesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon meeting Hölzl, she knew he was a special founder: Hölzl’s switch from elite skiing to academic performance was unconventional but promising. “He’s honestly amazing,” she says. “He’s very articulate, very high IQ, very ambitious, very competitive. At Sequoia, all our partners are really competitive. You put him at that table and he still might be the most competitive person there.” Lixandru recalls putting Hölzl in touch with a colleague of hers, a fellow German, and the two eventually met up. The colleague later reported back that they’d taken a nice Sunday bike ride. “And then, when I talked to Roman,” Lixandru says, “he was like ‘We had a biking race.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hölzl was surprised when he first heard from Sequoia; he thought RobCo, as a robotics firm, wouldn’t appeal to venture capitalists who tend to back software companies. The great drawback of robotics is that unlike software, robots are made of stuff. “With software, you build one product and you sell it a million times,” Lixandru said. “Here you have to rebuild every single product that you build and then go deploy it. And you have to do this in a smooth, capital-efficient way.” Eventually the goal is to expand across the globe—the U.S. market remains the ultimate prize—but scaling robotics is an even greater feat than scaling software. Every unit has to be built, shipped, installed and monitored. Sequoia is betting that Germany, a hub of mid-sized engineering and manufacturing companies, is the right place to start scaling.</p>



<p>In one sense, RobCo keeps pushing so fast by doing the least. Rather than dabble in theoretical solutions, the company builds only the specific features its clients ask for and need. Tschoeke says that his CEO has the charisma to sell and to communicate a vision, as well as the technical background to resolve customers’ engineering concerns. “He’s very to the point,” Tschoeke says of Hölzl. “Whatever the question is, he has answers. And I think that’s his biggest strength.”</p>



<p>RobCo is now approaching 100 employees, supplying small- and mid-sized manufacturers in Germany with its robotic arms. The company is filling a market niche that Hölzl believes may include tens of thousands of companies. As RobCo reaches more customers, it’s also gathering data with a long-term aim of making robots that work even in unstructured use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In Germany we have a quote that means, basically, ‘Impossible is nothing,’” Tschoeke says. “From a technical perspective, when they say, ‘OK, no, we cannot do it in two quarters because typically it takes a year,’ we say, ‘OK, let’s do it in one quarter.’ And we’ve proved it many times. This comes strongly from Roman. He is always pushing that balance pretty strongly.”</p>



 



<p>Hölzl misses his skiing days. His life now is spent in the office six days a week obsessing over RobCo. Get him talking about skiing and you can hear the joy in his voice. From RobCo’s HQ in Munich, he’s a short drive from alpine skiing. But when he daydreams, it’s of western Canada or of Hokkaido. Japan, he says, has the greatest snow in the world.</p>



<p>He and Florian recently splurged on a first for them: skiing in the Caucasus Mountains. Florian traveled to Georgia from Germany; his brother arrived directly from a work trip abroad, feeling a little worse for wear amid all the travel. They headed to a tiny village where the next morning, a man wearing ski boots picked them up in a Ford Raptor pickup truck. He drove them to a clearing outside town where a helicopter flew them to 15,000 feet and they got a glimpse of Russia before they dropped into virgin mountainside powder.</p>



<p>Florian remembers it as a sublime day on the mountain. He also watched his brother closely. After a few runs, Hölzl was actually the one to beg off early. His schedule had caught up with him, and in a moment of uncharacteristic restraint, he decided not to push himself to the absolute brink.</p>



<p>They left the mountain with light still in the sky. After two days of rest—an eon for any founder to put everything on pause but an eternity for this one—he finally felt right. On the third day, Hölzl began to bang out emails and take calls. “He was hyped to work again,” Florian says, “because he had so many ideas.” Florian felt that he was witnessing an understanding dawn on his brother in real time: Not every race in Roman Hölzl’s life required a headlong sprint, it turns out. It took Hölzl a mere three decades on skis to learn that he, too, is only human—a realization that just might help sustain his human-augmenting robotics company for years to come.</p>

<p>Today, we have adopted a new trademark policy for the Zcash trademarks. You can read the full policy <a href="https://zfnd.org/trademark-policy/">here</a>.</p>



<p>In this blog post, we highlight some of the important changes, and explain why we believe this new approach supports and enables greater decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



 Background 



<p>For the past five years, use of the Zcash trademarks was governed by an <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zcash_Trademark_Donation_and_License_Agreement_20191106.pdf">agreement</a> between the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and the Electric Coin Company (ECC). Following ECC’s decision to terminate that agreement, ZF became the sole steward of the trademarks. This provided an opportunity to review and update the trademark policy to reflect the growing decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



<p>Our overarching objective in making these changes is to allow members of the Zcash community to use the trademarks as broadly and permissively as possible for purposes that are natural and well-intentioned in the context of a decentralized cryptocurrency, while still protecting the trademarks (and thus, Zcash’s name, brand and reputation) from misuse by those who seek to mislead, deceive or defraud.</p>



 Key Changes 



<p>At a high level, the changes introduced in this new trademark policy are aimed at making it:</p>



 
 Shorter and simpler: The most obvious change is that the new trademark policy is shorter and simpler. The old policy was adapted from the Model Trademark Guidelines, which are intended for open source software projects. By reviewing the policy from the perspective of Zcash as a cryptocurrency, we were able to make it shorter, simpler, and therefore easier to understand. 
 



<p></p>



 
 More permissive: The new policy is also more permissive. The old policy was drafted in a way that required that certain uses be explicitly licensed. While we sought to make it as simple as possible to license the trademark, it still required paperwork, which discouraged some people and teams.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 
 Minimized in scope: The new policy seeks to minimize the scope of uses that must be explicitly licensed. For example, the old policy permitted the use of the Zcash trademarks on promotional goods for free giveaways but not for sale. This meant that anyone who wanted to make and sell Zcash-branded merchandise was required to obtain a license from ZF. The new policy removes this restriction, meaning that anyone can now make and sell Zcash-branded merchandise, like stickers, t-shirts or mugs.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Eliminating the Trademark’s Role in Zcash Governance 



<p>The trademark agreement created a governance role for the trademarks by stipulating that network upgrades were subject to approval by both ECC and ZF. If either party objected to the activation of a network upgrade, the Zcash trademarks could no longer be applied to either fork of the blockchain.</p>



<p>The ZF Board believes that it is no longer appropriate to use the Zcash trademarks in this way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency, defined by a documented protocol, and implemented as open source software (most notably <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zcash?tab=readme-ov-file#the-zcashd-full-node">zcashd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/?tab=readme-ov-file#about">Zebra</a>). The nature of open source software means that anyone is free to copy and modify that software, including making modifications to the way the Zcash protocol is implemented. They may then invite others to run that software. If this were to occur without broad consensus support across the Zcash community and ecosystem, it could result in a contentious hard fork.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the event of a persistent contentious hard fork, in order to prevent user confusion, the Zcash Foundation may use the Zcash trademarks to call for specific naming conventions at exchanges or other entities to clearly distinguish between the two tines of the fork. However, the Zcash Foundation will endeavor to not use the Zcash trademarks as a means of persuading the larger public that one tine of the fork or the other is the canonical and only legitimate version of Zcash.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>As Zcash and its ecosystem evolves and become more decentralized, the structures that have built up to support Zcash must also evolve. The Zcash Foundation is committed to ensuring that it adapts to better serve the Zcash mission and community. That commitment includes supporting ongoing decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, and this new trademark policy is an important step in that direction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, we are keen to hear the community’s feedback and suggestions (both of which helped inform our decision-making on this policy), so please engage on the Zcash Community forums.</p>

<p>Zcash Foundation has developed this <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zcash-Foundation_Participatory-Grant-Making-for-Decentralized-Cryptocurrency-Ecosystems.pdf">discussion draft</a> and an AI-generated <a href="https://zfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zcash-Foundation_Participatory-Grantmaking-in-Decentralized-Cryptocurrency-Ecosystems.wav">audio companion</a> in order to empower our community as we collectively explore various future Participatory Grantmaking (PGM) models. Its purpose is to provide an overview of potential approaches without endorsing or advocating for any specific model. The inclusion of any particular funding model in this document should not be interpreted as an indication of support or preference by the Zcash Foundation.</p>



<p>Participatory Grantmaking (PGM) is a natural extension of Zcash’s commitment to decentralization and community governance. The exploration of PGM models for Zcash represents our collective commitment to transparent and inclusive decision-making. The PGM framework enables community members to actively participate in determining how resources are allocated, ensuring that funding decisions align with the collective vision of Zcash’s future.</p>



<p>By examining different models, we can work together to identify mechanisms that:</p>



 
 Preserve Zcash’s core principles of privacy and decentralization 



 Ensure equitable participation in funding decisions 



 Maintain transparency while protecting participant privacy and 



 Strengthen community engagement and ownership 
 



<p></p>



<p>We invite discussion on the Zcash community forum to facilitate <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/unlocking-the-future-of-zcash-through-participatory-grantmaking/50379">an open dialogue about potential PGM implementations</a>, knowing that the success of any chosen model will depend on active community participation and careful consideration about how it serves Zcash’s mission. The ultimate decisions rest with the Zcash community, determined through collaborative discourse and deliberation.</p>

  The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework  <p></p>   
	By Team Sequoia	 
  



 
<p>In <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/arc/">Arc</a>, our company building immersion for Sequoia’s pre-seed and seed-stage founders, we focus on the path to product-market fit. Using the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-framework/">Arc PMF Framework</a>, we describe three distinct PMF archetypes, depending on how customers view the problem your product solves. This new companion framework is about application: Once you understand the three archetypes and your company’s place in the world, what steps can you actually take day-to-day to pursue PMF, and how do you know you’re on the right track?</p>



 Answer the Four Terrifying Questions 



<p>Achieving durable product-market fit requires tackling four terrifying questions that should keep you up at night as you build your business. Each terrifying question has positive indicators that mitigate your fear and indicate you’re headed in the right direction, and a resolution that confirms you’re ready to tackle the next terrifying question. As you build conviction in your answers to the terrifying questions, you get closer to PMF.</p>
 







 
 



 How to Answer Each Question&nbsp; 



<p>The more overlap between your company and the market opportunity, the closer you get to resolving the terrifying question.</p>
 


 
	 
					 
				The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework			 
				
	 

			 
			 
				Your unique advantage			 
			 
				What is my company’s right to exist?			 
			 
				The opportunity			 
		 
	 



 
<p>The first terrifying question to confront is: What is my company’s right to exist? Great companies are built on a founder’s authentic insight about a market opportunity. At this stage your work is to understand the category, the competition and your unique advantages as a founder. How clearly can you describe your founder-market fit? Pressure-test the originating belief behind your business. You want to understand if the <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/tam-sam-som">TAM</a> provides a big enough reward. As you refine your idea, there will be positive indicators that suggest you’re heading in the right direction.</p>



 
 You can articulate why it’s a compelling category and market, and why now is the moment to capture it 



 Your wedge or entry point into the market opportunity becomes clearer 



 You can articulate your unique advantage in seizing this specific opportunity—why you have founder-market fit 



 Ideation compounds as you hone your direction—information and conversations result in “productive pivots” that build sequentially; you feel progress, not just motion&nbsp; 
 



<p>Conviction in your originating belief should grow as you pressure-test your idea and see more positive indicators. You know that you’ve answered this question when you’re ready to marry the idea for the next decade-plus, and you’d recruit a best friend to work on it with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, when David Vélez was starting Nubank, he turned down an opportunity to join Sequoia as a partner in California. He had always wanted to start a company, and after finishing Stanford GSB he felt a pull back to Latin America. He then spent months pressure-testing his insight about the opportunity to disrupt Brazilian banking. The deeper he dug, the stronger his conviction in the idea became, and he identified his wedge: credit cards, which offered a lower regulatory barrier to entry. Once he was resolved and knew he was ready to commit, Nubank was born.</p>
 


 
	 
					 
				The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework			 
				
	 

			 
			 
				What you think matters			 
			 
				Do people care enough?			 
			 
				What customers think matters			 
		 
	 



 
<p>You have an insight into a market opportunity, but the terrifying question remains: Do people care enough about the problem you’re solving? If people don’t care enough, you won’t be able to build a meaningful business by addressing it. They need to care about the problem not only in the abstract, but they need to be willing to pay for the solution. Speaking with potential customers gives you this information. You need a critical mass of conversations to produce enough evidence: We’ve seen companies conduct 50+ conversations in a week. Positive indicators that the problem resonates with customers:</p>



 
 High hit rate on cold outreach (which is more likely to reflect truth vs. warm leads predisposed to “be nice”) 



 More people than you invited show up to calls and demos 



 Customers’ eyes light up at your pitch and they lean in; your idea represents an unlock for them: “I want this now!” 



 Customers express clear willingness to pay for the solution&nbsp; 



 Customer responses help you refine the idea and sharpen what a differentiated solution might look like<br> 
 



<p>It’s important to be objective about how customers externalize these positive indicators, and not let confirmation bias cloud your judgement. If only one in 10 customer conversations lean in, the problem may not matter as much as you thought—but what matters most is the depth of engagement. You’re looking for a set of customers who respond passionately and feel your pitch really speaks to them. Dig deeper into what they have in common and laser focus on this segment. It can be easy to talk yourself into believing that customers are more excited about your idea than they are. The conversations that resonate most strongly will help you define your ICP, how they see the problem and why it matters to them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ultimate resolution you’re seeking through these conversations is a set of design partners—initial customers who are excited to co-create the solution with you. If you’re seeing rabid customer interest and you’ve secured design partners, then you’ve successfully validated the problem and answered this terrifying question.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before launch, DoorDash’s founders <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-doordash/">spoke</a> with “three or four hundred” small businesses. While their initial idea was about last-mile delivery, they weren’t initially targeting restaurants, since they thought Grubhub and others had already solved this problem. However, they discovered through customer conversations that competitors only routed orders, and left restaurants to make their own deliveries. Local restaurants that couldn’t afford their own delivery staff were the most passionate merchants DoorDash interviewed, with a burning unmet demand. Their first onboarded customer was a macaroon store in Palo Alto that had been turning down dozens of orders per week because they couldn’t deliver them.</p>
 


 
	 
					 
				The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework			 
				
	 

			 
			 
				Your roadmap			 
			 
				Does my product actually change behavior?			 
			 
				Customers’ established behavior			 
		 
	 



 
<p>After you’ve validated the problem, there are still likely many different ways you could choose to build your product to solve it. At this stage, the terrifying question becomes: Does your product actually change behavior? It needs to not only work but to delight customers enough to transform their behavior. Your primary task at this stage is iterating on your product and evolving features to find positive indicators that users are consistently engaging with at least one feature. A product feature becoming “sticky” signals that it’s adding enough value to change users’ behavior, in addition to other positive indicators:</p>



 
 A clear “lightbulb” moment in your demo that makes your product click for people 



 Short activation period: users are able to on-ramp and get immediate value from the product, which you can measure as engagement 



 A specific feature in your product becomes durably sticky, even if it’s not the entire product surface 



 Customers make nuanced feature requests, point to a compelling feature set 



 Power user behavior emerges as an outlier pattern among a subset of customers&nbsp; 



 Evangelism and virality emerges—users start telling peers about a specific feature or capability 
 



<p>As you iterate on the product to move your metrics up, your North Star is engaged and retained users. A growing set of retained users, and a low churn rate, give you conviction that your product is indeed changing customers’ behavior. If your most engaged users match the ICP you identified earlier, it should strengthen your conviction in the problem. If not, this will help you refine your understanding of the problem and your ICP, and evolve your product to serve them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drew Houston of Dropbox <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-dropbox/">says</a> product virality is “an exponential game, but also a game of inches.” As Dropbox came out of beta and opened to general availability, the team obsessed over every surface of the onboarding flow and feature usage. They soon figured out that users who shared files with contacts got the most value from the product. As they optimized for file sharing—even advertising on Craigslist to get users in the office to test new designs—the product began to spread virally, with high activation and retention rates, and low churn.</p>
 


 
	 
					 
				The Arc PMF Terrifying Questions Framework			 
				
	 

			 
			 
				Your sales playbook			 
			 
				Will customers pay enough to build a business?			 
			 
				Customer spend			 
		 
	 



 
<p>After finding product traction and building conviction in your solution, the next terrifying question to confront is: Will people pay enough for it to build a real business? Scaling a meaningful business requires an exchange of value: customers have to be happy to pay your asking price. Your initial beta customers likely won’t pay your ideal price point, and that’s OK—getting there is a process. As you seek to prove the hypothesis that your price target is realistic, you should iterate on your sales process just like you iterate on product features, testing how to demo, price, package, activate, onboard and support your customers. As you strengthen the value exchange with customers, you’ll see positive indicators:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Discovery process confirms your assumptions about budget availability&nbsp; 



 Customers don’t balk at your asking price or slow roll the deal 



 High ratio of engaged users upgrading from the free tier to the paid tier 



 Contract reviews happen quickly; you don’t get stuck in procurement purgatory 



 You don’t find yourself in a knife fight with competitors based on price 
 



<p>The ultimate answer to whether customers will pay enough to build a business is a list of paying customers who feel they get great value from your product at your asking price. But to achieve your ambition and build an important company, you need to grow. You should be able to chart a path to $500M in revenue based on your conviction in the problem, your assessment of the TAM and the strength of the value exchange.</p>



<p>When Block first introduced the Square mobile card reader, they intended to sell the hardware and software to merchants. The founders had answered the terrifying questions of whether people cared enough about the problem and whether their product changed behavior, but they were still iterating on the price point and how much people would pay. As Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/crucible-moments-block/">explains</a>, at one point they realized the best value exchange would be to give the hardware and software away for free, and charge a percentage fee on each transaction. The company would get recurring revenue rather than a one-time sale, and their customers would get immediate value without any capital outlay—a win-win, which quickly brought them to PMF.</p>



 Revisiting the Terrifying Questions 



<p>While the terrifying questions build on one another, you shouldn’t think of answering them in a strictly linear way. Practice is always messier than theory, and it’s possible you’ll confront multiple questions at once, and move fluidly between them over time.</p>



<p>For example: In 2022 Robinhood, already a public company with over $1B in annual revenue, made a profound realization about their ICP: their core customer was not the first-time amateur getting started with investing, as they’d thought, but rather the “active trader” making many trades per week or day. In our Crucible Moments podcast, founder Vlad Tenev <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/podcast/robinhood-ft-vlad-tenev-reinventing-finance-for-a-new-generation/">describes</a> how discovering this caused the team to revisit who cared most about the problem they were solving, whether their product was optimized to deliver those users the most value, as well as the value exchange with those customers. Over two years, the company radically evolved its offerings based on these insights and iterated to strengthen their answer to each terrifying question. The result has been dramatically increasing revenue per user (and Robinhood’s share price along with it).</p>



<p>Every time you expand to a new customer or product line, you confront the same terrifying questions again. PMF is an ongoing pursuit, not a finite destination. But we believe that if you answer each terrifying question, the output is product-market fit.</p>

<p>As online content becomes predominantly AI-driven, intellectual property (IP) rights should not be neglected as (human) creators will heavily rely on them. While the main use cases for blockchains revolve around financial applications, one could argue that our everyday lives constantly intersect IPs in different forms. Although the legal framework is abundant, proper recording, monetization and disputes are often a burden for independent creators. Story Protocol aims to create a decentralised framework for IP management, tokenizing it both through NFTs and fungible tokens, allowing creators to register fully programmable IP, that is also recognized and enforced through the traditional judiciary system. Using smart contracts and programmable metadata, Story Protocol ensures proper monetization for creators whenever their IP is used.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jason’s background  Current IP pain points  Tokenizing IP  Story Protocol blockchain  Preventing IP infringement  Story Protocol validators  Interoperability  Onboarding traditional IP to Story Protocol  Story Protocol’s legal framework  Enforcing IP rights on Story Protocol  Hiding or demonetizing on-chain IP  Governance &amp; disputes  Roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/jasonjzhao">Jason Zhao on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/storyprotocol">Story Protocol on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.
