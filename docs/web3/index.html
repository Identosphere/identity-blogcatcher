<p>The games industry has a cost problem. Over the last decade, we’ve seen record growth in player demand driven by several tailwinds, including: the rise of mobile and emerging markets, new business models like free-to-play and subscriptions, transmedia storytelling, and much more. Yet that growth has come with a price in the form of rising game development budgets. Players today expect more from their games than ever before – more content, higher levels of polish, better graphics, multi-platform support, multiplayer that just works – all of this has become table stakes to find success in games.</p>
<p>Costs have risen proportionally to content. A recent UK <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/644939aa529eda000c3b0525/Microsoft_Activision_Final_Report_.pdf">CMA report</a> shared that the average AAA game green-lit today has a development budget of over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">$200M</a>. This is a ~20x increase from a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/01/game-budgets/">$10M</a> average budget for a single platform game in 2010. The original Final Fantasy VII released in 1997 took up <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-file-size-core-game/#final-fantasy-vii-1-317-mb">1.3GB</a> in hard drive space. The recent Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, a modern re-creation of the same game, clocks in at over <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-takes-over-150gb-of-ps5-storage-space-but-dont-worry-about-swapping-disks/">150GB</a> and only covers 1/3 of the original game. Furthermore, a shift to mobile and live service games means that content development is never truly done – a successful game launch quickly turns into a content treadmill to release monthly updates and DLC / expansion packs to retain players.</p>
<p>One way that developers have addressed rising costs has been to rely on outsourcing. Most studios today outsource substantial parts of game production, ranging from concept art, to asset production, to the design of entire levels. Work is handled by a network of contractors and co-development teams, many of whom are located in lower-cost regions. These partners, dubbed “work-for-hire” studios, are the unsung heroes behind many of our favorite games.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, we’re excited to announce our investment in <a href="https://www.kaedim3d.com/">Kaedim</a>, a new type of co-development platform providing AI-powered art outsourcing. Kaedim’s initial product is turning 2D images into ready-to-use 3D assets – today the company serves over 20k new creators each month, and 250 enterprise developers, including many of the largest AAA game studios, film production companies, and e-commerce platforms. Kaedim takes a unique human-in-the-loop approach to 3D asset generation, empowering a team of in-house tech artists with machine learning tools and the latest generative models to speed up asset production while lowering costs. The company recently launched a 3D asset marketplace with over 10k assets, and longer-term, plans to make their artist tools and workflow available to customers directly in an end-to-end creation pipeline.</p>
<p>CEO &amp; founder Konstantina Psoma grew up in Athens, Greece watching her father build his own software company and her mother immerse herself in art. She’s been passionate about the intersection of AI and art since her days at the University of Bristol, where she completed her Masters in Deep Learning. Konstantina founded Kaedim in her final year at university after talking to several game developers, including Aardman and Rebellion Games who would become her first backers. Since then, it’s been a pleasure getting to know Konstantina as she’s hired a great team and scaled Kaedim from a university project into an enterprise-class solution. With Konstantina’s relentless focus on customer value, we believe Kaedim will play a critical role as a next generation co-development platform for many of our favorite games and apps to come.</p>

<p>As technology progresses, infrastructure should be commoditised, especially in Web3, in order to avoid the creation of bottlenecks and gatekeepers. Blockchains are naturally oblivious to off-chain data, so they need oracles to fetch data. However, given their past technical limitations, oracles have failed to provide a decentralised and permissionless framework for data query. SEDA seeks to change this by creating an intent-based modular data layer, which brings off-chain data on-chain, in order for it to be available to any party, regardless of who requested it first.</p><p>We were joined by Jasper De Goojier, co-founder of SEDA Protocol, to discuss the oracle landscape and how SEDA aims to decentralise it and make data access permissionless.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Jasper’s background  High level overview of SEDA  Oracle use cases  How SEDA Protocol functions  Intent-based data availability  Verifying subjective data &amp; LLM integration  ZKPs &amp; FHE for data privacy  Interoperability &amp; bridging  Roadmap &amp; optimistic oracles  SEDA token migration  Chain abstraction  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/jasperflux">Jasper De Goojier on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/sedaprotocol">SEDA Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>At PIVX, we firmly believe in the rights of all crypto projects to make <br>their own decisions based on what they deem is right for them. We are committed to supporting the diversity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem and respecting the choices made by different projects, particularly when it comes to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As everyone is now aware, Binance approached Privacy Coin Projects with a request to develop a super transparent address type that would facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements. PIVX agreed to this request and made “exchange addresses” that ensure no shield transactions can be sent to these addresses.</p><p>While we understand that privacy is an essential feature of PIVX and is currently optional, we recognize the significance of exchanges maintaining compliance with regulators. Implementing the requested address type would make it easier for our users to deposit into Binance, ensuring a smoother experience for all parties involved.</p><p>It is important to note that the introduction of this address type does not compromise PIVX’s commitment to privacy. PIVX has always been about choice, offering both shielded and transparent transactions. By introducing this new address format, we aim to meet the requirements of exchanges operating in regions with stricter privacy coin regulations, such as Korea. This step would enable us to identify and engage in discussions about relistings with these exchanges, ensuring PIVX’s continued presence in these&nbsp;markets.</p><p>We want to emphasize that PIVX’s privacy protocol, SHIELD, will continue to exist and be supported by a wide variety of exchanges and payment gateways. <br> <br> At PIVX, we understand that regulation varies across the globe, and we strive to navigate these complexities while providing options for users and maintaining our principles. We believe in the strength and resilience of PIVX as we move forward, embracing collaborations that allow us to adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes while preserving the privacy choices we offer to our community.</p><p>PIVX Core</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/community-message-from-pivx-core-d5efdbce2122">Community Message From PIVX core</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		<p>This ZenIP proposes lowering the thresholds required for:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) formally submitting both technical and non-technical improvement proposals; and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) achieving a quorum of votes for both technical and non-technical improvement proposals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes would increase accessibility for community members to put forth proposals and would bring quorum requirements in line with the broader web3 industry standards. Please note that these proposed changes apply to both Zen improvement proposals (ZenIPs) and EON improvement proposals (EONIPs).</p>
<p>ZenIP 42401 aims to make it easier for community members to participate in governance by lowering the $ZEN threshold required for posting a non-technical ZenIP/ EONIP for community vote, as well as lowering the quorum threshold for a vote to be considered valid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current thresholds for both ZenIPs and EONIPs are as follows:</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 200,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 10% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating 
 
 
 
<p>This ZenIP proposes the following changes to the thresholds:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 100,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 200,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 5% of circulating supply participating (vs. 10% currently) 
 
 
 Non-Technical:
 
 Submit proposal for vote: 25,000 $ZEN held or delegated (vs. 100,000 $ZEN currently) 
 Vote quorum: 3% of circulating supply participating (vs. 5% currently) 
 
 
 
<p>Again, if ZenIP 42401 passes, these changes will apply to both ZenIPs and EONIPs. There are also no changes proposed to the majority requirements for either proposal type (i.e., 67% of votes in favor for technical proposals, simple majority in favor for non-technical proposals).</p>
 ZenIP Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are public proposals for the Horizen community to approve or decline. We encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> on ZenIP 42401 and share your thoughts on the proposal. We also encourage you to read the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42401-updating-proposal-and-quorum-thresholds/440">ZenIP 42401: Updating Proposal and Quorum Thresholds</a> post on Discourse to get a complete understanding of this proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42401 will start on Tuesday, March 12th, 2024 at 12pm EST and end on Friday, March 15th, 2024 at 12pm EST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Horizen DAO voting is done on the Horizen EON chain, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. The snapshot is taken once voting begins.</p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the vote instructions detailed tutorial, please have a look to the dedicated blogpost. Below we cover an overview of how to vote.&nbsp;</p>
 How to vote – Instructions 
<p>Your vote will be weighted regarding the tokens you hold, either on the Horizen mainchain (the historic one) or Horizen EON (the EVM chain).</p>
<p>If you already linked your mainchain address for a previous vote, you won’t have to connect it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Connect your wallet and verify if it’s properly linked here.</a></p>
<p>The vote happens on Snapshot and is done through MetaMask and therefore via the Horizen EON network.</p>
<p>Before going through the tutorial, we assume that the Horizen EON network is properly configured on your MetaMask wallet. If not, <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">please follow this guide</a>.</p>
 A/ You already voted and linked you mainchain address 
<p>Then it’s very simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still encourage you to verify if your mainchain address is properly linked on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance app</a>.</p>
<p>If it’s not linked, follow the tutorial just below.</p>
<p>If it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
 B/ You have to link your mainchain address 
<p>1/ First, make sure to have some ZEN on Horizen EON, you will need some gas tokens in order to interact with the EVM chain, link your address, and vote.</p>
<p>2/ Now it’s time to link your mainchain address(es). Any ZEN on Arizen, Sphere By Horizen, ZEN wallet, Swing wallet, or multi-sig wallets, Ledger, ZEN on exchanges are usable. Here, we will focus on Sphere By Horizen. If you need assistance for non Sphere By Horizen wallets linking, please have a look to this <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/how-to-link-the-mainchain-address-to-the-horizen-eon-address/174">post on the Horizen forum</a>.</p>
<p>You’ll get a more <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">detailed tutorial with a screenshot in the Governance doc</a>, but here are the steps:</p>
 
 Make sure Horizen EON is configured on MetaMask and to have some ZEN on there thanks to the steps stated above. 
 Open the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen Governance</a> page. 
 Click Connect Wallet. The EON wallet (MetaMask) appears in the top-right corner. Once connected, the EON address field is automatically filled with the connected EON address.
 
 Note: If the EON wallet (MetaMask) was previously connected to the Horizen Governance app, then it is automatically connected. 
 
 
 Open Sphere By Horizen and navigate to the mainchain wallet address you want to link to the EON address. Click the Information icon to view your address. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, click Link Mainchain Address.&nbsp; 
 The Link Address pop-up appears. Paste the Sphere wallet address in the Mainchain Address field. 
 Copy your EON address. 
 In Sphere, go to the Addresses pane. Click the compose icon (hand holding pencil). 
 The Sign message with address pop-up appears. Paste the EON address in the message field and click on Create signature. The mainchain signature appears below the message field. Then click on COPY TO CLIPBOARD. 
 In the Horizen Governance app, on the Linked Addresses pane, paste the signature in the Mainchain Signature field. 
 Click Link. The Pending pop-up appears stating that the transaction is being submitted. 
 The MetaMask Notification appears. Read the information details. Click Confirm. 
 The Linked Address appears showing that the EON Address and Mainchain Address are linked 
 You can repeat the process for other addresses. 
 
<p>Now that it’s linked, just head to <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Snapshot on the Horizen governance page</a>, and vote for the proposal when it’s published and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We also have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though many customers value paying only for what they consume in usage-based pricing, that flexibility also makes it very difficult to predict how much of your product they’ll use. Accurately predicting usage—and therefore cost—is a major sticking point for buyers of usage-based software. We’ve heard from plenty of leaders who opt to build instead of buy because it makes it significantly easier to forecast their costs.</p>
<p>The good news is that, as a vendor, there are measures you can take to help your customers predict their usage. But as your company scales and you revise your pricing structures—when you introduce new products, for instance, or enter a new market—those measures will likely need to shift.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given how often predictability is a pain point and how frequently growth-stage companies need to revisit their pricing structures, we’ve compiled a menu of common tactics—along with pointers on which approaches work best for different customer segments—you can use to help your customers more reliably predict their consumption of your product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This list isn’t exhaustive and not all of these options will suit your business needs, but the more of these suggestions you can implement for the segments you serve, the likelier it is you can provide your customers with a smoother buying and usage experience.</p>
<p></p>
  Pricing 
 Use an easy-to-understand, easy-to-measure pricing metric.&nbsp; 
<p>Most effective segments: all.</p>
<p>This might be the most important element to get right in usage-based pricing. Your pricing metric should be transparent, easy to understand, and aligned with your value prop—the easier something is to understand and measure, the easier it is to track and predict. If your customers can’t immediately understand your pricing metric, they won’t be able to explain it to the budget holder, and they won’t be able to purchase your product. No one wants to sign blank checks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes there’s an obvious way for these companies to measure their value proposition—a fintech company might bill per credit card transaction, or a SaaS company might bill per compute unit. But most of the time, these companies need to compile a few obvious but incomplete metrics into a single, new pricing metric. For instance, Databricks created a Databricks Unit, or DBU, composed of different compute and data processing metrics to measure a unit of processing power on their Lakehouse Platform. OpenAI bills by token and scales the price up or down depending on whether you opt for either a faster or more capable model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to keep in mind when you’re considering creating your own metric.</p>
<p>Generally, balance transparency with simplicity. A single, compiled metric might help your prospects understand your pricing structure during initial sales calls, for instance, but it might make it harder for them to track their own use of that metric. A good way to know if you’ve landed on the right metric is to test it for customer likeability. Put yourself in the customers’ shoes. Would you want to be charged that way? Is the metric fair and easy to understand? Will it scale with your customers’ use?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also useful to look out for metrics that might unintentionally encourage bizarre behavior. This is one reason Google doesn’t charge for each Google Doc you create, for instance. If they did, chances are many users would just create one huge, long document! Time Warner Cable has also observed that their own customers would rather pay more for an unlimited cable service than pay less and only for what they consume—so it’s important to implement a pricing model that builds trust with your customers and aligns with how they consume your product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Offer some form of committed consumption. 
<p>Most effective segments: PLG, SMB, midmarket.</p>
<p>Many companies we work with offer hybrid pricing models that include some form of committed consumption. This can look very different for different segments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For SMB and PLG:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Many growth-stage companies use “T-shirt sizing,” which offers different buckets with set amounts of usage. This approach offers new customers an easy, clear-cut way to start using your product. Generally, companies structure their tiers in such a way that companies who buy a “medium” tier of usage and use more than their allotment are incentivized to purchase the “large” tier of usage for a cheaper incremental per-unit rate. If customers do consume more than the usage limits allotted in their “T-shirt size,” many companies will bill those customers for overages (see next section).&nbsp; 
 
<p>For enterprise and midmarket:&nbsp;</p>
 
 We’ve seen some successful software companies offer packages that allow customers to commit to consuming ahead of their run rate. Customers can roll over or pull forward credits, or they can commit to a set amount of credits upfront and draw down those credits over a period of time.&nbsp; 
 We’ve also seen companies offer platform fees that include a set amount of usage. Any usage beyond the initial allotment is generally charged at a per-unit rate.&nbsp; 
 
 Carefully consider overages. 
<p>Most effective segments: all.</p>
<p><a href="https://a16z.com/overages-problem-usage-based-pricing/">Hitting your customers with punitive overages</a>—or charging your customers a standard rate, instead of their discounted rate, if they consume more than their commitment agreement—can guarantee you cash as a vendor, but it can also create friction between you and your customers and make it difficult to renew or expand that customer down the road. Consider carefully if you need these. And if you decide you do include them, try not to make them a surprise: use some of the other tactics we mention here to prevent their usage from skyrocketing and be upfront about the consequences of overuse.</p>
  Sales 
 Conduct a light-weight sizing exercise upfront.&nbsp; 
<p>Most effective segments: midmarket, enterprise.</p>
<p>Even if your customers aren’t committing, bringing a salesperson into your discussion with the customers can help them predict how much they’ll spend. These salespeople should constantly be in touch with whomever at your org researches customer usage patterns—product, growth, data science, or a separate function—and be able to consult confidently about how current usage trends and insights might apply to the prospect’s own business. (Otherwise, these prospects will do this work themselves and almost always forecast in a way that deviates from how your current customers are using the product.) This exercise can be especially important in downturn climates when customers have been spending at a certain run rate and that run rate needs to contract.&nbsp;</p>
 Offer true ups.&nbsp; 
<p>Most effective segments: enterprise.</p>
<p>In lieu of overages, you can reconcile and adjust your customers’ usage at the end of a billing period to ensure that they’re only billed for what they use. This is particularly helpful for companies that have unpredictable spikes or seasonal fluctuations in usage. True ups also scale with customer usage, since customers don’t need to renegotiate their contracts in order to continue consuming.&nbsp;</p>
  Product 
 Build an in-product dashboard to track usage.&nbsp; 
<p>Most effective segments: all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a dashboard that maps out last and current period’s usage, and predicts usage in the next, customers can easily track their accrued usage. We’ve seen some companies offer forecasts for the remaining billing period and the next billing period, which helps customers with near-term spend planning and limits surprise bills landing at the end of each billing period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many companies are also using AI/ML to help companies better predict usage and notify customers when they’re approaching their usage limits.</p>
  Customer support 
 Create implementation guides with best practices.&nbsp; 
<p>Most effective segments: all.</p>
<p>Creating guides that review your products’ features and capabilities, outline resource requirements, itemize best practices, and detail how your product can be scaled to meet customers’ growing needs offers users a solid resource for understanding how to get the most out of your product quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 Proactive engagement from customer success managers. 
<p>Most effective segments: midmarket, enterprise.</p>
<p>Customer success managers (CSMs) reach out when usage starts to spike and might supersede their typical or committed usage. In addition to flagging usage that’s trending too high, CSMs can also optimize the implementation of your customers’ products so they’re meeting their <a href="https://a16z.com/customer-success-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it/">agreed-upon business needs</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you offer your customers better ways to predict their usage of your product, you also lay the groundwork for more effectively tracking your own revenue as a vendor—and predictable revenue is the lynchpin of any company’s planning, execution, and ultimately valuation. There are other steps you’ll need to take in order to better predict your own revenue, which we’ll touch on in a future post.</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain-based payment surges, the need for on-chain privacy is <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/grayscale-files-for-privacy-etf-with-sec-zcash-part-of-offering.htm?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#:~:text=Crypto-focused%20asset%20manager%20Grayscale,be%20an%20industry-first%20fund">capturing the spotlight</a>. Privacy is particularly important for institutional users and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs). And, the problem is that any public, pseudonymous blockchain reveals transaction details.&nbsp;</p><p>From wallet addresses, to gas fees, to transaction value, and the tokens traded; transaction data is public. This enables transaction linkage, which exposes a huge data exhaust that may ultimately result in wallet:identity mapping. Simply attempting to make a trade can trigger MEV front-running; even price discovery can be followed. Neither privacy nor confidentiality are a feature of public ledgers.</p><p>Let’s examine how Panther’s multi-chain privacy-preserving protocol intends to offer users access to public ledger liquidity while providing transactional anonymity.&nbsp;</p> A vision for regulatory-compliant, on-chain privacy <p>Panther Protocol breaks the links between the wallet initiating the trade and the trade itself, i.e. it enhances transaction privacy: specifically, it preserves identity, the assets traded, and value transferred. This privacy is granted by Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pools</a>. Shielded Pools, known in TradFi as dark pools, obscure the trade initiator whose privacy must be preserved from peer traders and external liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p><p>The Shielded Pool acts like a walled garden: only invited users and assets may enter. Assets are deposited in the Panther Vault, part of the Panther Smart Contract, in exchange for a zAsset, or Zero-Knowledge Asset. It’s the zAsset that masks the detail of the user’s trades from observation.</p> What is a zAsset? <p>A zAsset represents a digital asset that users may trade with anonymity within a Panther Shielded Pool. The technology underpinning the zAsset enables trades to be settled privately on a public ledger.</p><p>In essence, the zAsset, is a "mirror" asset that is printed when a digital asset is <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/depositing-transferring-and-withdrawing?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">deposited </a>in the Panther contract. It’s subsequently spent when that asset is withdrawn. Therefore, the zAsset:asset always exists in a strict 1:1 ratio. Users can send, swap, receive, and pay with zAssets within a Shielded Pool.&nbsp;</p> How does a zAsset enhance trading privacy? <p>A zAsset utilizes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs. ZK proofs are cryptographic protocols that enable the prover to demonstrate to the verifier that something is true without revealing the underlying data required to form that proof. For example, you could prove that you are over 18 without providing the birth certificate or ID used to generate that proof, nor indeed your actual age.&nbsp;</p><p>zAssets represent their underlying asset in the form of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs). It’s these UTXOs that users trade within a <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Shielded Pool</a>. To store UTXO data on-chain, the Protocol uses ZK-SNARK (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) proofs. This allows a user’s on-chain state to be stored privately and to ensure private state changes, i.e. the UTXO data that represents the asset on-chain is condensed and encrypted. This means that asset balances and balance changes are not publicly available should a Panther account address become known to an observer.&nbsp;</p><p>To the observing world, the only available data that results from a trade is that a UTXO was committed to the smart contract. Only the owner of the UTXO can decrypt the proof and ascertain the value and token that the UTXO represents.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that UTXOs are not all created equal adds further support to the privacy set. The number of UTXOs created as a result of trades does not map to the number of tokens that UTXO represents. Some UTXOs may not even represent an asset, they may prove a zero balance, or null data, allowing the activity level of the protocol itself to also be shielded.&nbsp;</p> Deepening privacy <p>Panther Protocol offers two privacy layers; one is optional, and the other is a feature of the protocol. The zAsset is the protocol’s core feature, and the Panther Relayer is a protocol service provider that adds an additional privacy-enhancing mechanism.</p><p>Panther Relayers provide an additional privacy layer by breaking the link between the initiator of the transaction and the transaction itself. These ecosystem operators charge a fee for:</p>  signing the transactions with their public key  paying the gas fees  relaying bundles of transactions to the Shielded Pool contract&nbsp;  <p>Relayers, therefore, enhance privacy, since observers are unable to pinpoint the actual address that initiated the transaction because the Relayer signs the blockchain transaction with their key.</p> A brighter, more private, public-ledger future <p>Relaying alone goes a long way to confounding transaction linking by disbursing the data exhaust when compared to a peer-to-peer or peer-to-AMM transaction. Combined with zAsset trading, we believe this suite of solutions offers the most robust, and yet compliant, trading privacy mechanism created to date.&nbsp;</p><p>As the global economy migrates to a digital native medium that operates on public ledgers, the utility of on-chain protocols will largely hinge on how effectively they implement features that confer privacy where and when it is needed. We believe that Panther Protocol’s privacy-enhancing technology solves the public ledger privacy problem. Panther Protocol has developed a mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol provides dedicated, customizable space, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">a Panther Zone</a>, to empower institutions to trade in Shielded Pools with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the needs of compliant privacy-enabled DeFi in mind, Panther Zones deliver a chain-agnostic, fully decentralized, suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone for privacy-enhanced trading?

Then join our community testers and try out the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">testnet dApp</a>.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a>&nbsp;·&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>In this presentation from the <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit</a>, a16z General Partner Martin Casado lays out the case for AI as a driving force behind incredible advancements in technology, creativity, and the human experience — not to mention efficiency improvements on par with, if not greater than, those delivered by the internet and the microchip.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of his presentation:</p>
<p>I’m going to be covering this AI stuff everybody is talking about. I’m going spend about 10 minutes to talk about why we’re so excited about it, and then<a href="https://a16z.com/why-america-must-lead-in-ai-investment/"> Senator Todd Young is going be up here</a> and we’re going to have a discussion.</p>
<p>I probably took my first AI course in the late ’90s. The stuff has actually been around with us for a very long time. And during that 70 years, it, by every metric, has been a huge success. It’s been up and to the right.</p>
<p>We’ve solved a number of problems we didn’t think computers were good at solving. So, for example, expert systems in the ’50s and ’60s we used for medical diagnosis. We got very good at beating Russians at chess in the ’80s and ’90s. We’re good at image detection. We’re good at robotics. We’ve solved a lot of problems that originally we thought computers were just like large calculators.</p>
<p>On top of just solving these problems, for decades, a lot of the solutions are actually better than humans. Like, we’re better than humans at handwriting detection, we’re better than humans at identifying objects and images. And with all of this magic, we’ve actually been able to add a lot of value to large companies, right? Every time you go to Google and you get a search, this is using AI. Anytime you get some personalization, this is AI, right? So, this stuff is like magic, right? It’s been around for a long time. It’s solved all these problems.</p>
<p>So, there’s been this huge conundrum in the investment community. And the conundrum is the following. If this stuff is so magic and it solves all of these problems, why haven’t we seen a platform shift in the same way we saw a shift with mobile or with the internet? Like, why hasn’t this happened? And we’ve actually done a lot of research with this as a firm, and the answer is that even though the capabilities have been fantastic like I talked about, the economics just haven’t been there in the same way. There’s a number of reasons for this. I won’t be exhaustive, but I’ll just cover a few of them.</p>
<p>So, one of them, a lot of the solutions just tend to apply to niche markets. There’s not a lot of broad market appeal. The second one is probably the most important in nuance, which is a lot of the use cases that we apply it to, correctness is really important, like robotics, but getting something absolutely correct is very, very hard and requires a tremendous amount of investment. So, a number of the solutions require hardware.</p>
<p>And finally, you know, the competition for AI. It’s not another computer, it’s actually a human brain. And, you know, maybe it’ll be better, maybe it’s not as good. The human brain is incredibly efficient and it’s incredibly cheap. And one of the best examples of this is autonomous vehicles or robotaxis. So, when I joined Stanford to do my Ph.D. in 2003, Sebastian Thrun had just won the DARPA Grand Challenge, right? So, he had driven a van autonomously across the desert and won this. And we were like, “Great news, exciting.” Like, autonomous vehicle is a solved problem back in 2003.</p>
<p>Now, if we go 20 years later, we’ve invested $75 billion as an industry. And while we do have autonomous vehicles on the road and they’re great and they’re solving real problems, the unit economics are still worse than say Uber and Lyft because they’re competing against the human brain. So, while this is very important technology, to date, it’s really remained in the realm of large companies, right, that can sync these types of investments.</p>
<p>So, the AI learnings of the last couple of decades is not that technology can’t be built or even that we can’t monetize it, we’re actually good at all of that, it’s that this is very hard for startups to build businesses around. So, the reason that we’re so excited and the industry is changing so quickly is this wave is very, very different on exactly this issue, economics.</p>
<p>So, when I talk about kind of this wave, I’m talking about the emergence of what we call large models or foundation models or state-of-the-art models. These are pieces of software that you put in text or you put in an image and out comes something. Out can come an image or text or a conversation, right? There are this kind of, like, very, very smart pieces of software that you can ask questions and they provide answers to.</p>
<p>And they’ve already entered a number of problem domains that we just haven’t cracked in computers and certainly in AI, right? The AI has not been able to do this piece before. So, for example, creativity. You know, these models are better than humans at creating images or creating music or creating, you know, voice imitations. It actually turns out they’re great at natural language reasoning as well, right? They’re great conversationalists, they’re great friends, they’re great romantic partners, they’re great therapists, and they also are now serving this thing which we call co-pilot, which is this catch-all phrase that they’re pretty good at, like mean online tasks. And by mean I mean average, right? So, if it’s something that you do a lot of it can kind of get the hang of it and do it as well.</p>
<p>Now, remember when I said, like, traditional AI the economics didn’t work and there was a set of reasons? So, those reasons just don’t apply to this set of tasks, right? Like, these markets are enormous, like, whatever. Video games and movies alone are, like, a $0.5 trillion market. In many of these use cases, correctness isn’t an issue, right? I mean, like, there’s no formal notion of correctness of creating, like, a fantasy image or, like, creating a sonnet or something like that. The use cases are primarily software.</p>
<p>And the last point is the one that I couldn’t have predicted, and it’s the most surprising that it turns out that for these tasks, the one that we think of as very human, like, you know, communication and social interaction and creativity, the computers are far cheaper and far better than humans are. I wanna give you a very specific example. It may be silly, but it actually generalizes.</p>
<p>So, let’s just say that I, Martin, wanted to create a picture of me as a Pixar character. So, if I had one of these AI models do it, the actual inference cost, the cost of doing that is about 1/100 of a penny, and it takes about a second. And, I mean, this is what we did here, and this is the quality that you get. If you were to compare that to hiring a graphic artist, a graphic artist is what, let’s say 100 bucks in an hour. It actually is much more. I’ve gone down this road before. So, the AI, you know, it’s just not a little bit better. It’s not, like, 20% better, it’s 4 orders of magnitude cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>This isn’t limited to images, this is also the truth for, like, any sort of language understanding. So, like, take a complex legal document. I can take a complex legal document, I can feed it into an LLM and I can ask questions. If you compare the analog would be for me, like, whatever, like working with my lawyer. So, like, the lawyer would have to read it, would have to understand it, you know. I don’t know how much, you know, the average lawyer cost is, but, like, you know, $500 tends to be pretty standard. And so again, to use an LLM is four to five orders of magnitude cheaper and faster.</p>
<p>And it’s exactly because of this that we as venture investors and we on the private market side are so exciting because we’re seeing the fastest growing companies we’ve seen in the history of the internet, including, by the way, the internet itself. And this is by measuring for revenue or the number of users, etc., right? It’s exactly economic dislocations that create new startups, not just new technology.</p>
<p>So, if you take a step back, historically when marginal costs have dropped this much, this is what creates platform shifts and has changed the industry entirely. It’s happened twice. You know, pretty concretely, I wanna walk through both of those.</p>
<p>So, the first one was compute. So, in the creation of the microchip, it brought the marginal cost of compute to zero. Like, so before you had the microchip, calculations were done by hand, right? So, it was like people doing logarithm tables, you know, in large rooms. And then ENIAC was introduced, which was four orders of magnitude faster, and then you have the computer revolution. And here came, you know, IBM and HP and everything else.</p>
<p>The internet brought down the marginal cost of distribution to zero, right? So, before, like, whatever you’d send, you know, a box or you’d send a letter and then the price per bit dropped and you could send it over the internet. By the way, also four orders of magnitude improvement. And this ushered in kind of the internet revolution, right? This is kind of Amazon and Google and Salesforce.</p>
<p>So, it’s pretty clear if you just take the fundamental economic analysis that these large models bring the marginal cost of creation to zero, like creating that image and language understanding, like reasoning over those documents. And these are very, very broad areas that they can be applied to.</p>
<p>Now, whenever we talk about economics, we always kind of talk about job dislocation as well. It’s very, very important, especially with an economic dislocation of this size. We can learn from the last two epochs, both the microchip and the internet in that if demand is elastic, so, for example, the demand for compute seems kind of unlimited and the demand for distribution seems kind of unlimited, that even though the costs drop, the total throughput, the total use increases by a lot because it becomes more accessible. And so, rather than removing jobs or removing value, these tend to expand growth. Like, the internet almost certainly expanded growth in the United States. And so, we think the same thing is gonna happen here as well.</p>
<p>So, get ready for a new wave of iconic companies. It’s almost certainly gonna happen. It’s not just the technology which is solving problems that have never been solved before, but the economic case is absolutely there.</p>
<p>You know, when this happened with the internet, like, we didn’t really know what was gonna be on the other side of it. Like, we couldn’t have predicted Google and we couldn’t have predicted Yahoo, but we knew it was gonna be something. And it’s kind of one of those moments, but we have some glimpses, right? We know, like, the social order is changing. We know, like, this is a very real use case that’s monetizing today and people are using.</p>
<p>We absolutely think that creativity itself is going to change. You know, productivity, this kind of mean workers, like, this is happening as well. And if you really want some prognostication for where this is all going, I mean, for the first time, I say there is actually real line of sight to embodied AGI. And by embodied AGI I mean something that’s economically viable so you don’t have a bunch of robots that can’t work because they’re too expensive. Like, actually, like solving problems that we need to have solved.</p>
<p>And so, like, with that, listen, there’s a lot to do. This is gonna be a major value driver. I think it requires a ton of partnership from the VC community, from the tech community, and certainly from D.C. So, I appreciate all of you being here today, and your patience with my talk.</p>

In this session from the a16z <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit</a>, moderated by a16z General Partner Katherine Boyle, California Forever CEO Jan Sramek discusses building an ambitious new city between San Francisco and Sacramento, why he firmly believes California’s best days are still ahead, and what he and his team are doing to realize that vision.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of their conversation:</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Thanks for being here, Jan. I am so excited for this conversation. Many have probably read a lot about California Forever. And we’re going to get into the specifics of it. A city between Sacramento and San Francisco, 60,000 acres. But I want to start with you, because you actually have a very fascinating story.</p>
<p>You grew up far away from California in a small working-class town in the Czech Republic. And I want to understand what was it in your childhood, growing up, that led you to say, “I want to move to America and build a city?”</p>
<p>Jan Sramek: It’s great to be here. Thank you. And it’s great to get to tell the story. We’ve been working on this for seven years quietly, and so, it’s nice to be able to tell it.</p>
<p>I was born in 1987 in the Czech Republic. The Velvet Revolution happened in ‘89, the Berlin Wall came down in 1990, the Soviet Empire fell in ‘91, and so it was a very special time. And I think there were two influences. From a cultural perspective, I grew up on a diet of Hollywood culture and movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>And the ‘90s was an incredibly optimistic time in America. I think it was probably the most optimistic time in a long time in America. And I kind of soaked it all in. And I think that there is something about the culture that you consume during your teenage years in particular, that just gets buried in your brain. And we know that about music, and there’s kind of other things where that happens.</p>
<p>And so, to me, America was this place of idealism and opportunity, and California was this deeply optimistic place. And so, it was amazing after, I don’t know, 17 years later to be able to come here.</p>
<p>And, partially, it also drives how I think about some of the negativity that we’ve seen in California and the Bay Area about our inability to build things or our inability to solve some of the challenges where I still have that vision that I had 20 years ago. And so, it makes me upset and it makes me want to work on building it and making it better.</p>
<p>Katherine: Yeah. And we back a lot of immigrant founders, usually building companies, not cities. So, it’s extraordinary that you’re biting off an even bigger project. But we’ve alluded to it, California Forever, many have probably read about it. What exactly is California Forever in your words? And why are you building it now?</p>
<p>Jan: California Forever is an attempt to make sure that the Bay Area remains the center of innovation and prosperity that it’s been for the last 50 years. And we’re doing that by building a new city, the first new major city in the Bay Area that has been proposed or built in the last probably 50 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And so, we’re proposing to do that halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento, in a place called Solano County on the California Delta. And we’ve purchased about 60,000 acres in that area. We’re proposing to build a dynamic walkable community on a portion of the property, and then surrounded with open space and renewable energy, both wind and solar.</p>
<p>Why am I working on it now? I think a lot of it… some of it goes back to how I got to the Bay about 10 years ago. So, I got to the Bay 10 years ago and, you mentioned before, I grew up in a very blue-collar family in the Czech Republic, in a very rural part of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>And when I say blue collar, I mean, my grandmother built the house that I grew up in with her bare hands. She did the masonry work, she did the roof beams, she did the plumbing work, she painted the walls.</p>
<p>And my dad was a car mechanic who built some of the early radio communications infrastructure in the Czech Republic. And so, he built the radio towers, and when I go back to see my parents now and I make a phone call on my cell phone, the signal still goes through the tower that my dad built in the area, which is a 1,200-foot structure that they finished building in the ‘70s or in the ‘80s. And they finished the building in December in like minus 30-degree temperatures, there’s wind kind of swaying the whole structure.</p>
<p>And so, I think that growing up there gave me a deep appreciation for the value of skilled crafts and skilled labor. And the fact that the world around us is built by us, it’s not something that we just accept.</p>
<p>And the contrast to me with coming to the Bay is that, I got to the Bay about 10 years ago, and I think that this combination of capital and creativity and culture and talent that exists in the Bay Area and has for the last 50 years, I think once you’ve lived there for a while, or if you’re born there, it’s easy to forget how just special and rare that is.</p>
<p>I’ve since then started to think that, I think what’s happened in the Bay Area has happened maybe seven times in the history of the modern world, at least in the West. I think it happened in Florence and Paris and London and New York and Chicago and maybe LA, and then it happened in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>And when I moved there, I loved it for all of the reasons that I just named and for the reasons that everyone loves it, and the cultural openness, and the beauty of the place. But it was a time when housing costs were beginning to escalate in the Bay Area in a crazy way. And I think what people began to realize at the time is that the Bay Area was possibly on the verge of becoming the greatest squandering of economic opportunity in the history of mankind. And I don’t say that lightly.</p>
<p>But we had the situation where we had a innovation engine that was spitting out these wonderful new products and services that made life better for Americans and for everyone around the world. And we were creating good paying jobs that everyone around the world was dreaming of and trying to attract, and all we had to do in the Bay was just build more homes, something that we’ve known for 10,000 years how to do.</p>
<p>And because we didn’t do that, even the communities in the Bay Area were beginning to completely break in terms of social fabric. This is the time when you had people throwing rocks at Google buses.</p>
<p>Because we didn’t build enough housing, we had created a zero-sum tournament where people were forced to fight with each other over the same stock of housing in the Bay Area. And so, instead of people celebrating that we had new employers and new jobs coming to the Bay, the communities were fighting over it, which is insane… That’s insane. Like, the whole world is trying to be you and you’re killing the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And you could see that in the numbers. I mean, if I told you that we have an area in the country that’s producing all of this innovation and high-paying jobs, would you expect people to be moving in or to be moving out? You’d expect people to be moving in, right? Because it’s creating opportunities, and that’s what happened for 60 years in California. It was the place that people from the rest of the country moved to, to realize the Californian dream.</p>
<p>And for the last 10 years, people have been moving out of California. More Americans move out of California every year than move in, and it’s not because they don’t want to be there, it’s because we’ve made it impossible to live there.</p>
<p>And even at a national level, there’s now a body of well-established economic research that basically says that our inability to build enough housing in the Bay Area and in New York and a couple of other places is reducing the GDP across America, not just in those areas, by significant numbers.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~moretti/growth.pdf">famous paper</a> in, I think, 2015 that Hsieh and Enrico Moretti out of Berkeley published, where they argued quite convincingly that if we built enough housing in the Bay, in New York, and a couple of other places, American GDP would be higher by 14 percent or more. Not in those areas, across America.</p>
<p>So, American GDP is, what? Twenty-seven trillion dollars now? And so, 14 percent of that is 4 trillion dollars of economic output every year, not one-off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine: So it’s a housing question, but when you’re trying to get people to move to a new city, you also have to think about the other part of the equation, which is jobs, as you mentioned. What is your pitch to employers to tell them to come to Solano County?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jan: So, we have a lot of employers in the room, I think, in the Bay Area and in New York and DC. How many people feel like they need to pay their employees increasingly more and more and more because their employees can’t afford to live in the cities that they want to live in? Probably a lot of you.</p>
<p>How many of you are struggling because you can’t get your employees to come to the office every day? Because your employees have a commute that’s 45 minutes or, in some cases, one-and-a-half hours, and they just don’t want to spend that amount of time in traffic every day. So, even though when you tell them that they should come to the office, they fight and they don’t want to because they want to see their kids and they want to have breakfast with their kids, they want to have dinner with their kids.</p>
<p>And so, our pitch is, imagine that you had a place like West Village in New York or Georgetown in DC, or Noe Valley or the Marina in San Francisco. Medium density, row houses, backyards, traditional American urbanism, local shopping streets where you can walk to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, imagine that we improved the transportation system by creating super blocks where cars inside those super blocks can only go about 10 miles an hour. We created biking and public transport infrastructure to use with that, meaning your kids can actually play in the streets, meaning your kids can actually walk to school alone and you don’t have to be chauffeur your whole life like a crazy person.</p>
<p>And then imagine that we build that in a place that is 25 minutes to Napa Valley, and that is an hour and a half away from Tahoe. And so, it’s a lot closer to those places that everyone in the Bay Area loves than Palo Alto or Cupertino or San Francisco or Oakland. And then imagine that the place is still an hour and a half away from your headquarters or office in San Francisco or Palo Alto or Menlo Park or whatever.</p>
<p>And so, if your team members between the two offices want to go and see each other, you don’t have to do Uber, TSA, airport, plane, delayed plane, airport, Uber, get to the office in Austin or Denver or wherever it is, but you can actually get in a car and in an hour and a half or in an hour, you can be there.</p>
<p>And then imagine that it was a city for up to 400,000 people that was entitled and approved at once. And so, you knew that for the next 30 years, if this office is going to work and you’ll be able to hire talent there, there’ll be enough space for you to grow in for the next 30 years. There’ll be enough office and there’ll be enough homes for your employees, whether they want to rent them or whether they want to buy them.</p>
<p>And then imagine that instead of paying 4 or 5 million dollars for a mediocre home in Palo Alto or San Francisco, your employees would be able to buy a nice house for a million dollars.</p>
<p>Katherine: Yeah, I think that’s where everyone says, “Sign me up.” But another unique facet of this project, actually, that I think a lot of people in this room will be very interested in is that it’s located very close to Travis Air Force Base. And the area is home to many veterans. So, how do you envision the interaction between this new city and the veteran community that’s populous there?</p>
<p>Jan: We think that Solano County has the opportunity to become…go to the roots of what Silicon Valley used to be. And so, Silicon Valley started with defense, we all know this. I learned the other day that between 1950 and 1980, the largest employer in Silicon Valley was Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p>And so, that’s not that far back. But then we lost the defense business because land cost became too high, there wasn’t enough land for manufacturing, and it became too expensive to do, and then there were cultural issues with the fights between the tech sector and the defense industry. And we think that, particularly with American Dynamism and this revival in interest in investing in defense innovation, there’s a real opportunity to bring some of that back to Northern California.</p>
<p>And it’s hard to do that in the core Bay Area for all of the reasons that we discussed. But in Solano County, there’s an opportunity where there is an existing large labor force. Travis is there, Mare Island used to be there, which was a naval base. And so, there’s a lot of cultural heritage and history of that.</p>
<p>And so, we think that Solano County can become the foundry of American defense innovation for the next 50 years. And I think that, there was a lot of talk today about our adversaries and some of the challenges with that, and I think… There were two things that I think would have given our adversaries hope over the last 15 years, if you want, in what’s going to slow down the pace of innovation in America.</p>
<p>Number one, it was the fact that we were strangling the Bay Area innovation ecosystem by just not providing enough housing, so we couldn’t create a critical mass. We couldn’t innovate as quickly as we could otherwise. And then the second was this period of, I would say, limited engagement between the defense community and at least some of the venture firms in the Valley and how that worked.</p>
<p>And I think our project has an opportunity to be a nightmare for our enemies where, it is an opportunity for the leading venture capital investment funds and individuals in the valley to come together with the military in a location that can accommodate growth for the next 30 years.</p>
<p>And so, I think when people look back in 2050, they might say that this was one of the most interesting and lasting and impactful partnerships between the government and the military and Silicon Valley in the country.</p>
<p>Katherine: &nbsp;I want to ask: building a new city, we’ve done it many times in America, yet there’s a lot of skepticism around building a new city today. Why do you think that is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jan: It’s a good question. I think it’s an idea that’s fell out of fashion and because of it, people don’t quite know how to think about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it is interesting. It’s completely acceptable in California, and actually in most of the country today, to say that you’re working on inventing artificial intelligence. But when you say that because homes in the bay cost 5 million dollars and no everyday person can afford to live there, you want to take a bunch of non-prime farmland that isn’t ecologically sensitive and build some homes there so people can afford to live in the Bay Area, that’s somehow controversial. It’s okay to be building artificial intelligence and it’s controversial to be building a new city, it just doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>Katherine: So, assuming your initiative called the East Solano Homes Jobs and Clean Energy Initiative passes in November, what’s the time frame for breaking ground and actually completing the project?</p>
<p>Jan: Our target is to break ground in 2027 — that is ambitious by California standards. A couple of things have to happen for that to be the case. But we’re pretty optimistic that we will be able to do that.&nbsp; In terms of completing it, it’s a multi-decade project, and that we’ve sized it, we are approving it all at once so that people have the visibility, so that employers have the visibility that this is going to be here.</p>
<p>And so, I certainly hope to be working on it in 20 or 30 years. Someone told me if you’re trying to start a new city, it helps to start young, and so I was 29 when we started, so, we have a little bit of time.</p>
<p>Katherine: Yeah. And speaking of being young, you know, if you look at the trajectory 50 years from now, say, what’s the dream for this new city? What do you hope it looks like? What does it look like when it’s fully developed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jan: What it looks like, it should look like a bustling, dynamic community… Something that actually… would resemble some of these most beloved neighborhoods in America that we have today, some of them I already mentioned, and we have more.</p>
<p>If I ask people in the room to name your favorite neighborhood in America, the odds are you would name a place that was built in the 1800s or early 1900s. I think Tyler Cohen is speaking later on today, I think he’s been asking some of his guests, “What’s your favorite neighborhood? And why can’t we build amazing places anymore?”</p>
<p>And we want to rediscover the art of building great cities and neighborhoods. And that will be one of the contributions that we would make, which is, rediscover how we can do that so that other cities can hopefully learn from that.</p>
<p>We will have hopefully created a place that makes life much better for people in Solano County, the ones there right now and the ones who move in. It’s a county where there’s no major private sector employers in the county, and so, way too many of the residents commute an hour and a half, two hours every day for work, which means they never see their kids, and we can bring that economic engine.</p>
<p>And then, lastly, I think it’s an opportunity to make sure that the Bay Area remains the center of innovation and prosperity that it has been for the last 70 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would say, it’s fair to say that for the last 70 years, the modern world was invented in, a lot of it was invented in the Bay Area and in California. And I think that’s been amazing for the country overall, and it’s not clear that that’s going to be the case for the next 70 years.</p>
<p>And I think we would all much rather that the world is built and invented in America with American values than somewhere overseas. And I think that isn’t going to happen if we don’t create the room for us to innovate, particularly now that the Valley, to the point of American dynamism, is doing so much more in advanced manufacturing, and defense, and agriculture technologies, and all of these sectors attached to the real world.</p>
<p>And you can’t invent them or they are very difficult to invent in Palo Alto when a home costs 5 million and you can’t get any office space to build a factory or something like that, or an R&amp;D facility. And so, hopefully we can help make sure that the future is what it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine: Thank you for reigniting the California dream.</p>
<p>Jan: Thank you.</p>

<p>In this talk with a16z General Partner Ben Horowitz, from the a16z <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit</a>, Coinbase President and Chief Operating Officer Emilie Choi discusses, among other things, crypto’s potential to power the next-generation internet and bolster individual freedoms — two major reasons why America should not only embrace crypto, but take charge in shaping its future.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of their conversation:</p>
<p>Ben Horowitz: So, I’ve got Emilie, who is the very distinguished chief operating officer of Coinbase. So, we’re gonna talk crypto this morning. And so, those of us in crypto world have been very, very nervous that the U.S. may be losing its lead in what’s very likely the next generation of the internet. But there are some out there that say, “Oh, let crypto go offshore. We don’t want it.” How do you think about that?</p>
<p>Emilie Choi: I think it’s a travesty. I really think it’s a travesty. And I think the U.S. falling behind on crypto is not dissimilar from what we’ve seen with chips and what we’re having to do now with the chips bill. I think it’s like 5G, I think it’s a national security issue and threat to not have critical technology infrastructure built in the United States. And I think there’s technologies that we don’t always understand, whether it’s crypto, whether it’s AI. The instinct should not be to be like, push it off, push it offshore, or push it back in the bottle.</p>
<p>Ben: Yeah. When has that been a good idea?</p>
<p>Emilie: It’s never been a good idea. It’s never been a good idea. And the genie is outta the bottle. And we see all sorts of countries and regions starting to adopt sensible crypto frameworks. For example, 80% of the G20 now either has enacted or is in the process of enacting crypto legislation and regulation, and we just haven’t done anything here. And so, the net result is that 70% of crypto developers are now offshore, and thus the technology and data will continue to be built offshore. So, I think this has to be the year where we do something, we enable very sensible regulation here. You don’t often hear industries saying, like, “Please give me some lines. Please give me some level of regulation here so that we have some rules of the road.” You know, we have an organization called Stand With Crypto that has more than 275,000 advocates for crypto. It’s these entrepreneurs in all the different states. They come and they meet with their local representatives and senators and their friends in Singapore and other countries are saying, like, “Why would you build here? This is, like, such a dangerous thing to do here because here’s no rules of the road.” So, that’s what we have to do. We have to push stuff forward in the U.S.</p>
<p>Ben: So there were kind of no rules of the road on the internet to a large degree. How is crypto different? Like, what’s going on in the U.S. that makes that, like, a very bad idea?</p>
<p>Emilie: What makes out a very bad idea is that we have overzealous regulators such as the SEC, who are overstepping their boundaries. We’ve seen with the FTC that they’re overstepping on antitrust and thus not enabling any M&amp;A to happen. With the SEC, they issued a wells notice to Coinbase about a year ago. And the thing is that we have an exchange, we have something that… there’s a parallel analogy in financial services. There’s ways to create certain lines around this, but update them for 2024 and beyond, that is the difference and I think it helps ultimately really protect customers and consumers, which should all be in our interests.</p>
<p>Ben: Right. So, you have a campaign speaking of upgrades called Upgrade the Financial System. What do you mean when you say upgrade the financial system and then, what is Coinbase’s vision for what that could mean for the United States?</p>
<p>Emilie: Most Americans are dissatisfied with the current financial system. They feel like it is not serving them in terms of fees. They feel like it is slow. It is clunky sending a wire. They feel like they don’t have access to certain services. And we see this all the time. The thing that is novel about crypto, it’s 24/7, it’s global in nature. It’s decentralized. You don’t have a middleman, arbitrating that you are worthy of something. It is done through the blockchain. And so, it brings all sorts of benefits. I think that we’re just in a time, Ben, obviously of distrust of institutions. And so, it’s a time to kind of update the financial system and bring it into the modern era. A lot of these systems like Swift are decades and decades old. So when I think about Coinbase, we have three different customer groups.</p>
<p>We have consumers, many, many consumers, that’s the core of our business who often come into Coinbase and buy Bitcoin. And then they become exposed to all different parts of the crypto economy. Maybe they want to stake some ETHE, maybe they want to buy an NFT. Whatever it is, they can do all sorts of novel things within that crypto ecosystem. We have an institutional business which enables trading custody. We have more than 25% of the world’s top hedge funds using it. We were named as the custodian of 8 of the 11 approved ETFs at this point and all sorts of prime brokerage services such as lending. And then our other business is the developer business, which serves developers and offers them cloud services and a development platform to be able to build on the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ben: Interesting. Yeah. And I read a stat where if you’re middle to low income and you’re banked, you spend more on overdraft fees than on vegetables, which is pretty crazy. It’s actually more expensive to bank if you’re poor than if you’re rich.</p>
<p>Emilie: Yes. I think that’s the funny thing about crypto… in many ways, it started as a libertarian movement about individual freedom and having control over your money. In many ways, it’s also on the other side, progressive in nature if you think about serving the underbanked and the underserved populations who typically haven’t had access to those types of traditional financial services. And so, it should be very equal opportunity, but for some reason, it’s not perceived that way.</p>
<p>Ben: Yeah. It’s interesting… it’s by far the most inclusive financial technology we’ve ever had.</p>
<p>Emilie: Exactly.</p>
<p>Ben: Which brings me to my next question, which is some say, some very specific people say that crypto’s only use is for illicit or illegal behavior and they’ll even go further to say it’s or imply that it’s kind of most of illegal financing as crypto. How do you respond to that?</p>
<p>Emilie: It’s a myth. So, if you look at any study that actually has data behind, less than 1%, usually less than 0.5% of crypto transactions are deemed illicit. Whereas it’s estimated that 3% to 5% of cash transactions are illicit activity. And the blockchain is actually a terrible mechanism for illicit activity because it’s traceable. You have the Keystone pipeline, the vast majority of those funds were recovered because that was traceable. And even Hamas, I think in 2022, 2023 announced that they were no longer gonna be accepting Bitcoin because it was too traceable. So, it is a myth.</p>
<p>Ben: No Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Emilie: No Bitcoin for us, but yeah, we’ll take cash. I think it’s one of those things where it’s a convenient narrative, it’s a convenient soundbite. The data doesn’t map to it at all. So it is a total myth. And we have spent so much time, we have bank-level, if not better than bank-level compliance, knowing our customers, making sure that we’re checking for illicit activity. It’s a little disappointing to hear certain politicians trying to use that as the wedge to kind of drive crypto out of the United States because it’s just false.</p>
<p>Ben: Yeah. Interesting. Why do you think they’re trying to drive crypto out of the United States? Are they just confused about that? Or do they know that they’re not actually being totally straightforward and they have a separate agenda?</p>
<p>Emilie: I think it could be one of two things. I mean, I’ve talked to a lot of people in this town and I think there is a little bit of a scariness factor with new technologies. It feels complex and overwhelming, and so it’s just one of those things where, okay, maybe it’s illicit, maybe it’s not. It just feels like we don’t need to protect it at this moment. And then I think there is a nefarious element. I think there’s an element that is trying to promote an agenda either to protect the traditional banking system or potentially to foster the adoption of a CBDC or something where every citizen’s transactions are tracked and monitored in a way that I think most people should not be comfortable with, given the value we place on privacy. And so, I think that if you’re really kind of playing this out, some of the people who are promoting that agenda probably wanna be able to trace all of your transactions.</p>
<p>Ben: So, create a closed-end financial system. Trace everybody, cut off the money if they want to, that kind of thing. Interesting. Scary but interesting. All right, now you’re scaring me.</p>
<p>Coinbase, you guys started out, and when we invested, I believe you were basically a Bitcoin exchange. So, why do we need other crypto that’s not Bitcoin? And this kind of gets into this whole thing about the name of it, cryptocurrency. Is a currency the right way to think about it? Or is that just like bad naming again by those of us in technology?</p>
<p>Emilie: Yeah, I think Bitcoin is the gateway asset and I think it is proven so resilient and enduring. We were talking about the market cap last night. I think it’s at like…the crypto market cap is well over a trillion.</p>
<p>Ben: Yeah, it’s right below a trillion.</p>
<p>Emilie:&nbsp;And Bitcoin is just under a trillion. It’s never been hacked. It’s decentralized and it’s an incredible asset. I think it’s actually a store of value. It’s outperformed virtually every asset during its time of existence. But there’s other assets. And I think the way to think about this is that the world is going to be tokenized. So, we have more than 200 assets on our platform. Whether that’s Ethe or Solana or others, and it could be an NFT, it could be that we digitize real estate. It could be whatever…the whole world is likely to be tokenized at some point things are gonna be digitized. And so, it can be all sorts of different types of assets. And one of the things that I’ve always was excited about with Coinbase was that we weren’t picking an asset. We were a platform for those assets.</p>
<p>Ben: Interesting. And so, you’ve become kind of maybe necessarily more politically active. What motivated you to do that? Because you weren’t so much early on and particularly this election cycle, you’re super active. What motivated that? Why are you doing that? What are you doing?</p>
<p>Emilie: I think we’ve talked about the fact that crypto has been woefully naive of the way the game is played. And I think that we were always kind of optimistic that politicians would see the light and understand how important this technology was and that it would just kind of figure itself out. That clearly didn’t work. And I think that post the FTX and finance issues offshore, it makes it even more apparent that we need clear, sensible regulation here. And so to that end, we’ve done a few things, some in partnership with you. We have a grassroots organization that I mentioned called Stand With Crypto, which has 275,000 advocates. We’re gonna grow that and kind of rally the crypto army. The idea there is that a lot of these politicians have really active crypto constituents in their districts, and they don’t even understand.</p>
<p>I mean, one of the things that blows people’s minds when I tell them there’s 52 million Americans that hold crypto, like, it’s not a fringe thing anymore. It’s not this thing that’s off to the side. It’s actually a mainstream activity. And so, if you get these really vocal folks to come into these offices and help them understand, I’m trying to build products here. I’m trying to found great technological innovation in Michigan, in Ohio, and I don’t know if I’m safe to build this thing here. I don’t know if I should go move to Singapore with my friends who are also developing because there’s more knowns there about the safety of me building products there.</p>
<p>And then just generally Coinbase, we’re meeting with politicians, we’re meeting with regulators, we’re meeting with people who understand things like national security. So, we just formed an advisory council we’re really proud of. We have people like Mark Esper, the former secretary of defense who understand very acutely the national security issues inherent in allowing technologies to go offshore. We’re doing everything we can to make this a political force, especially 2024 is gonna be a really important election year.</p>
<p>Ben: Yeah. Yes. No, super important for crypto and for all of us. There are many large issues at stake.</p>
<p>Emilie: Yes. Many things. A lot of stake in many ways.</p>
<p>Ben: So, there’s been a tremendous amount of news about the Bitcoin ETF and you mentioned that most of them are at Coinbase. And so, what does it mean for Coinbase?</p>
<p>Emilie: Yeah. How many people in the room hold Bitcoin or some form of crypto?… I think it’s really an important signal in many ways and I think it’s gonna be ushering a new era of crypto. So, if you think about this, there were many who were never able to access Bitcoin in their current portfolios. They didn’t have a vehicle for that. So, having the most traditional, stodgy, frankly, conservative institutions offering this and actually advising that some portion of your portfolio should be in crypto, I think just it switches the mental math for folks. I think it makes it more legitimate. I think people crave a new asset class, and this is it. So, I think it’s going to usher in a new era of people holding crypto, starting with Bitcoin. So, I think that’s incredibly important. So, I think that’s going to influence the crypto market cap in a major way.</p>
<p>For Coinbase, specifically, we are the custodian on 8 of the 11 named ETFs. And so, it’s very important that we are playing that role because we’ve invested so much in compliance, security, and offering the best products to our customers that, to be named that, frankly, with the overhang of the SEC, just validates it even more that we’re here to stay and that this is the company for these products. So, we’re proud.</p>
<p>Ben: So, that brings me to kind of an interesting phenomenon, which is Coinbase is, you know, and we’ve evaluated this many times, by far the most compliant, the most secure, no question, SEC-approved public company in the space, like, by far. But you’re surrounded by some colorful, some fraudulent actors. And yet you’ve been harassed or, kind of, you know, targeted, investigated more than most of them. You know, it’s very frustrating for us as investors to see, you know, people kind of running these Ponzi schemes, casinos, and whatnot, and there’s no law enforcement, and then you’re getting a Wells notice. So, what can policymakers do to make the rules of the road such that the good actors who try to be compliant and stay within the law and protect consumers are rewarded and the criminals go to jail? Like, what can we do?</p>
<p>Emilie: Yeah. It is extremely frustrating. Like, I think when you think about us somehow getting penalized for FTX being a fraud of, like, Bernie Madoff proportions…and that year, post-FTX, was the hardest of my career because it felt like just all of the attention and focus was on us. As Ben mentioned, we went public in 2021, under the auspices of the SEC, we have substantially the exact same business that we had in 2021 when we went public under them. And we comply. We comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. We are regulated as a money service transmitter. The NYDFS, I mean, we comply with everything. We go above and beyond. To me, the number one thing we can do is pass legislation. There’s a bill called Fit 21, which was sponsored by Patrick McHenry. It’s a very simple bill and elegant in that way in the sense that it just simply says that the SEC would have jurisdiction over digital securities and the CFTC would have jurisdiction over commodities for spot. That kind of, like, just basic clarity is what we need to be able to operate our business without feeling this overhang of the regulator kind of overstepping its boundaries.</p>
<p>Ben: And what are the key, kind of, points that kind of separate the good guys from the bad guys?</p>
<p>Emilie: I mean, to me, if you think about it and boil it down to something very simple, it’s about knowing your customer. And I remember back in the day with FTX, people would be like, “How can you have so many compliance people? This is insane. Like, how can they operate with so few? What’s wrong with you guys?” And I always felt like, “Oh, my gosh. Like, what are we doing wrong? What am I not understanding? Are compliance people not as efficient? And ultimately it just turned out that we were doing the hard work of actually knowing our customers and putting them through the whole system to make sure that they were valid and to make sure we were monitoring for illicit transactions. That ultimately is the most important thing in a financial system because you don’t want illicit activity, and you wanna have tabs on what the activity is, and you wanna know that you have quality customers and that nobody’s trying to also steal from your customers or hack into them. So, that to me is the most paramount thing.</p>
<p>Ben: All right, great. Well, on that note we have run our time, so please join me in thanking Emilie for enlightening us on what’s going on in the world of crypto.</p>
<p>Emilie: Thank you.</p>

<p>In this session from the a16z <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit</a>, Representatives Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Jake Auchincloss (D-MA) discuss why the United States must strengthen its technological advantage in areas like AI, develop next-generation manufacturing capabilities domestically, and rethink how Silicon Valley does business with China. Gallagher is Chair of the House Select Committee on the CCP, on which Auchincloss also serves.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of their conversation:</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: The China threat, and this is an audience that would know it well, is a very broad topic, spanning from an app that might be on some people’s phones in the room, called TikTok, to Taiwan. What is the scope of the issue as you see it? And what should we be most concerned about? Big question. We’ll start with you, Congressman Gallagher.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Well, first of all, thank you for having me. Thanks, to all of you, for being part of this. I see a lot of friendly… I can’t really see, but I think I see some friendly faces in the audience.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Lots of friendly faces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: And some enemies, too. I see a lot of enemies, which is good. It means I’m doing something right. I think, to take your second question first, the risk, in simplest terms, from China, is war, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we tend to discount the possibility that Xi Jinping could do something as stupid as try to take Taiwan by force, because it does look irrational from a Western perspective, but if the collapse of deterrence in Ukraine has taught us anything, it’s that particularly when you’re dealing with autocratic systems who just don’t have robust feedback loops, they could do something that looks irrational from our perspective, that we think is deterred or deterrable, and yet from their perspective of preserving the regime, makes sense.</p>
<p>And so, my concern is that despite what’s happening in Ukraine, despite the fact that the system is blinking red across the world, despite the erosion of the conventional balance of power, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, we still have not fielded a deterrence by denial posture. That makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>And if you look at what just happened in Jordan, right? This is something that should have been obvious to anybody that watched the Iranian attack on the Saudi oil facility a few years ago, the Abqaiq oil facility. The army can’t do its one JROC, its one joint function, which is defense for our expeditionary bases against missiles and drones like this. We’re on the wrong side of the cost curve. Look at all the SM-6s we’ve expended in the Red Sea right now. We haven’t moved to maximum production rates of long-range precision fire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, beyond all the talk about decoupling and ideological warfare and TikTok, if we don’t get the hard power side of the equation right, we may stumble into war on someone else’s terms, and it’s going to be horrific. It will make the current crises in the Middle East and Ukraine look like child’s play in comparison. Other than that, I’m an optimist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Congressman Auchincloss, I’d love to hear your take on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: Yeah. I appreciate the chance to be here, and it’s good to be here with the chairman of the China Select Committee. I think America is going to out-compete China. I think we’re going to win this contest if we want to. And those are the four words that I spend a lot of time thinking about, “If we want to.” Because the competition between America and China is a competition of world views. China views individuals as pawns of the state. The United States was founded upon the timeless ideal that individuals have inherent worth and value. [00:03:00] And those are mutually inconsistent ways of approaching governance, of approaching economics, of approaching diplomacy and great power competition. And we must win. And we can, if we want to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the reason I am concerned about “if we want to” is that we are seeing increasing antibodies against the free and open society upon which the United States is premised. We’re seeing, on the right, this Blood and Soil nationalism, obviously articulated by Donald Trump, that is fundamentally about closing America off. And we see, on the hard left, a rejection of Western society and what it represents from the Enlightenment onwards. And both of those are wrong.</p>
<p>There is much for us to be proud of in what Western society has produced, and much of it has been crystallized in the U.S. form of government, and we should fight for it. But we should also fight for it, not as a Blood and Soil idea, but as the American Creed that every individual, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, should be free to pursue their aspirations in life.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: So one thing, from the outside looking in, it seems like there is bipartisan support agreement around how important this issue is. I’m sure there’s some sparring internally. It would be great to understand where you two are in alignment, where there’s consensus on the Committee, and then what are the major points of disagreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Yeah.</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: We’re laughing because, this morning, there was a little bit of fisticuffs on the Committee.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: I heard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: I’ll let the Chairman start though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: It’s all good. Well, I do think it gets to… Like, we are trying to do our committee’s work amidst what is a very fractious, political environment, right? And I have yet to meet the person who is enthusiastic about this Trump v Biden rematch. And so there is a big black hole that is the 2024 election sucking everything into its wake. And that is a challenge. It’s a challenge to get anything done in Congress on a good day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do think, and the last year of our committee’s work proves this, that there is broad agreement that, on the nature of the threat, that we must do something about it, that we’re not attacking it with a sense of urgency. When it comes to, I think the, sort of, military aspect of the competition, I actually think there’s more agreement than disagreement. On the ideological aspect of the competition, there’s disagreement within the Republican Party on what priority do you give ideological warfare. I give it a high priority, largely because Xi Jinping seems to think it’s important.</p>
<p>Having studied the collapse of the Soviet Union, he concluded that the main problem was insufficient commitment to ideology. And part of the reason we won the old Cold War is because Reagan was quite good at ideological warfare. But on the economic side, I actually don’t think it’s a clear “Republicans have an approach. Democrats have an approach.” There’s weird bedfellows. And I think Jake and I would agree on the fact, and he’s actually one of the loudest voices in his party for a pro…correct me if I’m wrong, a pro-trade agenda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And though we had somewhat of a disagreement about whether to revoke permanent normal trade relations with China, I think yes, Jake thinks no, I think we agree on the idea that as we adopt a more competitive economic relationship with China economically, we need to be enhancing intensifying our economic and technological partnerships with the rest of the world, and assume some intelligent risk.</p>
<p>And I do think the absence of a trade agenda is a huge grand strategic gap for both parties right now, if that makes sense. Just one… I think the primary point of disagreement sometimes is on the relative prioritization of climate change in the relationship with China as well as the prospect of engagement with the CCP at the highest levels, what that might yield. I’m more skeptical of that than some of my Democratic friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: I agree that it’s not always Democrat versus Republican where there’s disagreements. And I think the sort of productive dissent that I try to add into the committee is we spend a lot of time focusing on competition with China that can be zero-sum. It’s about export controls. It is about restrictions on licensing. It is about tariffs, obviously. It is about playing keep-away with intellectual property. And there is a place for that, and it’s important. But ultimately, I think in the Sino-American competition, 90% of the questions that matter are about America, not about China.</p>
<p>China’s got 1.4 billion people. They are a highly motivated, well-educated workforce. They’re going to create a bunch of impressive stuff. And the questions that I find most impactful for our future are about, are we investing in basic research and development? Are we trying to attract a high-skilled and, frankly, low-skilled immigration to the U.S. economy, which keeps us dynamic? Do we have rule of law and contract enforcement? Are we investing in quality infrastructure? Like, the boring stuff that we should be focused on before Washington gets distracted by quantum strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And my contention is here, in Washington, we’re not doing a good enough job in the boring stuff. We should take care of that. We should be asking ourselves, “Hey, in the latest PISA tests, Programme for International Student Assessment, American 15-year-olds went backwards on math scores.” That is what should be animating us. Because if American 15-year-olds can’t do math, we’re not out-competing anybody. I don’t care what our semiconductor strategy is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Yeah.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Yeah. Well, speaking of semiconductor strategy, that is one thing that is top of mind for this audience, for our founders, chip production. You know, it is something that if it is catastrophically disrupted… I would love to hear how you’re thinking about worst-case scenario, you know, how you even think about how to respond if something like that were to come to pass in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Specifically with Taiwan? Well, I guess one of the reasons, though it’s not the only reason, that Taiwan is important because if there was even a blockade scenario that played out, it would be profoundly disruptive to the global economy. We’re talking trillions of dollars lost in even the low-end modeling for something like this.</p>
<p>And then if they were somehow able to take Taiwan, which admittedly is a very hard problem, just from a pure… Like, invading an island and doing an amphibious assault is a hard problem. Jake’s a marine, I’m a marine, this is something that we are raised to understand. Zach Shore is a marine, I think, although he was mostly drinking the entire time with me. We were roommates in Carlsbad. Luckily, Facebook had just started, so none of it’s online. So, just sneaked under the radar. It’s mutually assured destruction, bro. It’s like, “You launch your missiles. I’m launching mine.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I also think maybe the conceptual mistake we made with the CHIPS Act…and I know there’s disagreement about the CHIPS Act, is that onshoring production of semiconductors to America would somehow enhance deterrence, but I wonder if the opposite could be true, right? The more we onshore, the less relevant Taiwan is, and therefore the more attractive of a target it is. Or, just as a question of investment, would it have been better to fund a CHIPS Act in order to make an invasion impossible, if not highly unlikely? Because even if they don’t establish a lodgment in an invasion, it’s gonna massively muck up the entire global economy.</p>
<p>But the economic reason is not the only reason Taiwan is important. If Taiwan falls, it will make our ability to fulfill our treaty commitments with Japan and the Philippines impossible. Las Vegas rules do not apply. What happens there will not stay there. And though we’ve had a brutal…and this is the third reason, debate about the nature and role of democracy promotion in American foreign policy, there’s something different in my mind about fending an existing, vibrant democracy from an authoritarian threat, that if America doesn’t stand for that, I’m just not sure what we stand for.</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: So we should also stand for Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Agree. Yeah.</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: Let’s do it. Tell your speaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: I will stand right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: So, one thing that’s also on the agenda for this week… and I know we’re jumping around a lot, but you all cover such breadth on the committee, is you’re holding the CCC cyber threat to the homeland and national security hearing tomorrow. Most citizens, when they think about cyber threats until recently, they didn’t think about attacks on critical infrastructure, things that could take out the power grid by nation-states. What you’ve learned about these threats, how do you assure the American people that things are going to be all right? Or is it actually a bad scenario that we should be very concerned about as citizens?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: It’s a legitimate threat and we need to harden our targets. Electoral systems, public water supplies, utilities. They’ve made big strides in the last five years, and it’s been a bipartisan issue under CSUN&nbsp; and Homeland Security to make themselves harder targets. A source of good jobs for young people as well. Massachusetts has created a lot of good cyber security certificates around this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But actually, the, sort of, digital threat I’m by far the most concerned about is TikTok. We are ceding the ideological ground to our adversary to inculcate the next generation of Americans into a worldview that is really, I think, antithetical to a lot of what we stand for, and the Chairman has been articulate about this in the free press, which I read your essay on that.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Oh, wow. Thank you. I read all your stuff, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: I think we’ve got to force a sale… We would never have allowed CBS, ABC, NBC to be owned by the Soviet Union in the 1960s. And that is, I think, if anything, understating the degree of influence that we are seething right now. And that’s not a speech issue. You can post whatever you want. It’s a question of reach. Just because we honor and respect the First Amendment, does not mean that we have to allow our biggest adversary to control, in a black box, an algorithm that influences hundreds of millions of people. That is not free speech. That is the control over reach.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: I just want to foot-stomp that and say, yes, there’s a concern with TikTok, that it can track your location and your browser history. That’s a huge problem for Zach in particular. But that’s not the primary threat. And Jake, I think, said it well. I mean, to allow a company that is owned by ByteDance, which is beholden to the Chinese Communist Party, to be the dominant news platform for the next generation of Americans, borders on national suicide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And by the way, if you are invested in ByteDance, I would assume you want TikTok to go public in America. That’s not going to happen under the current ownership structure. So it is in your interest for there to be a complete separation where none of the plumbing is connected and an American company controls TikTok U.S. and Douyin does Douyin things and there’s control of the algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And just one final note on cyber. I do think, having chaired the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, beyond all the fancy things we can do, like giving CSA the ability to do threat hunting on .gov networks, I think it all just comes down to human beings, right? Our biggest threats are human threats, a contractor doing something they shouldn’t do. And our successes will be a function of our ability to get the best and the brightest in cyber to work with DoD and the federal government.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Now, speaking of TikTok, many are concerned about the way that the tech community engaged with China in previous decades, how it engages now. What are your thoughts about the right way that technologists, that companies, should be engaging with China on a host of issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Listen, I don’t think anyone expects Andreessen or some tech company to be the State Department, but, I mean, if social justice or ESG is a big deal for you and your employees, I just would ask you to recognize that there’s no worse ESG actor and no greater offender of social justice issues than the Chinese Communist Party. They suck on the E, the S, and they really suck on the G. The G stands for anything. It’s the stand for genocide. So, speak up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: We’re asking American companies to act like American companies.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: I mean, listen, Jake mentioned an issue that I think you’d think there’s no agreement on, immigration. And listen, immigration politics, speaking of things that suck, they really suck. But I wonder if our framework is actually the same, right? Like, make it difficult, if not impossible, for people to come here illegally. But when it comes to legal immigration, modernize the system where it could scale up or down depending on the needs of our economy. And then when it comes to high-skilled immigration, and you want all these smart people, like, we should actively be on a recruiting mission around the world to scoop up the best and the brightest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: I’m gonna… Guys, don’t applaud that from him because I’m gonna throw a red flag on that play. Because we do have a Republican talking about immigration reform when…</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Things were going so well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: &nbsp;…we get Speaker Johnson and Mitch McConnell saying the quiet part out loud here, which is that they’d rather campaign on immigration than govern on it. And that’s not you, Mike, saying that, but at a certain point, the Republican Party is going to own the fact that, for 20 years, they’ve been telling the American people that immigration is broken. We have, in good faith, a bill to start fixing it, and the Speaker has said it’s dead on arrival.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Do we have the bill? I’m actually not… This isn’t, like, a rebuttal. I don’t… And people keep asking me about the deal. I just don’t know what the deal is. I haven’t seen it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: I was on “Fox News” on Saturday, and as far as “Fox News” is concerned, it is anathema. And it’s because…&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: If “Fox News” says we can’t vote on it.</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: …they’re cherry-picking the numbers. You’ve got Senator McConnell killing it. You’ve got Speaker Johnson killing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Damn you, Lachlan Murdoch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: We have overlap on the policy, but on the politics, I just, I do feel like one side is serious about it and the other side has not been as serious about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Yeah. Well, moving to a more hopeful note. You know, 10 years ago, you know, when I first moved to Silicon Valley, no one was talking about China. I would actually say, even five years ago, no one was talking about China. I would love to hear from your perspective. You know, we have a number of great founders where that is the focal point of their business now. It is top of mind for engineers and for founders in Silicon Valley. How have you experienced that shift with Silicon Valley? And do you think it’s making real progress in the eyes of what you’re building towards as well?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: I’m going to actually put that question back on you. I mean, you’re the one running the American Dynamism portfolio. And I would imagine that “The Specter of China” has galvanized some of the entrepreneurs that you work with to want to work with the United States government, which is not a particularly fun customer to have to deal with.</p>
<p>But they’ve said, “If we’re serious about being in the 21st century what we became in the 20th century, the guarantor of the Pax Americana and the shining light, we have to do housing, we have to do military, we got to do utilities, we got to do energy,” all the stuff that, I think, in the first boom out of Silicon Valley, was really overlooked. So I think that’s inspiring. And I would just encourage everyone here to keep pushing the U.S. government to be a better customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I say this all the time to the Department of Defense, “We do not need the Department of Defense to be a venture capitalist. We don’t need it to be an equities investor. We need the Department of Defense to be a good, reliable, expeditious customer.” And until they get that right, I don’t think we’re going to fully realize the possibilities of your portfolio.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: I’m actually cautiously optimistic here. And it’s not just because we now have… I’ve always wanted to do, like, a time-lapse photo of the banner of sponsors at the Reagan National Defense Forum. And I actually think it tells a good story about new and interesting companies who want to work with DoD.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Definitely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Or at least want to hang out with me for two days at Reagan. We’ve had outspoken voices, obviously, who I think are great, like Dr. Karp at Palantir, like Palmer Luckey. Is he here? Is he wearing shoes?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Not this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/uSaE2KVE5Ig">He was here last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Andruil. But I think there’s more people that want to get in that game, and want to try and break down the barriers to working with DoD. And it is ultimately, however, to Jake’s point, going to take DoD actually making big bets on a few companies that are non-primes. Because we just keep admiring the Valley of Death problem. And that’s, sort of, the less hopeful side of the equation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go to Reagan, almost every year the secretary comes, it doesn’t matter if it was Mattis or now Austin, it gives the same speech about “We’re gonna cross the Valley of Death,” and this and that, and that’s where we just need to appropriate money to DoD, right? We’re talking about a supplemental right now. What are we supplementing? We haven’t actually passed the DoD appropriation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then we have to force DoD to make big bets on things. And then we in Congress have to make sure that if some of those bets don’t work out, which they all won’t, that we won’t just rake them over the coals. We need to celebrate original mistakes while vilifying and demonizing making the same mistakes over and over again.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: So this is the question that’s going to allow our audience to dream, but if there were a President Auchincloss or a President Gallagher, how would that administration address the relationship with China and technology differently? Would it be different? What would you do tactically?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Well, Jake and I are here today to announce… I would love to be president of an obscure liberal arts university. Actually, the politics of that would be…</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Would be brutal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: Yeah, no, you wouldn’t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Yeah, well, you want to tackle that first?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: if I were president, how would I tackle the U.S.-China technological relationship?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Yeah, is there something tactical you would do on day one?</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: So, and this is, I think, a point of, I think, a genuine maybe intellectual disagreement here. Jake Sullivan has talked about a small garden with a high fence and this idea that there are some things that we’re gonna protect with all measures available. I would be a little bit tougher on how we describe that garden than, I think, the current approach is. Because I worry that it becomes really an excuse for lobbying, frankly, where every industry comes and tells us how strategic they are. And ultimately, it actually makes our economy more sclerotic and less dynamic.</p>
<p>I would… I’m persuaded that cutting-edge semiconductors belong in that garden. I have not been persuaded of basically anything else. I believe in markets that have global access, particularly for high R&amp;D, high fixed cost industries that are so important for our future utilities, biotech, semiconductors, etc. And so, I really…I want to see the maintenance and expansion of the U.S. operating system as a global commercial entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: So I would…and I actually do think this is… And Jake’s descent on some of our econ recommendations was productive. I think it made the final product better, and I respect his position. I would cut off the flow of U.S. capital, both [00:22:00] passive and active, public and private, to a greater number of sectors. I think a sector-specific set of guardrails is actually much easier to implement than the multi-list whack a mole we currently play right now, which is a total shambles.</p>
<p>And so we have billions, probably hundreds of billions of dollars, American dollars, that are flowing into Chinese technology and military companies that are building things like aircraft carriers, artillery shells, fighter jets, things that are designed to kill Americans in a future conflict. And I think that’s perverse. I think we should close the loopholes for licensing exemptions. Like, right now, Huawei is off the mat. It’s coming back with semiconductors in part because they still have access to U. S. technology, right? We’re funding our own destruction. To me, it’s crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would tighten up our CFIUS loopholes so that people can’t buy land, for example, near military bases or critical infrastructure. But…and maybe this is where we agree, on the positive side, I’ve long argued for it, we need a gold standard free trade agreement with the U.K. post-Brexit that could have a docking provision that other countries could join.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to AUKUS, I give the Biden administration a ton of credit for AUKUS, but in some ways, the most important part of AUKUS is not the Pillar 1 nuclear sub thing. Which, we could screw that up. We should not screw that up. That’s a big deal. We need to build more subs, 2.5 Virginias a year. Let’s do that. Pillar 2 on the technology side, we still have all these outdated barriers to cooperation with the Aussies and the Brits. Our closest allies. Who doesn’t love the Aussies and the Brits?</p>
<p>Because of ITAR regulation, we can’t share our best technology and people. That’s a huge own goal. I would be for a digital trade agreement. Like, we have IPEF, which is our only trade thing in Indo-Pac, is not a real thing, and it’s less of a real thing now that they’ve neutered IPEF, and it was neutered to start with.</p>
<p>So I think, again, to get to the basic balance, I would adopt a more restrictive framework with respect to China and our bilateral relationship, but in return, and simultaneously, I would deepen our engagement with other countries and assume some intelligent risk in the rest of the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: So I want to end with a personal question from my 88-year-old aunt in Chicago. A couple months ago, I sent her a video of Palmer Luckey, and she called me very upset, said, “Katie, I didn’t know that I needed to be worried about China too.” And I think that’s something that a lot of Americans feel. The world feels like it’s on fire. It feels like another thing that they have to worry about. The work you’re doing, what can you tell my 88-year-old aunt and other Americans that would assuage their fears and make them feel like we’re on the right course on the China threat?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Well, don’t be sending your grandma Palmer Luckey.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: I really shouldn’t have. I regret it. I sure… No. Eighty-eight-year-old aunt, but yeah, I shouldn’t have done it. I shouldn’t have done it.</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: I’m sure Palmer sends his grandma videos. I’ll give you a hopeful story that happened this week in my district. And I think it gets to, sort of, the generational…she’s part of the greatest generation. The boomers screwed it up, they continue to screw it up, there should be no boomers allowed to run for president ever. Although Biden’s not a boomer. He’s so old, he’s not a boomer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Silent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: He’s a member of the greatest generation, or the silent generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Silent generation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He’s older than the People’s Republic of China, if you can believe it. True. Fact-check me. Fact-check me. Okay. We had an event in my district, like, six years ago. I was a new member of Congress. We dedicated this fitness trail to an army general who had passed away unexpectedly. His widow raised the money. It was a beautiful thing. This girl came up to me. She was in eighth grade at the time. Raised by her grandparents. Shawano, Wisconsin, rural area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And she’s like, “You know what? This event has so inspired me, and General Cohen’s example inspired me. Like, I want to go to a service academy one day.” Well, on Wednesday, this week… I’m going to get a little choked up. No, I’m not. I got to tell this young lady that she got an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. Just, like, incredible, young American, like… Man, it’s awesome. So, there’s still humans like that in America. Patriots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: Yeah, he stole my answer. I would tell her to join me on my phone calls telling young people they got appointed to the service academies. You read those resumes, you look at their achievements, and then you talk to them about why they want to serve, and it is restorative for your sense of optimism. And to tell them to come knock on doors with me in my district and you find, talking to the average American, there’s a deep reservoir of common sense and decency that, in aggregate, gives me great hope that America is a land of possibilities, and don’t bet against us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike Gallagher: Awesome.</p>
<p>Katherine Boyle: Congressman Auchincloss, Gallagher, this was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Jake Auchincloss: Thank you.</p>

<p>Technology companies have rediscovered their roots as innovators in national security and as critical partners to the Department of Defense. In this session from the a16z <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit</a>, moderated by CNBC anchor Morgan Brennan, Anduril Cofounder and CEO Brian Schimpf lays out the case for how and why technology plays a critical role in helping ensure a safer world.</p>
<p>Here is a transcript of their conversation:</p>
<p>Morgan Brennan: It’s great to be on stage with you. It’s great to be here with everybody in the audience as well. There’s a lot to get to, but the first place I want to start is, we just had the Deputy Defense Secretary present on stage. She was talking about innovation, the intersection of Silicon Valley and DOD, government work. As somebody who’s on the other side of that equation, and what I will call, use the word, disruptor, in terms of breaking into defense and doing more work with the Pentagon, your thoughts?</p>
<p>Brian Schimpf: Well, I think, you know, I’ve been working in the defense space for maybe 15, 17 years now. And when I first started out, it was just impossible to break in, right? It was impossible to imagine new companies could do anything of substance. It was just sort of scratching at the surface. Fast forward now, you know, to even when we started Anduril, it was still hard to imagine that you could have new entrants doing anything large and at scale, new companies working on weapons. Larger aircraft just didn’t seem plausible, especially ones that focus on software. Today we’re at a place where, you know, we’re fortunate to be able to disclose we’re working with the Air Force on the Loyal Wingman project, which is an incredibly big change from where we were when we even started with this.</p>
<p>And I think the reality of how this is, you know, you’re going to see change in the department, how you’re going to see change of making this an area where the best technology, the best technologists want to work is actually allowing new entrants to do things at scale. Like, that is the bottom line, right?</p>
<p>And we’re starting to see areas where that is true. I think Replicator is another great example where the focus of this, on actually deploying at scale, becomes very, very key and not just having these kind of surfaced small-scale things. So that shift is wildly different than what it was when we started, and we’re incredibly excited that this is now feeling very possible. Whereas when we started, it was not obvious that this was going to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: There’s a lot there for me to unpack with you. And the first place I’m going to start is the fact that it has started to become easier. I mean, there are more and more…we see it in the amount of investment dollars that are going into defense tech right now.</p>
<p>There are more and more companies and startups that are aspiring to work with the DOD. But you still hear the term over and over again, Valley of Death. Anduril is still an exception. Maybe it’s one of the leaders, but it’s few and far between in terms of companies being able to work with DOD and in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Brian: Yeah, I mean, look, I think the hard reality with this is it’s just like venture, it’s just like any sort of industry where there aren’t going to be 500 success stories. That is unlikely to be the case, right? And I think if we enter a world where we’ve doubled the number of companies that are bidding on these large-scale programs, that is a huge accomplishment, right? I think that is a goal we should aspire to.</p>
<p>And I think the reality with this is a lot of the areas that are going to succeed are often the ones that are less&nbsp; popular. It’s areas working on weapons, like, this is not an area that a lot of companies are interested in doing. But I think to succeed in the defense space, you have to be willing to actually solve the core problems of this. And I think those are the companies that are going to succeed best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: So it’s the idea of making patriotism cool again.</p>
<p>Brian: I completely agree. I think it’s always been cool, but maybe it’s time to rejuvenate it a little bit.</p>
<p>Morgan: Okay, do you want to talk about CCA, which is the Loyal Wingman program for the Air Force? Huge moment here earlier this month that Anduril was unveiled as one of the companies that’s now working with the Air Force on this program, talking about autonomous fighter jets. I guess just walk me through what that looks like, especially since there’s still a down-select to go.</p>
<p>Brian: Yeah, so I’m somewhat limited in what I’m allowed to say in terms of like some of the specifics of it. But what I will say about it is, you know, the Air Force has done an amazing job of constructing an opportunity to really look at how can they use acquisition strategy, how they’re buying these things to curate the industrial base in a different way, right?</p>
<p>They’re looking at how do we have multiple participants in this? And these are a different class of systems. I think, unlike something like an F-35 where it’s only feasible to afford one provider of this, you can start to look at for this, for weapon systems, for a variety of these things, carrying multiple people to be able to really incentivize the industrial base to invest in this.</p>
<p>And I think that’s a really big deal. And I think the idea that they would… They’re looking at new entrants and new ways of production really as an indication that they are trying to move forward in new ways of doing business. So it’s a very exciting time for us. I think it’s a huge opportunity that they’ve created to show the Defense Department is serious about really expanding here, whereas there’s just no other kind of major programs out there that are in that same class right now.</p>
<p>It’s harder to imagine on a destroyer or a large capital ship. But on this class of technologies, on weapons technologies, I think it is ripe for new approaches and new ways of thinking and a new industrial base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: How does it speak to how the threat landscape is changing and what that means in terms of the capabilities that are needed for the warfighter in this future environment?</p>
<p>Brian: So if we look at what we’ve learned in Ukraine, the sheer quantities of systems, the amount that’s put at risk, and a lot of the assumptions that the U.S. has had historically about how we fight are very, very different. Air superiority becomes incredibly hard. Everything’s at risk all the time.</p>
<p>And the amount of warfighters and servicemen that are going to be at risk is much, much higher. And I think we can assume similar things for any conflict going forward. The ability to use autonomous systems is in effect like a new way of operating. Whereas, you know, F-35s and all these were sort of incremental improvements to a conventional way we’ve been fighting for quite a long time. How we actually adopt these new autonomous technologies is very much going to change how we think about warfighting. I think that’s something that still has to be explored and understood fully. And I think the U.S. leading on that is absolutely critical. We know that China is investing in similar technologies. We know they’re gonna move out on it. Having the U.S. in a leadership position on this, establishing norms, establishing ethics is absolutely critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: Replicator, Secretary Hicks just touched on it when she was on stage as well. Speaking of, very ambitious initiative to field thousands of autonomous systems and drones over the next couple of years here for warfighter needs. In Pentagon parlance, a couple of years, rather than 6 years, or 10 years, or 20 years, I mean, that’s a very fast pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian: Yeah.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: Are you working on Replicator, to the extent you can speak to that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian: Yeah, so there’s a number of technologies we have that are, I think, in that range. Like the secretary said, nothing’s been officially announced yet.</p>
<p>So you know, it’s all technologies that we very much believe in for this sort of regime. The part that I think is so interesting about the Replicator area is exactly what Secretary Hicks said, which is they are moving at a wildly faster pace than they have before. They’re using the power of, you know, senior leadership to mobilize and force change into the department that otherwise would kind of move and incrementally adopt these new things over a very slow period of time.</p>
<p>You know, an acquisition we’ve had, a system that we’ve had that’s dialed around, you know, large-scale aircraft carriers and F-35s, when you start thinking about the pace that this technology moves, it’s just not the same thing. So forcing this new system to come into existence to actually force technologies through this is exactly right, and it’s very aligned with the class of technologies we’ve been building and thinking about for years. How do we have higher quantities of smarter systems out in the environment? And so that’s exactly spot on to the types of things we’ve wanted to see since the beginning.</p>
<p>Morgan: What’s really curious, what’s really fascinating to me about Anduril is that your business model is a little different as well in terms of this, because the hardware is built and designed to enable and propel the software. And the way you design and develop some of these products is in anticipation of where the threats are going to come from and where those capabilities are headed, even if the DOD hasn’t necessarily gotten there yet, or at least officially. I wonder where you think this is all headed now and whether the U.S. is moving quickly enough to keep up with that technology and the rate of adoption that’s going to be necessary against a China or the like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian: So I think adoption’s the right way to think about it. So, you know, one of the things that I like about Replicator is probably one of the first at-scale opportunities to buy things in the way that every other industry in the world buys them.</p>
<p>You state what capabilities you need and you find what’s on the market and you buy it. You haven’t paid for R&amp;D, you’re not paying for development, you’re not plotting out the progress over a 10-year period of where this technology needs to go and shepherding it the whole time. It is very much, you know, the closest thing we’ve seen to a free-market approach to how you do defense innovation. And I think that’s exactly right. And that’s the type of approach we’ve argued for.</p>
<p>In terms of where do we invest, where do we see this going, and what are some of the problems we’re trying to tackle, there’s a whole span of these things. But one area I’d focus on is on the counter-drone side. So obviously the attack on Tower 22 is very tragic, and it’s the type of thing that I think is going to, frankly, increase in frequency. We’ve seen, you know, hundreds of attacks on U.S. bases already. This mirrors a lot of the types of attacks that we’ve seen in Ukraine. And the one thing we can say for sure is that the technology that the adversaries have is now pervasive. Nearly every country has what is the equivalent of cruise missiles. It is very rapidly iterating. So it’s gone from these sort of small little drones to now jet-powered capabilities that are coming from Iran.</p>
<p>The space is moving very, very quickly, and so we’ve invested in technologies, for example, our Roadrunner technology, which is a vertical, takeoff-and-landing, counter-air drone basically, it’s a counter-drone drone. We’ve invested in this with the idea that this needs to be designed for where the threat is going to go over the next five years. That’s really where we’ve tried to push this.</p>
<p>And so, I think there’s areas like that where you can kind of really see the threat, understand where this is going to go, extrapolate very effectively and build and field these technologies quickly. I mean, it was just like under two years from when we started from never having done a weapons program to having a fielded weapon capability. And that’s a very fast timeline. We wish it was faster. I think we could do it faster next time. But it was just an incredible pace. And I think you’ll see, one, you have the demand, the clear need, and the urgent problems, you will drive innovation. And if you can actually scale it, that will drive business and investors to be there.</p>
<p>Morgan: I want to get into the scale piece of this because this is crucial to this conversation. Are you already selling Roadrunners?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian: Yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: You just unveiled them a couple months ago.</p>
<p>Brian: That’s right. Yes. So we have a number of U.S. government customers and a lot of international interest where this is a very pervasive threat, right? And the U.S. has underinvested in air defense capabilities for the last 20 or 30 years, right? We’ve had full air superiority. We didn’t need to invest. It wasn’t the critical problems that we had. And so the ability to counter these threats was sort of underinvested in for the last several decades.</p>
<p>As a result, we’re shooting Patriot missiles and advanced air-to-air missiles at these $100,000 threats shooting $2 million missiles at them. It’s incredibly expensive. The missiles work very well, but there’s much cheaper ways to start to solve this problem. So we’ve had an immense amount of demand because it is such an urgent and critical problem to address from everywhere that you see this happening today.</p>
<p>Morgan: So the scale piece of this, we can talk about innovation. We can talk about designing and developing and offering new products. How quickly can you scale that manufacturing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brian: This is a big part that we’ve invested in, and my belief is the traditional industrial base in the U.S. for defense is often at the point of retirement. You have people who largely built this up during the Cold War. They’re retiring. Their kids don’t want to run these facilities. And it’s become a critical problem and a critical gap, but there is a new generation of manufacturing companies in the U.S. doing more advanced things. Shout out to Chris Power at Hadrian, sorry for stealing your talking points on this, but it’s spot on, like, there’s more advanced ways you can actually scale this with more automation, more smart approaches, and taking a lot of commercial innovation in that.</p>
<p>And that’s something we’ve heavily invested in. So, our belief is this is a solvable problem, you can take advantage of commercial innovation on this, and there should be no capacity constraints over any sort of five-year period to actually be able to produce these systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: All right, we have less than a minute left. So with that in mind, I do want to ask, because you have, at Anduril, helped forge the path here in terms of being a newer company, a newer defense contractor, working with the DOD on programs of record and in a meaningful, consistently revenue-generating way. What are your words of wisdom to others in the room that are either investing in other startups or starting their own startups and looking to, I guess, following footsteps in their own ways?</p>
<p>Brian: I think the single most important thing is if you’re solving a critical warfighter need on a problem that urgently needs to be solved, you can be successful. I think the trap for most people is they’re solving a problem that would be great to solve, but doesn’t have the urgency and isn’t going to move the needle for the department in a meaningful way. And rationally, the department is going to pick those things that actually are going to be able to scale and change the game for them. So really focusing on those problem sets that you’re actually going to have a meaningful impact, that is the most critical aspect of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan: Brian Schimpf, Anduril Industries, CEO.</p>
<p>Brian: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>At January’s <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit</a>, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks discussed the Department of Defense’s renewed commitment to innovation and the department’s new Replicator initiative, which is accelerating how the DoD procures and delivers capabilities to the warfighter at speed and scale. (Read her <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/3660659/remarks-by-deputy-secretary-of-defense-kathleen-hicks-collaborative-disruption/">full remarks here</a>.) </p>
<p>Following her keynote remarks, Dep. Sec. Hicks sat down for an interview with Wall Street Journal national security and foreign policy editor Sharon Weinberger. Here is a transcript of their conversation:</p>
<p>Sharon Weinberger: I wanted to start off with a more somber note of what you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN75v_jiLWA&amp;t=655s">referenced in your speech</a> talking about the tragic loss of life of the three U.S. service members. Is that, I realize it’s still early days in terms of what happened, but counter-UAS, counter-drone systems have been a big topic. It’s an area where a lot of companies are trying to innovate. Is this an area where there are lessons to be learned from that and ways to accelerate technologies to the battlefield?</p>
<p>Kathleen Hicks: Absolutely. First of all, I think it’s about our 165th attack on us using those sorts of techniques, largely UAS, but a variety of techniques. This one hit, it took three U.S. service members and wounded many more. And that is absolutely unacceptable to the United States. And, you know, that’s an issue that is being worked very closely, as I’m sure those watching the news have seen, by the President. It is an area we have been very focused on, counter-UAS. And, yes, we absolutely know we need to continue to evolve there.</p>
<p>So, software-driven Ukraine more than anywhere else has shown the rapid pace of iteration in terms of the development of the technologies and the capabilities. Again, a lot of it is software, there are some other aspects. Without the budget, it’s very, very hard for us. There are great limitations on what we can do under a continuing resolution. We have some rapid acquisition authorities. We are using everything we have. But there are, just frankly, limits to not having the government functioning as it should, and we need that 2024 budget.</p>
<p>Sharon: On Replicator, which you both acknowledge, there’s a lot of excitement and also questions about it. It sounds like you’re committed to the August 2025 timeline for it. What is the metric for success? When you get to that point, what are the concerns? What are the things that would say, “That didn’t quite work out as we planned or that worked out great?” How do you measure that?</p>
<p>Kathleen: I think there are a couple of different measures. The first is, did we meet that goal across multiple domains in the thousands in the timeline, 18 to 24 months? We know it’s an audacious goal. We set it at the beginning. I’m confident we’re doing everything on track to get there. We’re going meet that goal. But the real payoff, even though that’s real payoff to the warfighter. If you talk to the INDOPACOM team, they’re very excited by what we hope to deliver. The real payoff is, you know, not trying to hack the system in one particular way but to transform the system at DOD.</p>
<p>Replicator, as I said, is the latest of our efforts. It actually quite very clearly, for those who are kind of following the game, building on work we’ve done in Raider and CAP, sorry to throw up more acronyms. But very clearly driving down the risk, burning down risk for our processes inside the building, trying to identify where we are in our own way, or maybe where there’s some frozen middle issues that get stuck. So, another aspect of success beyond the immediate is, are we able to then take this, bring it into other areas, and transform the system to speed it up?</p>
<p>Sharon: Another thing you talked about is just this tremendous amount of private investment venture capital going into defense. We recently wrote about the 100 billion that’s gone in since 2021. But one of the concerns from those companies and from those investors is that it’s not being matched yet by acquisition dollars. Is that a concern for you? And how do we actually change that?</p>
<p>Kathleen: Yeah, so first of all, I think that, I really would hit that our procurement budget request for ’24 is, you know, the highest set in peacetime, you know, era or second highest in the peacetime era in 35 years. So, it’s not that we don’t have money going into acquisition. The question is, what are we acquiring? Are we acquiring what the warfighter needs and are we acquiring everything we think the warfighter needs? Well, we’ve always had to make hard choices. So, there’s no surprise that we will continue to have to make trade-offs.</p>
<p>I think what I would stress is, as we innovate and move through the changing nature of warfare, again, shaping that changing nature of warfare, we know so much of what is in that shift is software-defined, and also could be manufactured much more rapidly through advanced manufacturing. There are a lot of areas, biotech, I could think of others, that are driven right now by the commercial sector. So, as we shift in the nature of warfare, there’s more and more opportunity for non-traditionals and service providers to be a part of that procurement story. So, lots of dollars go into procurement, that’s not the issue. The issue is, are we able to buy what we need and are we thinking far enough ahead to what the shape of warfare needs to be?</p>
<p>Sharon: So, what, in that view, does the defense industrial base look like in, you know, we could say five years, 10 years time, are there more than five primes? Are there a dozen primes? How does that actually look in terms of a successful change in strategy?</p>
<p>Kathleen: I don’t think there’s a pre-definition of number of primes. I think it is important to have competition in the defense industrial base. There’s no doubt about it. And we know small business is a huge driver of that. Pardon me. So we work very hard on trying to drive up the percent of our procurement and investment that is going to those small businesses. With apologies. But I don’t think I would try to guess here today how many primes there would be. I think the whole nature of what constitutes the defense industrial base, we need to shift that mental model.</p>
<p>The American industrial base is the defense industrial base. We obviously have traditional providers we greatly value. We need them. We need them to stay at the cutting edge and we continue to work hard with them. But, you know, it’s very clear to everyone, including them, that teaming with other parts of the economy, understanding the new areas of innovation, compute, others, is incredibly vital to growing where we need to go in defense.</p>
<p>Sharon: You talked about this long history of cooperation that goes back decades between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon. There have also been periods where there’s been a rift, most notably after the Vietnam War period, and then there was a big effort to heal that rift. We’ve clearly come a long way. Are there still issues there? Is there still a need to overcome some of the hesitancy of tech Silicon Valley to work with the Pentagon or do you feel like we’re pretty much where we need to be?</p>
<p>Kathleen: I think that’s a constant refrain for us. And we focus very much on as a department across administrations, you know, I think there has been a strong focus on making sure that companies wanna work with us. We know part of that is making sure we represent the values of the nation. And we lean forward on that. That’s always been important for the United States in terms of bringing the commercial sector in to work with government. So we continue to do that today. I don’t think we are in a crisis phase, to use your Vietnam analogy. And I do think, as I said in my remarks, that the PRC did a lot of that work by comparison. And the types of both their military activities and the types of coercive strategies they use working with companies have done a lot to turn others to looking to how you can work with us.</p>
<p>I will stress one area that we’ve been very clear about is our responsible AI approach and a responsible autonomy approach. That’s decades-long, but we continue to evolve it as the technology evolves. We have Project Lima right now, which is looking at large language models. Safety is vital to effectiveness for us. These aren’t trade-offs, they’re one and the same. So, we look at how to adopt innovations in a way that’s safe for our warfighters and, again, reflective of American values. And we’ll continue to do that.</p>
<p>Sharon: You actually preempted my next question, which is on Lima, on that task force, looking at generative AI, where is it at? What do you see coming out of that? What are the issues it’s looking at, if you could expand on that?</p>
<p>Kathleen: Sure. So they are looking at hundreds of use cases to identify, what’s the right framework for the department? This spring is when that information comes forward to the CDAO and then to me and the Secretary thereafter. So, I anticipate getting some feedback on where there are use cases that are ready to go today if there are those, and the other areas where we need to do more work. But we work closely with all the major generative AI, you know, providers and would-be providers to make sure we’re lashed up. We’re very enthusiastic to work with them. We just have to do it in a way that actually delivers for the warfighter.</p>
<p>Sharon: You spoke about both Ukraine and then the challenge from China. There have been a lot of new technologies deployed in Ukraine. In some ways, it’s been almost, I think some people have compared it to a test lab for things like UAVs, for drones. What are some of the lessons learned out of that from your perspective of the technologies that have been deployed there?</p>
<p>Kathleen: Sure. I think what I would stress for the U.S. really has been the proliferation of space, low Earth orbit satellites, in particular, and communications, that the commercial sector really drove. That’s been a clear, that ability to communicate and have masts that’s distributed has paid off. I think when you look at autonomy, it’s a more mixed picture in terms of exactly how it has evolved, where it has provided benefit. And we take all of those lessons away. I think one piece that the United States has an advantage on over other competitors is that when innovation happens down at the unit level, we know how to bring that up and scale it.</p>
<p>We also need to make sure we do that exceptionally well and fast, so, that tactical innovations, TTP innovations that happen, software innovations that some very clever sergeant comes up with, for instance, which you see in Ukraine all the time, that sort of is lifted up and promulgated quickly across the force as we go through rapid iteration. So I think that’s another lesson I would add. And then the last is Intel, in general. The United States clearly has an advantage in intelligence that’s paid off substantially, and to the extent that we can help our partners with that, in this case, Ukraine, you know, that’s an area we know is a strength to build on.</p>
<p>Sharon: That iterative process that you talked about, particularly coming down from the tactical level, how do you get that into the U.S. system?</p>
<p>Kathleen: It’s an all hands on deck. It comes at all kinds of different levels. We’ve really emphasized with the warfighting concept, making sure that there’s rapid concept to experimentation to fielding. That’s our radar initiative, excuse me, is one of those areas where we’ve really tried to highlight, how do you quickly take a concept, make sure you have the right testing environment, experimentation environment, the lab, if you will, the substitute for Ukraine, for us, the experiment and exercise realm for us out with our co-coms. And you see a lot of that innovation going on today, SOUTHCOM, CENTCOM, INDOPACOM. Others are doing a lot of that work.</p>
<p>That’s how we do it. Really make sure we’re testing it in the field with the warfighter, closely linked to the technologist, so the operator and the technologist work together to do that rapid iteration. A lot of this too is, again, concept of employment. So, it’s not just technology. It’s about, how do we use that technology best? And that’s where we really can excel. We have the most incredible military service members. They are individuals who are incented to bring forward their best. That is definitely a different model than authoritarian states.</p>
<p>Sharon: It feels like still sort of the biggest barrier. You talked about, you know, American ingenuity is where we have an advantage over China. It still very much feels like our acquisition process is the 300-pound gorilla. Can we get to where we need to be without fundamentally reforming Defense Department acquisition?</p>
<p>Kathleen: I think we have to fundamentally reform defense acquisition. But we are down that path. We did have the alternative acquisition pathways, middle tier acquisition pathways, for example. We have to prove those out. We have to show that those pathways, software is one, for example, we’ve already put billions of dollars through that software acquisition pathway. Now we have to show our oversight committees that we can deliver through those alternate pathways because there is a different oversight model built into those. And it’s really about trust between Congress and the executive branch to prove out that we can do good things with these tools that they’ve given us.</p>
<p>So that’s why we’ve been so focused in this administration on taking all those authority changes, showing we can advance against them. Replicator is an example of that. And then, where we can, build that trust, I think there’s more opportunity to expand our authority. So, yes, we need acquisition reform. We’re in acquisition reform now. And we need to build trust as we go through that.</p>
<p>Sharon: Turn it back to Replicator for a moment, since you mentioned it. So, there have been specific capabilities that have been selected. When do you think we’ll learn about specific systems?</p>
<p>Kathleen: So the systems we are talking to Congress about in the immediate, so, we’re having those conversations right now, at the system level, expect to have those… And we’ve been working with… Sorry, let me step back and say, we’ve been already working with Congress, they know what’s coming. The system-level information comes forward in the next several days, as I said <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/3660659/remarks-by-deputy-secretary-of-defense-kathleen-hicks-collaborative-disruption/">in my remarks</a>. When you’ll know about them at the system level is a different issue.</p>
<p>We have a classification guidance we’re working through. It is not unusual for the Defense Department to keep some aspects of the systems that we are pursuing at a classified level. It doesn’t mean that we are hiding them. And we worked very closely with Congress. There’s nothing hidden from Congress. They have to approve all of that funding. So, we’ll work closely with them and more to follow in terms of what we’ll share publicly.</p>
<p>Sharon: Right. Are you surprised where we are now with tech in Silicon Valley compared to five years ago?</p>
<p>Kathleen: I am. I think it is a marker for what’s happened, I think, in broader world events. I think there’s more ability to see how you as an individual innovator or investor can contribute, you know, to the American experience, to American dynamism, dare I say, and more concern about what the alternative might hold. We’ve seen that in Hong Kong, we’ve seen that elsewhere. And I think that, more than anything, has brought to mind what the risks are for falling behind.</p>
<p>Sharon: It’s a great way to wrap up. Thank you so much.</p>
<p>Kathleen: Thank you. All right, thanks.</p>

<p>At the a16z <a href="https://a16z.com/american-dynamism-summit/">American Dynamism Summit,</a> Senator Todd Young (R-IN) spoke with a16z General Partner Martin Casado about the importance of open innovation and American leadership in AI, and why we need to support AI research at all levels — from the classroom to the war room. </p>
<p>Here is a transcript of their conversation:</p>
<p>Martin Casado: Great. Well, we have a lot of stuff to cover on. We’re going to cover, in general, how policy intersects with AI and how we’re thinking about it, and how do we keep the United States ahead? As part of that, you had this Senate AI Insight forum. I don’t think everybody knows what that is, so I thought maybe you could first just kind of describe what that was. Then we can talk about what the follow-up has been.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Sure. Martin, thank you so much for having me. This is a great event. I understand your speakers shared some great information today. But for those who may not be familiar with how Congress typically does its business, when we’re really following the normal processes, we work through the committee process.</p>
<p>So if we had gone the traditional route in trying to address artificial intelligence issues, that would have meant that a number of committees of jurisdiction would have started to hold hearings on artificial intelligence in a very public way. Members of their staff would have prepared… hours before each given briefing, and we would have learned what we could from those experts who briefed us over the course of two or three hours. But oftentimes, members aren’t able to dive deeply into the essence of various policy issues when we take that approach.</p>
<p>So instead, Senator Schumer, working with three other senators, decided to deviate from the process. Instead, we held first three briefings and then nine, as you mentioned, AI Insight forums. These were roundtable events, long tables full of talented innovators, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and others. No cameras were present, as is typically the case in our hearings.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot of candid conversation on dedicated topics. We held insight forums on national security,&nbsp; alignment, innovation, and other topics. And members were invited to witness these guided conversations, take extensive notes, and then after that, we have a lot of work products that we can deal with, recommendations, policy concerns, and other things that will lead to actual committee hearings and legislation being proposed as is traditionally done. So those were really constructive. Members gave a lot of positive feedback about it. We learned a lot in the process.</p>
<p>Martin: What are your key takeaways having sat through them?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Well, two really. I would say the first is just a general sense that this isn’t a particularly partisan issue. I would say one could probably detect slight differences in approaches when it comes to regulation versus innovation as you consult with members on either side of the aisle.</p>
<p>But as it related to this topic, and this gets into the second issue, there was a general embrace by my colleagues after they heard from some of the world’s best minds that we needed to regulate but it would have to be a light touch approach. We had to be very careful not to go overboard and constrain what is right now a sort of leading-edge industry and the United States is in the lead. We want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Martin: Yeah, do you think we can expect some legislation framework come out of this? Is there a time frame, or is this still kind of too early to…</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Well, I think we can. My hope is that we can expect all kinds of legislative efforts, not just this year, but in coming years. I don’t think we have to rush to do everything at once. We need to get clarity on a lot more of people’s concerns, but more importantly, what they perceive to be their opportunities as the technology evolves, as we learn more about the technology, as new versions are released. So sort of a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>I do, however, think that there will be some things we agree on now. We agree that there needs to be some resident expertise within the White House on an ongoing basis that other departments of government look to when it comes to issues surrounding artificial intelligence. I think we need to revamp our human resources approach so that we embed more expertise in every agency of government and we can dialogue with businesses, consumers, and others about things within a department’s field that touch on artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And then there’ll be some things, as you heard about earlier today, that deal with national security where we’re already behind. We need to make some key investments in people and platforms. And so all of those things are among the things that I think in the coming months will be addressed through the committees of jurisdiction in a bipartisan way if politics doesn’t get in the way. And as it relates to most of this, I don’t think it will.</p>
<p>Martin: So this is a bit of a personal story. So I did my undergrad in Flagstaff, Arizona, small Arizona town. And at the university, which is not a notable university, there was a lot of investment from DoD in supercomputing and they’ve bought supercomputers and I worked on them as a researcher, and that led me to a job in Lawrence Livermore National Labs. And then at Lawrence Livermore National Labs, I worked in the weapons program. I worked on these huge supercomputers with a bunch of other people that came from similar paths. And I remember thinking at the time, isn’t it amazing that we live in this country where people understand there’s new technologies that are very powerful and they invest all the way down to Flagstaff, Arizona, to stay ahead and find the people that are very interested in doing that.</p>
<p>It feels to me having gone through that and then having gone through, also, the intelligence community, which also embraces the internet and a lot of the network technologies, it feels like we’re in a bit of a doctrine shift now that when new technologies come we are more afraid of them than wanting to get ahead of them. And so, I just wanted to ask you, is my perception correct that there had been a bit of a doctrine shift in the United States, where we worry about the implication of technologies before we’re able to actually harness them and become leaders in them, or is that maybe just a perspective from the outside?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: I think it may be fair. I think this is one of the reasons these AI Insight forums were helpful to sort of keep certain colleagues honest that might have been ready to move forward aggressively with various regulatory actions. I can’t promise that won’t happen in certain discrete areas. But I think there’s a tendency to catastrophize different technology areas as opposed to different potential outcomes.</p>
<p>Historically, one of the many reasons we’ve been a dynamic country and created a favorable regulatory atmosphere for our technology-developing businesses is we have laws that reflect our values and we apply those laws to technologies only if they run afoul of certain prohibited behaviors that normally don’t even mention the technology, right? And if we can take, at least for the most part, a tech-agnostic approach as it relates to AI development and adoption, I think that that would be more helpful. So no special carve-outs, no special, you know, benefits, except when explicitly those rare instances where there’s a compelling argument that we need to, right?</p>
<p>Martin: So I got a sense… You know, so I went to, you know, one of these AI meetings, and there was a lot of concern around AI. And I listened to the concern. I was like, “Wait, that’s not AI. That’s all computers.” I was like, “That’s not AI. That’s the internet, as someone that’s been in these things for a very long time. And so I’ve gotten the sense that maybe there’s a response to the prior battle. People felt like we didn’t get it right with the internet, and therefore they’re trying to&nbsp; use that consternation now but for a different technology.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Well, I think that’s absolutely happening. It’s happening with respect to data right now.</p>
<p>Martin: Well, let me tell you what the danger is. So having been through the rise of the internet very closely, there were things that were very unique to the internet, right, things like asymmetric attack, right? The more that you invested in the internet, the more vulnerable you were. And if you’re dealing with a terrorist threat, that’s a big deal because they didn’t have infrastructure to take down. We did. So that’s a very particular thing that impacted, like, you know, defense. You know, there’s other things like exponential growth, things can get out of control and it’s everywhere. There’s these huge implications. I will say they actually don’t exist with AI, but somehow people are imbuing AI with it.</p>
<p>And so I’m just wondering if, like, you know, there’s maybe a lack of literacy or maybe people feel like they didn’t really do it on the previous war and this is being applied now. And if that’s the case, what can we do to educate or kind of get ahead of it?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Well, this is helpful. You’re in the right town, right, but to the extent some of you have not been visiting with members of the Senate, members of the House, who will soon be considering… You know, we’ll be playing with live rounds, as we said in the Marine Corps, right? We’ll be considering actual bills, we’ll be developing bills, and we’ll be voting on them.</p>
<p>And there will still be some members who haven’t done extensive homework and carry superficial views of what constitutes artificial intelligence technology. And we need all of you to disabuse them of this being, you know, an extension of social media. This is very different.</p>
<p>And data, we’re going to have to think about data perhaps in a different way. So I do think that [00:10:00] some are either confused. There are others who are just probably using the opportunity of this legislative effort, which is ahead of us, to try and pass bills that they had prepared two decades ago, right?</p>
<p>Martin: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Right. So it’s like now’s my time.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: I’ve done it in other contexts, but if we do it in this context, it could be quite damaging.</p>
<p>Martin: And how much has the economic reality hit the calculus when it comes to these discussions? Because, listen, none of us really know the future. I will tell you when economics change this much, right, when the marginal cost of creation goes to 0, this is gonna be another 10x expansion in value for sure. And historically, the U.S. captured that, right? That’s why, you know, the internet age was so great for us, right? And so, like, is that part of the calculus, or is the focus really on, like, how do we keep this stuff from hurting us?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: We tried to make this part of the calculus. In fact, we spent at least half of the time, perhaps we should have spent even more, on the AI Insight forums discussing the upsides. It’s not as though we had to address the upsides. The upsides are going to be a result of innovators and entrepreneurs and investors. We understand that. But I thought it was very important for us to focus on that to provide some balance to the staff members and my colleagues who were present. So constantly reminding people of that I think is going to be very important.</p>
<p>Listen, there are I think what you may have characterized in the past as some fantastical doomsday scenarios, and there are a lot of those. And there may even be a couple that are real and we need to hedge against, right? And we need to take those seriously, but we cannot become so fixated on those that we lose the forest from the trees. And, you know, we can do this. We can do this. It’ll be complicated. It’ll be challenging. We won’t get it all right in the beginning. And we shouldn’t try and tackle everything in the beginning, which is a bit of a concern, but I think we’ll get it.</p>
<p>Martin: It’d be great for you to talk about, like, on the positive side, your takeaways from the discussions on how AI can benefit America. That’s not just strictly economic, like, you know, from an innovation or a tech or daily life or whatever.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: We can rapidly… And it’s very difficult for us to quantify some of these things. I can sound very specific and learn it by just throwing out figures. Within X years, we’ll solve cancer, but no, we’re going to rapidly compress the treatment and drug development timeline, something I’ve heard from our pharmaceutical makers. We will come up with drought-resistant climate-change-resistant crops to help feed the world, become more productive, drive down the cost of food. We’ll develop the ability to have tailored, personalized tutor services and mental health services. Vastly expanding the workforce in those areas, leveraging technology so that we’ll have mental health providers in areas that we don’t.</p>
<p>We can clean up the environment in all sorts of creative ways, ways that our artificial intelligence technologies will…you know, they’ll illuminate some of the solutions to hard challenges. We’ll have ways of reading health records so that we can discern probabilities of getting certain types of infections, certain prophylactic measures we can take to extend, improve, and save people’s lives. We don’t have the benefit of those AI sort of insights. We can decrease the rate at which mistakes are made within a medical healthcare context. So I mean, it goes on and on. And this is what we should be talking about.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m sitting on a commission right now pertaining to synthetic biology. And so much of advanced biology these days really involves the use of artificial intelligence technologies. And so I have charged the commission with educating me and members on specific things, innovations from material science to medicine, to environmental health that I can start touting because that’s going to be very, very powerful for my constituents and also for colleagues.</p>
<p>Martin: You know, as an outsider, it feels to me like the general discourse is getting more sane, and so I’ve actually gotten a lot of faith in the process.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Well, I tend to make people feel that way.</p>
<p>Martin: With you, but I mean in general. I just meant the national discourse. I appreciate it. But the natural discourse, it does feel like…</p>
<p>Sen. Young: I just thought you meant in this conversation.</p>
<p>Martin: Also this one, too. Yeah.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Okay.</p>
<p>Martin: But no, I think people are becoming much more reasonable about it and so forth. And I just feel like you’re one of the people that’s really been advocating for AI research. I think it’s the right thing to do. Thank you very much for doing that. Is your job getting easier? Am I right? Or has it shifted noticeably since it started, say, two years ago?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: You know, I would say we were able to foresee the need for more research dollars as it relates to artificial intelligence. Myself, Senator Schumer, who helped get signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act. We made a massive allocation for additional federal research through places like the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. It wasn’t easy to get that included with the CHIPS piece, but arguably that will even be more consequential towards our economic security and our national security in the longer run than will the CHIPS piece.</p>
<p>So that authorization will allow us to now appropriate money if members of Congress can be persuaded for AI. And so I feel like half of that hard work is done. And we’ve got a lot more work to do, but I think… What was the second part of your question? I’m sorry.</p>
<p>Martin: Well, I was just wondering if your job was getting easier, but I’m so glad you brought the CHIPS Act. So I’d love for you to answer, like, you know, is your job getting easier? Because it seems to me that, like, there is a lot of rationality in the discourse. I would love to get back to the CHIPS Act because I think it’s probably the most significant piece of legislation in the last 50 years for innovation. So we’ll do that next.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Actually, that’s where I was headed on the point. Thank you for centering me, again. But the CHIPS Act. Yeah, so the job’s getting easier because we passed the CHIPS Act. It’s not just the authorization of research, but we’ve already made the argument, very recently, that something that falls outside of the direct DoD context, as most of the CHIPS and Science Act does, is indeed a national security investment. So we got the institutional muscle memory used to that notion. That is ahistorical in modern history. My colleagues typically don’t think of an investment in the National Science Foundation as a national security investment, but it is.</p>
<p>And then we also were able to make the case to my colleagues that by making these sorts of critical investments in research and in next-generation technologies, as we did through the CHIPS and Science Act, it’s going to lead to a lot of economic growth. And we were able to personalize that argument state by state. So that’s the very same argument that we have for this situation, artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Martin: So this is going to be repeating a little bit, and I apologize. I just think this is so important. So many of the D.C. insiders here understand the CHIPS Act and why it’s important. A lot of people here that come from the investment committee or founders or whatever probably don’t understand the implication. I view it as literally one of the most significant pieces of legislation in 50 years on innovation. It’s a huge, huge, huge benefit. It was the right thing to do. And so if you could just take just a couple minutes to describe the highest level for those that are not insiders what it is. I think it’s so important to get this message out.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: So the CHIPS and Science Act was…at once it was a $53 billion investment in both research and incentives for the semiconductor industry. The incentives would be to reshore some of our manufacturing capacity so that our supply chains would not be as vulnerable to interruption as they, of course, were during the global pandemic, and they could be, God forbid, if there was a geopolitical effort to interrupt those supply chains, say, by the Chinese Communist Party making aggressive actions towards Taiwan.</p>
<p>It was also a national security effort because, of course, we need microprocessors and we need our own radiation-hardened domestically manufactured microprocessors to go into nuclear weapons, to go into our radar systems, and all manner of other things. So that was the microprocessor piece, and we have been in the process now where some of that money is starting to flow. Over $200 billion [00:19:00] of private capital has been invested, and we’re not even at $1 billion, even close to it of federal monies that has been released. So it’s paying handsome dividends. The market is responding, and we’re becoming less risky in our supply chains. The idea was not to become independent of other countries.</p>
<p>And then there’s this whole other and Science piece, which for the purposes of this conversation, big investments in research, which I mentioned earlier, not just in artificial intelligence, but that research can also flow to hypersonics, quantum computing, synthetic biology, autonomous systems, and other areas far upstream, of course, but a bit more applied research than the curiosity-driven research that most people tend to associate with the NSF.</p>
<p>Martin: Yeah, that’s great. So a number of investors are like these free markets solve everything and like this kind of almost libertarian bent. I am not that. You know, I worked at Livermore. I worked for DOE. I worked for two war efforts. Like, I’m a huge believer in the government. I’m a huge believer in actually national institutions and involvement. That said, there’s been an ongoing dialogue with, like, what is the right roles between kind of private and public partnerships for things like AI? Like, what is the right balance? And so I’d love your view on how we can work together on this, where the government stops, you know, where the free markets pick up. How do you think about that as we go forward?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: Well, I look to history. I look at what we did in the Space Race. I look at the innovations that have occurred through our DOE labs like the one you worked at, like the one that developed fracking technology before the frackers claimed it their own, right? I mean, so many innovations have been earned off of the toil of our researchers in our DOE labs, through our land-grant colleges, and the other constellation of research agencies. So we need to keep making those investments.</p>
<p>Over the years, the federal government started to pull back from research that wasn’t curiosity-driven, wasn’t basic research, theoretical sort of research as opposed to more applied. We need some more applied research. I think that’s one of the lessons we’ve learned in recent history.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we need clear rules of the road, clear regulations. Those regulations ought to typically be, and I use my words very carefully here because there are exceptions to everything, but they typically should be technology-agnostic so that we don’t favor or constrain different types of technologies within the market. That’s investors, that’s business people, that’s consumers. And then we’re going to have to work with our partners and allies on development of standards for some of these what I’ll call platform technologies. There aren’t many. Artificial intelligence and synthetic biology are the ones that really come to mind.</p>
<p>So there’s a diplomatic component that if we want our values embedded and follow on generation AI technologies, we better develop and design those technologies here, but we also need to embed the standards that we have as it relates to privacy, consumer protection, and other things into those technologies rather than leaving it to, I’ll pick on the Chinese Communist Party again.</p>
<p>Martin: Yeah, perfect. Okay, so we have the last minute. So I only thought it was fair because when I was at the Insight forum, you asked me this question. So I’m going to ask you two questions that you asked me. The first one, what would…</p>
<p>Sen. Young: It may be a hard question.</p>
<p>Martin: It’s not. What would you give the chances of P doom?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: The probability of P doom?</p>
<p>Martin: The probability of P doom.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: This is colored by my optimism, right? But low. You didn’t ask me to make it qualitative. Yeah, low, but not non-existent, which is how most of the, you know, doomsday scenarios are. They’re low probability, high cost, and we need to hedge against them. But let me say this, the first step in hedging against them is to really seek to understand them, to study them a lot better, so that before you take more costly action constraining the opportunity cost for humanity ahead, we really know what we’re talking about.</p>
<p>Martin: I love that. One last very quick question with my flair. Do you think that P doom, where P doom is a probability that we as humanity has a catastrophic event, do you think it’s greater with or without AI?</p>
<p>Sen. Young: I think in the short run… You’ll see I’m not pandering.</p>
<p>Martin: No, I love it. This is great.</p>
<p>Sen. Young: I think here’s what we’re probably going to have. We’re going to have, in the short run, some unsteadiness, right, because we’re trying to learn countermeasures. We’re trying to figure out how systems work. We’re trying to figure out all sorts of things. And then in the long run I think we can actually push the risk down.</p>
<p>Martin: A hundred percent.</p>
<p>Martin: I agree. Awesome. Thank you so much. You were wonderful. Thank you so much, everybody.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>February was a busy month for Panther Protocol, with the launch of testnet Stage 4 supporting internal transfers and withdrawals, alongside Stage 1 technical enhancements for improved performance and the parallel development of Stages 5 &amp; 6 of the dApp. February also saw the Panther tester community grow to 900+ testers.&nbsp;</p><p>This update covers the ecosystem’s growth, product development progress, and a peek at what’s planned for March:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 4 is live — supporting internal transfers and withdrawals <p>Testnet <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-4-is-now-live-supporting-internal-transfers-and-withdrawals/">Stage 4</a> was released in February, supporting internal transfers and withdrawals. Stage 4 allows users to send zAssets from one zAccount to another. The release of Stage 4 marks a significant step towards the protocol’s mainnet release.</p> Blog: Let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/">latest blog</a> explores the need for a balanced approach to privacy and transparency in Web3. It stresses the importance of private transactions on the public ledgers. By comparing traditional finance’s privacy and DeFi’s transparency, we argue for a middle ground that supports global finance and compliance. Panther Protocol offers solutions to achieve this balance, aiming for a future where privacy and regulatory demands work together.</p> AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an engaging AMA with Saif Akhtar, our Head of Product, and Joris Koopman, our Head of Community.

   Blockchains are, by default, public ledgers containing every transaction recorded by the network. While this ensures transparency, it also violates users’ privacy once an address is linked to an entity.

While this ensures transparency, it also violates users’ privacy once an address is linked to an entity. Apart from creating additional risk for self-custody, institutions are also limited by what they can publicly share on a blockchain. As a result, there is great demand and utility for on-chain, compliant privacy, which still requires KYC (&amp; KYT), but protects them through cryptographic constructs. Zero knowledge proofs attest computational integrity, allowing for transactions to be bundled together and their correctness verified, without revealing each individual interaction.</p><p>We were joined by Anish Mohammed, co-founder &amp; CTO of Panther Protocol, to discuss the importance of compliant privacy for on-chain transactions, powered by zero knowledge technology.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Anish’s background  Panther’s value proposition  UX &amp; on-chain privacy  Panther’s multi-asset shielded pool architecture  KYC &amp; KYT  Shielded zones and transactions  Zone administrator  Address mapping  Roadmap &amp; Panther mainnet  Target audience &amp; adoption  Fee model &amp; tokenomics  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/anishmohammed">Anish Mohammed on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther">Panther Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.6.0. This release exposes the shielded scanning functionality through an initial version of a gRPC server. You can find the documentation outlining how to interact with this gRPC interface in the <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan-grpc-server.html">Zebra Book</a>. Please note that due to this new gRPC server, building Zebra now depends on <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf">protoc</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With this release we have also been making improvements to simplify the Docker images that we share. We now provide a number of new docker-compose files to make it easier to run, test and develop on Zcash using Zebra. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.test.yml">docker-compose.test</a> enables anyone developing on Zebra to easily run CI locally, using a similar approach to what is run through GitHub Actions. We also want to make it easy for users to use Zebra and Lightwalletd without the risk of losing their cached states, so we are now providing <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/main/docker/docker-compose.lwd.yml">docker-compose.lwd</a> to run zebrad with lightwalletd.</p>

 Introducing Nym Squad League — Dawn of the&nbsp;Nymja  Kickstarting four seasons of quests, missions and campaigns to bring strong privacy to the world — so roll up your sleeves and get&nbsp;ready. <p>In the ever-evolving landscape of the digital realm, a clandestine force known as the Nymjas has emerged, weaving through the intricate web of the internet with a singular purpose — to safeguard the privacy of individuals worldwide.</p><p>These enigmatic figures, reminiscent of ancient ninjas, are not bound by the shadows but instead thrive in the decentralised expanse of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>In the lore of the Nymja, these digital guardians are dedicated to maintaining a network of mixnodes, ensuring the protective veil of privacy is cast over the entire internet, enabling privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>Nym is a powerful privacy system bringing network level privacy to the entire internet. What makes Nym powerful is the fact that it is decentralised. And what makes it decentralised is the Nym community of operators, stakers and creators. Last year saw thousands of people join Nym community channels across the world and more than 40 new squads created — led by an emerging collective of&nbsp;Nymjas.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/memperkenalkan-liga-pasukan-nym-fajar-nymja-cb1f84d11411">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymportugues/apresentando-nym-squad-league-aurora-do-nymja-37888c110c4c">Português</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n87c20b78d22b">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%B5%D0%BC-nym-squad-league-%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82-nymja-52c8b5bf34b1">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/kar%C5%9F%C4%B1n%C4%B1zda-nym-squad-league-nymjan%C4%B1n-do%C4%9Fu%C5%9Fu-09579ebacda7">Türkçe</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8Dnym%E6%88%98%E9%98%9F%E8%81%94%E7%9B%9F-nymja%E7%9A%84%E9%BB%8E%E6%98%8E-ef7350750531">中文</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Español</a></p><p>Now is when the community becomes stronger, more decentralised and more independent. Now is the time of&nbsp;Nymjas.</p><p>Welcome to the Nym Squad League, Season 0: Dawn of the&nbsp;Nymja!</p> What is Nym Squad&nbsp;League? <p>Once initiated into the way of the Nymja one does not exist in solitude; Nymjas unite in a seasonal gathering, a vibrant pulse of the Nym Squad&nbsp;League.</p><p>The Nym Squad League gathers Nymjas and their squads into seasonal missions to propel the success of the overall mission: to enable privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>This is not a conventional competition, but a collaborative exhibition of skill, artful dedication and innovation, where Nymjas compare notes, exchange strategies, and celebrate the collective progress made in fortifying the digital bastions of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p>  At the beginning of each Season, a set of Missions are announced that align with the goals of Nym for that quarter. The first season is for Nymja and Shinobi&nbsp;only.  People who have been active in the Nym community can already <a href="https://app.deform.cc/form/556b3376-e34a-4006-b2b3-86f2b03a3fdc/">register as a Nymster! </a>Starting with Season 1 (April 2024), Nymsters will get to compete for a dedicated prize pool by acing challenges, completing quests and achievements, contributing to seasonal objectives, and&nbsp;more.  If they prove their skills, Nymsters will be invited to become a Nymja, giving them the ability to complete Missions and access to rolling contracts, for example running community channels.  Outstanding Nymjas might be invited to join the innermost circle: the Shinobi. These are Nym community experts, more knowledgeable at times than even the core team. Shinobi run programmes and have priority access to the Nym Innovation Fund.  At the end of each Season, the Squad Wealth Fund distributes rewards to community members who have excelled at the Missions.   Dawn of the Nymja:&nbsp;Missions <p>Season 0: Dawn of the Nymjas has already begun, with Nymja and Shinobi having received their first missions via their Dojos&nbsp;already.</p><p>This season is dedicated to sharpening the tools of the core team and community to meet the demand for the upcoming <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">NymVPN</a>. From Brazil to Ukraine and beyond, Nymjas across the world are busy testing the NymVPN, providing feedback and getting their own operations ready ahead of the NymVPN alpha&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Next season will open the doors to n00bs and Nymsters alike, for rolling bounties and ways to learn about and contribute to global&nbsp;privacy.</p> Sounds great! How do I&nbsp;start? <p>In the world of anonymity, the crowd is your friend, especially when the crowd is united by a collective mission that requires the strength of a united force. The first thing you need to do is join the Nym channels:</p>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> (think of it as the town square with no&nbsp;privacy)  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat">Element</a> (this is the Nym HQ with stronger&nbsp;privacy)  <a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">Twitter</a> (the Nym bulletin&nbsp;board)  <p>Global Telegram channels:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p><p>Once you have joined one of the Nym communities, here’s how you can progress and become a core contributor:</p><p>Nymster: constructive, entertaining and helpful activity in community channels, min 50 NYM token staked or bonded. If you meet these requirements, <a href="https://app.deform.cc/form/556b3376-e34a-4006-b2b3-86f2b03a3fdc/">register&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Nymja: you need to be recommended by two existing Nymjas or core team and have submitted outstanding proof-of-work in your Nymster missions.</p><p>Shinobi: by Nym Core Team invitation only.</p><p>Nym Squad League is beyond a competition. It symbolises a community of individuals bound by a common cause — the relentless pursuit of privacy in the digital age. As they engage in these virtual missions, the Nymjas weave a tapestry of collaboration and commitment, demonstrating that privacy loves&nbsp;company.</p><p>Friends, welcome to the Nym Squad&nbsp;League…</p> Hold up, what is the Squad Wealth&nbsp;Fund? <p>The Squad Wealth Fund is a pot of NYM tokens that will grow and shrink with the performance and usage of Nym. The mechanics are as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Every quarter, a new <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-delegation-programme-is-now-open-c371c74610c5">Nym Node Delegations Program</a> begins, with official delegations going to high-performing nodes in key regions. This is to ensure good coverage and that new operators have a chance to get into the ‘active set’ of the mixnet, start mixing traffic and providing privacy.  At the end of the quarter, staking rewards are redeemed and put into the Squad Wealth Fund to support the Nym Squad League missions that have been completed that&nbsp;season.  Nym nodes in the delegation program are regularly assessed for performance, stake saturation and uptime. Completed (fully saturated) and underperforming nodes are removed on a rolling basis, refilled with queued high-quality Nym&nbsp;nodes.  <p>The first round of delegations were made in January, with rewards being redeemed at the end of March to reward Nymjas and Shinobi missions.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squad-league-dawn-of-the-nymja-268b7c4b4b6a">Introducing Nym Squad League — Dawn of the Nymja</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, Brave is excited to announce the release of Leo—Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser—on all Android devices. Android users who update to version 1.63 can ask Leo questions, summarize pages, translate pages, create content, and more from both the browser address bar and within the webpage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since launching on desktop three months ago, Brave Leo has seen significant global adoption. With the chat interface built right in the browser and several large language models (LLMs) to choose from, Leo makes it easy to interact with AI in a seamless, familiar way. Leo can help users answer questions, navigate different tasks, and accomplish more each day. And the experience has only gotten better—and the answers more accurate and timely—with the addition of new integrations and <a>new models like Mixtral</a>.</p>
<p>Now, that same great Leo experience is available for users with Android phones and tablets. Brave Android users can seamlessly interact with AI without leaving the security of the browser, and maximize productivity no matter where they are.</p>

 What can Leo do? 
<p>Leo can handle any number of tasks, both in the context of the webpages you’re viewing and completely separate from this context. Among other things, Leo can:</p>
 
 Create real-time summaries of webpages or videos 
 Answer questions about content 
 Generate new long form written content 
 Translate pages, analyze, or rewrite them 
 Create transcriptions of video or audio content 
 Write code 
 
<p>So what can you do with Leo on mobile? Summarize that long webpage you meant to read at the office, but never got around to. Get help hunting for a product mentioned on that page and compare it to others. Plan a recipe for tonight’s dinner. And get smart travel tips to escape the daily grind.</p>
<p>With Leo on Android, you can maximize productivity as you move between home, office, and anywhere else you go. All with the same privacy and security guarantees of the Brave browser. With Brave Leo, there’s no login or signup required—you just open your browser and chat. Privately.</p>

 Mixtral as the default LLM brings higher quality answers 
<p>Brave Leo gives access to several high-quality large-language models (LLMs), ensuring better, more relevant answers to even niche questions, and fewer of the hallucinations that plague other AI experiences.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Leo includes access to Mixtral 8x7B, Claude Instant, and Llama 2 13B. Mixtral—the default LLM—can interact in multiple languages including English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It can even generate code.</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B has quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December, 2023 release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, <a>we recently set Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM</a> for Leo on desktop, and we’ve seen great feedback. And while Mixtral is the default LLM for Android as well, users have the option to select from other LLMs, or to upgrade to Leo Premium for higher rate limits.</p>

 Leo Premium&nbsp; 
<p>The Brave Leo experience is free to all users. For those who’d like access to higher rate limits, however, Leo is also available as a Premium experience. Users can subscribe to Leo Premium for <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=leo">$14.99/month</a>, and one subscription covers up to 5 different devices across Android, Linux, macOS, and Windows. Users log into their Brave account from their other devices with that subscription.</p>

 Smart AI, still private by default 
<p>As with all of Brave’s other features, privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. These specific privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Responses discarded: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers that can be linked to you (such as <a>IP address</a>), and no personal data is retained by Brave-hosted AI models. If you select a model from Anthropic and submit Leo queries, that data will be processed by Anthropic for a period of 30 days, then deleted.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access for the free version: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo (they access their Premium account if they wish to use Leo across multiple devices however).&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you use to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 

 What’s next for Leo, and how to get started 
<p>Brave Leo for Android is now available to all Brave Android users who’ve updated to version 1.63. Note that it will be rolled out in phases over the next few days, so users should check back soon if they’re not seeing it today.  Brave Leo for iOS devices will be available in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Ready to try Brave Leo? It’s easy: Simply open the browser, begin typing in the address bar, and click  “Ask Leo”. For the on page chat experience, Android users can tap “⋮” and then tap Leo to get started.</p>

It has a market capitalization of approximately $27 billion (equivalent to around 4 trillion yen) with over $24 billion in circulation according to its <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/USDCAttestationReports/2023/2023%20USDC_Examination%20Report%20December%202023.pdf">December 2023 reserve attestation report</a>.

<p>With the latest update of Brave on desktop (1.63), Brave Wallet users can now create Native SegWit Bitcoin accounts, which offer lower transaction fees and better error detection compared to other Bitcoin account types. Brave Wallet is now also fully equipped to send and receive from all types of Bitcoin addresses, including Legacy, Nested SegWit, Native SegWit, and Taproot, ensuring compatibility with third-party wallets.</p>
<p>After nearly 15 years, Bitcoin has stood the test of time and proven itself as a resilient asset class. There’s growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin following the approval of several Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.— and Bitcoin use cases are expanding beyond peer-to-peer payments and serving as a store-of-value with a new wave of innovation fueled by NFTs and DeFi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our aim with Brave Wallet is to offer the most secure and privacy-considerate software wallet for everyday use. As the Bitcoin ecosystem expands with new apps and services, Brave Wallet will be there to put security and privacy first, to help keep users’ assets safe.”</p>
<p>– James Mudgett, VP Web3 Products at Brave</p>

<p>How to get started with Bitcoin in Brave Wallet</p>
 
 Open Brave Wallet on Mac, Windows, or Linux 
 Click the expanded … menu in the top right of the panel 
 Select Create account 
 Select Bitcoin 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>More UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) chains and features on the horizon</p>
<p>Last year we announced our partnership with <a>Zcash and Filecoin Foundation</a> to bring better privacy to the Web. In the coming months, we’ll be delivering on a major component of the partnership in Brave Wallet with shielded Zcash transactions. Later this year, we’ll add support for more Bitcoin account types, which will allow users to store BRC-20 tokens and Ordinals in Brave Wallet—and make all of these features available across all desktop and mobile versions of Brave.</p>
<p>About Brave Wallet</p>
<p>Brave Wallet enables Brave users to store, swap, and manage their crypto assets across multiple blockchains from a single wallet. Unlike most crypto wallets, Brave Wallet is browser-native, meaning it doesn’t require any additional downloads or extensions, helping reduce security risks and improve convenience across the ever-expanding landscape of Web3.</p>
<p>To get started with Brave Wallet, <a>download Brave</a> and click the wallet icon in the top right corner of your browser.</p>

      Delivering Instacart’s Next Chapter         
	By Davy Rothbart	 



Published February 26, 2024
        From fishing village to Silicon Valley, Instacart CEO Fidji Simo is tackling the grocery shopping ecosystem.      



 
<p>Fidji Simo sat in a San Francisco hotel room, poring over details for the coming day. As CEO of tech upstart Instacart, the next morning—September 19, 2023—would be a landmark day. Simo was leading the company’s IPO, a historic moment that would be held at Instacart’s headquarters in downtown San Francisco. Nasdaq staff had flown in from New York City to oversee the event, and Simo’s own parents had made the journey from France. Though Simo was known for her equanimity, she was electric with anticipation.</p>



<p>Her husband, Remy Miralles, encouraged her to try to get some sleep. Miralles had been by Simo’s side throughout her journey: from a high schooler in France with big dreams to an MBA student in the United States; from helping scale Facebook, the world’s biggest social media network, to taking the helm as CEO at Instacart, where she led the company through a dramatic period of transition as she prepared it to go public. “Promise me one thing,” Miralles said. “Tomorrow, you’ll be pulled in a million directions. You’ll be focused on what comes next. Please, savor the moment.”</p>



<p>Simo knew he was right. It would be a mistake to breeze past this momentous occasion with her gaze set solely on the future. As the winds off the Bay whistled outside, Simo settled in to wait for the new day to begin.</p>



 



<p>Sète, population 44,576 (about the size of San Luis Obispo), is a bucolic fishing town in the south of France, on the Mediterranean Sea. For generations, Simo’s family, Sicilian by heritage, had worked in the fishing industry. Her grandfather, Rocco, was the captain of a fishing vessel; her father, Jacques, rose through the ranks to captain his own boat. They worked long, hard days, sometimes as long as 18 hours, heading out to sea at 2 in the morning and returning at 8 in the evening with a fresh haul of bass, sole, hake, monkfish, sardines and anchovies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Simo’s grandmother, Viviane, was a fishmonger who sold what her husband caught at a tiny shop in the center of town. Simo took pride in her family’s hard work and their crucial, if perhaps underappreciated, role in supplying food for the village and beyond. But she knew she would never follow in their footsteps. As a kid, though it thrilled her to join her dad at sea, she always got seasick, a malady she never outgrew. Simo preferred being on land and cherished her time in the city gardens with her sketchbook in hand, filling a blank page with drawings inspired by Gaudí and the Surrealists, or in her mother’s boutique, admiring her entrepreneurial spirit and the kind, authentic way she interacted with customers. Over time, Simo developed an interest in business and dreamed of one day launching one of her own.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One night, the radio Simo’s grandfather kept on the dining room table crackled to life—an emergency transmission. A fishing boat was in rough seas, in desperate trouble. While her father and other fishermen scrambled into boats to aid the rescue mission, Simo stayed by her grandfather’s side, listening as the captains worked together to organize the rescue, riveted by their composure under pressure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memory has always stuck with Simo—a demonstration of the power of leadership and community in a moment of crisis. As boat captains, Simo’s dad and grandfather often spoke of their responsibilities, not only in keeping their crews safe but making sure each person on board felt valued. They were the kinds of leaders who wouldn’t assign a task they weren’t willing to do themselves, never too regal to scrub decks or disentangle nets. “The crew comes before you, always,” Simo says, summarizing the ethos her dad and grandfather modeled. For her, this approach has been a lifelong priority. The world of tech may seem vastly distant from life aboard a fishing boat on the Mediterranean Sea, but for Simo, her childhood yielded lasting lessons.</p>



 



<p>After high school, when Simo left her hometown to go to business school at HEC Paris, Miralles went with her. The two had met as teenagers and formed a friendship that would evolve into a lifelong partnership. As she closed in on her master’s degree, Simo elected to take courses at UCLA, fulfilling a long-held dream of moving to the U.S. that she’d nurtured through an obsession with the Southern California TV drama “The O.C.” Again, Miralles joined her. Their decision to move overseas, far from their home and close-knit families, wasn’t made lightly. But Simo, like her parents and grandparents before her, had always been one to rush toward a challenge, not run away. What’s more, she had Miralles’ support, a confidence that would give her the courage to make bold decisions time and again in her career. And she was intrigued by what she viewed as a U.S. appetite for entrepreneurial risk-taking—in business and in developing new technologies.</p>



<p>On the flight to Los Angeles, she blasted the theme song to “The O.C.,” “California” by Phantom Planet, through her headphones: “California, here we come!” She knew the future would come with challenges, but sitting back in her seat, she relished the joy of it beginning.</p>



 



<p>After UCLA, Simo spent four years on eBay’s strategy team before moving to Facebook in 2011. The company had already seen explosive growth but continued to expand its scope. As VP of video, games and monetization, Simo tackled challenges with relish, defying skeptics at every turn. Few believed Facebook could monetize mobile, but Simo cracked the problem by introducing a robust advertising network to the Facebook App, which proved to be a turning point for the company. When there were doubts as to whether the company could compete with YouTube given its eight-year head start on video, Simo and her team built Facebook Live and Facebook Watch, pioneering new approaches to video streaming and generating massive engagement.</p>



<p>In time, Simo developed a powerful sponsor in CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Working alongside him at “the school of Zuck,” as she calls it, Simo learned crucial lessons about balancing long-term strategy and vision with a commitment to short-term execution. “A lot of great operators can do the day-to-day, nitty-gritty work, but don’t have vision,” Simo says. “And a lot of people have great vision, but can’t execute for the life of them. Mark has both. And that really shaped me.”</p>



<p>Zuckerberg’s faith in Simo was apparent when he gave her the reins to the flagship Facebook App, where she would manage a staff of 6,000. As Simo dug excitedly into the new challenge, however, she suddenly began dealing with a constellation of frightening physical symptoms: dizziness, nausea and frequent fainting spells. She was eventually diagnosed with a neuroimmune condition called postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which is not life-threatening but can be debilitating.</p>



<p>Determined to rise to the occasion of leading the Facebook App, Simo refused to let the diagnosis hold her back. Instead, she found creative ways of managing her symptoms in the workplace, like bringing a reclining chair into the boardroom to ensure her blood pressure didn’t drop during long meetings. Facebook rallied around her during this time—an outpouring of community support that echoed what she’d experienced as a child in Sète’s fishing scene.</p>



<p>Despite Simo’s successes and close relationships at Facebook, as a creative soul, she yearned to one day be a CEO herself. She viewed the CEO position as the ultimate canvas to shape a business following her own instincts and imagination. She was fascinated with the idea of solving a company’s most critical puzzles. In 2021, when she was approached by a major tech company in need of new ideas and fresh vision on its board, her ears perked up.</p>
 







 
<p>Instacart was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, Max Mullen and Brandon Leonardo. After an initial rejection, it famously secured a spot in Y Combinator when the founders ordered a six-pack of beer that was delivered to the partners. Michael Moritz, formerly a partner at Sequoia, led its investment in the company soon after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following nearly a decade of steady growth, Instacart became essential during the pandemic as shopping went digital, and its sales surged. But as quarantine waned and people returned to shopping in person, Instacart’s growth declined. The company recognized it needed to redefine itself in a post-COVID world. Founder-CEO Mehta was the first to identify Simo for the board, noting that her scaled operating experience and product expertise would be valuable as the company navigated the path forward.</p>



<p>While maintaining her role at Facebook, Simo joined Instacart’s board in January 2021 as the company was strategizing on how to expand its ambitions. “Instacart’s mission of helping people access food resonated deeply with me,” she says. “Growing up in a family who for generations harvested food from the sea and brought it ashore, it was this ancestral, deeply cultural connection.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later that summer, Instacart and Mehta began pursuing a successor for his role to lead the company into its next chapter—someone with a vision for Instacart’s future and experience running an organization at the scale the company hoped to achieve. Moritz, impressed with Simo’s board contributions, began championing her for the role. Recognizing her CEO potential and ambition, he wryly commented to Simo that she would grow old waiting for the chance at Facebook. “Michael had the wisdom of having seen so many people navigate this career moment,” Simo says. “He told me, ‘If one of your goals is to be a CEO, to make a difference and see what you can do when you can drive your own vision, Instacart is your canvas.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the position’s appeal, Simo knew it came with pressure and risk. “At the time, Instacart’s gross transaction volume was declining by double digits,” Simo remembers. While Instacart’s success—and her own as its CEO—wasn’t guaranteed, Simo was drawn to the challenge of steering the company’s evolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After a series of visits from Moritz at her home to discuss the role’s challenges and potential—and bond over her husband’s recipe for madeleines—she was about ready to accept. When she asked Miralles his opinion, he encouraged her to listen to her instincts for where she would find joy. “That’s where you’ll do your best work,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2021, Simo became CEO of Instacart, a seismic industry move that made headlines around the world. Now, the hard work could finally begin.</p>



 



<p>Simo was aware of the whispers in Silicon Valley that Instacart would never be profitable. As newly minted CEO, she was determined to prove skeptics wrong, as she had throughout her career.</p>



<p>Early in her new role as CEO, Simo observed a tension between Instacart and its retail partners, the grocery stores where Instacart shoppers shopped. To the retailers, Simo says, it wasn’t clear if Instacart was a friend or a “frenemy.” She recognized that Instacart was reliant on its retailers for success and sought to strengthen these relationships in a way that was symbiotic. If Instacart could help retailers thrive, she intuited, the company would also prosper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To achieve this, Simo revamped Instacart’s company values and instituted a new leadership ethos known as Grow the Pie to help grocers improve their own processes—both in-store and online—via new technologies. Instacart partnered with over 100 grocery chains like Sprouts and Publix to build smooth, sleek, white-label websites that are individually branded but powered by Instacart. Now, whether a customer orders groceries through Instacart or a grocer’s site, both parties benefit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Simo’s superpowers is innovating new products, and a major appeal of the CEO role was getting to push product visions forward. As part of its omnichannel strategy, Simo made the decision to acquire Caper AI, a startup offering AI-powered grocery carts. When an in-store customer places an item in a Caper Cart, the cart is able to scan it and add the price to a running tally. The screen serves as a payment terminal, so when a customer is done shopping, they can avoid the line and head for the parking lot. The cart is also outfitted with a screen where brands can suggest recipes and advertise products, a significant revenue opportunity for both Instacart and the stores.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem.”</p>
Fidji Simo</blockquote>



<p>Once retailers were confident that their goals were aligned with Instacart’s, they found other ways to more deeply integrate, adding new online offerings that enabled customers to access every aisle of the store—including alcohol, produce and packaged goods—and to pay via a variety of payment methods, including EBT SNAP. “These changes have allowed Instacart to reach beyond its roots as a service fulfillment company into managing the full grocery shopping ecosystem, while partner stores also benefit,” Simo says. “It’s been absolutely thrilling to see.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo recognized the critical role played not just by partner stores, but by Instacart’s shoppers. To understand their motivations and challenges, Simo tried her hand at being a shopper herself. The experiment was humbling. Finding parking at a San Francisco grocery store called Gus’s was in itself a daunting feat. Then, managing a customer’s particular dietary preferences presented another challenge. As Simo roamed the aisles trying to locate a specific brand of kombucha (a product that this fish-and-potatoes girl had never tried), a store manager came to her aid and helped her complete the order. “I got a sense for how resourceful the shoppers are and how difficult a job it can be,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo began holding regular one-on-one meetings with shoppers, too. She notes that Instacart’s shoppers vary demographically from other gig economy workers: about two-thirds are women and approximately half are parents. Simo says the shoppers provided “a tapestry of reasons” why they were drawn to Instacart, though for most of them the flexible hours—and locations—were key. One shopper had a severely disabled daughter and was able to clock in for short stretches when someone else was available to offer support at home. Another woman had always dreamed of traveling to all 50 states. Working for Instacart allowed her to have a job on hand wherever she traveled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simo made it her mission for Instacart to introduce new technologies that would increase shopper efficiency and boost their pay. Instacart began alerting shoppers to peak earnings days; prompted customers to increase tips when they rated a shopper five stars; created batch orders so that a shopper could grab items for multiple customers on a single trip to the grocery store; and built in-app way-finding technologies that allow shoppers to navigate aisles and collect items in a more efficient pattern. These efforts have largely succeeded; Shopper salaries, on a per-hour basis, have consistently notched up. “I’m proud that shoppers are now making more than they did in the past,” Simo says.</p>

<p>Simo was chosen to lead Instacart because investors believed she could grow the company and reimagine it, but also because they felt she could ready the company to go public. In late 2021, however, the tech industry was hit by a market collapse and subsequent IPO drought. Given this difficult climate, a less ambitious person might have shelved the prospect of going public altogether. But Simo was keenly aware of the hundreds of Instacart employees who had worked tirelessly for years, for whom an IPO could be life-changing, allowing them a cash liquidity she felt they’d clearly earned. Simo promised her employees that when the market grew receptive, Instacart would be one of the first companies to go public. To do so, however, Simo “quickly realized that we needed to show the world that this was an industry that was profitable.”</p>



<p>Ravi Gupta, a former CFO and COO at Instacart who became a partner at Sequoia in 2019, became a trusted advisor to Simo as she quickly got up to speed on where Instacart had been and put a strategy in place for the future. Recalling their conversations, Gupta says, “She’s built to be a CEO. She wants the ball. She wants the responsibility that comes with leadership.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“She’s built to be a CEO. She wants the ball. She wants the responsibility that comes with leadership.”</p>

<p>For two years, Simo worked with her team to pivot the company toward profitability. Product innovations—from batching orders to shopper way-finding—improved the margin on each order, and its revenue from advertising has grown significantly. Instacart now boasts more than 5,500 ad partners, including PepsiCo, General Mills and Unilever. It has introduced new ad formats such as shoppable display ads, and because Instacart (and its associated white-label sites) is a closed-loop platform, the company is able to serve up unique insights to partners about how their ads are driving sales. Instacart reported that ad campaigns drive an average 15% incremental sales lift—an almost unheard-of number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the market downturn, Simo had observed other companies try to hang onto their former valuations, concerned about the optics of a lowered figure. “They buried their heads in the sand and pretended nothing had changed,” she says. “I took a different approach. I faced reality straight-up, and I’m like, ‘Okay, yep, the markets have changed. We are not worth the same. That’s totally okay. Let’s embrace this new reality and grant stock for employees at a fair valuation.’ We’re focused on doing what’s right, not the thing that looks good.’”</p>



<p>By the summer of 2023, Instacart had hit five consecutive quarters of profitability. As the markets continued to warm, Simo kept her promise to her team, setting an IPO date for September, with an opening price of $30 per share. With more than $2 billion in cash reserves, Simo says Instacart’s IPO was less about raising money (and, in fact, was non-dilutive) than making sure that the company’s more than 3,000 employees would finally realize the fruits of their labor.</p>



<p>Usually, when a company goes public and hits the Nasdaq exchange, a few lead executives show up in New York City to ring the bell and celebrate. But Simo knew the company’s success was a result of the employees who had contributed throughout the years, and she wanted all of them to have the chance to participate in the festivities. So she asked Nasdaq officials to come to San Francisco.</p>



<p>The night before the IPO, her husband’s suggestion to be present resonated deeply. The next morning, as the company gathered in the employee cafeteria, now decked out with its CART ticker symbol, Simo circulated among employees, the executive team, the founders and their families, and felt her emotions rise. She and her husband had also invited their 8-year-old daughter Willow to join the occasion, as well as Simo’s parents and grandmother Viviane—the former fishmonger—who’d arrived from her hometown of Sète. “I started seeing the scene through their eyes,” Simo says. “I hadn’t made a big deal out of it, and I don’t think they really knew what to expect. But when I saw the tears in their eyes, it flipped a switch in me.” In particular, Simo was moved by the sight of her dad, Jacques—the hardened fishing captain who could pull a hook out of his hand without flinching—now radiant, bursting with pride and tearing up.</p>



<p>Cameras rolled, broadcasting the ceremony around the world, as Simo stood on stage with Instacart’s executive team and rang the bell, marking Instacart’s emergence as a publicly traded company. For 90 seconds, she clapped along with her colleagues, sharing the joy, accomplishment and pride of the moment. “And then right after the cameras turned off,” she says, “I was just a sobbing mess.”</p>



<p>Through her tears, Simo picked up a microphone and made an impromptu toast, shining a light on Instacart’s co-founders and talented workforce. “I had this immense feeling of gratitude,” Simo says, “because I realized how much of a privilege it was to lead a team like this, and work toward a mission that can make a difference in the world.” Simo says what gives her the most joy in business is finding the magic in others and celebrating it. To have the chance to big-up her hard-working team in front of their colleagues—and even their own families—swept her with another wave of happy tears. Finally, Simo welcomed her daughter, Willow, to join her on the podium, and as a chorus of flashbulbs popped, they both grinned—dreaming of the future, but fully present in the moment.</p>



 



<p>The art studio in Simo’s home, dubbed the flower room, is a space dedicated to her personal projects: paintings, sculptures and collages. Simo takes flowers by the dozens, hangs them up to dry and then uses their distinctive natural dyes as a material in her art. Simo’s health condition makes intensive exercise a no-go, so when she wants to tune out work stress, the flower room is her sanctuary. One recent Saturday afternoon, she huddled with Willow in the flower room, sculpting magic wands out of sticks and flowers. Together, they pretended to imbue each wand with special powers: levitating objects, stopping time.</p>



<p>Though Simo’s free time is limited, she squeezes every drop out of it, cherishing moments with her daughter and the occasional dinner out with Miralles. She also, bogglingly, has found the bandwidth to create the Metrodora Institute, which opened in April 2023 in Salt Lake City. Metrodora, named after a fifth-century female Greek physician, welcomes those living with diseases that many doctors fail to diagnose and often do not know how to treat. The center offers clinical care and conducts scientific research with the goal of developing cures for complex chronic conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Challenges can spur creation,” Simo says. It’s a motto she reiterates to her team at Instacart as the company continues to work to expand its scope and prove its durability in what remains a challenging environment for many public tech companies. One of the initiatives to broaden Instacart’s horizons relates to Simo’s interest in health care and biotech. “Eighty-five percent of health care costs come from treating chronic diseases, like diabetes and hypertension, that can be caused or made worse by diets that lack key nutrients,” Simo says. “It became obvious to me that a company like Instacart, which exists at the intersection of people’s relationship with food, has a role to play in health care.” Simo conceived of Instacart Health, a program that allows doctors to prescribe food as easily as they prescribe medication. Simo imagines a future where a doctor not only recommends that a patient eat healthier, but prescribes specific meals, and by the time that patient arrives home, the ingredients for the meal are waiting on their doorstep, delivered by an Instacart shopper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But for now, here on a Saturday afternoon with her daughter, Simo’s job is to sculpt another magic wand and pass her special powers down to her own child. “I want her to see that everything is possible,” Simo says. “That’s the biggest gift that my parents gave me.” Though Simo’s family had no advanced degrees, Simo says their message to her never wavered: If you work hard and put your mind to something, you can accomplish anything. Now, Simo reflects on Instacart’s IPO, and her special moment on stage with her daughter. “I think that was when everything landed for her,” Simo says. “Like, ‘Okay, wow, this is a big moment. And Mom is right! We can do big things.’”</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation engineering team has been working on an implementation library for <a href="https://zfnd.org/frost/">FROST</a> (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures) for Zcash. To support this we have built <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">demos</a>, which are NOT to be used in a production environment nor with any secrets. The purpose of these demos are to:</p>



 
 Identify gaps in our documentation 



 Provide usage examples for developer facing documentation 



 Provide reference implementations for developers wanting to use FROST in a “real world” scenario 
 



 



<p></p>



 THREE DEMOS 



<p>We have three demos in this project covering each of the corresponding roles, which are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Trusted Dealer: a third party or participant who is trusted to:
 
 Generate good randomness 



 Keep secret values confidential 



 Delete secret values after distributing key shares to each participant 
 
 



 Participant: a recipient of a key share 



 Coordinator: a third party or participant who is responsible for:
 
 Determining which participants will take part in generating a signature 



 Coordinating FROST signature rounds 



 Aggregating signature shares generated by each participant 



 Publishing the resulting signature 
 
 
 



 



<p>Note: We also have <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost-zcash-demo/tree/main/dkg">a demo</a> which covers Distributed Key Generation (DKG), where there is no trusted dealer role and participants generate key shares among themselves.</p>



 



<p></p>



<p>We invite you to&nbsp; test the demos for yourself by following <a href="https://frost.zfnd.org/zcash/ywallet-demo.html">our tutorial</a>, which was showcased during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvzESdDtczo&amp;list=PL40dyJ0UYTLII7oQRQmNOFf0d2iKT35tL&amp;index=37">our presentation at ZCon4</a>. The demos allow you to choose one of two journeys—either with a trusted dealer or DKG for key generation. This tutorial describes the trusted dealer journey.</p>



 



 HOW WE BUILT THEM 



<p>The method for building these demos included:</p>



 
 Reading the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf">FROST paper</a> 



 Reading the <a href="https://cfrg.github.io/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-15/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost.html">FROST draft</a> 



 Reading documentation in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">FROST crate</a> 



 Reading documentation in library while building the demos 



 Referring to the draft paper to match the documentation 
 



<p>When building a protocol library from a paper, names are likely to change and you need to document the code well; it’s not uncommon to find mismatches. We tried to build the demo from the perspective of someone who had not seen FROST before, and so we went through all the documentation without any assumptions. We also started publishing releases more often so the demos could be updated as we found different API changes we needed to make. This encouraged us to properly document throughout the process.</p>



 



 NEW FUNCTIONALITY 



<p>We realized that we hadn’t created a way for the trusted dealer to accept an existing key rather than allowing the application to generate one for you. Originally we weren’t able to specify an existing secret because generate_trusted_dealer() generated a secret for you. We compared this functionality to that specified in the draft paper and&nbsp; it was discovered this was missing; so we added split_secret() to handle this functionality and trusted_dealer_keygen()would generate one instead.</p>



<p>We also took this opportunity to add serde support to our FROST library. Serde is a library that helps encoding structures into multiple formats such as JSON or XML. We’d had a request to implement serde in our FROST library and decided that the demos created a good opportunity to get this done, since they require copying and pasting structures between terminals. It was pretty straightforward and it meant we could copy structures encoded as a single line JSON object between our terminals, instead of having to copy and paste each field of each structure.</p>



<p>Working on these demos has enabled us to make the library more robust and easier to use for implementers. We’d love to know if you agree!</p>



<p>We hope that this will help anyone understand how frost works and what you can do with it. Please do let us know if you’ve found this useful by reaching out to us on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/676527656170160146/997122644048613427">ZF Discord FROST channel</a>.</p>

<p>Confidential-DPproof uses Zero Knowledge Proofs for verifiable privacy protection, and garners Spotlight award at prestigious ICLR 2024 conference</p>
<p>by Ali Shahin Shamsabadi, Privacy Researcher at Brave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary. Machine learning models trained on clients’ data without any guarantees of privacy can leak sensitive information about clients. For example, in the application of machine learning to advertising, we ideally want to learn the general patterns (“showing scientific advertisements to clients visiting scientifically related contents”), however parameters of a trained machine learning model might encode specific facts about the interest of an individual client (“Ali visited <a>https://brave.com/research/</a> on 26 Feb 2024.”). Unfortunately, some institutions may not adhere to their claim of training machine learning models with client privacy</p>
 
 Intentionally: not considering client privacy while training the models, or considering inadequate privacy safeguards to achieve better model utility; or&nbsp; 
 Accidentally: hard-to-detect bugs occurred in the implementation of privacy requirements of learning algorithms. 
 
<p>We introduce verifiable private training (Confidential-DPproof – Confidential proof of differentially private training) which enhances training with a certificate of privacy while not revealing any information about the data and model.</p>
<p><a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is accepted at the 12th International Conference on Learning Representations <a href="https://iclr.cc/">ICLR2024</a> as a spotlight (top 5%) paper. Confidential-DPproof will be presented at the conference between May 7th and 11th in Vienna, Austria. <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a> is available in an open-source implementation, and can be used by institutions to offer verifiable privacy protection to clients in machine learning based products.</p>

 Why should we care about client’s privacy when training machine learning models on their data? 
<p>Machine learning models that are trained without a privacy-preserving algorithm can memorize sensitive information about their training set. Publishing the parameters, or even just the outputs, of machine learning models can consequently risk the privacy of the clients who contributed to their training process. For example,&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05820.pdf">Membership inference attacks</a>: exploit access to a model’s outputs to infer the presence (or absence) of a particular data point in its training set. 
 <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=oVn5GLyONY">Data reconstruction attacks</a>: reconstruct the original training data points through an analysis of the model’s parameters.&nbsp; 
 

 How can we protect client’s privacy? 
<p>The framework of <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/tcc2006/38760266/38760266.pdf">Differential Privacy</a> is the gold standard for formalizing privacy guarantees. When training machine learning models, a Differential Privacy training algorithm provides guarantees for individuals by ensuring that data contributed by each individual client has a bounded influence on the final model in a mathematically precise manner. Therefore, absence or presence of a client will not result in a significantly different model.</p>
<p>Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent is the canonical approach to training machine learning models with guarantees of Differential Privacy. Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent imposes two main modifications to vanilla Stochastic Gradient Descent to provide differential privacy guarantees: 1) clipping per-example gradients to a fixed norm to bound the algorithm’s sensitivity to each individual client’s data (assuming each client only contributes one data point to the training); 2) adding calibrated noise to gradients before they are applied to update the model to ensure indistinguishability across updates. Training machine learning models with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent mitigates all attacks against the privacy of training data that fall within the threat model of differential privacy, including membership inference and training data reconstruction.</p>

 Why should we care about verifiable privacy? 
<p>Implementing Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithms can be challenging and hard-to-detect errors can easily occur as a result of uncommon and complex modification to the underlying training optimizer. Therefore, institutions may not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with differential privacy guarantees intentionally (e.g., if they are trying to evade privacy regulations to maximize utility) or accidentally (e.g., if there are hard-to-detect bugs in the implementation of their private algorithm). For example, see Apple’s ambiguity around not releasing the exact privacy budget of a deployed Differential Privacy mechanism and/or other relevant details: <a href="https://www.cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/fall2019/Papers/privacylossappleproducts.pdf">Privacy Loss in Apple’s Implementation of Differential Privacy on MacOS 10.12</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is important for companies or other institutions that use DP-SGD to demonstrate that they train models within the privacy constraints expressed by clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Confidential-DPproof framework 
<p>We designed a framework, called <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=PQY2v6VtGe">Confidential-DPproof</a>, that allows institutions to directly and proactively prove to any interested party–users or customers, regulators or governments–, through the execution of a Zero Knowledge Proof protocol, that their machine learning models are trained in a privacy-preserving manner (i.e., protecting the privacy of individuals who provided their data for the training).</p>


    
    

    


    




 How does Confidential-DPproof work? 
<p>In our work, we propose a zero-knowledge proof protocol to proactively generate a certificate of privacy during the training process while preserving the confidentiality of all information including training data and model parameters.&nbsp; Zero-knowledge proof allows a party to prove statements about their private data without revealing it. Therefore, the prover’s dataset or model is not revealed to external parties.</p>
<p>Parties. Consider a setting with two parties, a prover and an auditor:</p>
 
 The prover is an institution that wants to train a model on a sensitive dataset for different purposes such as providing machine learning based services. 
 The auditor is an external entity (e.g., a user or an auditor) that aims to verify the privacy guarantees of the prover’s model. 
 
<p>Desiderata.</p>
 
 Completeness. The auditor must infer the exact privacy guarantee and provide a public certificate of such guarantee. 
 Soundness. The auditor must be able to catch malicious provers who do not adhere to their claims of training machine learning models with privacy guarantees, either intentionally or accidentally. 
 Zero Knowledge. The training data and model parameters computed during training must stay confidential as institutions are not willing/allowed to share their models and data with external parties due to privacy regulations and intellectual property concerns. 
 
<p>Confidential-DPproof framework works as follows:</p>
 
 Prover publicly announces the privacy guarantees that it is planning to provide; 
 Prover and auditor agree on the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent training algorithm and specific values for its hyperparameters. 
 Prover and auditor run our newly-proposed zero-knowledge protocol. 
 Prover obtains a certificate for the claimed privacy guarantee. 
 

 How is the performance of Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Since we design Confidential-DPproof to enable institutions to prove the differential privacy guarantees of their model to an auditor while being able to protect the confidentiality of their data and model, our experiments consider the following questions:</p>
 
 What are the best trade-offs between utility and certified privacy guarantees that Confidential-DPproof can achieve given i)&nbsp; the respective interests of the institution (in terms of utility); ii)&nbsp; the respective interests of auditor (in terms of privacy); and iii) constraints imposed by Zero-Knowledge proof regarding the complexity of models? 
 What is the cost (in terms of running time) of verifying the training run while ensuring confidentiality? 
 
<p>

    
    

    


    



ConfidentialDPproof trains machine learning models that achieve high test accuracy with certified privacy guarantees in practical running time!</p>

 Want to improve Confidential-DPproof? 
<p>Confidential-DPproof provides many benefits to institutions and their users; however, there is still room for improvement. For example, one could further extend Confidential-DPproof to prove that no adversarial data manipulation, such as sharing information across data points, was performed prior to data commitment.</p>

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights several key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  Blog  - let’s end the taboo of on-chain privacy <p>Our<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lets-end-the-taboo-of-on-chain-privacy/"> latest blog </a>covers why Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in financial exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 900+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 2 million $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Enhancement Stage-1 <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage is in progress to implement various fixes from previous stages. This week, we made several enhancements across different components of the protocol, including the Wallet Engine, to boost productivity. This included optimizing its cold start, resolving issues with data passing to the dApp, enabling silent initialization post zAccount activation, and addressing a set of Stage 4 issues. One of the key features to be released as a part of this enhancement stage is the transfer of zZKP from Panther Gas account to regular zAsset and vice-versa.</p><p>The team has further implemented error code mappings focused on enhancing user experience by providing detailed explanations for transaction failures. We are expecting to release stage 1 of enhancements for public testing in the week of February 26.</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a third party Relayer service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract. The team is currently performing integration testing with the second Relayer. Overall, the end-to-end Relayer integration process is working. The team is working on Stage 5 parallel with other stages and is pending the implementation on the dApp side.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal.&nbsp;</p><p>Changes to the smart contract are under development and expected to be completed by next week. The changes for displaying and charging fees from the dApp will require an additional two weeks. We expect to release Stage 6 for public testing in mid-March.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/weekly-update-panther-protocol-feb-16/">last week’s update</a> to learn more about Stage 6 functionalities.</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in Shielded Pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

<p>The monolithic blockchain era appears to be sunsetting. Among the first to contribute to this paradigm shift was Cosmos, which introduced the idea of specialized sovereign blockchains (appchains), made possible by the Cosmos SDK. Nowadays, the modular thesis employs external data availability and even execution solutions, which enables the creation of countless new chains. Each new blockchains comes with its own ‘specs’, and centralised RPC and node providers have to adapt to each chain’s setting. However, the saying ‘Jack of all trades, master of none’ applies in this scenario too - we have often witnessed RPC failures during high demand periods. Lava Network aims to provide a competitive marketplace for RPC and node providers, which would compete based on their performance and user feedback.</p><p>We were joined by Gil and Yair to discuss Lava Network’s RPC decentralisation in the modular, multi-chain landscape.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  High-level overview of Lava Network  What problem Lava Network solves  Decentralised marketplace for RPC providers  Quality of centralised vs. decentralised RPC providers  Gateways  Lava Network participants  Specs &amp; APIs  Quality of service &amp; provider optimizer  How services are priced  Relayers  Modularity &amp; chain abstraction  Magma &amp; Lava mainnet  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/yaircleper">Yair Cleper on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/xgilxgil">Gil Binder on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/lavanetxyz">Lava Network on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>As transparent Central Bank Digital Currency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/euro-backed-stablecoin-eurm-trials-spain?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">(CBDC) pilots</a> continue to gain traction, on-chain privacy has exploded into one of the polarizing issues in the Web3 industry. However, as is the nature of polarizing extremes, neither absolute transparency nor absolute privacy will serve users' real-world needs.</p><p>In fact, the privacy vs. compliance issue has existed and has already largely been solved for, across states and time. Existing systems based in the physical domain tend to operate on the principle of default privacy. As such, state-approved mechanisms are implemented to mitigate against fraud and other dishonest practices. These introduce and enforce transparency, such as mandatory financial reporting and audit requirements. Furthermore, additional privacy protections are extended to individuals and private enterprises such that their financial reporting isn’t exposed.</p><p>In contrast, those blockchain-based, public-ledger systems that underpin DeFi operate on default transparency. This means public ledgers require additional mechanisms that preserve privacy. Then, as per their physical domain equivalents, discoverability features must be implemented to prevent money laundering, tax evasion, and other forms of malicious activity from eluding the state.</p><p>The issue, therefore, is really about Web3 accepting that while DeFi does “solve money”, it must also solve for a balance between privacy and compliance, because money will always be in the domain of the state’s law enforcement (even when the state no longer prints it).</p> Going beyond early teething pains <p>Most Web3 advocates believe that blockchain ecosystems have the potential to provide the best conditions to operate an integrated global economy that is prosperous, liquid, resilient, and fair. However, institutions are never going to agree to operate in a fully transparent environment. Compliant on-chain privacy is the catalyst required to push decentralized financial players to penetrate the mass market.</p><p>To achieve this, the Web3 community must shake off the tendency to polarize DeFi privacy projects as teetering between terrorist financier and a tyrannical surveillance facilitator. While the nascent public ledger privacy sector has been met with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-strong-defense-trial?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">litigation</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/monero-drops-multi-month-lows-binance-delisting?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">critical delistings</a> — it becomes clear that now is the time for a mature solution set that respects the financial privacy rights of institutions and individual users, while providing the compliance features of its physical-domain cousins.</p><p>Now is the time to get serious about adoption. And, to achieve widespread adoption, Web3 needs to engage in a more nuanced conversation about the integral roles privacy and transparency play in facilitating the fundamental process of exchange, maintaining fair and free markets, and enabling institutions to conduct daily operations. In short, these issues are a matter of existential importance to the future of decentralized systems.</p> On-chain privacy, a problem solved <p>Panther Protocol has developed the mature, considered solution set that allows institutions and end-users to balance their privacy and compliance needs.&nbsp;</p><p>With Panther, institutional players have access to a suite of DeFi tools to manage dedicated trading spaces, called Zones, to trade digital assets in Shielded Pools — revolutionizing private trades with public, on-chain settlement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/shielded-pools/zones?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther Zones</a> are highly customizable, as are their disclosure mechanisms. The Panther suite empowers institutions to leverage privacy-protocol trades with allowlisted assets and counterparties. Designed with the operational efficiencies of institutions in mind, Panther simplifies portfolio and asset management with a suite of features that provide unparalleled privacy, security, and compliance support for public on-chain transactions.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther Protocol recognizes that the path to adoption isn’t about the mechanics of privacy, transparency, or discoverability, per se; it’s about providing meaningful abstraction to the end user. Panther’s Privacy Protocol is doing for the on-chain domain what the Microsoft Office suite did for the personal computer — delivering abstractions that make it usable. However, unlike Microsoft, Panther presents a Web3-native protocol based on chain-agnostic, decentralized principles.</p><p>Here at Panther, we believe that those who understand institutional operations and pain points intimately and who apply the technical know-how to develop versatile on-chain systems with refined privacy functions will be the major winners in Web3’s next major wave: the institutional onboarding process. We intend to spearhead that revolution.</p><p>Interested in customizing your own trading Zone? Reach out to us at contact@pantherprotocol.io.</p>

<p>PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of update v5.6.1, a crucial upgrade required for all users, including exchanges and service providers. It’s imperative that everyone updates their software prior to the implementation of the new Exchange Addresses to ensure seamless operations. With the upcoming activation height set at 4281680, the network will begin to isolate older versions to facilitate a smooth transition.</p><p>For most users, the update does not introduce any significant changes, except for the inability to send Shield Transactions to Exchange Addresses. Updating is straightforward: simply replace your existing pivxd or pivx-qt application with the latest version, or install the update via our provided installer packages.</p><p>For exchanges and service providers, the update introduces a novel feature — the “Exchange Address.” This innovation aims to simplify regulatory compliance and minimize accounting challenges associated with shielded transactions sent to exchanges. By utilizing the new RPC command getnewexchangeaddress, exchanges can generate these specialized addresses, which are identifiable by the “EXM” prefix, standing for Exchange Mainnet. This command also allows for labeling the new address, functioning similarly to existing commands like getnewaddress or getnewstakingaddress.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1">https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/releases/tag/v5.6.1</a></p><p>Additionally, the v5.6.1 update enhances the overall user experience with various quality-of-life improvements to the PIVX Core. These enhancements include upgraded GUI features, the ability to generate proposal addresses directly when creating proposals, CoinControl for selecting inputs for master nodes, the option to lock shield notes, and more. For a comprehensive overview of all the new features and improvements, we encourage you to read the release&nbsp;notes.</p><p>Please note that by block 4281680, the new Exchange Addresses will activate on chain, which should be around Feb 29th at 12:00 PM UTC. We will be sending our upgrade spork around ~48 hours before that, so please be sure to update before that to avoid any potential forking. All MNs will need to be “restarted” (the controller wallet will need to issue a new start message) during this&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This update is a testament to our commitment to continually enhancing the PIVX platform for all users, exchanges, and service providers</p><p>.<br>Many thanks to Liquid369, PIVX Core Dev for writing this announcement.</p><p>PIVXDevsRock! <br>PIVX&nbsp;Core</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-is-thrilled-to-announce-the-launch-of-pivxs-core-wallet-v5-6-1-894e66a92bf3">PIVX is thrilled to announce the launch of PIVX’s Core Wallet v5.6.1!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

</h3>

  Today we're announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today we’re announcing the highly requested and long-awaited rollout of self-custody BAT payouts for Brave Rewards. An initial group of invitees—and soon Brave users around the world—will be able to receive BAT earned from Brave Rewards to a self-custody wallet address on the Solana blockchain.</p>

 Invite only to start 
<p>Rewards on Solana is launching as an invite-only feature, starting with a limited group of early participants. Brave will send out invitations via a notification in the Brave Rewards panel. This invitation will unlock the ability for users to connect a self-custody Solana address and start receiving BAT on-chain. To find out if you’re eligible, keep an eye on Brave Rewards in your Brave browser.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Invitees will receive a notification in the Rewards panel and new tab page</p>
<p>To connect a Solana address to Brave Rewards, you’ll use a Solana wallet to verify that you own the address. You can do this with Brave’s very own integrated wallet, <a>Brave Wallet</a>, or with a third-party browser extension like Phantom.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Solana address connected to Brave Rewards</p>
<p>Once connected, monthly BAT rewards will be deposited directly on-chain to your Solana address in Wormhole-bridged <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">SPL-BAT</a>. That means you’ll be able to receive earned BAT without a custodial account (though the option to receive BAT rewards via a custodian will remain available).</p>

 Only possible on Solana 
<p>We chose Solana as the ideal network for the launch of on-chain Brave Rewards given its high transaction speed and low fees, which help reduce the costs associated with distributing BAT earnings to hundreds of thousands of users. For example, a single transaction on Solana costs on average $0.002 USD, while a single transaction on Ethereum, or on its most popular layer-2 scaling solution, Arbitrum, costs on average <a href="https://l2fees.info/">$1.00 and $0.10 respectively</a>.</p>
<p>This new way of distributing BAT removes many of the barriers everyday people face when onboarding to Web3. There are no withdrawal fees or limits, since the Solana wallet is entirely owned and managed by the user. Users can earn and receive BAT directly on-chain, and use it on-chain however they like. For example, here are some great ways BAT can be used on Solana:</p>
 
 Contribute directly to your favorite <a>Brave creators with on-chain contributions</a> (details below) 
 Exchange between hundreds of tokens through the swap feature in <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/13397025065357-What-are-Brave-Swaps-">Brave Wallet</a> 
 Buy a .SOL domain from <a href="https://www.bonfida.org/">Bonfida</a> 
 Earn trading fees by depositing SPL-BAT to <a href="https://www.orca.so/">Orca</a> liquidity pools 
 Mint and buy <a>NFTs</a> with SPL-BAT 
 

 Support your favorite creators on-chain 
<p>We also <a>recently announced a new on-chain contributions feature</a> as a more Web3-native way for users to support their favorite creators, including with the SPL-BAT they earn. Supporting self custody for users and creators is an important step toward a more decentralized Brave Rewards and Brave Creators experience. Together, they further our mission of providing users with greater control over how they browse, search, and transact on the Web.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our blog, social accounts, and <a href="https://community.brave.com/">Brave Community</a> forums for the latest news from Brave, and announcements about new rounds of Solana on-chain invites.</p>

<p>Last September, we <a>released a roadmap</a> of innovations for <a>Leo</a>, Brave’s privacy-preserving AI assistant built right into the browser.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve completed another piece of the roadmap: Leo can now interact with PDFs and Google Drive files. By seamlessly integrating with these popular productivity apps and document types, Leo enables users to save time and accomplish more at school and work, while preserving user privacy.</p>

 How we built document support 
<p>Brave’s built-in AI assistant Leo has recently gained new capabilities for understanding how to help users while using web-based tools and workflows. Specifically:</p>
 
 
<p>By using the accessibility tree in a PDF’s metadata, Leo can understand the underlying semantic structure of PDF documents.</p>
 
 
<p>By leveraging a technique called Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on canvas-rendered apps, Leo can use an image of a page to extract text in Google Docs and Google Sheets.</p>
 
 
<p>In both cases, Leo can offer insights and suggestions for users working with many different productivity applications, whether at school or at work.</p>

 Use cases for Leo’s document integrations 
<p>With this novel use of the accessibility tree, OCR, and other techniques, Leo can help with several important use cases. These include:</p>
 
 
<p>PDFs: Leo can extract topics and data deep within PDF documents. This can help with understanding research papers, preparing analysis from reports, finding details in a technical specification document, and more.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Docs: When you’re editing a Google Doc, Leo can propose relevant terms or writing styles, or even review the document as a whole.</p>
 
 
<p>Google Sheets: Leo can analyze tables and data in a Google Sheet, and even suggest formulas.</p>
 
 
<p>Slack workspaces: Leo can highlight key discussion points from a thread in a Slack workspace, extracting the thread’s essential points while saving you the time of reading the entire thread history.</p>
 
 
<p>YouTube: Leo can produce video transcripts from classes, industry events, and influencer videos. These transcripts can then be summarized for useful details mentioned in the video, and allow the user to ask Leo follow-up questions about the video or the transcript.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Brave Leo and unparalleled privacy 
<p>As a privacy-first company, Brave is dedicated to releasing leading alternatives to popular Web tools that also protect user data and anonymity. Leo—and its document integrations—is no different. This is particularly relevant as work and school documents may contain sensitive information:</p>
 
 
<p>Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address.</p>
 
 
<p>Discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers.</p>
 
 
<p>No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Just as Leo utilizes these techniques to preserve your privacy as you chat, it offers the same protections when Leo is helping you analyze documents and other files.&nbsp;</p>

 How to use Leo for PDFs and Google Drive files 
<p>Leo’s support for PDFs, Google Docs, and Google Sheets is available now for all Brave desktop users on version 1.63 or higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try it out, simply open a PDF, Google Doc, or Google Sheet in a tab in the Brave browser. Then click the  in the sidebar, and start asking Leo questions about the file.</p>
<p>Don’t have Leo in the sidebar yet? Just click Settings, then click Leo, and toggle on the Show Leo icon in the sidebar option.</p>

 What’s next for Leo and document / file support? 
<p>Leo will soon support other documents and file types. For example, Leo will integrate with GitHub, allowing code reviewers to summarize the purpose and impact of pull requests by analyzing code changes without line-by-line inspection. Keep an eye out for announcements about GitHub support, and for even more document and file integrations.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we saw Leo as far more than an AI chatbot (though it can handle real-time, contextual chats with ease). Rather, we saw Leo as a true smart assistant that could help you engage with the applications you use every day, to help you learn, work, and plan more efficiently. By surfacing insights from within PDFs, suggesting text for Google Docs, writing formulas for Google Sheets, summarizing YouTube videos, analyzing code in GitHub (and more), Leo saves you time and makes you more efficient and productive.</p>

<p>Greetings community,</p><p>It is our honor to announce the two year anniversary of the Shade Protocol governance &amp; utility token: SHD. Since the inception of Shade Protocol, we have strived to hold true to multiple paradoxes →</p>  Protect the privacy of individuals, while remaining transparent with the community  Ship products aggressively, while maintaining the patience of long term&nbsp;vision  Listen to the market and the users, but never lose track of our mandate to empower digital privacy, independence, and global permissionless access to unstoppable &amp; fair&nbsp;finance.  <blockquote>Your Money.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Data.</blockquote><blockquote>Your Decisions.</blockquote><p>In this two year anniversary we will explore the current distribution of the SHD token and a distribution update known as “The Merge” which will directly empower the decentralized Shade community &amp; DAO to control the future of Shade Protocol with the arrival of Shade Protocol governance close at&nbsp;hand.</p> The State Of Distribution 33.65% of SHD used, 66.35% remaining<p>The largest outlay of supply came from the creation of the following products (via grants to external teams as well as use of the dev fund for the operational cost of core contributors) →</p>  SILK Earn  SILK Vaults  SILK Oracle  CPMM DEX  DEX Rewards&nbsp;Contract  DEX Routing  Pair Factory  Asymmetric Concentrated Liquidity  IBC Bridging  Axelar Bridging  MetaMask wallet&nbsp;support  API V1 +&nbsp;V2  ShadeJS  stkd-SCRT  Shade Staking  SNIP Token&nbsp;Wrapping  SNIP Send  SNIP Portfolio  Bonds  Query Auth  Admin Auth Security&nbsp;Layer  Batch queries  Multi-execute tx Framework  Automated Rewards +&nbsp;Buybacks  Referrals (in progress)  Money Market (in progress)  dSHD (in progress)  Analytics V2 (in progress)  FINA debit card (in progress)  Liquidity Orderbook (in progress)  Liquidation Engine (in progress)  DAO DAO (in progress)  TX History (in progress)  Audits  Multichain airdrop  <p>Roughly 35 products / features requiring a development lifecycle &amp; 30+ developers across 15 different teams / contractors have been the lifeblood of setting the stage for the Shade Protocol MetaEngine.</p><a href="https://shadeprotocol.io/blog/shade-metaengine-an-interwoven-economy">https://shadeprotocol.io/blog/shade-metaengine-an-interwoven-economy</a> The Merge <p>With the advent of governance on the near horizon, the following five categories with their respective remaining tokens will be merged into the community pool to be governed by the decentralized SHD tokenholders:</p>  Airdrop (clawback)  Staking (real yield model transition)  Incentivized testing / bug&nbsp;bounties  Grants  Advisor +&nbsp;Listing  <blockquote>This bolsters the community pool from 1,000,000 SHD (~$7M / 10% of supply) to 3,700,597 SHD (~$25.9M / 37.05% of supply) to be governed via SHD&nbsp;stakers.</blockquote><p>An astute observer will notice that the green portion of the chart combines circulating + vested supply — summating to a larger number than what is currently listed for SHD circulating supply on Coingecko. This is because despite vesting progression &amp; completion for various categories (private raise, grants, dev fund, etc.) many entities have chosen to not claim their earned SHD — thus not directly impacting circulating supply (yet). Another key disclaimer is that of the 1.8M SHD dev fund, none of the dev fund SHD is staked / nor active in any capacity so as to not impact staking yield or governance proposals.</p> Protocol Liquidity Matching <p>Another distribution component to note is Protocol Liquidity Match (PLM) — a novel mechanism whereby Shade Protocol loans out tokens in collaboration with other protocols to bootstrap liquidity. This model is favorable as it does not involve an OTC and does not involve any emissions. However, this deal structure was invented prior to full blown decentralized governance; the core contributors are not comfortable categorizing PLM as “LP” without a community vote. As of right now PLM is handled and accounted for from the dev fund until a formal ratification of categorization via the community pool. The following are the 11 protocols that have been partnered with on liquidity deals (accounting for 40%+ worth of ShadeSwap’s volume) for both PLM &amp; OTC liquidity deals:</p>  Kujira  Manta  Andromeda  FINA  Persistence  Levana  Archway  Composable  White Whale  Sienna  Stride   Onwards To Governance <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119">https://forum.scrt.network/t/dao-dao-x-secret-network-proposal/7119</a><p>With the passing of <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/secret/proposals/280">prop 280</a> Shade Protocol has helped spearhead and coordinate the cross deployment of DAO DAO which will be usable as open source code by various protocols on Secret Network. With this soon to be deployment, Shade Protocol community will have access to the ability to vote on signaling proposals, community spends, parameter changes, as well as the creation of SubDAOs to solve &amp; coordinate in the name of Shade Protocol&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly is there is something meaningful to govern — with an increasing amount of fees, rewards, &amp; parameters to be stewarded and&nbsp;managed!</p> Conclusion <p>Shade Protocol is an array of connected privacy-preserving applications built on Secret Network.

							<p>On January 3, 2024, Trail of Bits reached out to us to raise <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/02/20/breaking-the-shared-key-in-threshold-signature-schemes/">a denial-of-service vulnerability</a> that affects different implementations of distributed key generation (DKG) protocols. Our FROST implementation was among those impacted.</p><p>This denial-of-service vulnerability introduced the possibility of an attack being carried out as follows:&nbsp;During the DKG run, a malicious participant can generate a random polynomial with a larger number of coefficients than required. In practice, this makes the key shares generated by the protocol have a threshold that is higher than intended. For example, when generating key shares with a threshold of 2, an attacker could silently increase that value to e.g. 3. Thus, two participants would never be able to successfully generate signatures since three or more would be required. Additionally, if the attacker increases the threshold to a number higher than the number of shares, then it would be totally impossible to generate valid signatures. In the Zcash context, this could mean that deposits made into a freshly-generated FROST wallet could become unspendable, leading to loss of funds.</p><p>We do agree that this is a confirmed and important vulnerability, which has been successfully remediated by adding <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/commit/e1fb9bc953a5ea5c22304c0018f56f407163f101">a simple check</a> to make sure the polynomials generated have the correct number of coefficients. This fix is included in the recently published 1.0.0 stable release of our FROST implementation. We are not aware of any production-ready FROST Zcash deployments using our software, so no user funds should be at risk.</p><p>We thank Trail of Bits for identifying the issue, providing a test case showing our crate was vulnerable and coordinating its disclosure.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is excited to announce the first stable release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/frost-core">frost-core</a>, a reference implementation of Two-Round Threshold Schnorr Signatures with FROST, written in Rust. This implementation has been <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2023/10/23/public-report-zcash-frost-security-assessment/">fully audited</a> and conforms to the latest and final version of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IRTF draft specification</a>, which we are confident will soon make it as a final Informational RFC.&nbsp;</p>



 



 What FROST does and why it matters 



<p>FROST is a threshold multi-party signature scheme. It allows a key to be split into multiple shares (or even to be created in a distributed fashion without having to create an original unsplit key), and then enables creating a signature by aggregating multiple signature shares created by participants who hold key shares. The threshold means that a minimum number of participants are required to be able to create a signature.</p>



<p>In the context of Zcash, this means that FROST allows creating wallets where transactions have to be authorized by multiple participants. This has multiple benefits: it’s more robust, since if a participant loses a share, it is still possible for the other participants to sign transactions (and they can help to reissue the lost share); and in the same vein, if a participant gets hacked, the attacker won’t be able to solely sign transactions.</p>



<p>With the <a href="http://www.github.com/zcashfoundation/frost">frost</a> Rust library, the Zcash Foundation provides a reference implementation for the informational “Two-Round Schnorr Threshold Signatures with FROST” CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) Internet Draft. The CFRG is a general forum for discussing and reviewing uses of cryptographic mechanisms and is part of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which in turn promotes research of importance to the evolution of the Internet protocols, applications, architecture and technology.</p>



<p>This release includes the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/tree/main/frost-rerandomized">frost-rerandomized</a> variant, an adaptation to the FROST threshold signature scheme to make it unlinkable, which is a requirement for its use in the Zcash protocol. The adapted scheme generates signatures that are compatible with spend authorization signatures in the Zcash protocol, for the Sapling and Orchard network upgrades. This makes it possible for Zcash transactions to be authorized by more than one party, while preserving the privacy of individual signers.</p>



 



 Privacy-preserving threshold multi-party signatures for Zcash 



<p>Now that the frost reference implementation is production-ready we look forward to the acceptance of <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/662">ZIP-312: “Shielded Multisignatures using FROST”</a> and its implementation in the Zcash ecosystem. We will continue to work on a set of demos to show how some of the challenges for integration into wallets may be solved, as well as to provide a reference for implementers.</p>



<p>We would like to thank the following current and past ZF team members for their contributions to the FROST reference implementation; without their work and support, we would not have reached this milestone today:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chelsea Komlo, Conrado P. L. Gouvêa,&nbsp; Natalie E., Deirdre Connolly, Pili Guerra, Alfredo Garcia, Teor, Marek Bielik, Henry de Valence, Jane Lusby, Josh Cincinnati, Antonie Hodge, Fungai Matambanadzo.</p>



<p>We would also like to thank all of the numerous external contributors to the spec and code base.</p>

<p>As the global need for environmentally conscious energy intensifies, tokenisation emerges as a groundbreaking strategy to democratise energy ownership. Amidst the growing consensus on the need for a shift to renewable resources, the challenge of accessibility and affordability persists. By leveraging blockchain technology to fractionalise ownership of renewable energy assets, tokenisation offers an inclusive pathway for individuals and communities to invest in and benefit from sustainable energy sources. This innovative approach not only aims to lower the barriers to entry in the renewable energy market but also foster a more distributed and participatory energy landscape.</p>



<p></p>



 Democratising energy: The role of tokenisation in ownership 



<p>The shift towards sustainable energy is a global priority, underscored by initiatives like the Paris Agreement, especially within Europe. This movement faces the challenge of perceived high costs and barriers to entry in the renewable energy sector. However, recent commercialisation of energy storage technologies shows significant <a href="https://www.irena.org/Energy-Transition/Technology/Energy-storage-costs">cost reductions</a> in wind, solar power, and grid stability over the past few years. This cost reduction has widened access to renewable energy, allowing a broader spectrum of individuals to benefit from these technologies.</p>



<p></p>



 How tokenisation democratises energy ownership&nbsp; 



<p>Tokenisation plays a pivotal role in further democratising energy ownership. For individuals without direct access to physical assets, such as a roof for solar panels, tokenisation offers a novel solution. Through crypto anchors and property rights encapsulated within tokens, individuals can own a share of an energy asset. This approach not only allows for the ownership of the physical asset but also enables individuals to own carbon credits, kilowatt hours, and even data rights associated with the energy asset.</p>



<p>One such initiative is <a href="https://www.sunified.com/">Sunified</a> –&nbsp; a solar technology company creating critical infrastructure to facilitate yield farming on solar infrastructure. Yield farming is the process of staking or lending cryptocurrency assets within a DeFi protocol’s liquidity pool to receive rewards, often in the form of the protocol’s governance tokens. Liquidity providers are then compensated with an annual percentage yield (APY) in real-time for their contributions as a result. The purpose behind yield farming is to promote the platform’s utilisation and compensate the community for adding liquidity, crucial for the ecosystem’s vitality and growth. Sunified’s initiative also includes storage infrastructure integration into electric vehicles (EVs) and other parts of the energy ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As energy grids undergo a gradual transformation over the next decade, tokenisation offers immense opportunities to introduce new business and ownership models through blockchain and sound crypto infrastructure architectures. This transition presents a unique chance to reconstruct the energy ecosystem, making sustainable energy ownership more accessible and flexible for a wider audience.</p>



<p></p>



 Fractional ownership of solar power&nbsp; 



<p>Fractional ownership in the context of solar power introduces an innovative approach to investing in renewable energy. This concept allows individuals to collectively invest in solar projects, such as solar parks or community solar gardens, through a blend of equity and debt financing. The essence of fractional ownership lies in the tokenisation of solar infrastructure, breaking down the investment into manageable units—whether in the form of €100 blocks or based on the capacity, such as 100 Watt blocks of a solar panel.</p>



<p>A group of experts would initially determine how to capitalise on a solar project, deciding on the mix of equity and debt to make the project investment-ready. This capital structure can then be tokenised, offering participation rights to investors. Tokenisation carves up the asset into fractional pieces, making it possible for a wider audience to invest in solar energy projects.</p>



<p>It is crucial to differentiate between owning a part of the solar park itself and having rights to the energy produced by it. While you might not fractionalise the energy output directly, fractionalising the means of production — i.e., the solar panels and infrastructure — offers a tangible way to invest in solar energy. Fractional ownership and tokenisation democratises access to renewable energy investments, enabling more people to contribute to and benefit from sustainable energy solutions.</p>



<p></p>



 How should a real-world asset, such as energy, be put on the blockchain?&nbsp; 



<p>Placing a real-world asset like energy onto a blockchain involves a multifaceted approach that bridges the physical and digital worlds. With a particular focus on renewable energy sources like solar power, the process starts by establishing a tangible connection or “hook” between the physical asset and its digital representation on the blockchain. This involves integrating a sensor directly into the asset during the manufacturing process, such as embedding it within a solar panel at the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) factory. This sensor plays a crucial role in anchoring the asset across three realms: the physical world, the digital world, and the crypto realm.</p>



<p>The sensor enables tracking of the solar panel’s lifecycle from its inception, including its initial performance and the carbon footprint incurred throughout its supply chain journey. By activating the panel in the field, it is possible to account for its entire lifecycle, including production, deployment, and operational carbon emissions. This comprehensive approach ensures that the asset is not only represented accurately on the blockchain but also that its environmental impact is meticulously accounted for.</p>



<p>This method transcends traditional reliance on third-party verification or trust anchors, reducing the need for intermediaries. Instead, it offers a direct and trustworthy linkage between the real-world asset and its blockchain counterpart. This direct connection is essential for leveraging blockchain’s capabilities to support decentralised and distributed energy systems, which are increasingly becoming bidirectional.&nbsp; Unlike the traditional centralised energy distribution model, where power flows from a central hub to consumers, modern energy grids are evolving to support energy flow in both directions. This shift necessitates new measurement infrastructure to accommodate and accurately represent these changes on the blockchain.</p>



<p></p>



 Navigating challenges in energy tokenisation 



<p>The journey of tokenising energy assets is fraught with multifaceted challenges, significantly influenced by regulatory uncertainties, security concerns, data privacy issues, market volatility, and a general lack of understanding and readiness within the industry. A pivotal aspect of navigating these waters involves identifying the nature of energy tokens for regulators—be it as utility, payment, or governance tokens—or even advocating for a multi-use token that transcends traditional categorisations.</p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Hurdles 



<p>Discourse within the digital asset community highlights a need for regulatory frameworks around energy tokens that must be clearly defined. This confusion necessitates a rigorous educational effort towards regulators, to clarify the distinctions and functionalities of various token types, including utility, energy, asset, and governance tokens. Without clear regulatory guidance, projects are compelled to seek jurisdictions with more favourable legal frameworks. The UK is a regulatory example of a more defined ecosystem for property rights, energy governance, and tokenisation of real-world assets. The only other option would be to work within regulatory sandboxes and project-specific frameworks to advance tokenisation initiatives without overstepping uncertain legal boundaries.</p>



<p>Moreover, the push towards standardising practices across different regulatory environments presents another layer of complexity. The UK has made significant strides in establishing clear guidelines through bodies like The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Other jurisdictions are still in the budding stages of adapting their regulations to accommodate the novel demands of tokenised energy systems. In addition to regulatory hurdles, the practicalities of offering energy tokens without categorising them as equity to facilitate easier trading, and the fundraising challenges for scaling projects across multiple locations, are critical.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Communication 



<p>The ability to articulate the concept and clear implications of tokenising energy resources, such as solar panels, is crucial for market acceptance and regulatory compliance. This task extends beyond mere product explanation; it encompasses clear dialogue with lawmakers, consumer protection bodies, and entities concerned with data privacy. Simplifying complex technological underpinnings for a diverse audience, from regulators to the layperson at the bus stop, is essential. Failure to do so risks future operational nightmares, underscoring the importance of both education and transparency in the tokenisation ecosystem. Simplification without sacrificing essential information ensures that investors, users, and stakeholders, who will journey with the initiative for years to come, fully comprehend its value and operation, making the technology’s intricate background less daunting and more accessible.</p>



<p></p>



 Where to begin: energy tokenisation 



<p>Embarking on the journey of energy tokenisation requires a foundational understanding of the token’s purpose, its intended holders, and the value it offers. Before diving into the legal and technical specifics of token types, it is essential to address these fundamental questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This approach does not necessitate a one-size-fits-all solution. For instance, investors interested in direct engagement with energy projects can opt for utility tokens, whereas those looking for a more traditional investment route might consider security tokens tied to assets like solar parks. This flexibility allows projects to cater to diverse investor preferences, enhancing accessibility and interaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Highlighting the significance of inclusivity and accountability in energy trading, an initiative such as the <a href="https://www.amelandenergie.nl/">Amelander Energy Cooperative</a> demonstrates the potential for democratising energy markets. Such a project demonstrates the possibility for transparent, traceable systems that ensure accountability across all levels of interaction—from investors to consumers, and from producers to the overarching financial ecosystem. Achieving this level of integration and transparency is a meticulous process to harmonise understanding and communication across various stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Tokenisation within the energy sector signifies a significant stride toward democratising access to renewable resources and fostering sustainable practices. By bridging the gap between the physical and digital realms, tokenisation introduces a new paradigm where renewable energy assets, like solar power, become attainable and manageable for a wider audience. This process not only democratises access to sustainable energy solutions but also addresses the pressing need for energy independence, resilience, and environmental preservation. As we navigate the complexities of regulatory landscapes and technological challenges, the ultimate goal remains clear: to create an energy ecosystem that is inclusive, transparent, and aligned with the principles of environmental sustainability. Through collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and community engagement, tokenisation has the potential to reshape our energy future, making sustainable living a reality for all.</p>

<p>Prolonged range bound markets are a hallmark of bearmarkets and they usually end up chopping inexperienced or over leveraged traders. Customised structured products offer a solution for market participants that want to limit their downside, but also the upside, by introducing knock-outs at certain levels or triggers. Such custom options, usually with lower probabilistic chances of occurring, naturally come at a discount. This allows traders to hedge their risk, while also betting on certain outcomes or market scenarios.</p><p>We were joined by Zhiming Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, to discuss crypto derivatives and how TradFi expertise applies to customising structured products for crypto markets.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Zhiming’s background in investment banking  FX derivative products  Exotic options  Crypto structured products  Custom solutions for crypto miners  Hedging Uniswap V3 impermanent loss  Options based on prediction markets  Managing counterparty risk  Protocolising structured products  Differences between TradFi and DeFi  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhiming-yang-800103b/">Zhiming Yang on LinkedIn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/Orbit_Markets">Orbit Markets on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.orbitmarkets.io/">Orbit Markets website</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>Another week has flown by in the dynamic world of Panther – now it’s time to share our latest updates and progress with the Panther community! This week’s rundown highlights a series of key developments and testing from the past week.</p> Ecosystem updates  AMA with Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar <p>On February 8, we hosted an AMA session featuring Panther Protocol’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, and Head of Community, Joris Koopman.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ-NfX_4ldY&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Watch the recording</a> for full insights into our latest testnet updates, testing processes, reward systems, and upcoming testnet releases.</p> Panther testnet video guide for account creation <p>You asked – we delivered! Panther has received numerous requests to provide support materials dedicated to the account creation process. For a step-by-step video guide detailing how to make your very own testnet Panther account, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw3LhZKvM_U&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">check out our tutorial video</a>. Once you have your account set up, the video will also show you how to get started earning $ZKP rewards. All you need is a MetaMask wallet and 10 minutes!&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Current testnet users: 800+  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share? Grab the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">latest link</a> from Panther’s docs to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Product updates  Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 includes using a 3rd party Bundler service and supports gasless transactions via an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.</p><p>Users will be able to submit transactions via Bundlers and pay gas fees in $ZKP instead of $Matic (on Mumbai testnet but similarly on Polygon) from the Panther Gas account that holds $zZKP.&nbsp;</p><p>Integration testing is underway, with two end-to-end Bundler providers operating successfully. Changes on the dApp side are expected to reach completion as we utilize resources from other stages of development taking place in parallel.</p> Enhancement Stage - 1 developments <p>As we continue to strive for parallel development efforts, a 2-week technical enhancement stage was slated to implement various fixes from previous stages along with a feature for Gas Management. This key feature allows users to move their $zZKP inside MASP from the regular balance to the Panther Account Gas balance and vice versa. Gas Management plays a significant role enabling users to top up their Gas balance and make sure they have sufficient $zZKP to pay for various transaction costs.</p> Stage 6 developments <p>Stage 6 of testnet is a complex stage and includes overall fee management, basic disclosures, and zAccount renewal. Stage 6 allows users to test:</p>  Fee deductions from the Panther Gas account and payment to 3rd parties such as Compliance providers and Bundler service providers.  Protocol fee deductions in a transacted token currently set to be charged on Withdraw.  Basic disclosures that allow Panther users to provide adequate transaction reporting to outside parties issuing requests that can be satisfied by independent on-chain verification.  &nbsp;A zAccount renewal function (after the expiry date). This feature functions in a similar manner to KYC renewals.  <p>Additional smart contract and testing changes are in progress, and will require one more week to complete. Following the completion of these changes, development on the dApp will begin.&nbsp;</p> About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools; zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs; and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s Zero-Knowledge primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

  Partnering with LangChain: The LLM Application Framework  <p>Harrison, Ankush and their team are building the AI programming framework every engineer needs.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/sonya-huang/">Sonya Huang</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/romie-boyd/">Romie Boyd</a>	 



Published February 15, 2024
  



Team LangChain



 
<p>We are at the dawn of a new age of applications, with large language models (LLMs) as the enabling technology. But programming an LLM remains more art than science. The instructions that generate robust, reliable performance out of these non-deterministic models remain poorly understood. We are still in a wild west of prompt hacking, eyeballing outputs and a lot of duct tape when it comes to Generative AI.</p>



<p>We have seen this movie play out before. In Software 1.0, frameworks such as React and Next have abstracted, modularized and organized the most common building blocks of software engineering, making it fast and reliable to build and test your next mobile app or website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI, too, deserves a proper programming framework. Developers are craving a common set of best practices and composable building blocks for their LLM applications, to simplify the complex and to avoid reinventing the wheel. <a href="https://langchain.com/">LangChain</a> founders Harrison Chase and Ankush Gola have designed just that: an open-source toolkit for building sophisticated, data-aware applications on top of LLMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Engineering teams use LangChain to accomplish a myriad of tasks: accessing datasets to power retrieval-augmented generation (LangChain boasts over 600 integrations); running “chains,” or collections of calls, to enable more complex applications (some companies run chains with thousands of links or more); giving LLMs access to external tools; and using LLMs as full-fledged “agents” capable of planning and reasoning to accomplish goals.</p>



<p>Zooming out, LangChain is a platform that allows companies to build the scaffolding of their applications’ cognitive architectures. It is paving the way for developers to build much more powerful LLM applications, going beyond simple one-shot queries to the intelligent, interconnected systems in which these reasoning engines truly shine. The more complex LLM operations are what allow for jaw-dropping results, and we at Sequoia believe that LangChain can be a force multiplier on the pace and quality of AI application and agent development.</p>



<p>Harrison was a standout machine learning engineer at our portfolio company Robust Intelligence when he started LangChain as a nights-and-weekends side project, with no plans to build a company. But after he released the first version, it quickly took off. He quickly started working with Ankush, a star colleague from Robust. From the start, they have been humble, responsive, and fast—all key ingredients for keeping up in the quickly evolving world of generative AI. And above all, they are community-first, spearheading a community of more than 2,000 open-source contributors.</p>



<p>Today, more than 50,000 LLM applications have been built using LangChain, with use cases ranging from internal apps to autonomous agents to games to chat automation to security scanners and more. And while the platform is already a mainstay at weekend hackathons, we have also been excited to see many of our portfolio companies moving their LangChain use cases into production. Soon, your delivery order or customer support or gaming experience may be powered by LangChain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And there is more to come. To continue the Software 1.0 analogy, developers benefit not just from open-source frameworks like React and Next, but also services such as GitHub, Datadog, Vercel and Heroku to deploy and monitor their applications into production. LangChain’s ambitions are similarly expansive.</p>



<p>The company’s latest “big bet” is <a href="https://www.langchain.com/langsmith">LangSmith</a>, a product that helps developers debug, test and monitor their LLM applications. As customers move from prototyping into production, LangSmith is providing the visibility and tooling they need to make their generative AI applications more performant and reliable. Elastic powers their Elastic AI Assistant for security in LangChain and leverages LangSmith for visibility helping them get to production fast. Rakuten relies on LangSmith for rigorous testing and benchmarking so they can make tradeoff decisions about their copilot Rakuten AI for Business, built in LangChain, in a systematic way. And Moody’s relies on LangSmith for automated eval, easy debugging and experimentation so they can quickly iterate and innovate.</p>



<p>Since the announcement of LangSmith’s closed beta in July, 70,000 users have signed up and more than 5,000 companies now use LangSmith every month. We look forward to seeing that list grow with the product now in GA. More recent product launches include LangServe, an easy way to deploy LangChain into production, and LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.</p>



<p>Even all of this is still just a taste of what LangChain has in the pipeline. The team is building in a rich problem space with plenty to explore, and they are guided by a passionate user community with no shortage of important problems for them to solve.</p>



<p>We are thrilled to partner with LangChain and lead their Series A.</p>

  Sequoia Open Source Fellowship: Applications Now Open  <p>Calling all open source developers to pursue your projects with no strings attached.
</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published February 15, 2024
  



 
<p>Last year we introduced the Sequoia Open Source Fellowship with the goal of encouraging the development of open source software and supporting the community of open source developers. More than ever, open source serves as the bedrock and lifeblood of the world’s software, with companies of all sizes utilizing OSS. The entire ecosystem relies on libraries and software packages—often solely maintained by open source developers. While Sequoia has partnered with many companies that found success commercializing OSS, the non-commercial spirit of open source collaboration underpins almost every aspect of modern technology. The fellowship was designed to support this work without any expectation of an equity stake in a commercial project or company.</p>



<p>We started the fellowship as an invite-only program. This year, we are excited to announce that we are opening applications to the public. Starting today, any developer working on an open source project may apply for a fellowship stipend. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open source software is critically important for ensuring that progress continues to come from every corner of the globe and not just from a few companies in Silicon Valley. We see a pressing need for collaboration, for developers to collectively push forward what new technologies are capable of in ways that serve the entire ecosystem and the public good.</p>



<p>To apply, simply complete our brief questionnaire and we’ll be in touch if your project is a good fit. We will primarily be focused on existing open source projects. Fellows will receive a stipend to cover reasonable living expenses for 6 to 12 months. They will continue to own the fruits of their labor—any code written before, during and after the program will remain entirely the fellow’s. Sequoia will not take equity or expect anything in exchange for the sponsorship. We plan to accept 2 to 3 fellows per year.</p>



<p>If you’re building something exciting in open source, we want to hear from you. Applications are now open—see <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/oss">here</a> to apply.</p>

Metadata leaks with every single online interaction.</p><p>The mixnet achieves this by splitting data into identically sized encrypted Sphinx packets and dispersing these in three hops to ‘mix nodes’ worldwide at randomized intervals. Next, the mixnet shuffles in dummy ‘cover’ traffic, further complicating tracing. Together these features make tracking metadata patterns impossible even for powerful adversaries with a global view of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Nym and Zcash share the same vision of privacy for everyone. The invention of Zcash by the Electric Coin Company has already made great strides to defend user privacy by bringing zero-knowledge proofs to market, an innovation that many other projects are now building upon. However, like every technology, zero-knowledge proofs remain vulnerable at the transport layer of the internet — a problem acknowledged <a href="http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf">in the original Zerocash whitepaper</a>.</p><p>Powerful adversaries can analyze traffic patterns such as the stream of TCP/IP packets used to submit transactions, which can then be used to de-anonymize users. ISPs can snoop on traffic patterns to passively record Zcash activity. And the growing crypto surveillance industry can passively spy on peer-to-peer traffic, as well as conduct active&nbsp;attacks.</p><p>Even advanced privacy protections like Zcash’s auto-shielding feature are vulnerable at the network layer. For example: if an adversary obtained a Zcash user’s transaction address, or extracted it from a unified address, they could then send a transaction to the address. Then, they could observe the user’s wallet as it broadcasts the t2z auto-shielding transaction. By repeating this process, the attacker could obtain more granular details such as IP measurements, and track these over&nbsp;time.</p><p>“We at Nym believe people deserve privacy — it is an alienable right to a dignified life free from gross intrusion and interference,” said Harry Halpin, cofounder and CEO at Nym Technologies. “But in the digital realm, intrusion and interference are simply the normal state of affairs. This is unsustainable and needs to change. With this groundbreaking integration, Nym and Zcash are working together to make real privacy online a reality.”</p><p>Josh Swihart, CEO of ECC (Electric Coin Company), said: “I’m extremely pleased to see Nym come to life on the Zcash network. Network-level privacy has been a missing piece since Zcash’s inception. This partnership between these two projects will significantly deepen protections from everyday users wishing to protect their financial privacy. It’s fantastic to see the privacy ecosystem come together.”</p><p>Jason McGee of Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) said: “ZCG is excited to support Nym’s proposal to enhance network-level privacy protections for Zcash. This effort aligns with our core mission to advance the Zcash network, and underscores ZCG’s commitment to addressing challenging issues related to privacy and security. By integrating Nym’s mixnet technology into Zcash’s lightwalletd infrastructure, Nym is laying the foundation for future integrations with Zcash nodes and wallets. Our hope is that this collaboration marks the beginning of a long-term partnership that results in significant improvements in privacy protections for Zcash&nbsp;users.”</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-begins-integration-for-complete-privacy-protection-on-zcash-ecosystem-7452d1ea7141">Nym Begins Integration For Complete Privacy Protection On Zcash Ecosystem</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Brave now offers a fully native version for ARM64 Windows. When you newly install Brave on your ARM64 device, then you get an even faster browser. Read on to learn more, or skip to the end to find out how to get the new version.</p>

 What is ARM64, and why is it important? 
<p>ARM64 is a newer type of CPU, developed for speed and efficiency. Every computer has a processor (or “CPU”) that acts a little like a brain. Processors can be made in different architectures that essentially govern at a low level how the CPU works. Typical architectures are the 32-bit x86 architecture and the more recent 64-bit x64 architecture.</p>
<p>You can only run programs on your computer that are compatible with your CPU architecture. For example, you cannot run a program made for x64 on an x86 processor.</p>
<p>Software companies get around this by offering multiple versions of their programs. So you can, for example, download an x86 version of Brave if you are on an x86 CPU, and an x64 version if your computer’s processor has the x64 architecture.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most Windows computers have an x64 CPU. But recently, another architecture has entered the mainstream through products such as Microsoft’s Surface laptops. This architecture is called ARM64 and it offers better power efficiency and performance.</p>

 ARM64 and Brave 
<p>Newer CPU architectures are usually able to run programs with an older architecture. For example, an x64 CPU can run an x86 program. Likewise, ARM64 CPUs can run x64 and x86 programs. But there is a significant performance overhead. In the example of Brave, you could run x64 Brave on an ARM64 computer. But it would be slower than it should be. We therefore spent considerable effort last year to offer an ARM64 version of Brave for Windows.</p>
<p>So what’s necessary to get an ARM64 version of Brave? To create Brave, we write code in programming languages such as C++. The programming language is readable as text by us humans. But CPUs operate in their own machine language. In order for the CPU to be able to run our code, it needs to be translated to machine code with a program called a compiler. We can tell the compiler the architecture of the CPU we want to target. So, mostly, we could take our existing C++ code and tell the compiler to produce machine code for the ARM64 architecture.</p>

 On-demand updates and universal installers 
<p>Given how complex Brave is, there were of course also parts where this process didn’t work quite so seamlessly. The first problem we encountered was the following: When you type <code>brave://settings/help</code> into Brave’s address bar, you get a page that shows Brave’s version. Crucially, this page also checks for a new version of Brave with a little spinning animation. This feature showed an error in x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. After extensive research, we realized that this is caused by a fundamental limitation in the Windows operating system itself.</p>
<p>To work around the problem, we introduced a universal installer which ensures that our users do not accidentally install x64 Brave on ARM64 Windows. Instead, they always receive a copy of Brave with the correct architecture for their system. What does this look like? When you go to brave.com and download its installer, then you get a 1 MB .exe file. When you run it, it downloads the latest version of Brave for your CPU architecture from our servers. This ensures that you don’t get the error described above.</p>

 DRM protected content and Widevine 
<p>The second main technical hurdle was caused by an optional and downloadable component of the browser called Widevine. Web sites such as Netflix use this component to protect their content. If you do not have the Widevine component installed, then Netflix (and similar sites) may only serve you low-quality videos, if anything at all.</p>
<p>Widevine is proprietary technology and its licensing terms do not allow us to redistribute it. This means that we can’t just create an ARM64 version of Widevine and include it in Brave. But an ARM64 version of the component can be downloaded from public Google servers. So we do the following: The first time you visit a web site that requires Widevine, we ask you if you agree to downloading and installing the component:</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>If you agree, then Brave downloads and installs Widevine from Google’s public servers. While Brave already worked this way for other architectures, it required a lot of extra work for ARM64. If you are interested in the technical details, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/18695">pull-request #18695</a> on the brave/brave-core repo.</p>

 This sounds great. How do I get ARM64 Brave? 
<p>You need Windows 11 and an ARM64 CPU. To check if your CPU is ARM64, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/check-if-processor-arm64-x64-64bit-windows-11/">How to check if processor is ARM64 or x64 (64-bit) on Windows 11</a> article on pureinfotech.com. If you have an ARM64 CPU, but installed Brave before December of last year, then you need to first uninstall this old copy of Brave to get the newer ARM64 build. When the uninstaller prompts you for confirmation, be sure not to select the check box that says “Also delete your browsing data?”. Once you’ve uninstalled the x64 build of Brave from your ARM64 CPU, go to brave.com, click on the Download button and follow the instructions. When you then type <code>brave://version</code> in Brave’s address bar, you should see “arm64” mentioned on the page.</p>

 Summary 
<p>More and more new Windows computers have ARM64 CPUs. In order for Brave to be as fast as possible, it needs to be optimized for this architecture. We completed this technical work last year. There were some technical challenges on the way, but we were able to overcome them. You can now install ARM64 Brave on Windows 11 by visiting <a>brave.com</a>!</p>

		<p>Horizen Labs has submitted a ZenIP Discussion topic on Discourse, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/t/zenip-42400-modernizing-horizen-technology-via-a-modular-proof-verification-layer/394">ZenIP: 42400 – Modernizing Horizen Technology via a Modular Proof Verification Layer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that ZenIP 42400 focuses on the modular proof verification layer. If this proposal passes, Horizen Labs will roll out subsequent phases to the Horizen community for discussion and debate as the “New Horizen” initiative progresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenIP 42400 is focused solely on the establishment of a Modular Proof Verification Layer, i.e., a blockchain dedicated to verifying proofs with the ability to support any settlement layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we dive into what this means for the Horizen Ecosystem, let’s review a few points that have been raised by the Community regarding this proposal:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Name of the Initiative: The term “New Horizen” is currently a placeholder for the system and its individual component blockchains. The designation is being used to conceptually describe the initiative until an official name is determined. 
 EON Integration: A key aspect of the development strategy is the integration of EON into the new Proof Verification Chain. The Horizen Labs teams are actively involved in exploring viable pathways for this migration, ensuring that EON remains an integral part of the Horizen ecosystem after the implementation of the blockchains that comprise the “New Horizen” initiative. 
 $ZEN Tokenomics: Currently, there are no plans to modify $ZEN’s tokenomics, and any such change would be subject to community discussion and DAO approval.&nbsp; 
 Market and User Research: The Horizen Labs team used comprehensive market and user research, aiming to design a user-friendly system capable of widespread adoption.&nbsp; 
 
 Why should the community be excited about this “New Horizen” proposal? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative will modernize the Horizen tech stack to better align with the broader web3 industry while building on the legacy of the Horizen Mainchain and Zendoo. This will “future-proof” the Horizen network and unlock market value to the Horizen ecosystem. New Horizen is based on current web3 market needs and addresses a problem that affects most modular web3 protocols: volatile and expensive proof verification costs for L2s (ZK-Rollups in particular).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Labs’ proposed “Proof Verification Chain” aims to substantially reduce rising security costs for L2s.</p>
<p>A dedicated Proof Verification Chain would not only make running a ZK-Rollup more economical, but also align with the anticipated shift towards these technologies becoming the dominant scaling solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, collaboration in the Web3 space is becoming increasingly important, New Horizen aims to foster this collaboration across ecosystems and expand the reach of the Horizen ecosystem. The Horizen Labs team is working to ensure that the Proof Verification Chain described above is being designed to accommodate a variety of proof types and settlement layers. By developing a solution that is versatile enough to be compatible with multiple development frameworks, proving systems, and settlement layers, this positions Horizen as a hub of collaborative innovation. Potentially reaching new audiences beyond our current community, embracing and leading the change towards a more interconnected and cooperative blockchain environment.&nbsp;</p>
 How Will this Work? 
<p>The “New Horizen” initiative is set to deliver multiple components that address the market’s current and future needs across several phases. The Proof Verification Chain (Phase 1) will focus on verifying proofs originating from other blockchains, such as rollups / appchains or applications. Initially, the focus will be on ZK-SNARK proofs, in particular zk-snarks produced by ZK-Rollups, but the plan is to expand its capabilities to accommodate a wide range of proof types in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proof verification layer aims to improve the existing process of proving state validity for ZK-Rollups and other proof-generating applications, offering a more efficient, scalable solution to handle these operations, which will reduce the costs of blockchain networks.</p>

 Scalability, Decentralization &amp; Security — What Trilemma?  The blockchain trilemma is a classic idea that truly decentralized blockchains need to choose between security or scalability. Verus offers a different perspective and a new approach. Together we will come to the conclusion that the Verus Protocol solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or security, effectively solving the trilemma.  A Closer Look at the&nbsp;Trilemma <p>Before we dive in, let’s examine the current perceived definition of the crypto trilemma: “You can’t have a scalable blockchain that is truly decentralized and thus secure” — it is said to achieve worldwide scalability a blockchain needs to be fast so it can process all the transactions for a large population (btw, this is a false premise, you can read about that later.) And to get a fast, high tps (transactions per second) blockchain it must compromise on decentralization and thus security.</p><p>Decentralization and security go hand-in-hand. A truly decentralized protocol (open to all, many validators) is secure because it is difficult to 51% attack such a protocol. If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain — censorship-resistance.</p><blockquote>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>There is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all, which makes them slower, and makes it more difficult to get them to process large numbers of transactions. To get a high tps blockchain you would need to lower the number of validators so they can find consensus more easily, and raise the hardware requirements for running a node so they can process those transactions quicker too. Yet doing so compromises true decentralization. The lower the number of validators, the less decentralized, the less robust. And the higher the hardware requirements, the less accessible it is for people around the world, the less decentralized.</p><p>The trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world. We will show you how Verus offers a new and better approach.</p> Scalability Does NOT Mean High&nbsp;Tps <blockquote>Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator — like GHz for computers.</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency protocols often boast about how fast their blockchains are (transactions per second) as an indicator of their scalability. Contrary to popular belief this is a false premise. Transactions per second are nothing more than just a performance indicator. Like how we use GHz (CPU clock speed) to indicate how fast a computer is, or an even better example — how fast servers&nbsp;are.</p><p>To bring the promise of crypto to billions of people around the globe let’s make a comparison with the Internet. The Internet does not run on one single server. All websites and applications that we use daily are not connected to one single server. The Internet has not been scaled to the world by constantly upgrading the one server to a faster one. It’s millions of servers that are servicing billions of people around the world. These millions of servers are perfectly connected, and completely interoperable so that using the Internet today is a seamless experience.</p><p>Now, with this perspective in mind, let’s get back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn’t scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Instead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.</p><p>Verus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.</p> Unlimited in&nbsp;Scale <p>Before we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let’s start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.</p><p>Most, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up — increasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.</p><p>Verus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It’s called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the organization’s need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>There is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don’t go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.</p><p>Of course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are — in a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.</p><p>Cross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (&amp; ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) — it’s all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to&nbsp;use.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let’s dive into&nbsp;it.</p> Built to be Decentralized <p>There are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security — Verus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee&nbsp;Pool.</p><blockquote>Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or&nbsp;tax.</blockquote><p>Before we jump into the above let’s acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralized protocol, to being credibly neutral. Just like Bitcoin before, Verus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax. Verus is not a company or a business. Verus is rent-free and all protocol fees go to the block producers. These facts are super important to incentivize decentralization and to be a credibly neutral protocol in the eyes of the&nbsp;world.</p> A Hybrid Consensus Mechanism <p>Now let’s unpack Verus Proof of Power, the consensus mechanism of the Verus blockchain, and all PBaaS-chains. It’s a hybrid of 50% proof-of-work and 50% proof-of-stake, and it’s <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf">a provable solution to 51% hash attacks</a>. Out of the 1440 daily blocks (on Verus, and when a PBaaS-chain opts for 1-minute block times), half is solved by mining and half by&nbsp;staking.</p><p>VerusHash, the proof-of-work mechanism which disincentivizes ASIC &amp; FPGA development, and favors CPUs, mobile phones and ARM-devices for mining. Mining with mobile phones and for example, Orange Pi 5’s are the most cost-efficient way to do it. This proves a significant leap towards a more inclusive mining environment. It’s accessible to everyone and thus creates a naturally decentralized protocol.</p>An Orange Pi 5 mining farm by community member&nbsp;DCAL4.<p>Additionally, to give even more power to miners, they can merge-mine up to 22 PBaaS-chains simultaneously without sacrificing their original hashing power. This dramatically increases efficiency and network security. So, when considering an unlimited number of PBaaS-chains on the network, each miner can choose up to 22 to mine. They can choose for profitability, or choose the ones they want to&nbsp;support.</p><p>This approach to mining is environmentally conscious. The protocol’s design allows for low-power devices to mine extremely efficiently. It lowers the entry barrier for participation in blockchain validation, especially in low-income countries, yet can also give life to phones that are old or with broken screens. Thus significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional PoW&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Then we have the proof-of-stake part of the consensus mechanism. This one is really simple and powerful. Anyone can run a node and start staking. There is no minimum amount of VRSC needed (pretty unique in the world of PoS). Verus <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e">solved the “nothing-at-stake”-problem</a> therefore there is no slashing of funds. Funds staking are never locked and running a node can be done with something as cheap as a Raspberry Pi 4. All-in-all proving yet again that Verus is accessible to everyone, creating a naturally decentralized protocol.</p><p>We can conclude that Verus is truly a decentralized protocol, naturally emerging from its extremely low-barrier mining and staking. So what does that mean for security?</p> Protocol Security at Another&nbsp;Level <p>Seeing as the Verus Protocol is naturally decentralized and provable 51% hash attack resistant, it’s extremely secure. PBaaS-chains take these properties with them as they have the same consensus mechanism, and the Verus miners can choose up to 21 of them to merge-mine. It’s fair to say that there is no compromise on security given the scalability of the protocol.</p> Verus Introduces the Fee&nbsp;Pool <p>Let’s first explain the fees the protocol generates for the miners and&nbsp;stakers:</p>  PBaaS-chain launches: 10,000 VRSC (5,000 for the block producers of Verus, 5,000 for the block producers of the newly launched&nbsp;chain)  Currency launches (tokens, basket currencies, liquidity pools, ERC-20 mapped currencies): 200&nbsp;VRSC  VerusID registrations: 100, 80, 60, 40 or 20&nbsp;VRSC  subID registrations: 0.02&nbsp;VRSC  DeFi conversion fees: min. 0.0125%, max.&nbsp;0.025%  Transaction fees: 0.0001&nbsp;VRSC  <p>Builders and users pay these protocol fees for their operations and the fees are directed into the Fee Pool. Then, for each new block, 1% of the Fee Pool is added on top of the regular coinbase reward (currently 6&nbsp;VRSC).</p><p>The Fee Pool is introduced as a security measure to keep the protocol stable. We have seen in other blockchain protocols that when a block has large fees, block producers try to “snipe” the block (putting lots of hash onto the network, then pulling it out of the network, or even trying to reorder the blocks for their own gain). In doing so they destabilize the protocol. Verus mitigates this behavior by spreading the extra fees over many&nbsp;blocks.</p> Smart Contracts Are Not&nbsp;Secure <p>Most blockchain protocols use the VM-based application model — smart contracts written with Solidity. It’s full of smart contract hacks and bugs and has insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. On top of that MEV (maximum extractable value) is rampant, due to the serial processing of transactions on the VM-model (it’s easy for a block producer to reorder transactions inside a block for their own gain). We can honestly say that the VM-model is not&nbsp;secure.</p><p>The Verus approach is different as it follows the fundamental systems design principle — the most important security layers should be located in the protocol itself, and not coded on top via L2 (smart contracts). All operations on Verus and PBaaS-chains are directly connected to consensus, secured by the miners and stakers of the protocol.</p><p>Now you might ask yourself “But can we build dApps that are as capable as building them with the VM-model?”. The answer is yes. Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions.</p> Does Verus Solve the Blockchain Trilemma? <p>A fair question. And hopefully we answered with enough detail. The answer is&nbsp;“yes!”.</p><p>Let’s summarize. Verus does not compromise on decentralization and security to reach unlimited scalability. Unlimited scalability is reached by scaling out, not scaling up. It is the equivalent not of upgrading your server but of putting an extra server next to it to spread the bandwidth around.</p><p>Decentralization is achieved by making mining and staking accessible for everyone through extremely low hardware requirements. This naturally creates a large number of miners and nodes (stakers), making the network robust against attacks of all&nbsp;sorts.</p><p>High security is not only reached through the decentralized nature of the network but also because of the Fee Pool and the fact that all operations are directly connected to consensus and thus the miners and&nbsp;stakers.</p> Now is the Time to Build with&nbsp;Verus <p>Without having to rely on smart contracts, builders can develop dApps that are even more powerful, secure and scalable. Builders can use the no-coding-required API commands, together with VerusID and its VDXF (Verus Data Exchange Format) as a controlled public storage system with multiple levels of nesting to create dApps of any&nbsp;kind.</p><p>The foundation has been laid for a true Internet of Value.

Instead of slowing down on AI progress, Beff explains why we should be speeding up.&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🎧Listen On Your Favorite Podcast Player&nbsp; <a href="https://bankless.cc/Podcast">https://bankless.cc/Podcast</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>🐙KRAKEN | MOST-TRUSTED CRYPTO EXCHANGE <a href="https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2">https://k.xyz/bankless-pod-q2</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; ⁠&nbsp;</p> <p>🔗CELO | CEL2 COMING SOON <a href="https://bankless.cc/Celo">https://bankless.cc/Celo</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🗣️TOKU | CRYPTO EMPLOYMENT SOLUTION <a href="https://bankless.cc/toku">https://bankless.cc/toku</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>🛞MANTLE | MODULAR LAYER 2 NETWORK <a href="https://bankless.cc/Mantle">https://bankless.cc/Mantle</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>💸 CRYPTO TAX CALCULATOR | USE CODE BANK30 <a href="https://bankless.cc/CTC">https://bankless.cc/CTC</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦄UNISWAP | ON-CHAIN MARKETPLACE <a href="https://bankless.cc/uniswap">https://bankless.cc/uniswap</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>------ TIMESTAMPS&nbsp;</p> <p>0:00 Intro 7:15 Why Pseudonym 15:01 The e/acc Pil 31:54 Fume 36:25 Beff’s Beliefs 39:39 Defining e/acc 40:52 The Dangers of AI? 52:05 Why We’re Here &amp; The e/acc Religion? 58:19 Thermodynamics &amp; Life&nbsp; 1:06:16 Maximizing Human Happiness?&nbsp; 1:16:25 Forgetting Society’s Bottom Half&nbsp; 1:23:00 Cancer Also Grows? 1:29:01 AI Regulation 1:33:09 Social Media’s Mistake &nbsp; 1:36:30 AI Bill of Rights&nbsp; 1:38:26 Domesticating AI 1:41:00 Biggest Threats Against e/acc&nbsp; 1:43:43 AI Humans vs. Humans&nbsp; 1:46:09 e/acc vs. Decels…Violence?&nbsp; 1:49:09 Beff’s Thoughts on Crypto 1:54:36 Beff’s Company - Extropic 1:58:18 Closing &amp; Disclaimers&nbsp;</p> <p>------ RESOURCES</p> <p>Beff Jezos <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos">https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Guillaume Verdon <a href="https://twitter.com/GillVerd">https://twitter.com/GillVerd</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Extropic <a href="https://twitter.com/Extropic_AI">https://twitter.com/Extropic_AI</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>AI Safety Podcasts - The Decels Eliezer Yudkowsky <a href="https://youtu.be/gA1sNLL6yg4">https://youtu.be/gA1sNLL6yg4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Connor Leahy <a href="https://youtu.be/pMoVsM1EWR0">https://youtu.be/pMoVsM1EWR0</a>&nbsp;  Paul Christiano <a href="https://youtu.be/GyFkWb903aU">https://youtu.be/GyFkWb903aU</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Nate Sores&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/Ymjb3SkElco">https://youtu.be/Ymjb3SkElco</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Not financial or tax advice.

		<p><a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a> was originally designed and built by the Horizen Ecosystem team as a POC (proof-of-concept) sidechain, called Tokenchain, to test the scalability and durability of the Horizen network. TokenMint was a live proof of concept that permitted the team to build Horizen EON, and now that Horizen EON is successfully running, the time to deprecate TokenMint is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the deprecation, all TokenMint users will need to remove their $ZEN from the sidechain before the deprecation date to avoid loss of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important Dates</p>
 
 Wednesday, February 21st, 2024 – TokenMint Testnet will be Deprecated 
 Wednesday, March 6th, 2024 – TokenMint Mainnet will be Deprecated 
 
<p>To move $ZEN off of TokenMint, users can simply send their ZEN from their Cobalt Wallet to a Horizen mainchain address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning: ZEN can only be sent to Horizen Mainchain Sphere addresses from Cobalt. Sending ZEN to another Horizen Mainnet address outside of Sphere could lead to a loss of funds.</p>
<p>Please open a ticket on our <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord server</a> with any questions or concerns during the deprecation period and please be sure to REMOVE your ZEN from TokenMint BEFORE March 6th, 2024, as the funds will be permanently lost after that date.</p>
<p>How to Send ZEN to the Horizen Mainchain from Cobalt Wallet</p>
 
 Open your Cobalt Wallet and make sure you are connected to the TokenMint chain.&nbsp; 
 In the Assets and Activity page, click the ZEN row. The page now allows you to send ZEN. It displays the current amount available. 
 Click the up arrow to send a transaction. 
 In the Send to field, enter the desired address you want to send the ZEN to. This field will display an error, if you enter an invalid address. 
 In the Amount field, enter the amount of the ZEN you want to send. 
 In the password field, enter your password to complete the transaction. 
 Click Submit. The Sent flag appears indicating that the transaction is successful. 
 Click Back to display the transaction activity. The Send page appears. If the transaction is pending, a notification will appear stating that the last pending transaction for this address has not been confirmed. Note that it can take up to 72 hours for the transaction to show on the destination wallet, even if the transaction is confirmed on the TokenMint explorer.

Combining a high performing 2-hop VPN mode with a full privacy 5-hop mixnet mode, the app encrypts your traffic and routes it across a decentralised global mixnet, enabling actual private and secure communication.</p><p>To have a chance to try the NymVPN, join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">the NymVPN channel in Matrix</a> and introduce yourself. Nym is looking for people with a strong awareness of privacy to help battle-test NymVPN before V1.0 rolls&nbsp;out.</p> Introducing Nym Squad&nbsp;testing <p>The Nym community have already got their hands on the alpha and are busily testing the VPN in a series of workshops all over the&nbsp;world.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.daoariwas.xyz/">DAOariwas</a> <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/introducing-nym-squads-e2972f70a778">Squad</a> were the first to jump at the occasion. Based out of the hackerspace <a href="https://platohedro.org/">Platohedro</a> in Medellin, Colombia, they travelled to the recent <a href="https://ethcincodemayo.com/">Ethereum Hackathon</a> in Cholula, Mexico and held the first community-organised NymVPN test&nbsp;session.</p>Left: the Daoariwas squad in Puebla, Mexico. Right: NymVPN session in Cholula,&nbsp;Mexico.<p>NymVPN alpha test sessions were also underway at the Swiss Free Software movement meet-up in Vaud, Switzerland — and in Lyon, France at the bitcoin meet-up, with many more planned in Kyiv, Prague, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>The alpha version will roll out in a staged launch, starting with Nym Squads and friends and then in batches to members of the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN waitlist</a>. Newer batches will be added based on the stability of the applications and the capacity of the network to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Alpha and beta testers are gaining free access to the NymVPN.

It features customizable entry and exit locations for geo-blocking resistance and is launching with two&nbsp;modes:</p>  The 5-hop Nym mixnet&nbsp;mode  <p>The 5-hop mixnet mode is optimised for privacy and uses the full capabilities of the Nym mixnet, a decentralised network of servers all over the world that ‘mix’ traffic so it becomes untraceable. The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/follow-the-packet-spoiler-you-cant-9c14380335c7">mixnet encrypts your traffic</a> in novel onion encryption, then routes it via an entry gateway, three mix nodes and an exit gateway. This makes it near impossible for anyone to link sender and receiver, ensuring advanced privacy against even government-level adversaries. It is the optimal solution for sensitive use cases like crypto transactions, messaging, and secure email, that are not timing sensitive. It protects metadata, IP addresses and patterns of communication from traffic analysis and end-to-end correlation.</p><p>Read more about the <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym&nbsp;mixnet</a>.</p>  The 2-hop Nym dVPN&nbsp;mode  <p>The 2-hop dVPN mode is optimised for speed. This mode uses the entry and exit gateways of the Nym mixnet, enabling IP address obfuscation for everyday browsing, streaming, or&nbsp;gaming.</p>NymVPN on Manjaro&nbsp;Linux<p>It is multi-hop by default, going far beyond the privacy standards of most VPNs. Most VPNs don’t provide privacy at all. Instead they just shift who knows your IP address and has access to your habits from the server you are communicating with, to the VPN provider. In fact, many free VPNs take advantage of this fact and sell your browsing habits for profit. The Nym dVPN is decentralised so there can be no centralised logging of your online&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Read more on the difference between <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/decentralized-vpns-vs-traditional-vpns-all-the-differences">traditional and decentralised VPNs</a>.</p> NymVPN: upcoming&nbsp;features <p>Upcoming features include split tunnelling so you can preset which of your apps should run through the low latency 2-hop mode, and which require full privacy protections of the 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode.</p><p>There will also be a killswitch to prevent data leakage, and censorship resistance to ensure anyone can access the internet from anywhere, even in regions with strict restrictions.</p><p>Sign up to the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN waitlist</a>.

<p>Fellow Panthers,</p><p>It’s time to review what Team Panther was up to in January and our plans for February. In this month’s update, we cover ecosystem updates, team expansion, product highlights, and a glimpse of next month’s plans; here’s everything you should know:</p> Ecosystem updates  Testnet Stage 3 is now live with a new design, enhanced security, and added features <p>Testnet Stage 3 was released in January, bringing a new design, enhanced security, and added features. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther’s Shielded Pool.</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-3-is-now-live-with-a-new-design-enhanced-security-and-added-features">Stage 3 of our testnet</a>.</p> LBank lists Zero-Knowledge DeFi pioneer Panther Protocol’s $ZKP&nbsp; <p>We are excited to share that Panther Protocol’s $ZKP is now listed on LBank, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. This listing follows $ZKP’s listing on BitMart in December 2023. These listings are part of our focus on cementing strategic partnerships and a strong exchange presence before Panther Protocol’s V1 launch.</p><p>More about the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/lbank-to-list-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">LBank listing</a>.</p> AMA recap: Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, discusses $ZKP listing on BitMart and the future of privacy in DeFi <p>Following the recent listing of $ZKP on BitMart, Panther’s CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart’s community. Catch a summary of the conversation in our <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ama-recap-panthers-ceo-oliver-gale-discusses-zkp-listing-on-bitmart-and-the-future-of-privacy-in-defi/">latest blog</a>.&nbsp;</p> Panther Protocol testnet and rewards update   Number of current testnet users: 634  Total rewards distributed: 500,000+ $ZKP  <p>Our testnet rewards pot is 1.5M $ZKP — have you signed up for our testnet yet to earn your share?<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Learn more and sign up</a> to join our testnet and receive your $ZKP rewards.</p> Panther’s Co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale on CryptoCoinShow <p>&nbsp;Our co-founder and CEO, Oliver Gale, was recently on the @CryptoCoinShow discussing Panther’s strategic direction and the future of privacy-preserving tech in DeFi. Watch the complete episode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM65JyReAj0&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.</p> Panther hires Harrie Bickle to improve product documentation <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harriebickle/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Harrie Bickle</a> has joined the Panther team as a Senior Technical Writer. Harrie brings over a decade’s experience in Documentation and Product Marketing and has been in the blockchain space since 2018. Her range spans writing and editing articles, whitepapers, yellow papers, developer portals, and API documentation.</p><p>We are delighted to welcome Harrie and look forward to seeing our documentation reach a new level, thanks to her expertise gained while editing for Starkware in the Zero-Knowledge space and building out developer portals for Qredo’s crypto trading API and Neon EVM’s Solana settlement layer solution.</p> Product updates  Stage 4 developments <p>The dApp development for Stage 4 is complete, and we expect to launch it in the first week of Feb. Stage 4 of testnet allows users to send zAssets inside the pool from one zAccount to another. Stage 4 is a feature-filled release as it is being shipped with an interesting, related feature originally from Stage 6: Withdrawals.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the Stage 4 dApp, users can also undertake UTXO selection.&nbsp;</p> Stage 5 developments <p>Stage 5 development is underway in parallel, thanks to the team’s efforts over the last two months. The team is currently working on integrating bundle services into the dApp. Stage 5 includes using a third-party Bundler service and the ability to submit gasless transactions using an Account Abstraction Paymaster contract.&nbsp;</p> Oshiya update <p>We’ve updated the code for our Panther miner, Oshiya. The latest version of Oshiya comes with an enhanced miner setting: FORCE_UTXO_SIMULATION. This parameter gives control over whether the miner should consistently add a simulated UTXO, regardless of the presence of any pending queues. When set to ‘false’, a simulated UTXO will only be added if a pending queue exists. We recommend running the updated version of the Oshiya code.&nbsp;</p> Plans for February&nbsp; <p>Following the launch of Stage 4, the team will concentrate on enabling the dApp to support users to select a transaction for the Bundler service and perform end-to-end testing of this feature.&nbsp;</p><p>In parallel, the core team will focus on Stage 6, with its revised scope offering a cohesive Fee and Rewards mechanism. In this stage, users will pay all the fees (mimicking a production experience) and receive ‘subsidies’ from the DAO for certain fees, such as for compliance checks, among others. These subsidies are part of the bootstrapping and will be limited to the initial period of the protocol launch. We wish to understand our users’ views on the fee structures and invite the community to engage with the DAO to discuss the subsidies that should be applied during mainnet launch.</p>  About Panther <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation (ZF) is excited to share our vision for the next two Zcon conferences: ZconV (virtual) in May 2024 and Zcon6 (in-person) tentatively scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. Get ready for impactful presentations and outcomes at ZconV, under the inspiring theme “Zcash Unified!”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 ZconV 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>ZconV will be a virtual conference, happening online in early May 2024. It will be a celebration showcasing how the diversity of&nbsp; individuals, organizations, and projects within the Zcash ecosystem contributes to its success and innovative spirit. Our goal is to open doors for inclusive and widespread participation from our global community, while maintaining our commitment to fiscal responsibility amidst the uncertainties surrounding the Dev Fund and market conditions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using the popular Whova web and mobile app, which received rave reviews during our last conference, ZconV will offer an interactive and dynamic platform for real-time Q&amp;A, discussion boards, polls, chat, and video conferencing. Keep an eye on the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/zconv/">ZconV webpage</a>&nbsp;for continuous updates and ways to engage in these enriching discussions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Zcon6 
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As for Zcon6 we plan to bring the Zcash Community together for an in-person event in Mexico City in early 2025. This gathering will focus on strategic planning and commitment to long-term projects, empowered by a clear understanding of available resources. The timing in Q1 2025 not only offers cost-effectiveness but also a warm and inviting atmosphere during the colder months in many parts of the world, adding an extra layer of appeal for attendees. Stay tuned for more details on Zcon6, including the exciting reasons behind choosing Mexico City, coming your way by the end of Q3 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Join us for these two landmark events as we continue to propel Zcash into a bright and unified future!</p>

Every Panther user is assigned a zAddress upon sign-up. Find your zAddress in the dashboard by clicking the Receive button, as shown in the screenshot.</p><p>You can also share your Panther account address (zAddress) via a QR code from the receive screen. </p> Withdrawals <p>Users can now withdraw zAssets from the shielded pool to their external, linked wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>This external wallet may be the wallet linked to the original Panther account. Alternatively, testers may create a new Panther account with an alternative external wallet and withdraw to an account that did not originally deposit assets.&nbsp;</p><p>The withdrawal process performs compliance checks to ensure that users own the zAccount they are interacting with. This step also verifies that the wallet accepting withdrawals has no illegal association as part of the KYT (Know Your Transactions) check.</p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.</p> Get started with Stage 4 testing <p>To start testing Stage 4, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated dApp test link and follow the steps outlined.</p> Internal Transfers <p>Log into your MetaMask wallet and sign into the Panther dApp.</p> Step 1: Navigate to the Send screen <p>Send is available from:</p>  Top main menu &gt; zAssets &gt;Send tab  zAssets &gt; Portfolio card &gt; Send button  Dashboard &gt; Private zAssets section &gt; token line &gt; token management buttons   Step 2: Create the transaction <p>Enter the amount to send and choose the token from the menu.

As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in testnet Stage 4! </p><p>Note: An issue was reported after Stage 3 that made a specific zZKP UTXO unusable. This UTXO was created by converting PRP to zZKP. Because this UTXO was unusable, we made a custom filter on dApp to not fetch them thus avoiding confusion between good and bad UTXO.&nbsp;</p><p>Users who had those zZKP UTXO, however, will be compensated by a direct distribution to their externally owned account thereby ensuring rewards are not lost. Users do not need to perform any action on their side. </p> Not sure how to create a Panther testnet account? watch our tutorial below:

          About Panther Protocol <p>Panther Protocol is a cross-protocol layer that uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology to build DeFi solutions that aim to meet ever-evolving regulatory standards while satisfying users’ on-chain data privacy needs. Panther’s goal is to enable seamless access to DeFi via a cross-chain-supported ZK compliance protocol. The Panther Protocol offers confidentiality across transactions in shielded pools, zSwap for DeFi integrations — enabling private swaps on third-party DEXs, and zTrade for internal OTC book for trading assets privately. Furthermore, Panther Protocol’s ZK primitives are generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

		<p>On February 7th, 2024, at approximately 12:00pm UTC, ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via hard fork at block #1502800. As previous communications have stated, after this hard fork it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pool before then.&nbsp;</p><p>Failure to remove shielded ZEN from shielded addresses prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your shielded ZEN. It’s important to note that transparent ZEN is not affected by the hard fork, just shielded ZEN.&nbsp;</p><p>This move came with the successfully passed <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">ZenIP 42207</a> earlier this year, which enabled the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain. This change built upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">ZenIP 42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features. As a result, it will no longer be possible to conduct a private transaction on Horizen or access private addresses as of February 7, 2024.</p><p>This is a complete removal of all private payment features from Horizen, effective Feb 7, 2024. There will be no private payment capabilities in Horizen as of this change. Regular public payments, just like Bitcoin, will continue to be supported by Horizen. Horizen will not be a privacy cryptocurrency anymore when this takes effect on Feb 7, 2024.</p><p>Again, we strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses transfer their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 7th, 2024. After February 7th, 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p><p>There is a guide on the Horizen Blog on how to De-Shield ZEN on Sphere Wallet, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool. Please reference the guide here: <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/">https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-de-shield-zen-on-sphere-wallet/</a></p><p>The Horizen Ecosystem Team remains readily available to answer any questions around this, please open up a ticket, or reach out to us on our Discord: <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">https://horizen.io/invite/discord</a></p>

  Partnering with Oasis Security: The Stars Align  <p>At Sequoia, we look for strong teams going after growing markets. In Danny Brickman and Amit Zimerman, and non-human identity security, that’s exactly what we found.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a>	 



Published January 31, 2024
  



Bogomil, Danny and Amit hiking Twin Peaks in San Francisco.



 
<p>When we first met Danny Brickman in the summer of 2021, we identified him as a young star in the Israeli entrepreneurial ecosystem and someone we should watch. At the time, he was still ideating and had not started a company. But we recognized in him the same passion and drive we’d seen in the founders of Sequoia portfolio companies Wiz and Cyera (who, like Danny, are graduates of the elite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpiot_program">Talpiot program</a>).</p>



<p>At the same time, we at Sequoia were developing a thesis that identity was the largest remaining opportunity in security. Why? In part because when we asked CISOs to name their top three priorities, identity security was the most frequent theme. In the lingo of security pros, identity is the new perimeter, with the majority of security attacks today occurring via a malicious actor stealing a user’s identity. It is more important than ever to tighten that perimeter, and to have solid answers to questions like who should have access to what—and who is actually accessing what. Which team members need to use which apps and resources? What kind of access should they have? Are their current privileges too broad?</p>



<p>Most of us are very familiar with the process of securing how humans access systems. We may even get annoyed by the constant reminders to choose stronger passwords—but we know how costly it can be to have our private identity stolen or to allow an attacker into our corporate systems. What comes as a surprise to many, though, is that only a very small fraction of access requests in a company today actually come from humans. In the age of distributed systems, microservices, APIs, automation and AI agents, the overwhelming majority of these requests are from systems and machines—with their own identities, just like ours—accessing other systems and machines.</p>



<p>These non-human identities now outpace human ones by a factor of at least 10, and in some companies 50 or 100—an abundance of riches for an attacker to go after! But even more important, some of these non-human identities like service accounts and secrets (API keys, tokens and certificates) have much broader privileges than most human users; they may be able to not only access an application but also modify its settings or even delete it entirely! And in the hands of bad actors, such identities can wreak yet more havoc—from deleting an entire AWS environment to exfiltrating a lot of data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As critical as non-human identities have become, however, the processes and tools for securing them and managing their lifecycle are still emerging—and that can leave teams vulnerable to ticking time bombs, just waiting to explode. One security leader told us about a key generated with permission to read all of the company’s email, with no constraints—which was then emailed to an external contractor who used it to write software on their personal device. Another security admin found a Slack app designed for Christmas greetings that also had full read access to all conversations. Then there was the small recruiting product with root access to all Gmail.</p>



<p>As we at Sequoia explored the challenges and opportunities in the identity security space, we wrote an internal white paper detailing the need we saw, and were considering incubating a company in the domain. But Danny and co-founder Amit Zimerman were recognizing the same opportunity—and they decided to tackle it themselves.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.oasis.security/">Oasis Security</a> takes a holistic approach to securing non-human identities, solving for the specific issues that make managing their lifecycle so different from managing human identities. This includes not only the scale, but the rate of change. Human identities change at the rate of employees joining and leaving the team—or changing their passwords. Non-human identities, on the other hand, can be ephemeral, including short-lived tokens and certificates that expire in seconds. Oasis Security’s platform also accounts for the “blast radius” of non-human identities, which are more likely to interfere with entire systems than with individual users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Sequoia team is thrilled that the stars aligned for us to support this important work and lead Oasis Security’s Series A, and we are proud to be in business with Danny, Amit and their team as they work to build a generational company. In the face of the huge and growing challenge of securing non-human identity, they are leading the charge toward a solution—and we will all be safer for it.</p>

<p>January 31, 2024, San Francisco, California— Today Brave Software announced the launch of Brave Ads Manager, a new platform to buy, manage, and report on privacy-preserving ad campaigns in the Brave ecosystem. The platform had been in limited <a>beta</a> since last spring and is now offering open <a href="https://ads.brave.com/">registration</a> to customers worldwide.</p>
<p>The Brave browser has grown to an audience of over 65 million monthly users while Brave Ads, which was <a>introduced in 2019</a>, has successfully run 9,000+ campaigns for 1,500+ advertisers in 200 countries. Throughout 2023, Brave Ads also expanded with the help of early adopters to ad placements on <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, the fastest growing search engine since Bing. Brave’s recent clients include Ford, Intuit, Norton, Swarovski, and Wayfair.</p>

 Reaching the next generation of early adopters 
<p><a>Brave users</a> are lead users and are passionate about their role in the future of the Web. As early adopters of emerging technologies like Web3 and AI, they value independence, quality content, and privacy above all when browsing. This makes them engaged but not easily reachable through conventional channels.</p>
<p>Brave Ads reconnects users with advertisers and enables direct relationships where users and brands meet on their own terms. Users set preferences for privacy-respecting ads, choosing when, where and how often to engage. Advertisers signal care for customers by respecting these choices, building goodwill and trust. No trackers or cookies are ever used. Ultimately, both parties benefit from Brave’s model of transparency and control over online experiences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With over 65 million users and growing, Brave can’t be ignored by brands who want to reach the people at the frontier of the Web. What Brave users do, buy, and talk about today, the rest of the world will be doing, buying, and talking about in years to come.”</p>
<p>Luke Mulks, VP Business Operations</p>
</blockquote>

 The easiest way to advertise with privacy in mind 
<p>Customers can navigate a familiar and streamlined campaign creation process to create their Brave Ads campaigns in minutes. Once a campaign is submitted for review, customers can expect launch within 48 hours. Throughout the campaign, customers will have access to a dashboard to view campaign performance through a range of basic and advanced tools, all designed for practical use in the cookieless Web.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    
Brave Ads Manager campaign creation</p>

 Unique browser-based ad placements 
<p>Brave Ads Manager customers have the option to buy Notification and Newsfeed ad placements, two of four available ad types found throughout the Brave <a>browser</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/notification/">Notification ads</a> were the first—and remain the most popular—ad unit to launch with Brave Ads in the browser. For acquisition-based campaign objectives, advertisers can leverage Mindset Ad Targeting, Brave’s unique ad-matching technology that delivers precision, interest-based targeting at the browser level without risks or harm to privacy.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/news/">Newsfeed ads</a> are native image and text placements integrated seamlessly within Brave News, a free and customizable RSS and news aggregator available in the Brave browser via a new tab page. Ads in Brave News are always 100% SOV (share of voice)—two ads will never display in the feed at the same time.</p>

<p>Brave’s two other ad placements—<a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-browser/ntt/">New Tab Takeovers</a> and <a href="https://ads-help.brave.com/ad-placements/brave-search/keyword/">Search keyword ads</a>—are available as managed service buys and can be booked by <a href="https://ads.brave.com/contact">contacting Brave’s ad sales team</a>.</p>
<p>About Brave Ads</p>
<p><a>Brave Ads launched in 2019</a> with the goal of reforming an increasingly user-hostile Web, made worse by ever-invasive tracking from innumerable ad-technology firms competing to capture as much data—people’s data—as possible. Brave Ads are cookieless, don’t track or identify users, and offer choice in how brands engage with them as they browse and search the Web.</p>

 Consensus 2024 — Verus Showcases Fully Completed PBaaS Blockchain Technology  Verus showcases its fully completed Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) technology at Consensus 2024, May 29–31, Austin, USA. The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.  The L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks <p>Developing dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (<a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID</a>) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to&nbsp;them.</p><p>All these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts — it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [<a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-smart-transactions-vs-smart-contracts-f98079c00ed0">read more</a>] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/eth-bridge/">more on the&nbsp;Bridge</a>].</p> Showcasing Verus App-Development Opportunities at Consensus 2024 <p>Get ready for a new era of decentralized application development. Unlike today’s complex smart contract applications, requiring VM-based smart contracts that talk to user facing applications through server-side APIs and phishing-prone web-interfaces using public key hashes or rented names as identity, the Verus network is a Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 0 (L0) protocol with composable and powerful multi-chain core primitives, including identities, currencies, MEV-resistant liquidity baskets, updateable, even transferable ID-bound databases that can comprise NFTs and real world assets, all on a 100% fully decentralized, unlimited scale backbone, secured by the 50% proof-of-stake / 50% proof-of-work, 51% hash attack resistant Verus Proof of Power (PoP) consensus and accessible securely from mobile clients or cloud-based web-applications.</p><p>Build applications in your favorite framework for clients and access the Verus network either through QR-codes and deep-links to a client-side wallet under user control or talk directly to data-indexed, blockchain nodes, capable of providing fast access to an unlimited number of user identities and their unlimited Verus Data Exchange Format (VDXF) indexable key-value database providing provable, optionally private, worldwide resolvable data at unlimited scale over an unlimited number of blockchains. All of this power, including inherent eCommerce and markets of all types are usable by applications, and unlike yesterday’s Internet, application-owned data stays under application control, while user-owned data remains under user control and subject to voluntary, provable disclosure, protected by zero knowledge privacy, as it should always have&nbsp;been.</p><p>Write applications your way, your client frameworks, your languages, with links and RPC calls to the decentralized Internet of Value. Connect through one or more blockchains. Use, create, sell, and provision your application’s permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on the rent-free, credibly neutral and fully decentralized Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p><p>Builders of applications, organizations, and businesses can use the Verus Protocol to provision IDs, manage and interact with users and user state at any scale, launch currencies (e.g. tokens, liquidity baskets [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">see docs</a>]), even fully interoperable, independent, customizable worldwide blockchains with their own economics and fee structure, while sharing mining and economic power across the entire Verus Protocol network of unlimited PBaaS chains. All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/export-to-eth.html">see docs</a>] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic&nbsp;control.</p><p>With Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [<a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/mapping-1:1-eth.html">see docs</a>], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamlessly between the Verus and Ethereum networks.</p><p>All currencies on the Verus network (also the ones bridged over from Ethereum) can be used with Verus DeFi, another primitive inherent to the protocol. Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.</p><p>Whether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you’ll be left behind if you don’t deep dive on Verus&nbsp;first.</p><p>Join us in the next crypto revolution. Verus, with truth and privacy for&nbsp;all!</p><p>Come to the Verus booth on May 29–31 at Consensus 2024. The worldwide community is happy to get you started with a free VerusID, the easy to use Verus Mobile or any of the wide range of protocol features.</p> Amazing Verus Community <p>The Verus community united to facilitate participation at Consensus 2024 by generously contributing VRSC, ETH, DAI, MKR, Bridge.vETH and BTC. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors! ❤️</p><p>The Verus community used the funds to secure a two-block booth at Consensus, along with other facilities that we can not disclose&nbsp;yet.</p><p>Numerous members of the Verus community are participating in Consensus 2024, and we invite you to be a part of it too! Let’s create a significant presence and showcase to the world the wide range of capabilities of Verus.

<p>Happy 8th Birthday, PIVX!</p><p>It’s time to celebrate another incredible year of achievements and growth. Over the past year, PIVX has reached new heights, expanding its use cases, increasing rewards, gaining listings on various exchanges, and engaging with its vibrant community.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of this remarkable year for&nbsp;PIVX:</p><p>Rewards Increase: <br>The most significant highlight was the rewards increase. With the mandatory PIVX v5.5.0 update in January 2023, payments to the treasury, staking rewards, and Masternode rewards all received a significant boost. Treasury payments surged by an order of magnitude to 10 PIV per block, staking payments doubled to 4 PIV per block, and Masternode payments also doubled to 6 PIV per block. These increases have incentivized more participation and further strengthened the PIVX&nbsp;network!</p><p>Use Case Expansion: <br>PIVX expanded its use cases throughout the year. PIVCards, Coinsbee, and <a href="https://www.travala.com/">Travala.com</a> embraced $PIVX as a payment option. Users can now purchase gift cards from all over the world with PIV on<a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/"> mypivxwallet.org, PIVCards</a>, <a href="https://shopping.io/">Shopping.io</a> as well as <a href="https://www.coinsbee.com/">Coinsbee</a> offers a platform where $PIVX can be used to purchase various gift&nbsp;cards.</p><p>Listing Growth: <br>PIVX experienced significant listing growth, providing more opportunities for PIVX enthusiasts. New listings included <a href="https://whitebit.com/">Whitebit</a>, <a href="https://changeangel.io/">Changeangel</a>, <a href="https://houdiniswap.com/">Houdini Swap</a>, <a href="https://cointopay.com/">Cointopay</a>, <a href="https://swapuz.com/">Swapuz</a>, <a href="https://easybit.com/">Easybit, </a><a href="https://www.coinex.com/">CoinEx</a>, <a href="https://dex-trade.com/">Dex-Trade</a>, Securus Wallet, <a href="https://www.biconomy.com/">Biconomy,</a> Coinstore, <a href="https://nonkyc.io/">NonKYC</a>, <a href="https://changenow.io/">ChangeNOW </a>widget added to PIVX.org, <a href="https://tradeogre.com/markets">TradeOgre</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/breaking-news-9615d5416f6c">P2P payments on Binance,</a> <a href="https://www.lbank.com/">LBank</a>, <a href="https://arcticwallet.io/">Arctic Wallet</a>, <a href="https://finchpay.io/">FinchPay</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xt.com/en">Xt.com</a>.</p><p>Enhanced Trading Options: <br>PIVX gained enhanced trading options with various exchanges. In addition to the PIVX/USDT Binance trading pair, some other exchanges introduced BTC as well as USDT options, allowing for more convenient and accessible trading options for the PIVX community.</p><p>Community Engagement: <br>PIVX actively engaged with its community through various activities. These included YouTube shorts, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), the SuperBlock Report (PIVXLabs), PIVXcommunity contests, and the Privacy Roundtable, a collaborative group consisting of PIVX, BasicSwapDEX, Particl, and Firo. The Privacy Roundtable, hosts monthly Twitter spaces where trending privacy topics are discussed and other privacy projects are introduced. These initiatives are fostering a more vibrant and engaged community.</p><p>As we celebrate PIVX’s 8th birthday, we can proudly reflect on these achievements over the past year. The rewards increase, expanded use cases, listing growth, enhanced trading options, and community engagement have all contributed to the growth and success of&nbsp;PIVX.</p><p>On this special day, let us say that growth is not a destination, but an ongoing journey. As we celebrate PIVX’s achievements, we recognize that it is through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the embrace of new opportunities, and the adaptability to changing circumstances that PIVX continues to evolve and expand. Let us come together as a community committed to learning and adapting, keeping PIVX at the forefront of innovation and progress in the pursuit of privacy and financial sovereignty</p><p>Happy 8th birthday, PIVX!

With this grant, StarShell will allow users to route wallet RPC requests through the Nym mixnet, bringing metadata protection and robust privacy guarantees to end users. The wallet will include real-time metrics and visualizations based on mixnet activity. A new API will allow web applications to route all chain-directed traffic through the mixnet via the&nbsp;wallet.</p> <a href="https://www.nodies.app/">Nodies DLB</a> <p>Grant amount: $30,000USD</p><p>Nodies DLB is a managed infrastructure provider for centralized and decentralized remote procedure call (RPC) nodes, which enable communication between applications and blockchain networks. Nodies DLB gives its clients access to thousands of decentralized nodes while maintaining best-in-class security and performance standards. However, there is currently a scarcity of decentralized privacy-preserving RPC solutions. Nodies DLB proposes integrating its software with the Nym mixnet to bring end-to-end privacy protections to its assets including advanced metadata protection.</p> Pastenym by <a href="https://notrustverify.ch/">No Trust&nbsp;Verify</a> <p>Grant amount: $3,000USD</p><p>Pastenym is a text-sharing service proposed by long-time Nym community contributors and node operators,<a href="https://notrustverify.ch/"> No Trust Verify</a>. In the manner of Pastebin, Pastenym is an online text-drop but with added privacy protections for its users via the mixnet, encrypting their data as well as their metadata when text is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Congratulations again to these successful teams!</p><p>The <a href="https://nymtech.notion.site/nymtech/Nym-Innovation-Fund-7a1d2581a55b417bb44083fb29e12a0f">Nym Innovation Fund remains open for submissions</a>.</p><p>As these projects mature over the next quarter, we will introduce them to the venture funds that have pledged to support the Nym Innovation Fund. In addition, we’re hoping to onboard existing mature projects with their own plans for growth using Nym that can attract venture capital funding. Proposals with a business plan, a unique market proposition, and that are mature enough for seed investment will receive priority.</p><p>In addition to opening a pipeline to respected VCs, Nym will mentor successful teams to further refine their proposals.</p><p>With the VPN market alone projected to be <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/report/vpn">worth $151bn by 2030</a>, there’s enormous market potential for an entire ecosystem that actually respects people’s right to privacy&nbsp;online.</p><p>People are fed up with the surveillance capitalism model of web 2.0.

<p>To our winner, Sam Richter, congratulations on this well-deserved $2,500 cash prize you can use toward tuition, books, or anything else college requires. When informed of his big win, Sam said: “I plan to put the money towards my college tuition as I pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science at Iowa State University.” In addition to the cash prize, Sam’s photo will be seen by Brave’s 60+ million worldwide users as a featured background on the Brave browser’s new tab page throughout 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam took the picture when he and his family hiked on a trail in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area in Nevada. His photo not only shows a remarkable moment in nature, but also his technique and creative eye.</p>
<p>At Brave, we believe in building a human-first Web, and empowering anyone to participate in that Web by creating user-generated content. The Brave new tab page is another surface where people can show their creative selves.</p>
<p>For those who submitted but did not win: Thank you! And, stay tuned—there may be more opportunities and exciting events in the near future.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for being a part of the Brave community.</p>

Decentralization enables strong privacy properties making it near-impossible to trace your traffic through the internet. But NymVPN is not just a dVPN, it also features mixnet technology: a novel feature ensuring unlinkability and strong privacy protections of not just the content of your messages but also your metadata.</p>The Nym mixnet in action via NymVPN’s 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode<p>Mixnets are a unique privacy technology that have only now, after years of research, become available to ordinary people. By shuffling your traffic through a stratified network of nodes and shuffling the order of packets, your patterns of communication vanish and become untraceable to unwanted observers. NymVPN is the first user-friendly application built on the Nym network. As plug-and-play privacy-as-a-service infrastructure across the transport layer of the internet, the mixnet will in time be folded into browsers, search engines, and blockchains across the Web3 ecosystem. <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Read more about mixnets&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Combining the best of both worlds, NymVPN has two distinct modes in one simple application:</p><p>The NymVPN 2-hop dVPN&nbsp;mode:</p>  Optimized for&nbsp;speed;  Customisable entry and exit nodes for geo-blocking resistance;  IP address obfuscation for everyday browsing, streaming, or&nbsp;gaming;  Multi-hop by default, going far beyond the privacy standards of most&nbsp;VPNs.  <p>And</p><p>The NymVPN 5-hop mixnet&nbsp;mode:</p>  Optimized for&nbsp;privacy;  Complete privacy against even government-level adversaries for sensitive use cases like crypto transactions and secure email that are not timing sensitive;  No more metadata leakage of timing and volume of&nbsp;packets;  Traffic analysis resistance via packet shuffling and dummy traffic in inner-three mix&nbsp;nodes.  <p>Nym is trustless, permissionless, and totally transparent. Unlike traditional VPNs where you have to trust that the provider isn’t spying on your communications, Nym’s full stack is decentralized and open source with gateways and mix nodes dispersed all around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>As <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nyms-2024-new-year-resolutions-aeb6d1123c00">Nym CEO and cofounder Harry Halpin said in his new year note</a>, if 2023 was about readying the Nym network for usage, 2024 is the year everyone everywhere will be able to enjoy truly private access to the internet.</p><p><a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">Sign up to the NymVPN waitlist&nbsp;now.</a></p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvQAMpeqJB?s=20">Catch Marc Debizet, Head of Product at Nym for a live Ask Me Anything on Twitter spaces, 30 January at 14:30-UTC.</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-alpha-is-ready-for-private-launch-in-february-f268a9388e62">NymVPN alpha is ready for private launch in February</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of Zebra version 1.5.2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This latest version is a hotfix release, to temporarily remove the experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature introduced in the preceding 1.5.1 release. Following the 1.5.1 release on GitHub, we identified difficulties in publishing the&nbsp;zebra-chain&nbsp;crate to <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, to resolve this challenge, which involves an unpublished dependency, we had to temporarily remove the internal miner support introduced in version 1.5.1.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 1.5.1 release includes a utility for reading results from the zebra blockchain scanner, thus finalizing a minimum viable product for scanning the Zcash blockchain with a viewing key. It also added an experimental&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature, temporarily removed with the 1.5.2 hotfix release, which can mine blocks within&nbsp;zebrad. This feature is only supported on testnet as you need to use a more efficient GPU or ASIC for mainnet mining.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We plan to reinstate the&nbsp;internal-miner&nbsp;feature once our PRs are merged and released into the&nbsp;equihash dependency. You can track development progress on this issue <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/issues/8183">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of this release we have also improved our documentation with details on how to use the new blockchain scanning feature as well as making it easier to find documentation for all our crates in <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can see a full copy of the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.1">v1.5.1 Release Notes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.5.2">v1.5.2 Release Notes</a> on github.</p>

 Zcash Viewing Keys 



<p>When a Zcash user creates a shielded transaction, they encrypt it to the recipient’s address. Being able to access the data hidden behind the encryption is a necessary condition for the recipient to spend the funds, but it’s not sufficient since the recipient also needs to prove ownership of the spending key corresponding to the address. To decrypt the shielded transaction, the recipient uses a so-called viewing key, which they derive from their spending key. A viewing key allows decryption of the shielded data but reveals nothing about the spending key, effectively allowing “viewing” of shielded transactions but not spending of them.</p>



 Blockchain Scanning with Zebra 



<p>All Zcash users use their viewing keys to learn about what transactions belong to them. They try to decrypt each transaction in the blockchain to see if they can unlock the shielded data. We refer to this process as scanning or trial decryption. Light clients can perform the scanning locally so that the public server they communicate with doesn’t learn anything about their transactions. However, some users operate their own infrastructure. These are typically enterprise users, such as exchanges, which are best served using a scanning service closely linked to their full node.</p>



<p>At Zcon4, the Electric Coin Company and Zcash Foundation agreed to move the Zcash ecosystem to Zebra. To be able to do so, Zebra needs to support wallets capable of replacing the wallet in zcashd. As a first step toward this goal, we decided to extend Zebra with a blockchain scanner that accepts viewing keys and performs the trial decryption of shielded transactions. The scanner then stores the results in persistent storage. This functionality should allow for an efficient implementation of wallets relying on Zebra.</p>



 Implementation Details 



<p>The current scanner is a new crate in the Zebra repository, in the form of a minimum viable product. It relies on the librustzcash library to perform the scanning, and supports only Sapling. It reads all blocks through Zebra’s internal state service and stores the TXIDs, referring to transactions that contain notes decryptable by the provided viewing keys. The storage is a separate instance of RocksDB that Zebra also uses for storing the state.</p>



<p>The current version of the scanner is documented for users in our <a href="https://zebra.zfnd.org/user/shielded-scan.html">Zebra book</a>. If you want to give it a try, you can use <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/tree/main/zebra-utils#scanning-results-reader">this tool</a> to read the scanning results. If you submit the scanning <a href="https://zecpages.com/boardinfo">key from ZECpages</a>, it will print all posts from the board to standard output. The next step for the scanner is to implement a gRPC frontend, exposing the scanner’s capabilities to Zebra users.</p>

 New C/C++ bindings open the door for deeper Bitcoin, Zcash, Firo integrations and&nbsp;more. <p>The Nym mixnet is a powerful plug-and-play privacy infrastructure that protects any kind of communication in transit. Not only does the mixnet protect your data, but by shuffling traffic it protects metadata too, making your internet habits invisible. In order for the mixnet to be really plug and play, though, it needs to be able to communicate outside of its native Rust code&nbsp;base.</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/pembaruan-nym-rust-sdk-25dc81aa15ff">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-nym-rust-sdk-bc2464efb07b">Русский</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/n1adb4103b630">日本</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nym-rust-sdk-g%C3%BCncellemesi-0bfadbb15841">Türkçe</a></p><p>Now, any projects written in C++ will be able to more easily integrate with the Nym mixnet thanks to a new interface available in the Nym Rust SDK: <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp">C/C++ bindings</a>. And there are a lot of projects that have C/C++ components, from the Bitcoin source code to libbitcoin, Zcash, Firo, some components of the Signal messaging app and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Developers: please try out these bindings! You can find a reference implementation example <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp/src/main.cpp">here</a> for how C/C++ devs could interact with the SDK. Try to connect your application with the mixnet and see what you can do. If you have any questions or feedback, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#dev:nymtech.chat">please do reach out on Matrix/Element</a>.</p><p>For the rest of you, what do these bindings mean? Let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p> Why does Nym need C/C++ bindings? <p>The backend of the Nym stack is written in Rust. Rust is a great language and has been adopted by projects across the crypto, security, and privacy space because of its design — to be a flexible and fast low-level systems language, which aims to remove an entire class of memory-related issues that other languages fall foul&nbsp;of.</p><p>However, when you’re making a generic network layer for the rest of the internet, relying on a relatively new language can create issues — after all, Rust’s first stable release was in 2015. Projects use a lot of other languages, and not all of these are interoperable.</p><p>In an ideal world, one would be able to write everything in Rust and cross-compile it to be able to use it anywhere. (See the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/Motivation.html#how">Motivation section</a> of the UniFFI documentation for a bit more on&nbsp;this.)</p><p>Unfortunately this glorious future has not yet come to pass. So instead the team has to rely on writing Foreign Function Interface (FFI) code; this essentially creates a translation mechanism for code in one language to call code in&nbsp;another.</p><p>The Rust compiler cannot and does not understand C++ code. Therefore, the Rust compiler needs to be told about code to use on the C++ side. Language bindings are the glue to make this communication happen.</p><p>One of the nice things about Rust is that it, like many other languages, exposes a C <a href="https://slightknack.github.io/rust-abi-wiki/intro/what_is_an_ABI.html">Application Binary Interface</a> (ABI) — something that defines how to interact with a piece of compiled code. For example, with Nym this might be how to call a function that starts a process of listening out for incoming messages from the mixnet, or how the code deals with managing data in memory such as storing incoming messages and <a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/architecture/traffic-flow.html#private-replies-using-surbs">replySURBs</a> for your app to use later&nbsp;on.</p><p>Why is this important, and how does one acronym (ABI) relate to the other (FFI)? Like&nbsp;so:</p><blockquote>“The FFI is the user-code interface the language provides to interact with other executables, which may have a different ABI. The FFI forms the transition layer between different ABIs.” — <a href="https://slightknack.github.io/rust-abi-wiki/intro/what_is_an_ABI.html#what's-the-difference-between-an-abi-and-an-api%20fi">From the Rust ABI&nbsp;wiki</a>.</blockquote> Nym Rust SDK&nbsp;update <p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp">The first version of some FFI bindings for the Nym Rust SDK</a> were published this&nbsp;week.</p><p>This means applications written in C/C++ can start experimenting with integrating mixnet functionality by interacting with the Nym Rust SDK, using these bindings.</p><p>The development team has covered the initial functions that developers will need for starting to experiment with the mixnet: creating a Nym client and sending and receiving messages. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/sdk/ffi/cpp/src/main.cpp">reference implementation / example</a> of how C/C++ devs might interact with the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>This is an important step in making the mixnet more accessible to third parties, so previously unsupported developers can use Nym’s Rusk SDK.

<p>With today’s desktop browser update (v1.62), we are excited to announce that we have integrated Mixtral 8x7B as the default large language model (LLM) in <a>Leo</a>, our recently released, privacy-preserving AI browser assistant. <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral 8x7B</a> is an open source LLM released by <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Mistral AI</a> this past December, and has already seen broad usage due to its speed and performance. In addition, we’ve made several improvements to the Leo user experience, focusing on clearer onboarding, context controls, input and response formatting, and general UI polish.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Unveiling Mixtral 8x7B 
<p>Mixtral is now the default LLM for all Leo users, for the free version and the Premium version ($15/month). The free version is rate limited, and subscribers to Leo Premium benefit from higher rate limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixtral 8x7B quickly gained popularity and usage among the developer community since its December release. Mixtral 8x7B currently outperforms ChatGPT 3.5, Claude Instant, Llama 2, and many others, according to the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard">LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard</a>. Mixtral also shows improvements in reducing hallucinations and biases, <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">according to the BBQ benchmark</a>.</p>
<p>Among other benefits, Mixtral can:</p>
 
 Handle larger contexts 
 Interact in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish 
 Generate code 
 
<p>Brave is already using Mixtral for its newly released <a>Code LLM</a> feature for programming-related queries in <a>Brave Search</a>, and the combination of Mixtral’s performance with its open source nature made it a natural fit for integration in Leo, given Brave’s commitment to open models and the open source community.</p>
<p>“Since its release, Brave Leo has been adopted by tens of thousands of free tier users and paid subscribers, and we expect even greater adoption as we expand our availability of LLMs to include Mixtral,” said Brian Bondy, CTO and co-founder at Brave. “Our aim is to create novel and convenient use cases in the context of users’ browsing sessions, and to help our users interact with the Web in groundbreaking ways.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are very happy to see Mixtral being used to power CodeLLM in Brave Search, and to now have Mixtral integrated in Brave Leo,” said Arthur Mensch, CEO at Mistral Al. “Making Mixtral available as an open model enables Brave to easily integrate it and to fulfill their users’ growing AI needs.”&nbsp;</p>

 Giving Leo users choice with a variety of LLMs 
<p>Unlike other AI assistants, Brave Leo offers its users the flexibility to choose from different models according to their needs and budget. While we’ve added Mixtral 8x7B as the default LLM for both the free and premium versions of Brave Leo, we also offer Claude Instant from Anthropic in the free version (with rate limits) and for Premium. The free and premium versions of Leo also feature the Llama 2 13B model from Meta.</p>
<p>With Mixtral’s integration, Leo users will notice a significant performance improvement in the answer/result quality. Regarding the free Leo version, users will also have the option to revert to the previous Leo experience with Llama 2 and continue their AI experience once they reach the rate limits for Mixtral.</p>

<p>Privacy remains paramount for Brave Leo. Chats with Leo are private, anonymous, and secure. Leo doesn’t record chats, or use them for model training, and no account or login is required to use Leo. Privacy protections in Leo include:</p>
 
 Reverse proxy: All requests are proxied through an anonymization server so the request and user-address cannot be linked. Brave cannot associate the user request with their IP address. 
 Immediate discarding of responses: Conversations are not persisted on Brave’s servers. Responses from Leo are discarded immediately after they’re generated, and not used for model training. We do not collect identifiers such as your IP Address that can be linked to you. No personal data is retained by the AI model or any 3rd-party model providers. 
 No login or account required for access: Users do not need to create a Brave account to use Leo.&nbsp; 
 Unlinkable subscription: If you sign up for Leo Premium, you’re issued unlinkable tokens that validate your subscription when using Leo. This means that Brave can never connect your purchase details with your usage of the product, an extra step that ensures your activity is private to you and only you. The email you used to create your account is unlinkable to your day-to-day use of Leo, making this a uniquely private credentialing experience. 
 

 Ready to try Brave Leo? 
<p>It’s easy to get started with Brave Leo because it’s built right into the browser, so no extra apps or extensions are required. Leo provides seamless access to AI experiences via the browser address bar, or as a sidebar, chat-like interface positioned beside any webpage. Leo helps users with all sorts of tasks in the context of the page they are on by creating real-time summaries of webpages or videos. Leo can also answer questions about content, generate new content, translate pages, analyze them, and rewrite them. Whether you’re looking for information, trying to solve a problem, writing code, or creating content, Leo is integrated in the browser for enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>To access Leo, Brave desktop users can simply ask a question in the address bar and click  “Ask Leo”, or click  in the Brave Sidebar.</p>

  To kick off 2024, we're thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed.

<p>To kick off 2024, we’re thrilled to announce a major update to the desktop version of Brave News, our privacy-preserving, in-browser news feed. The improved Brave News creates an even more seamless experience for catching up on personalized news, by simply scrolling down in a new browser tab. Brave News is free and the update includes a streamlined interface as well as an upgrade to the local personalization algorithms. These changes make Brave News both easier to use and smarter about the stories you see, while maintaining Brave’s privacy promise.</p>
<p>This newly optimized Brave News feed gives users more choice and control over what they see, and options for filtering content by channel or publisher. The improved local feed algorithm helps users discover new and interesting stories and provides suggestions for following channels and publishers they might enjoy. Users can also add RSS feeds, and choose to view content only from their favorite local publishers, blogs, or community sites.</p>
<p>Key updates include:</p>
 
 A For you section that shows stories based on your interests and local browsing history - while never infringing on your privacy 
 An updated top news section and story clusters 
 A filter view for viewing content by channel, source, or RSS feed 
 An easily visible news preview on the new tab page, with the latest news that may be of interest to you 
 

 One place, better control 
<p>In this update, we were hyper-focused on the way news is presented. We redesigned the Brave News space to show more articles and be more conscious about how we display images so you can get more value from a glance. We also added a side navigation panel so you can explore your favorite channels and publishers in a single click.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking for an interesting mix of daily news, then check out the For you and Following feeds. Whether you want an overview of the day’s news, or you’re looking for something specific, Brave News puts you in control of your news experience…all while protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>To find Brave News, just open Brave on your desktop, then open a new tab and scroll down.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Redesigned Brave News feed page</p>

 Content that’s relevant to you 
<p>Endlessly scrolling through irrelevant news can be a real time waste. That’s why we overhauled how your feed is created and personalized, making it smarter and more attuned to your interests. The improved Brave News now prioritizes showing you content you may actually want to read.</p>
<p>Some new features take the form of new types of cards displayed in the feed. Channel cards, for example, are single-themed deep dives into the channels and topics you care about the most. And for US users, Top stories cards neatly summarize the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>

    
    

    


    



      
      
    


    
    

    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Left: Channel card: single-themed deep dives into topics you care about most. Right: Top Stories card: summaries of the most important events and developments happening now.</p>
<p>To make customizing your feed even easier, we added Customize cards to the feed. These cards will recommend new publishers and/or channels you might be interested in, based on your existing preferences and signals.</p>
<p>

    
    

    




      
      
    
Brave News customization cards</p>
<p>The customization menu is also accessible via the settings button at the bottom right, or via the Add button in the new side navigation panel.</p>

 Privacy always comes first 
<p>News aggregators are a common way to consume news. However, the way most popular aggregators work is by collecting and storing your preferences, consumption habits, and other behavioral data to determine what news to show you.</p>
<p>But the news you consume can tell a lot about you, from your political beliefs to fine-grained interests (e.g. a review about a self-help book) and more. For these reasons, we believe that the news you consume should have the same privacy protections as anything else you do online. Unlike others, Brave does not collect or store your data.</p>
<p>From how articles are delivered to how and where personalization happens, Brave News has been designed with privacy in mind. Information about your consumption habits—what channels and publishers you follow, the exact articles you click and read, and more—never leaves your computer. Because a great news experience does not require data collection, Brave’s local personalization mechanisms ensure the news in your feed is relevant, interesting, and private.</p>

<p>Backing open-ended breakthrough research is at the core of BlueYard’s investing philosophy, whether it’s nuclear fusion, programmable stem cells or novel crypto-compute infrastructure. Hackers and researchers remain the essential backbone of the crypto industry. We are proud to have supported the work of research-focused companies like <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://www.flashbots.net/">Flashbots</a>, <a href="https://www.privy.io/">Privy</a>, <a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a>, <a href="https://www.tromero.ai/">Tromero</a> and more in solving critical crypto compute and infrastructure challenges, including those that could be key to unlocking adoption and enabling groundbreaking novel use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>This brings us to our core thesis underpinning our crypto investing strategy:</p><blockquote>In the history of technology, economics and organizations — never has there been a technology and incentive system that can autonomously coordinate machines (compute, storage, etc), algorithms, data and capital at such an incredible scale, so quickly — all while providing independent, robust and trustless infrastructure for economic activity and data. Although still early in its development, crypto might be the ultimate solution to the collective action problem. Also, if one believes in a future where the autonomous coordination between compute, data and capital will play an increasing role, crypto networks could be the “under the hood” operating system for large economic networks.</blockquote><p>Due to crypto’s inherent properties (ability to cut out gatekeepers, separation of state and money, internet native assets with open access) — crypto’s potential will unfold both through novel applications and decentralized infrastructure.</p><p>Within this context, it is essential that individual researchers and hackers continue to explore open-ended research, despite the current funding and regulatory headwinds in the industry. Individual research is often the nucleus of a future key component of the crypto industry. ​​In that spirit, we are announcing BlueYard DYOR (Do Your Own Research, and pronounced like <a href="https://youtu.be/HPsgY7zCtck?feature=shared&amp;t=41">this</a>) funding program. We’re offering $100k to thoughtful researchers and builders to pursue their curiosities and research in crypto, with an open-ended outcome if their work is contributed to the industry and/or forms the nucleation of a new company or&nbsp;network.</p><p>As the name suggests, we expect the BlueYard DYOR cohort to conduct independent crypto research and/or work on a project. You don’t currently have to have a company, team, or a specific idea of what you want to build or research. Simply a direction of what you want to pursue. We are geography agnostic and excited to work with the best minds wherever they might&nbsp;be.</p><p>You are someone&nbsp;who:</p>  Has a track record of experimenting and building (show us your&nbsp;work!)  Might be sitting on the sidelines waiting for the bear market to blow over (now is the best time to start something new) or don’t have the personal funding to spend more time pursuing your crypto curiosities  Is independent, insatiably curious, and excited to try novel things in&nbsp;crypto  Understands the potential of crypto beyond its speculative value and wants to build for the long&nbsp;term  <p>What you can expect from BlueYard&nbsp;DYOR:</p>  Access to the BlueYard team and its crypto portfolio (and the wider science and compute companies in our broader portfolio) to support you in your&nbsp;work  A cohort of 10 other builders experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in&nbsp;crypto  Help in publishing / releasing and distributing what you have&nbsp;built  Access to crypto and science events alongside meetups within the BlueYard&nbsp;family  Help in setting up an entity through which the DYOR funding will be received via an uncapped&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents">SAFE</a>  <p>You can learn more about our crypto portfolio <a href="http://www.blueyard.com">here</a> and apply for BlueYard DYOR&nbsp;<a href="https://blueyard.typeform.com/to/vvc3f8BC">here</a>.</p>

Please, update to ZEN 5.0.0 before February 6th, 2024.  ZEN 5.0.0 will perform a network upgrade on Mainnet via Hard Fork at block #1502800, on February 7th, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled so that it will no longer be possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded, and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.  Only nodes running on Mainnet have to be updated.      <p>IMPORTANT: 5.0.0.<br>After the previously mentioned Hard Fork, it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses.

<p><a href="https://www.ingonyama.com/">Ingonyama</a> is developing hardware to speed up zero-knowledge proofs, a cryptographic scheme that secures much of web3 and is a critical component for scaling Ethereum.</p><p>ZK proofs allow verification that a transaction or smart contract was executed without revealing any of the details. This was first used to support private transactions in protocols like ZCash. The even more promising application is to increase the scalability of protocols such as Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions such as StarkWare execute transactions and smart contracts for users and then post a ZK proof to Ethereum. This significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored on Ethereum and enables transaction volumes similar to traditional payment networks such as&nbsp;Visa.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Inside of every CPU are specialized circuits for speeding up the cryptography used to secure the internet today. At first, Ingonyama might look like a niche business designing specialized hardware for scaling crypto protocols. As the internet becomes more decentralized, the same hardware could secure every internet-connected device.

<p>Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase: A Gateway to Promising Opportunities</p><p>As we commemorate the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://pivx.org/news/pivx-rewards-increase">PIVX’s rewards increase,</a> it is a moment of celebration and reflection on the positive impact this decision has had on the PIVX ecosystem. On January 22, 2023, coinciding with block 3715200, PIVX embraced the version 5.5.0 upgrade, marking a significant milestone in its financial structure. This upgrade brought forth remarkable changes, including increased payments to the treasury, staking and Masternode rewards, setting the stage for further growth, innovation, and community engagement.</p><p>Expanding Opportunities and Strengthening the Network:<br>With the rewards increase, maximum treasury payments soared to 10 PIV per block. This surge in funding allows for greater support for listings, use cases, development, marketing, and essential initiatives within the PIVX community. Simultaneously, staking rewards doubled to 4 PIV per block, providing an incentive for more PIVX holders to actively participate in securing the network. Doubling of Masternode payments to 6 PIV per block further encourages the growth of Masternodes, enabling them to vote on treasury expenditures and contribute to future PIVX applications. These advancements not only strengthen the PIVX network but also open doors to exciting opportunities for growth and development.</p><p>Conclusion:<br>As we celebrate the one-year anniversary of the PIVX rewards increase, we acknowledge the positive impact it has had on the project’s financial structure. The rewards increase is succeeding in enhancing funding, stimulating proposal submissions, expanding use cases, and attracting more listings for <a href="http://PIVX.org">PIVX.</a> It has played a vital role in supporting various initiatives and contributing to the growth and opportunities of the&nbsp;<a href="http://Discord.PIVX.org">project.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/celebrating-one-year-of-pivx-rewards-increase-9c4146cd3e17">Celebrating One Year of PIVX Rewards Increase.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Web2 file storage relies heavily on centralised entities, which have mostly outgrown their competitors, establishing a quasi-monopoly. The reasons for this are twofold: enormous operating costs and seamless user experience (e.g. social logins and account recovery), which, until recently, could only be solved through centralisation. Add to this the reluctance to change platforms as users need to re-upload their files, and you get an ossified user base. However, data leaks and hacks are a constant threat to users’ privacy, and indicate the disruptive potential of decentralised file storage and sharing.</p><p>We were joined by Andreas Tsamados &amp; Vijay Krishnavanshi, co-founders of Fileverse, to discuss their decentralised file sharing solution and how they plan to disrupt the Web2 quasi-monopoly.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Returning to the P2P roots of the Internet  Web2 vs. Web3 user experience (UX)  Business models for Web2 data  Decentralising data  Web3 data storage  Costs of data storage  Managing file updates and permissions  Fileverse use cases  The business model of Fileverse  Improving UX  Future roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/miroyato">Andreas Tsamados on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/0x6b8">Vijay Krishnavanshi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/fileverse">Fileverse on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

		  EON 1.2.0 is meant to be used for: GOBI Testnet nodes and EON Mainnet nodes.    Guide available at <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/develop_and_deploy_smart_contracts/local_build_and_deploy">EON Documentation</a>&nbsp;      GOBI Testnet: The network upgrade was performed on EON 1.2.0 at Consensus Epoch 1982 which happened on January 10th, 2024.    EON Mainnet: EON 1.2.0 will perform a network upgrade on &nbsp;EON Mainnet via Hard Fork at Consensus Epoch 1297 which will occur on January 25th, 2024 approximately<br>at 11:55 am UTC.  <p><br>Below is a list of the exciting new features (from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0):</p>ZENDAO Native Smart Contract  Added support for multisig Mainchain addresses  ZenIP 42203/42206  Forward transfers can be directly performed towards a smart contract address in the EON sidechain  Possibility to top up “EON forgers reward pool” with a forward transfer to a specific address  Improvements  Forger Stake native smart contract: OpenStakeForgerList function can be invoked using the ABI-compliant signature. The old signature is still valid for backward compatibility.

		 Introduction 
<p>The confirmed date for full secure node deprecation is Mar 11, 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> was introduced and voted on in November 2023 and the community overwhelmingly voted in favor of deprecating secure nodes and repurposing the coinbase reward that secure nodes were receiving to EON forger nodes.&nbsp; However, secure nodes have not yet been fully deprecated.&nbsp; This blog post outlines the steps remaining, the timeline to full secure node deprecation, additional information on EON forger nodes and a link to instructions on setting up a forger node.</p>
 Details 
<p>This date listed above represents the date that the secure node tracking system is shut off, and that changes to both EON and Horizen are implemented (and sufficiently tested) to enable the movement of the coinbase reward from Horizen to EON, and then the subsequent distribution of the coinbase reward to forgers who have forged blocks.</p>
<p>Before the end of March the secure node tracking servers will no longer accept connections, most of the tracking servers will be shut down, and two servers will remain running for the foreseeable future but will be put into an ‘archive’ mode.</p>
<p>The remaining servers will be limited to content concerning payments and earnings for tax purposes.&nbsp; API connectivity will be limited to interacting with API keys and earnings.</p>
<p>The Horizen Team would like to thank everyone who staked ZEN and ran nodes over the last 6+ years, especially those who have been here since the initial deployment of Secure Nodes in December of 2017.</p>
 Timeline 
 
 Jan 25, 2024 – changes to EON implemented 
 Feb 7, 2024 – next mainchain hardfork 
 Mar 10, 2024 – last secure node earning period ends 
 Mar 11, 2024 – last secure node payment performed, secure nodes fully deprecated 
 Mar 18, 2024 – first coinbase rewards deposited into Horizen EON 
 
 EON Forger Node Instructions 
<p>For step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run an EON forger node, please visit <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/compose-evm-simplified/blob/main/docs/FORGER.md">our GitHub repository below</a> to learn more. If you intend to run a forger node, please select ‘forger’ when executing the ‘init.sh’ script for the first time. Keep in mind that both the Mainchain node and the Sidechain node will require some time to fully synchronize the entire chains.</p>

		 What are Horizen EON Forger Nodes and Why are they Important? 
<p></p>
<p>In a Proof-of-Stake chain, the nodes are called forger nodes.&nbsp;Forger nodes play a critical role in PoS consensus by creating blocks, validating transactions, enhancing security, and promoting efficiency and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forger nodes are critical to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus for several reasons:</p>
 
 Block production: They create new blocks in the blockchain, with their chance of being selected often based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold as collateral. 
 Transaction validation: Forger nodes validate and add transactions to the blockchain, ensuring that only valid transactions are recorded. 
 Security: They’re financially motivated to act honestly because they’ve staked their own tokens as collateral, risking loss of rewards if they behave maliciously. 
 Energy efficiency: PoS is more environmentally friendly than PoW because it doesn’t require the same amount of computing power. 
 Sybil attack resistance: The larger the number of honest forger nodes, the harder a sybil attack becomes. 
 Decentralization: Forging nodes contribute to network decentralization, allowing a wider range of participants to be involved.

Some of you will already know about it. You might even have heard of how this problem can be fixed and have joined the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">community working together to fix it</a>. For the rest of you, it’s time you’re also let in on the secret. This is for you: discover exactly what happens to your data and come along for a five-hop ride through the maze of mixnet technology.</p><p>The internet is a wild and wonderful place. An immense, global network of information, gossip and chatter, broken into little packets and routed through networks organised by protocols: TCP/IP, HTTP, UDP, FTP, TLS,&nbsp;DNS…</p><p>Billions of packets are routed through the internet every minute using these common protocols. But here’s the problem: the packets can be traced. It doesn’t matter that the content is encrypted, packets can still be watched to see who is speaking to who, how often, and from where. The standard protocols of the internet leave your patterns of communication fully visible to anyone watching parts of or the whole network. This includes internet service providers, VPN providers, internet exchanges, autonomous systems, BGP routers, even WiFi routers, LAN, and famously, the NSA and other security agencies.</p><p>So what can be done about&nbsp;it?</p><p>The obvious thing would be to immediately throw a cover over the internet to protect these packets. After all, it’s ludicrous that one of the main vehicles of communication for the entire world allows all kinds of people, companies and agencies to watch your communication without your knowledge. This is really not a normal state of affairs. And it’s about time it&nbsp;changes.</p><p>A mixnet is an ‘overlay network’ and provides just such a cover for internet&nbsp;traffic.</p><p>A novel update to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358549.358563">decades-old concept</a> of mixed networks, the Nym mixnet scrambles traffic patterns to prevent corporate and government surveillance — and is designed for scale, usability, and anonymity.</p><p>Mixnets send your packets through several hops and mix them so that it becomes nearly impossible to trace these patterns of communication from one end to the other. Let’s go on a journey through the five hops of the Nym mixnet to learn more about exactly how that&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Here’s the TL;DR overview of the full&nbsp;journey:</p>  The Nym client (this lives on your device to encrypt your packets before they get sent to the&nbsp;mixnet)  The entry gateway (this is the first hop and entry point to the magical world of&nbsp;mixnets)  The three mix nodes (these perform packet shuffling, scrambling communications)  The exit gateway (where data is sent out from the&nbsp;mixnet)  Hello world! Your packet has now entered the internet with no traceability back to&nbsp;you.   Nym mixnet traffic flow step one: the Nym&nbsp;client <p>The Nym client lives on your device. It takes any outbound traffic before it leaves your device and wraps each packet in layers of encryption. A packet is simply a piece of data that’s built using cryptographic primitives. The Nym mixnet uses a special type of packet called <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/sphinx-tl-dr-the-data-packet-that-can-anonymize-bitcoin-and-the-internet-18d152c6e4dc">Sphinx</a>, which is different from a TCP/IP packet. The way a Sphinx packet is designed is to ensure the confidentiality of your content or communications. Each Sphinx packet looks identical to others, to make them untraceable within the network based on their binary&nbsp;pattern.</p>Diagram of the traffic sent by the Nym WebAssembly Client<p>At the high level, a Sphinx packet is composed of two independent parts, a header and a body/payload part.</p><p>The header encapsulates all routing information needed to route the packet through the mixnet to the recipient. The payload contains the content of the communication, for example our ‘Hello World!’ message that we want to send through the mixnet. Both the header and the payload are independently layer-encrypted, meaning that there is a separate layer of encryption for each hop in the route. This also means that if your client has selected mix nodes A, B, C for your packet P, no other nodes can successfully process your packet P. And for each packet sent through the Nym mixnet, a Sphinx acknowledgment is received by the previous node, so they know it has&nbsp;arrived.</p><p>Sphinx encryption is a novel type of onion encryption, named for the lustrous layers of the root vegetable protecting its tiny core. Onion encryption ensures ‘bitwise-unlinkability’. In short, this means that when your packet traverses a mixnode, it changes its binary appearance. Neither the nodes in the route, nor a global surveillance actor observing the whole network, can link sender to receiver. For example, even if an entry and exit node collude, neither of them can tell whether they processed any common packets because of the changing binary pattern. Traditional TCP or UDP packets do not provide such a property, i.e. they look the same ‘going in’ as they do ‘going&nbsp;out’.</p><p>In addition to unlinkability, Sphinx provides ‘integrity protection’. What this means is that if a malicious node tries to malform a packet, Sphinx detects it and the packet is dropped in the network to prevent the tracing of tainted packets. Moreover, the Sphinx protocol also offers Single-Use-Reply-Blocks as a tool for anonymous replies, so the recipient of a packet can reply to the original sender without the need to learn their network location (i.e.,&nbsp;IP).</p><p>To summarize, the Nym client lives on a user’s device or in an app. The Nym client manages the secure connection with the selected gateway, encrypts your communications and facilitates sending packets through the Nym mixnet. It also does things like storing a user’s private keys and NYM tokens to facilitate bandwidth credentials and more — but that’s for another&nbsp;time!</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step two: the entry&nbsp;gateway <p>A gateway is the entry point to the mixnet. It acts as a proxy between the Nym client and the Nym mixnet and checks that a user has the necessary credentials to use the mixnet — whether they or the app they’re using have paid for fair&nbsp;usage.</p><p>All gateways are operated by the Nym community to ensure complete decentralization of the mixnet system. There are currently <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">70 gateways</a>, which can be viewed on <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways">Nym Explorer</a> along with metrics like routing score and reliability.</p><p>The gateways are necessary for a few&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Gateways check bandwidth credentials to ensure that a particular user has a right to use the Nym mixnet — i.e., that they paid for it. This also limits Denial of Service attacks and free-riding, where people squeeze resources from networks without contributing to&nbsp;them.  Secondly, gateways also act as offline storage for incoming packets — so if a client is offline, the gateway stores this incoming communication until it gets back&nbsp;online.  And third, the gateway is your, well, gateway into the mixnet from the Nym client. This also means that the gateway can potentially see the client’s IP address. But they do not know anything about the destination of the packet, nor its content or metadata.  <p>For super users, <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/gateways-to-privacy-51196005bf5">it’s possible to run your own gateway</a> if you don’t want to expose the IP to that first&nbsp;hop.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step three: the three mix&nbsp;nodes <p>Your packet has now been Sphinx encypted by your client and sent to the entry gateway. Now what? This is where the magic ‘mixing’ happens. The entry gateway decrypts one layer of Sphinx to check which mix node to send your packet to first. What is a mix node? An independently run server that someone in the Nym community has created, also called a ‘hop’. All mix nodes are visible on the <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/network-components/gateways">Nym Explorer</a>.</p><p>This hop depends on a number of factors including geographical proximity and which mix nodes have been selected for the ‘active set’. The active set is simply the amount of nodes that are currently active and mixing traffic: 240 at any given&nbsp;time.</p><p>This ‘active set’ changes every ‘epoch’ — one epoch lasts an hour — and a selection algorithm checks the performance and reputation of nodes. This ensures traffic paths are continuously changing and malicious paths cannot be established by hostile node operators.</p><p>What is a ‘layer’ in the mixnet? Well, the mixnet arranges nodes into something called a ‘stratified topology’, which just means that the nodes are grouped into three layers, with the three hops distributed across these layers. This is to ensure horizontal scalability, efficiency, and anonymity by&nbsp;design.</p><p>When a data packet is routed, a mix node is picked at random from each layer, and a path is composed that has three hops. Take a look at this&nbsp;gif:</p><p>These mechanisms alone vastly improve user anonymity compared to traditional VPNs or even other decentralized privacy-preserving technologies.</p><p>But that’s not all: there are two very important features that make ‘following the packet’ even more difficult. These are timing obfuscation and cover&nbsp;traffic.</p>POV: you’re the NSA trying to track a data packet on the&nbsp;mixnet.<p>Timing obfuscation means that the order of packets are shuffled and reordered by each of the three mix nodes. This makes it near impossible for an observer to correlate an incoming to an outgoing packet. These intervals are practically imperceptible to&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Adding even further anonymity, all real data packets are mixed in with cover traffic. These are empty data packets that are the same size as real data packets. They’re useful for privacy because they create a “crowd” of packets obscuring any traffic patterns in a flurry of fake communication that’s useless to anyone snooping on the&nbsp;network.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step four: The exit&nbsp;gateway <p>Your packet has now reached the final hop in its journey: the exit gateway. The exit gateway will decrypt the final destination of the packet, working in tandem with a service provider that will connect the packet to whichever ‘clearnet’ website or app you are trying to&nbsp;reach.</p><p>The gateway can see the final destination. However, your data is routed on a per packet basis. This means that even in the event a malicious exit gateway was set up and was picked for the active set, it would only see a tiny portion of your traffic. Furthermore, the gateway does not see any plaintext. Content is still end-to-end encrypted by the original sender and is only decrypted by the receiving client.</p> Nym mixnet traffic flow step five: Hello&nbsp;world! <p>Your packet has now reached the rest of the world, passing through the protective cover of the mixnet. The patterns of your traffic have been protected, your data end to end encrypted, and any snoopers will have surely lost your packet by now. But this journey is just for a packet going out. But what about replies? And what if an app wants to fetch information via the&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p>Nym uses something called Single Use Reply Blocks, or SURBs. These allow applications to interact with other applications anonymously via the&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Say a client application needs to interact with an online service or a P2P application on another person’s machine. To avoid revealing any gateway or client keys (and defeating the point of anonymity via the mixnet), SURBs allow for anonymous interactions.</p><p>A SURB is a layer-encrypted set of Sphinx headers that detail a reply path that ends in the original application’s address. These are encrypted by the senders’ client so that a receiving service or application can attach its response and send back a Sphinx packet, without knowing who it is replying&nbsp;to.</p><p>In the case of larger anonymous replies like files, the mixnet uses something called ‘MultiSURBs’ — where a bundle of SURBs are created rather than just the one to handle bigger data capacity.</p><p>There is much more to the story, so stick around for next week’s deep-dive into the Nym&nbsp;client.</p><p>The power of the mixnet will soon reach ordinary people: <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> is launching later this&nbsp;year.</p>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">Sign up</a> to the&nbsp;waitlist  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#NymVPN:nymtech.chat">Get involved as a beta&nbsp;tester!</a>   Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p>Privacy loves&nbsp;company</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p><p>The Nym mixnet is run by a wonderful community of operators all over the world.

<p>Crypto token staking is a rapidly growing multi-billion market, set for further rapid expansion as more Proof of Stake (PoS) becomes the de facto standard model for consensus among crypto networks. This also opens more opportunities for capital vs machine deployment within crypto networks. However, running staking nodes is a difficult task, akin to the challenges and expenses of running a production data center coupled with the complexity of orchestrating bleeding edge software from multiple blockchains in an environment in which security is paramount. These challenges aren’t just faced by institutional capital, but also by retail or exchanges &amp; custodians seeking to provide staking services to their customers.</p><p>That is why <a href="https://www.kiln.fi/">Kiln</a> has built a full-stack “staking as a service” platform, allowing pools of capital to participate in PoS, through a platform that enables investors and builders to manage validators and read-write nodes on multi-cloud infrastructure in a simple, fast and secure way. Kiln allows customers to securely deploy, manage and monitor blockchain validators across several networks in a single space — while users continue to control their private keys. The company runs a SaaS model for its services, dashboard and APIs. Kiln has partnered with Ledger Live, Crypto.com and Coinbase to provide pooled staking services, allowing every ETH holder to access staking with any amount of ETH access to value creation in the digital assets ecosystem. Further, Coinbase Cloud has integrated Kiln’s On-Chain platform into its product offering allowing Coinbase Cloud to bring on-chain partial ETH staking capabilities to their clients, with limited engineering effort needed to integrate. Kiln runs validators on all major PoS blockchains, with over $3.6b of stake under management (up 4.4x y-o-y), running on a multi-cloud, multi-region infrastructure. Kiln also provides a validator-agnostic suite of products for fully automated deployment of validators, reporting and commission management, enabling custodians, wallets and exchanges to streamline staking operations across providers.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>As increasingly large pools of capital are deployed to crypto to meet PoS demand of chains, a company that facilitates and manages capital flows should be able to become a key fabric for the&nbsp;space.</p><p>We are excited to be investing in Kiln for the third time now, most recently joining its <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221128005157/en/Kiln-Announces-%E2%82%AC17-Million-in-Funding-to-Expand-Staking-Offering">$17 million funding&nbsp;round</a>.</p>

<p>Following the recent listing of <a href="https://www.bitmart.com/en-US?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP on BitMart</a>, Panther's CEO, Oliver Gale, introduced Panther Protocol to BitMart's community. This post provides a summary of the conversation. Firstly, let's quickly revisit the BitMart:Panther partnership.</p> BitMart:Panther partnership <p>In December 2023, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitmart-lists-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">Panther Protocol's $ZKP was listed on BitMart</a>, a leading cryptocurrency exchange serving a global user base spanning 180 countries.</p><p>This partnership with BitMart and upcoming listings on other trusted exchanges are part of Panther commitment to make <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/tokenomics?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">$ZKP more accessible</a> to the wider Web3 community.&nbsp;</p> Panther's value proposition <p>Oliver Gale, Co-founder and CEO of Panther, presented his vision of how Panther Protocol solves some of the pressing pain points that act as barriers to entry to both retail- and institutional-level investors in DeFi.</p><p>Oliver asserts that, for the decentralized Web to scale and attract more users, it must first overcome several significant challenges that crypto faces. He summarized these as four key issues:</p>  Exposed investment strategies: with the rise of blockchain analytics solutions such as Nansen, institutional investors are increasingly worried about exposed investment strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fragmented liquidity: the inability to leverage liquidity across multiple chains makes it difficult for institutions to buy and sell their preferred crypto without affecting the price.  Lack of transaction security: since June 2020, MEV bots have made at least $1 billion in profit across Ethereum, BSC, and Solana chains by exploiting transaction queues.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Compliance and privacy: existing privacy-focused DeFi products lack features to comply with AML/CTF requirements amid increased regulatory scrutiny.  <p>Oliver explained how Panther's privacy-preserving infrastructure for the decentralized Web, consisting of a shielded pool, cross-chain bridges, and ZK compliance tooling, solves these issues. This means that users can send, swap, and receive shielded assets through Panther while their on-chain privacy is being protected.</p> Panther Protocol: the product suite <p>Oliver gave BitMart's audience a run down on how Zones within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools (MASPs) empower users by providing a unified privacy set for all assets within a given smart contract environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Panther allows users to trade stablecoins, utility tokens, and NFTs within a single shielded pool, simplifying trading in a privacy-preserving environment. The innovation of Zones represents the first coherent solution to enable institutional access to DeFi, as they enable AML compliance, customization, and enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p>Oliver expanded on how Panther Protocol’s rich feature set positions Panther as the go-to solution to onboard users to private DeFi in a privacy-preserving manner. Panther’s strong position is, in part, due to its integration with third-party on-chain compliance providers. This enables the protocol to authenticate users — solving for the KYC demands of regulators by offering users a unique set of credentials on completion of verification. This key innovation is that the user data is private thanks to zero-knowledge proofs generated directly within the user's browser. The credential provided allows the user to seamlessly integrate with blockchain-based DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and similar platforms.</p><p>Furthermore, due to the flexibility of its design, Panther users can access the protocol without being bound to a single compliance provider. Similarly, financial institutions can benefit from flexible zero-knowledge compliance tools or fully integrate their existing AML controls.</p> The current status of Panther <p>Oliver shared that Panther is currently deploying testnet versions of Panther Protocol in 9 Stages. Multiple protocol functionalities, such as intra-shielded pool transfers, DeFi swaps, and zTrade, are being tested during these stages. Through zTrade, users can conduct OTC transactions while enjoying unprecedented data privacy-preservation. More on Panther testnet stages <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> BitMark asks: What are you looking forward to? <p>Oliver, as always, enthused about the growing interest in privacy-preserving infrastructures. He feels that, thanks to the recent paper by prominent authors such as Vitalik examining <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Dark Pools</a>, this is a clear signal that the market is ready for such solutions. As he points out, Panther is a pioneer in the space — having been building for over 2 years, and is looking forward to releasing the V1 of the protocol once testnet rollouts are complete.</p> Want to get involved? <p>If you are interested in joining our community of testers, there is still time. Panther is rewarding engaged community members with $ZKP in return for battle-testing the testnet version of the product. Learn how to <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">get started</a> as a community tester.</p> About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther's zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Discord</a></p>

		<p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/wallets/spherebyhorizen/">Sphere by Horizen</a> is a desktop wallet created by the Horizen ecosystem team. It features both lite and full clients, offering wallet functionality that currently supports transparent and soon-to-be deprecated, shielded transactions. Sphere allows funds to be restored using a seed phrase and supports backward and forward transfers between Horizen’s mainchain and sidechains.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Sphere was able to send two different types of transactions: transparent transactions and shielded transactions:</p>
 
 Transparent Transactions: These are similar to Bitcoin transactions. The details of the transaction, including the sender’s and receiver’s addresses and the transaction amount, are visible on the blockchain. This transparency allows anyone to view and verify transactions, contributing to the network’s auditability. 
 Shielded Transactions: In contrast, shielded transactions offer enhanced privacy. They use advanced cryptographic techniques (like zk-SNARKs) to encrypt transaction information. This means the details of the transaction, including who sent or received the funds and the amount, are hidden from public view.&nbsp; 
 
 The Need for De-shielding 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42207-complete-removal-of-shielded-pool-from-the-horizen-mainchain/">Horizen has announced that ZEN will be discontinuing support for shielded transactions with the release of Zen v5.0.0.</a> Consequently, Sphere, Horizen’s multifunctional app, will also cease supporting these types of transactions. To ensure the accessibility of their funds, users will need to de-shield any ZEN in a shielded address by transferring it out from the shielded pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Who needs to De-shield their ZEN? 
<p>The upcoming changes to ZEN and Sphere necessitate action from all users who possess shielded addresses. If you have any ZEN in a shielded address, it’s crucial to de-shield these funds to avoid any loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine if you need to take any action:</p>
 
 If You’re Using Lite Mode: If you’ve only used the lite mode in Sphere and never switched to full mode, you don’t need to do anything, as shielded addresses are only available in full mode. Your funds are secure and no action is required on your part. 
 If You’re Using Full Mode: In full mode, look through your wallets. If you don’t see any addresses with a small shield icon next to them, you’re all set. No action is needed. 
 
<p>For any address with a shield icon, you should move (de-shield) these funds to a transparent address (one without a shield icon). This is important to ensure your funds remain accessible and secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another check is to look at the prefix of the address. Addresses start differently depending on the network and the type, so this also helps you identify your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>On mainnet:</p>
 
 “zn” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zs” (or rarely “zr” or “zt”) for multisig address 
 
<p>On testnet:</p>
 
 “zt” for transparent address&nbsp; 
 “zc” for shielded address 
 “zr” for multisig address 
 
 Step-by-step Guide to De-shielding Your ZEN 
 Prerequisites 
<p>As a reminder, de-shielding to an exchange deposit address is strongly discouraged. Before you begin de-shielding your shielded addresses in Sphere, it’s important to have at least one transparent address where you can transfer your funds. If you don’t already have a transparent address (any address without a shield icon next to its name, or that is not prefixed with “zc”), you’ll need to create one. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar select one of your wallets. 
 Click on the “Add Address” button. 
 Give a name to the new address, and make sure that, if there’s any “Private” checkbox, it remains unchecked. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once you have a transparent address, you can proceed with the de-shielding process for your shielded addresses.</p>
<p>You can get your new address by hovering over the information icon and clicking on the “copy” button that appears:</p>
<p></p>
 De-shielding Process 
<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide to de-shielding your funds in Sphere by Horizen:</p>
 
 Open Sphere, login, and on the sidebar take a look at your wallets.&nbsp; 
 Select the wallet containing a shielded address. If you have multiple wallets with shielded addresses, you’ll need to repeat this process for each one. 
 Within each wallet, follow these steps for every shielded address:
 
 Select the shielded address you want to transfer the funds out of. 
 Click on the “Send” tab. 
 Enter a regular, transparent address that you own, where you wish to receive the funds. 
 Click on the “MAX” button to transfer all the funds from the shielded address. 
 Click the “Confirm” button and wait for the transaction to complete. 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>Once the transaction is successful, you have de-shielded your funds. Repeat this process for every shielded address in your wallets.</p>

<p>Today, Aztec Labs is excited to share the winning proposal from the <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-prover-coordination/2397">prover coordination protocol request for proposals</a> (RFPs) — “Sidecar”. Additionally, we are announcing a formal request for comments period covering Aztec’s Sequencer Selection and Prover Coordination Protocols, key components of Aztec’s block production.</p><p>At the heart of Sidecar’s design is the decision to facilitate proving outside of the scope of the protocol, enabling integrations with various solutions, such as decentralized zero-knowledge proving marketplaces. Read the latest documentation on Aztec’s block production.</p><p>👉 <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aztec-sequencer-selection-and-prover-coordination-protocols/3038">https://forum.aztec.network/t/request-for-comments-aztec-sequencer-selection-and-prover-coordination-protocols/3038</a></p> Why Sidecar? <p>The Aztec Labs team, with input from various industry-leading experts, chose Sidecar over the various other proposals submitted (<a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-cooperative-bft-proving-using-striped-redundant-binary-trees/2515">1</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-decentralized-prover-network-staking-reputations-and-proof-races/2489">2</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-when-the-levee-breaks/2457">3</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-cooperative-proving-network-for-fernet/2400">4</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-provers-bonded-prover-auction/2401">5</a>, <a href="https://forum.aztec.network/t/proposal-staking-proving-network-for-fernet/2439">6</a>) due to its simplicity and ease of integration — very similar to the reasons<a href="https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/announcing-fernet-aztecs-decentralized-sequencer-selection-protocol-dd06194d572f"> the Fernet Sequencer Selection protocol was chosen during a previous RFP&nbsp;process</a>.</p><p>Further, the decision to not enshrine a particular prover coordination protocol enables Aztec Labs to continue iterating on proving networks or marketplaces outside of the scope of the Aztec network’s traditional upgrade mechanisms — similar in spirit to Vitalik’s notion of “<a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/09/30/enshrinement.html">minimum viable enshrinement</a>”.</p><p>Additionally, not enshrining a particular protocol in this way allows the network to be fully compatible with a broad spectrum of options to prove a given block, including:</p>  vertical Sequencer-Prover integration, or  third party zero-knowledge (zk) proving providers, or  fully decentralized zk proving marketplaces  <p>Through these various options, Aztec’s proving is fully permissionless and allows anyone to participate in a competitive marketplace for zero-knowledge proof production.</p><blockquote>“We are excited to collaborate with other projects that share our vision for decentralized zero-knowledge proving.

<p>In the blockchain world, scalability is not just a technical issue but a crucial factor impacting user experience and the ability to build compelling applications. Traditional blockchains, while groundbreaking, have often been hampered by limited scalability, leading to congested networks, slow transaction times, and high costs. As teams have worked to solve these issues in the Ethereum ecosystem with layer 2 chains, the experience only continues to degrade with bridges, fragmented liquidity and unwieldy lists of networks users must maintain in their wallets. These issues significantly degrade the user experience, deterring widespread adoption.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://massa.net/">Massa</a>, a response to the critical scalability and user experience issues in blockchain technology. Its innovative multithreaded block graph architecture significantly boosts transaction capacity, effectively addressing the major pain points of network congestion and slow processing times. This approach not only enhances the system’s performance but, unlike the leading alternatives solving blockchain performance issues today, also upholds the essential principle of decentralization.</p><p>Massa goes beyond mere transactional efficiency and decentralization. Its autonomous smart contracts represent a leap in blockchain functionality, allowing contracts to operate independently based on predefined conditions. This reduces reliance on external triggers and opens new avenues for decentralized applications. Additionally, Massa’s on-chain web page storage marks a significant stride towards a truly decentralized web, ensuring secure, immutable, and censorship-resistant hosting of web&nbsp;content.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>We believe that Massa’s approach to scalability, without sacrificing decentralization, is pivotal for the next generation of blockchain applications. The platform’s ability to handle high transaction volumes with low fees is not just a technical success; it is a gateway to making blockchain technology accessible and practical for everyday use. Massa’s technology is not just an incremental improvement; it represents a leap forward in the blockchain space. By resolving the longstanding challenges of scalability and user experience, Massa opens the door to widespread adoption of blockchain technology.</p>

		  5.0.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of 5.0.0 to Mainnet later in January 2024.  Pre-release 5.0.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1404200, on January 16th, 2024 at approximately 02:00 PM UTC.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP-42207</a> to fully remove the shielded pool from Horizen will be implemented with this release on Testnet:  All transactions involving shielded addresses will no longer be accepted at the consensus level once the hard fork activates.  RPC calls z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress have been partially disabled, so that it will be no longer possible to submit transactions involving shielded addresses (transparent-to-shielded, shielded-to-shielded and shielded-to-transparent) once the hard fork activates. Transparent-to-transparent transactions will still be accepted and submitted to the network.      Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 5.0.0 will be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will no longer be possible to perform any transactions involving shielded addresses. It is highly recommended to move funds out of the shielded pools before then. Directly depositing funds from shielded addresses to exchange wallets is strongly discouraged.<br>  <p>See release notes <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/blob/release/5.0.0-rc1/doc/release-notes/release-notes-5.0.0-rc1.md">Here!</a></p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

We will be sharing details on our 2024 proposed roadmap but before we get there, let’s dive into what happened in 2023!</p> 2023 Highlights <p></p> Community Growth <p>Discord</p><p>In 2023, we reached over 20,000 members of our Horizen Discord, a growth of over 5,000 users throughout the year. With the launch of Horizen EON and various growth campaigns on platforms like Galxe and Layer3, we have had new community members learning about the Horizen ecosystem and exploring the new integrations. We look forward to seeing more of this growth in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Discourse</p><p>In 2023 we established the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse forum</a>, to facilitate active community discussions around the Horizen Ecosystem. In 2023, activity on this platform increased as the broader community discussed ZenIPs, shared tutorials, explored content created by the Horizen Ambassadors, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>We encourage the Horizen community to join Discourse and engage with the rest of the community on the platform!</p> 2023 Highlights – Our Technology <p>In October of 2023, Horizen EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain went live on mainnet, marking a new milestone in the Horizen multi-chain ecosystem!&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Horizen EON ecosystem has continued to grow, with additional partnerships, integrations, and tools launching on the platform. There has also been a significant influx of TVL and developer activity on Horizen EON.&nbsp;</p><p>The full range of dapps and partner integrations can be found on the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/ecosystem">EON Ecosystem</a> page – let’s dive into a few of the major announcements. </p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-interport-finance/">Interport Finance Integration</a></p><p>At the beginning of December 2023, we announced an integration with Interport Finance, which brought cross-chain trading capabilities to Horizen EON! This integration not only boosts the efficiency and security of cross-chain transactions but also signifies a step towards a broader vision of a cohesive digital finance ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate fluidly across diverse blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/archon-bridge-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">Archon Bridge</a></p><p>Archon Bridge launched on Horizen EON in Q4 of 2023, bringing a new bridging protocol to the ecosystem. This protocol facilitates the transfer of various cryptocurrencies including ETH, WBTC, WZEN, USDT, USDC, DAI, and LINK, between the Horizen EON network and the Ethereum and Avalanche networks.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-with-layerzero-to-boost-trustless-cross-chain-communications/">LayerZero</a></p><p>Another innovation to enhance cross-chain communications on Horizen EON saw an integration with LayerZero go live, ensuring seamless and direct communication between various blockchains via arbitrary message bridging. This integration offers enhanced interoperability, allowing data, assets, and information to be transferred across blockchains without compromising on efficiency or security. Beyond just messaging, this integration signifies a broader vision of creating a unified digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can operate seamlessly across multiple blockchains.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/spookyswap-is-live-on-horizen-eon/">SpookySwap</a></p><p>Another exciting announcement for Horizen EON came in November 2023, when we announced an integration with SpookySwap! This helped bolster DeFi innovation, bringing a DEX multichain integration and yield farming to EON. USDC is tradable against ZEN and wZEN, with additional pairs being enabled once sufficient liquidity develops.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/horizen-eon-integrates-ascent-exchange-with-simple-liquidity-opportunities-via-ichi-vault-to-boost-the-defi-ecosystem-on-eon/">Ascent Exchange</a></p><p>The DeFi ecosystem on Horizen EON was boosted with the integration of Ascent Exchange, supported by the automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, enabling simple yield opportunities for EON users. This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Ascent Exchange is the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, marking a major milestone!</p><p><a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/service_providers/eon_native_stablecoin/">Stably/ZUSD</a></p><p>2023 marked the 1st native stablecoin to be launched on Horizen EON, ZUSD, which was made possible by our partnership with Stably! The collateral for ZUSD is held in liquid USD-denominated assets by a designated trustee for the benefit of verified ZUSD token holders. This ensures that each ZUSD token can be minted or redeemed at a 1-to-1 rate with USD or USDC by users who passed Stably’s KYC verification process.</p><p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/yuzu-finance-horizen-eon-unlocking-yield-opportunities-in-the-horizen-ecosystem/">Yuzu</a></p><p>Our last major partnership announcement of 2023 welcomed Yuzu Finance onto Horizen EON! This integration unlocked yield opportunities for the Horizen Ecosystem, including borrowing, lending, and yield farming (soon)! Yuzu is a non-custodial decentralized liquidity market protocol that enables users to deposit or borrow crypto assets securely. Depositors provide liquidity on Yuzu, while borrowers can take out overcollateralized or undercollateralized loans.</p> Horizen EON TVL &amp; Metrics <p>As of December 31st, 2023, Horizen EON had $3.08M in TVL (as tracked by <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Horizen%20EON">DefiLlama</a>), highlighting impressive ecosystem growth within the first few months of mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the mainnet launch of Horizen EON in October 2023, there have been over 900,000 total transactions across over 18,000 wallet addresses. There have also been 950+ contracts in total since Horizen EON went live on mainnet.</p> Launch of the Horizen DAO <p>In 2023 the Horizen ecosystem reached a key milestone in decentralized governance by launching the Horizen DAO! The launch of the Horizen DAO makes it easier for Horizen community members to get involved in governance and make their voices heard in the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>The Horizen DAO further decentralizes decision-making for technical, non-technical, and other substantive improvements to the system. $ZEN holders are the ultimate decision-makers for the future of Horizen and exercise governance over the network’s evolution through participating in the Horizen DAO. All $ZEN holders can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community. To facilitate effective community governance, users will also be able to delegate voting power to individuals they view as effective stewards of the Horizen ecosystem guiding values.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about this in our <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/introducing-horizen-dao/">blog post</a>, as well as joining the <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Horizen DAO Discourse!</a></p> ZenIPs (<a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">42204</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">42206</a>) <p>Building off of the launch of the Horizen DAO, 2023 saw two very important ZEN Improvement Proposals (ZenIPs) pass with overwhelming community support.&nbsp;</p>  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip-42204.md">ZenIP 42204</a> – Deprecation of Shielded Pools  <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/master/zenip_42206.md">ZenIP 42206</a> – Redirect Horizen Secure Node Rewards into Horizen EON&nbsp;  <p>Let’s take a closer look at both.&nbsp;</p><p>ZenIP 42204</p><p>This ZEN Improvement Proposal proposed the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, preventing shielded transaction (t addresses to z addresses) support at the consensus level. The goal of ZenIP 42204 was to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risk. Regulatory threats are top of mind, they are not friendly towards privacy coins and that drove a lot of the ambition to propose ZenIP 42204, which passed with overwhelming community support. Additional information can be found <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/what-is-zenip-42204-deprecation-of-shielded-pools/">here.</a></p><p>ZenIP 42206</p><p>In August of 2023, ZenIP 42206 was proposed, to redirect the portion of the Horizen mainchain block reward currently paid to Secure Nodes to an EON Forger Subsidy Fund. This will help drive the success of the Horizen EON network by increasing the security and decentralization of the network. There is a strong need for forger nodes in EON to help enhance the security of the network, and for decentralization, which the current secure node reward can be put to better use by redirecting. <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zenip-42206-explained-redirect-horizen-secure-node-rewards-into-horizen-eon/">Learn more here.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Horizen Node Network <p></p> Horizen Ambassador Program <p>Throughout 2023, we were very proud to see all of the work accomplished by our amazing Horizen Ambassadors.

We launched EON, our EVM-compatible sidechain, which significantly helped Horizen’s journey into the contemporary Web3 world. That’s especially important because it allows Horizen Labs to leverage its relationships and bring more companies, developers, and brands directly into the Horizen ecosystem. We’ve been hard at work bringing best-in-class partners to EON, from oracles like Pyth and Band to DeFi protocols like Spooky, Yuzu, and Ascent to RPC providers such as Ankr and Tatum. We’ve built a strong relationship with LayerZero as well, which will lead to many exciting things happening within the ecosystem.</p><p>Meanwhile, the mainchain saw the introduction of forward and backward transfers, a technological feat that sometimes gets overlooked but is significant. How many UTXO-based tokens can be used on EVM chains? Beyond Bitcoin and ZEN, not many! We also saw the start of the deprecation of shielded pools and ZEN’s move away from being a privacy token.</p><p>Now, as we enter 2024 we’re gearing up for what should be the most exciting year in Horizen’s history. In the coming weeks and months, we’ll announce a slew of new partners, initiatives, and focus areas relating to the Horizen Ecosystem through a significant expansion and push on DeFi to RWA programs. We’re also working hard on expanding access to ZEN and directly to the EON ecosystem, along with making sure that EON can host a sustainable, consistently growing ecosystem as it moves forward.</p><p>And the vision of a New Horizen is on the docket too. I can’t wait to talk to you all about it and the modular future that Horizen and Horizen Labs will push forward together.”</p> Additional Links:&nbsp;   <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q1-2023-report/">Q1 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q2-2023-report/">Q2 2023 Report</a>  <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/the-horizen-q3-2023-report/">Q3 2023 Report</a>

<p>Firstly, thank you to all our testers for your continued support and feedback: we could not do this without you. Testnet Stage 2 is now completed and it provided us with valuable insights resulting in several updates to the codebase.</p><p>We are excited to announce that Stage 3 of our testnet is live. Stage 3 enables users to use the newly allowlisted test Matic and test $ZKPs in Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>On depositing $ZKP, users may divide their ZKP deposit holdings to store it as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay for Protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services.</p><p>One of the key compliance requirements on the Panther roadmap is building different disclosure mechanisms. Stage 3 includes basic disclosures, which can be found under the History tab. We expect to improve the information within the History tab in future testnet stages.</p><p>This testnet stage comes with an enhanced circuit to improve KYT/KYC signer fields, overall protocol security through extended zAccount UTXO, and further improvements related to scaling and rewards. Supporting these updates required retrofitting previous stages and end-to-end testing, resulting in Stage 3 being released later than we initially planned. </p><p>For a complete list of Test Stages, visit the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet/testnet-stages?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther docs</a>.<br></p> Get started with Stage 3 testing <p><br>To start testing Stage 3, visit the<a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/product-and-technological-components/product-versions/v1-testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Panther Protocol documentation</a> for the updated test link and follow the steps outlined below. Here are a few additional details to consider before you start testing:&nbsp;</p>  Previously created testnet accounts will need to be reactivated for Stage 3. The protocol will treat these as new accounts. To that effect, all prior testing Rewards (ZKP and ZKP equivalent of your PRPs) will be sent to your EOA (externally owned account) used for creating the account.  You can also create a brand new account and complete the KYC process to continue. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUvug0JhhlIUHBR4d2TZVKEUeGzvD_MIR-NrcIpptko/edit?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io#gid=0">Here’s</a> a guide to creating your account.   After activating your zAccount, if you immediately go to the ‘Deposit’ or ‘Voucher’ etc. screen, you may see the action button with the status “Oshiya Processing/Syncing/Mining.” It may take a few minutes for the testnet to complete as it waits for Oshiya to process your account activation. The buttons will be active once that is done.  During the first interaction with the dApp, it downloads the ZK proof information in the background (close to 100MB). While this happens, you may see a status on your action button saying “ZK Proof downloading,” this needs to be completed before any user action can take place.   Onboarding rewards have been increased to 5000 PRPs to reflect that this stage retests the onboarding flow.  <p>Once you’ve created your new testnet account, follow these steps to make a deposit to your account:</p> Step 1: Initiate a deposit <p>Go to the Deposit screen by selecting any of the available options: </p>  Within the zAsset menu item, click on the Deposit button as shown in the screenshot below.  Within the My Public Asset section in the Dashboard, select the token; this takes the user to the Deposit screen.  The Private zAsset section; which also has the option to select and deposit  On zAsset Portfolio, click on the balance card.   Step 2: Select the token type <p>Select the token to deposit if it is not preselected, or adjust your selection via the token selection modal window.</p><p>NOTE: ZKP has its own dedicated deposit flow, which supports splitting a deposit amount between two zZKP subaccounts, zAsset and Gas. The Gas can be used to pay for relayer or verification services in a privacy-preserving way; with no direct interaction with a blockchain.</p> Step 3: Set up the deposit <p>3.1 Enter the amount to deposit.&nbsp;</p><p>3.2 Click the Deposit button and complete the transaction.</p><p>Congratulations, the deposit is complete!</p><p>You may now view the updated balance in your Dashboard, your Private zAssets section, and the adjusted balance of the deposited asset.</p><p>You can view your transaction history under the History tab.&nbsp;</p><p>This screen provides information about different types of transactions you performed within Panther, along with its transaction hash and the date/time of the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>To share your feedback, kindly fill in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSczZNB-tvMILSo8paFjIkeeSub3cqxv7L85rCeR47ad5bs2Gw/viewform?usp=sf_link&amp;ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">form</a>.</p><p>This phase marks a significant advancement in the protocol's capabilities and gets us a step closer to our V1 release. As always, let us know if you have any additional feedback through our social and community channels.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for participating in Testnet Stage 3!&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that meet regulatory requirements and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs.

      Arvind Jain Pushes into AI-powered Productivity         
	By Zee Zakheim	 



Photography: Kelsey McClellan



Published January 10, 2024
        Glean solved enterprise search. Now it’s unlocking generative AI for the workplace.      



 
<p>Arvind Jain hunched over his desk, sifting through hundreds of employee surveys, searching for the answer to a problem. Rubrik, the cloud security company he had co-founded four years earlier in 2014, was one of the fastest-growing businesses in cloud data management. Since its launch, it had scaled from a handful of employees to almost a thousand. But a problem came to light in 2018: Productivity had stagnated. The company’s output wasn’t growing with its scale.</p>



<p>Jain pored over the results of the survey that had been commissioned, scouring for patterns. Was it talent? Not a chance. Company culture? Not according to the surveys. And then, a troubling insight: Employees reported spending hours of their time trying to find and piece together fragmented bits of information from across the 300 SaaS products Rubrik used in its internal operations—onboarding materials, meeting notes, support tickets, project archives and more. In their quest to find answers, they were stalled and sidetracked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rubrik’s problem, Jain realized, wasn’t Rubrik-specific, but universal: the seemingly impossible task of wrangling digital information from every facet of an enterprise. What if there was something like Google Search, but for the workplace? Jain began researching search engines for enterprises, but none could do what he imagined. “I spoke with other CEOs to see if they had solutions I’d missed,” Jain says. “Their response was, ‘If you find something like that, let us know.’”</p>



<blockquote>

<p>Search engines are notoriously difficult to build—they require crawlers sophisticated enough to index data in a multitude of formats in real time and algorithms smart enough to sort and rank that data with precision for any given search. What Jain was considering developing would be even more complicated, as every search would need to be personalized for every employee based on their degree of access to a company’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, this provocation became the springboard for Jain’s next startup: an AI-powered search engine for enterprises called <a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a>. As it happened, Jain was the perfect person for the job.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In 2003, hundreds of employees unpacked boxes and settled into office space in Mountain View, California. Google had officially signed its new lease in the heart of Silicon Valley, taking over the former Silicon Graphics campus. While the new digs were reflective of Google’s success, the company was also at a crossroads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch in 1998, Google had gained a loyal following of users. But as the internet evolved—growing rapidly in size and shifting from rudimentary websites to include pages that were more complicated and nonstandard—Google Search wasn’t able to keep up with the velocity of new data. Meanwhile, alternative search providers were closing in, the most competitive of which was Yahoo. “Google and Yahoo were locked in a battle for the most sophisticated, comprehensive web indices,” says Bill Coughran, a Sequoia partner who was then SVP of engineering at Google.</p>



<p>Coughran gathered the web crawler team and told them they needed a new system design. It would have to be able to respond to diverse and rapidly changing data, and do it at scale. The timeline for the new system? As soon as possible.</p>



<p>Arvind Jain, a recent hire then in his late 20s, was one of the leaders of what became the new effort. Over the next few weeks, Jain and his colleagues spent days analyzing Google’s search engine. Eventually, they approached Coughran with an idea for the new design.<br>“What was interesting about their vision is that it took advantage of the basic primitives Google’s web crawler already had in place and built on top of those,” Coughran says. “The design showed a system that could index not just websites, but dozens of file types from HTML to PDF, including PowerPoint, Flash, PostScript and JavaScript. And, as the web continued to scale, it could operate more and more instances of itself and do more and more work.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”</p>
Bill Coughran</blockquote>



<p>Some senior executives, however, viewed the proposed framework with skepticism. “They looked at the design and just didn’t believe it would work,” Coughran says. But he was convinced. “My experience with Arvind, certainly at the time and since, is that he’s meticulous and thoughtful about how he does things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain and his colleagues spent a year building out the system, which launched in the fall of 2004. In November of that year, Coughran published a blog post on the Google website with the headline “Google’s Index Nearly Doubles.” He says, “It could inhale hundreds of gigabytes of traffic at a given time and it could do it quickly, so when you searched something, you weren’t getting stale information. It was a difficult undertaking, but it worked. They pulled it off.”</p>
 







 
<p>The thoughtful meticulousness Coughran observed in Jain grew out of an introspective childhood in Jaipur, a tourist destination in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. “My father always encouraged me to be confident,” Jain says. “To look people in the eye and talk to them, but extroversion wasn’t something that came naturally to me.” Instead, Jain took after his mother, who exuded a quiet confidence and had an ability to defuse conflict with calm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain became fascinated with computers after his older brother introduced a PC—loaded with Pac-Man—to the family home. Jain delighted in the game, but even more so in the idea that coding had real-world applications, for video games or otherwise. Jain decided to pursue computer science in earnest, placing into an advanced high school track and then gaining admission to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. After graduating, Jain set his sights on the U.S. Following a stint at Microsoft, the allure of Silicon Valley beckoned, and Jain cut his teeth in the startup world at Akamai and Riverbed before joining Google.</p>



 



<p>“I’m not an entrepreneur,” Jain said. It was 2013 and he sat across from Bipul Sinha, an engineer who had an idea for a cloud security company and wanted Jain as its technical co-founder. Jain was taken aback. “I was like, ‘Of all your contacts, why me?’” he says. Sinha explained that, more than anyone else, he believed in Jain to build a product from the ground up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the years since arriving at Google and working on Google Search, Jain had left his mark on a series of other projects. He had helped engineer YouTube’s video serving system—which pulled up videos related to a user’s search, but also recommended content based on their browsing history. Jain had also worked on the search functions for Google Maps, which were more technically ambitious by far than Google Search and YouTube. “Maps’ data is the most chaotic,” Coughran says. “You’re dealing with ever-changing, wildly inconsistent data, coming from many disparate sources—public records, land developers, people taking photos, enterprises submitting information.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, Maps was rewarding, not just because it challenged him as an engineer, but because of the app’s real-life, societal impact. “Maps changed the way people understood and navigated the world around them,” Jain says. He loved seeing couples on the street pull up Maps to direct them to a restaurant, or a family open the app to walk to a relative’s house. The Maps team was also deep in the weeds documenting places that weren’t previously mapped, including small towns in rural areas of India. “Making these places accessible and seeing the impact of that was just amazing,” Jain says. “It was very meaningful to me.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain’s contentment with his work at Google was one reason he wasn’t sure about founding a company with Sinha. The other reason was philosophical. “I always thought that people became entrepreneurs when they encountered a problem that nagged at them and that nobody else wanted to solve or knew how to solve, but them,” Jain says.</p>



<p>Despite these reservations, Sinha was convincing—he would build the business while Jain built the product. He won Jain over, and in 2014, they launched Rubrik. Four years later, Jain would encounter a problem that nagged him. One that nobody else wanted or knew how to solve, but him.</p>

<p>Sitting at his desk in the Rubrik headquarters in 2018, reviewing his employees’ notes on the challenges of finding information within the company, Jain thought to himself, “Data should not be the reason why you fail. It should be the reason you succeed.”</p>



<p>Jain convinced co-founders T.R. Vishwanath, Piyush Prahladka and Tony Gentilcore to tackle the project with him. They built Glean, which officially launched in 2019, to solve what Jain believes to be the most urgent problem in today’s workplace: that it’s often easier to find answers in the vast expanse of the internet than it is within a single organization. “Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally,” Jain says. “Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Even when I was at Google, we could never find anything internally. Anything you wanted externally was available instantly via Google Search, but internally—it was impossible.”&nbsp;</p>
arvind jain</blockquote>



<p>Even with Google Search, YouTube and Maps’ search engines under his belt, Jain knew building Glean wouldn’t be easy. The difficulty of creating a search engine for an enterprise is that, unlike the information in a general-purpose internet search engine, “company data doesn’t live in readily organized forms,” Jain says. “Information can be fleetingly exchanged over one communication suite, like Slack or Google Chat, but not formalized in another. And it’s not just that data is spread across a range of SaaS tools—each individual has their own level of access to those systems. The CEO has access to different data than someone in research and development who has access to different data than someone in human resources.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jain assembled a team of engineers to help him bring Glean to life, many who had worked with him at Google, others who were familiar with his reputation as one of the best search engineers in Silicon Valley. The company described its initial product, launched in 2021, as a “work assistant with intuition,” modeled on a Google-like search engine. It worked by transforming the entirety of a company’s data, in all its various forms, into nodes on a knowledge graph. And it was able to do this in under two hours, meaning it was Google-fast and required minimal onboarding time. Glean then used state-of-the-art natural language processing and deep learning to deliver individualized search results. “AI was always core to our product,” Jain says. “But in the last year, the shift in the capabilities of AI models—it’s changed everything.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the spring of 2023, Glean announced it was incorporating generative AI into its product. “If Glean’s user interface started out with a feel similar to Google Search, now it’s more like Google plus ChatGPT,” Jain says. “Glean is no longer just surfacing information, it’s taking that information, consuming it and then performing a task. For example, if an employee were to ask Glean to provide a list of the company’s top 10 customers who are likely to churn, our engine can actually go and hunt through information in your enterprise corpus, figure out what makes it likely for a customer to churn, go to your metrics dashboard, look at whether those metrics are looking bad for certain businesses and actually give that answer back to you.”</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”</p>
Sonya Huang</blockquote>



<p>The integration of enterprise search capabilities with generative AI has become Glean’s superpower. “CIOs and knowledge workers have been waiting for an enterprise AI product that is workplace-knowledge-aware,” says Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia who serves on Glean’s board. “Glean spent years perfecting the algorithms to get corporate knowledge into algorithms for search and has now arrived in the right place at the right time for generative AI.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Jain, the challenge of Glean wasn’t only in developing its product, but in growing into the role of CEO and leading an entire company. Jain rose to the occasion by drawing on the traits of his parents: his father’s confidence and practice of reaching out to others, and his mother’s approach to conflict, which prioritizes listening and never saying “I told you so.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Glean serves over 200 enterprises, some with hundreds of employees, others with hundreds of thousands, saving them hundreds of hours of work per month and millions of dollars per year. “Similar to how Google Maps changed our navigation of the world, soon, Glean will alter the way we work, period,” Jain says. He envisions that one day, every employee who uses Glean will have a “work double,” essentially a digital assistant who can perform tasks and track every project, every communication and every piece of company knowledge. It’s a world in which employees aren’t impeded by the challenges of locating information, but empowered by data to tackle their next challenge—maybe even the thing that won’t stop nagging them.</p>

<p>What began as an AI company trying to seek solutions in order to pay remote (unbanked) workers, Near AI became, in 2018, Near Protocol. Its sharded design was inspired by modern database architecture and large language model (LLM) training. Near Protocol aimed to solve the scalability trilemma, through a modular approach, combining data availability sharding with stateless validation. By abstracting away archaic blockchain standards, Near basically enabled decentralised full stack development and, in terms of UX, a distributed custodial solution via chain abstraction and account aggregation.</p><p>We were joined by Illia Poloshukhin, co-founder of Near Protocol, to discuss Near’s journey, from AI company to high-throughput L1 blockchain, and how LLM training influenced the modular design choice.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Illia’s background in AI &amp; ML  Scaling large language models (LLMs) and the role of attention  Stochastic Parrot vs. Understanding spectrum  From Near AI to Near Protocol and the role of LLMs  How Near abstracted the blockchain away and enabled decentralised full stack development  Defining ecosystem standards to improve UX  Chain abstraction, account aggregation and interoperability  Chain threshold signature  Near’s intent layer  Near’s modularity, Nightshade sharding &amp; stateless validation  EigenLayer integration  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon">Illia Polosukhin on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol">Near Protocol on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

		<p><a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">ZenIP 42207 </a>for the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain was submitted on January 4th, 2024, opened for Community voting on January 8th, with voting closing on January 11th, resulting in 99.97% vote share “for”. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ZenIP proposed the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP-42204</a> and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Complete Disabling of Shielded Transactions: All functionalities related to the shielded transactions (z-addresses) will be completely deactivated, preventing any type of transaction related to the shielded pool. 
 Removal of Related RPC Calls: RPC calls specifically related to shielded transactions, such as z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress, will be deprecated. 
 Migration Path for Users: A migration path with the necessary tools and guides will be provided to users to move their assets out of the shielded pool before the hard fork. Community support and detailed documentation will be available to facilitate this transition. 
 Network Upgrade: The deactivation of the shielded pool will occur through a network upgrade at a specified block height (TBD). Extensive testing, community preparation, and communication will precede this upgrade. 
 Communication and Timeline:&nbsp;Representatives of the Horizen ecosystem will communicate regularly with the community about the timeline, necessary user actions, and available support resources throughout the transition process. 
 
<p>IMPORTANT: ZEN 5.0.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible to send any shielded transactions, including transactions to de-shield coins from shielded to transparent addresses.</p>
<p>ZenIP 42207 goes further than the hard fork originally announced with ZEN 4.2.0-rc1, ZEN 5.0.0 will completely remove the shielded pool. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address. &nbsp;Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged. Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>
 Voting Timeline 
<p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, we encourage you to join the discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/z8eebsj7Sv">Discord</a>, <a href="https://horizen.discourse.group/">Discourse</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> around ZenIP 42207 and voice your thoughts. We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/blob/zenip_42207-draft/zenip-42207.md">full ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting on ZenIP 42207 started on January 8th, 2024, 5pm UTC and ended on January 11th, 2024, 5pm UTC. The Horizen DAO voting is done on Horizen EON, using Snapshot and Discourse for governance. At the same time that the voting began, the snapshot was also taken. <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">You can view the results of the vote here on Snapshot.&nbsp;</a></p>
 Who is Eligible to Vote?&nbsp; 
<p>Any $ZEN holder can vote on improvement proposals, and those who hold (or who have been delegated) the requisite amount of $ZEN may put forth proposals to the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Voting power is determined by the amount of $ZEN you hold on the Horizen mainchain and on the Horizen EON chain. Therefore the more $ZEN you hold, the more voting power you have.&nbsp;</p>
 How to Vote – Instructions 
 
 Go to the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io/governance/dao">Horizen DAO Governance page</a> on the Horizen EON web app to get started. 
 Connect your web3 wallet (ex. MetaMask). <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/horizen_eon/connect/connect_your_wallet/">Please follow this guide if you need help</a>. 
 Link your Horizen mainchain $ZEN address to Horizen EON. In order to vote with your mainchain $ZEN, you need to have $ZEN on a <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere</a> mainchain address and link that address to your MetaMask Horizen EON chain address. You only need to link your <a href="https://horizen.io/spherebyhorizen">Sphere wallet</a> once. You can use the same wallet for future voting rounds.&nbsp;
 
 Please see <a href="https://docs.horizen.io/governance/voting_process/linking_mainchain_address/">this guide for step-by-step instructions </a>on linking Horizen Mainchain and Horizen EON $ZEN Addresses to aggregate your voting power.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Make sure you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask address for the gas fee. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFsjT069v7E">this tutorial</a> to learn how to transfer ZEN from Horizen mainchain to your Horizen EON address on MetaMask 
 Once your mainchain ZEN address is connected to Horizen EON, and you have sufficient ZEN in your MetaMask for gas fee, it’s time to vote using Snapshot! 
 Join the <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundation.eth">Horizen Foundation space</a> on Snapshot if you haven’t done so, to receive notifications about future ZenIP voting.&nbsp; 
 
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/PjDFYEh6SDw?si=VgQKGkl_PHj8Q0qW">We have a helpful video tutorial here with instructions on how to vote for the Horizen DAO.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>     
 

 
	     
		 ZenIP 42207 Voting Results 
<p>The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/horizenfoundationtechnical.eth/proposal/0xbb8d72c088637c53cde7aa07c030b63dcdfa901ddffd5ce579b061d6064d5bb0">ZenIP 42207</a> voting period ended on January 11th, 2024, at 5pm UTC, and passed with 99.97% of votes “for”, with .03% of votes “against.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to thank the community for their engagement on this new ZenIP. The voting participation marks a new step in the progress of the Horizen DAO and we are glad to see that our community is involved in the project’s decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The successfully passed ZenIP 42207 enables the complete removal of the shielded pool from the Horizen mainchain, achieving a wide range of various goals. This change builds upon the deprecation of access to the shielded pool enacted by ZenIP 42204 and is a response to the evolving regulatory environment around privacy tokens, re-confirming and showcasing the project’s strategic pivot away from privacy-focused features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step is to unshield your ZEN on private addresses. We strongly recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen or zen-cli before February 2024. After February 2024 it will not be possible anymore to transfer any funds inside of the shielded pool to any other address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>Failure to remove ZEN from shielded pools prior to the hard fork will result in the loss of your ZEN.</p>

      AI in 2024: From Big Bang to Primordial Soup         
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 





Published January 3, 2024
        2023 was a frenzied year in AI. 2024 will be a year of exploration and discovery.      



 
<p>Over the Christmas holiday, I had time to reflect on 2023 and the whirlwind year we had in AI. </p>



<p>The “Big Bang” of ChatGPT in late 2022 unleashed a fervor and, ultimately, a feeding frenzy in 2023. Not only was AI the #1 story in Silicon Valley, but it became a hot topic in every corporate boardroom, in the media and even in Washington, DC. AI drove public market stock performance too.</p>



<p>For a technology so nascent and still with low usage, as we covered in <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-act-two/">Generative AI’s Act Two</a>, the feeding frenzy of 2023 had a key weakness. It was an assumption that the hard problems in AI had been solved, and therefore it’s a foregone conclusion that AI will become ubiquitous and powerful.</p>



<p>This fallacy is understandable. It is human nature to avoid ambiguity because humans desire certainty. The idea that AI is the “end of history”—and that we’re within sight of that—appeals to this instinct. This is an easier idea to hold in our minds than the reality we are living in: We are in the primordial soup phase of AI. There is much potential in the air, and yet it is still amorphous. Vision is required to convert it into something real, tangible and, ultimately, impactful.</p>



<p>In Silicon Valley, the frenzy of 2023 was productive in attracting talent to AI. But it was also unproductive in the type of company formation it drove and the psychology it induced. Specifically, it led to implementation-oriented thinking vs. vision-oriented thinking. If you believe that the hard problems have already been solved, it changes the nature of the company that you build. Instead of building deep-benched teams that are eager to face down new, unsolved problems, you build shallower organizations.</p>



<p>As a result, you had themes in AI with five or six new companies being formed, each with one or two great technologists and a very similar objective. One of the biggest challenges for startups in 2023 was convincing talent to join their companies—everyone wanted to start an AI company of their own.</p>



<p>In 2024, we need to look farther out and build companies that are fundamentally architected for the murky reality of AI. When we realize that we are in the primordial soup phase, we begin to think not about how we can win the race, but about how we can invent new things. And we realize that we need to join forces to do that. By focusing on impact, we can assemble teams capable of taking on demanding challenges and surmounting them.</p>



<p>I want to draw an explicit contrast to SaaS. SaaS was an evolution from on-premise, license-based software to cloud. AI is a revolution, where we are building new intelligence for the first time. There is no precedent, so we don’t even know what problems are worth solving. Fundamental innovation is going to be exceptionally important.</p>



<p>The primordial soup phase will give rise to visionary founders. I believe we will see more visionary thinking emerge in 2024. In times of murkiness and uncertainty, vision is required to see through the fog and understand what needs to exist on the other side. Vision is also necessary to attract a team capable of getting there.</p>



<p>We are going to move away from “AI for X” toward customer-centric companies. The goal of solving deep societal problems by building hard technology will reshape the culture of these companies, how they are built and the type of talent they attract. We will see innovation in the company formation process itself—the AI research labs are one expression of that creativity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, we will build from the substrate of Transformers, GPUs, RAG, Diffusers, open source and everything else that has been floating around the ecosystem in 2023. From these primitives, we will discover new ideas and new insights about how to build advanced AI systems. We will look back at 2024 and say, this is the year that we began to convert AI’s potential into real solutions.</p>



<p>At a conference in September, I heard Jakub Uszkoreit, one of the inventors of the Transformer, say he thought we had prematurely jumped from the exploration phase of AI to exploitation. 2024 will be a reset year, where those focused on quick and easy exploitation of this technology lose steam, and founders who are driving deep exploration toward value creation will pull ahead.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of turning this primordial soup into impactful products and companies. And here’s to the daring founders who will build them.</p>



<p>If you are building a visionary company in this primordial soup, I’d love to hear from you. Please reach out at <a href="mailto:dcahn@sequoiacap.com">dcahn@sequoiacap.com</a></p>

<p>For Nym, 2024 will be the year that ordinary people all over the world start using Nym to have private access to the internet to enable freedom of communication. Our resolutions are&nbsp;to:</p>  Get NymVPN working on every operating system to onboard thousands of ordinary users, increasing the traffic through the network, and thus the anonymity of users and the revenues of the Nym community via transaction fees — in short, making the entire Nym project financially sustainable.  Integrate against every major zero-knowledge blockchain that wants to deliver real privacy to their users via our new Rust and Typescript SDKs.  <p>One of the open secrets of the blockchain industry is that there are almost no actual people using blockchain tech for anything except for stablecoin transfers or trading, with many projects living off inflation before collapsing. And so, most blockchains are ghost-towns that don’t have anything resembling real-world usage outside DeFi and NFTs. What makes Nym different?</p><p>Languages: <a href="https://medium.com/@nym_ru/%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8B-nym-%D0%BD%D0%B0-2024-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4-5a812108dc75">Русский</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@NYM_Indonesia/resolusi-tahun-baru-2024-nym-d865645eb486">Bahasa Indonesia</a> // <a href="https://note.com/koko_crypto/n/nb640cb84badd">日本</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymspanish/prop%C3%B3sitos-de-a%C3%B1o-nuevo-de-nym-para-2024-8558fe4f6bd9">Español</a> // <a href="https://medium.com/@nymturkish/nymin-2024-planlar%C4%B1-9bbeff41e0d5">Türkçe</a> //&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@nym_china/nym%E7%9A%84-2024-%E5%B9%B4%E6%96%B0%E5%B9%B4%E6%84%BF%E6%9C%9B-201661f3ae5c">中文</a></p><p>Nym has one of the few use-cases that actually have a chance at getting massive real-world adoption outside of cryptocurrency: replacing VPNs — which are almost entirely based on false promises — with something that actually works to preserve the security and privacy of end-users. Rather than aim just for a larger share of the tens of thousands of blockchain developers or the millions of cryptocurrency users, we at Nym are serious about our mission to enable privacy for all humanity: we’re aiming at the billion people that use VPNs&nbsp;today.</p><p>As the world continues to descend into geopolitical chaos with wars in Europe and the Middle East — and likely an economic war between the US and China over the next few years — the only guaranteed outcome is that internet surveillance and censorship will increase for everyone. The restrictions that we see now in Iran and China will soon spread to America and Europe under the banner of fighting “misinformation” and “fake news.” As we stated in 2019 in our <a href="https://nymtech.net/nym_litepaper.pdf">litepaper</a>, surveillance is ultimately about mind control. Against this rising tide of repression, Nym is the only solution out there that can give a person protection against global passive adversaries such as nation-state intelligence agencies that can watch an entire internet connection. Unlike traditional VPNs, thanks to blockchain-based decentralization, in 2024 Nym will also focus on validators and gateways so that the network is resistant to being taken out by powerful malicious actors.</p><p>Nym needs an easy way for ordinary people to use it, and that’s why we created NymVPN. In 2023 we launched <a href="https://nymvpn.com/">NymVPN</a> for testing at <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-returns-to-chaos-communications-congress-a2a08194a487">Chaos Computer Congress</a>, the world’s largest hacker conference, the same conference where we launched the first version of the mixnet for testing in 2019! Under the leadership of Marc Debizet, the plan for NymVPN is to make it available on every operating system, including mobile operating systems. In 2024, the focus will be on enabling every one of our hundreds of mix nodes to also serve as a gateway for open internet access, allowing unparalleled access across different jurisdictions for Nym users. The ability to have zero-knowledge proofs to access for privacy-enhanced payment to be turned on for&nbsp;NymVPN.</p><p>The wheel will then start turning: as people start using Nym, with payments being activated and transformed to NYM tokens on the backend, the entire ecosystem will become financially sustainable by receiving real transaction fees, something that only a handful of blockchains have achieved so far. Of course, we don’t know how many people actually want even a truly private communication tool, much less how much they will pay. In 2024, we’ll find out. In order to make privacy a reality in 2024, we will need thousands of NymVPN&nbsp;users.</p><p>And NymVPN isn’t the only way we’ll get users. Thanks to the Nym Innovation Fund and our new Head of Partnerships Ade Molajo, Nym is ready to integrate against any application, and blockchain. Autonomous verifiable anonymous computing is revolutionary technology, and every blockchain that uses zero-knowledge proofs should integrate Nym as an anonymous channel, as otherwise there will be no privacy. We’ve started this year with Liquid, Aztec, Firo, Monero, and are now in discussions with many L2s. In 2024, another goal is privacy by default over every zero-knowledge blockchain.</p> Looking back on&nbsp;2023 <p>Looking back, 2023 was a year of getting Nym ready for usage. While the mixnet was working via a SOCKS5 proxy even back in 2021 before the token launch, it was not easy to integrate against by programmers and required ordinary people to cut and paste obscure looking “localhost” IP addresses in even more obscure windows in their programs like Telegram and Electrum Bitcoin wallets. Led by Mark Sinclair and the new integrations team, the major focus of 2023 was making it possible for developers to integrate against the Nym mixnet by releasing a Rust API and Typescript APIs, including the wonderful mixFetch that makes integrating against Nym as simple as cut-paste for web applications.</p><p>The year closed with <a href="https://nymtech.net/learn/shipyard">Nym Shipyard</a>, a six-week intensive privacy academy training the next generation of Nym operators, builders and community visionaries. The academy enabled the community to get much more organized, forming “squads” that operate mix nodes across the world (especially in LatAm, Russia, Ukraine). Some squads use their rewards to support local hackerspaces and community organizations, others use the rewards to start building apps on the mixnet. This budding, professional operator community is essential for Nym as the industry’s network privacy DePIN. They form the decentralized underpinning for not just NymVPN but any application.</p><p>In 2024, Nym will continue with our general principles:</p>  Nym will put the user first. This includes the user experience of the NymVPN as well as all our users of Nym operator binaries, the Nym SDK and people using the NYM token to bond and delegate.  Nym will be community driven. The Nym global community — across 80 countries! — are increasingly our experts on the mixnet and token economics as it operates in the real world. We resolve to have close collaboration and quarterly town halls to enable rapid iteration and improvements on software and token economics as the NymVPN goes to&nbsp;market.  Nym will continue to leverage the latest technological breakthroughs to enable ordinary people’s privacy. Starting with rolling out zk-nyms for the NymVPN to prevent leakage of data when paying for services. The focus will then shift to enabling censorship resistance and post-quantum cryptography with leading academic experts in the&nbsp;field.  <p>As a team, we’ve transformed from a small startup to over fifty people working full-time on Nym, hundreds of mix nodes, and a global community of thousands across different languages and cultures. As the old world of nation-states and the traditional monetary system teeters on collapse, our mission of enabling privacy is critical for the survival of humanity more than ever. Without privacy, there can be no communication. Without communication, humanity cannot empower our collective intelligence to create a new world. It’s our only way out to escape the soul-crushing despair of war, surveillance, bureaucracy, and&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>Being able to communicate freely is the first step, but it’s simply too hard for people. For too long, truly private communication has been the province of only an aristocracy of technically-adept hackers, and it’s our turn to bring — as we promised at the Web 3.0 conference in 2020 — power to the people. In 2024, Nym is taking privacy out of the underground, opening a tunnel from this world to the next.

   In December, we opened a Helios poll of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment […]

<p>In December, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) to elect three members of the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) committee, to decide whether ZIP 1014 should be amended to provide ZCG committee members with a stipend from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and to gather community sentiment on the question of whether the Dev Fund should be replaced after it expires in late 2024.</p>



<p>The poll closed this morning and the results are in. </p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The results of the ZCG election are as follows: </p>



 
 Jason McGee – 111 votes 



 Michael Harms – 96 votes 



 Amber O’Hearn – 89 votes 



 Roosevelt Gordones – 69 votes 



 Kworks – 45 votes 
 



<p></p>



<p>Congratulations to Jason, Michael and Amber, who are duly reappointed to the ZCG Committee. Thank you also to Roosevelt and Kworks for volunteering to serve the Zcash community. </p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>The poll respondents voted in favour of amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, with 99 votes in favour versus 39 against. </p>



<p>We will therefore draft an appropriate amendment to ZIP 1014. </p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we put the following question to ZCAP: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>111 respondents voted Yes, and 27 respondents voted No. </p>



<p>We look forward to seeing further discussion and proposals from the community in the coming weeks about what form a new funding mechanism might take. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Through techniques like ZK rollups, multiple transactions are bundled into a single proof, streamlining the verification process. This compact form of verification reduces computational requirements and enhances the network’s overall scalability. By processing larger volumes of transactions more efficiently, zero-knowledge proofs boost blockchain network throughput without compromising security or decentralisation. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic tools that work like magic tricks, allowing one party to prove they know something without revealing the actual details. They maintain confidentiality while confirming specific information and have a key role in web3. This article will explain what they are, how they work, their use cases in web3, and take a deep dive into how zero-knowledge proofs improve blockchain scalability.</p>



<p></p>



 What are zero-knowledge proofs? 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs, often referred to as ZKPs, are a clever way to prove something without revealing any details about it. Imagine being able to show you know a secret password without actually saying what the password is. That’s the magic of ZKPs – they allow one party to confirm they have certain information without giving away the information itself.</p>



<p>In every zero-knowledge proof, there’s a prover and a verifier. The prover wants to show the verifier that they know something without disclosing what it is. They do this by demonstrating knowledge of some facts that only the rightful owner of the information would know. It’s like solving a puzzle without showing the solution.</p>



<p>They can be used for a variety of purposes. Still, their main applications include improving data security, scalability, and privacy in blockchain transactions, safeguarding sensitive information in industries like healthcare and finance, and enabling secure authentication without unnecessary exposure of personal details.</p>



<p></p>



 How zero-knowledge proofs work (in simple terms) 



<p>While relatively simple at the surface, understanding the intricacies of zero-knowledge proofs can be complex. To explain how they work we will use a simple analogy:</p>



<p>A scientist claims to have discovered a complex mathematical proof for a groundbreaking theory. Verifying this proof conventionally requires extensive computational resources and time. Alternatively, using a zero-knowledge proof, the scientist can demonstrate the proof’s validity without divulging the entire process, significantly reducing the time needed for verification while ensuring the credibility of the discovery.</p>



<p>In essence, the zero-knowledge proof is a distilled version of the proof containing only the details necessary to prove its validity. When using zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain for improved scalability and privacy it works in similar ways. To explain how this works, consider the following scenario:<br><br>A validator has verified and put together a block of transactions that produces a certain hash value. To verify this hash (and thus the transactions inside the block), someone could verify this hash by following the exact same energy- and time-consuming process of recreating this block. However, another option would be for the validator to provide a succinct zero-knowledge proof to make it easy to verify the validity of this block without revealing the details. This proof is called a Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument, widely known as a ZK-SNARK.</p>



<p>Similar to the mathematical proof example, the validity of a statement can be verified quickly without revealing the underlying details of the statement.</p>



<p></p>



 Use cases of zero-knowledge proofs in Web3 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs have a variety of use cases within the web3 space, with some of the main ones being:</p>



 
 Enhancing privacy 



 Improving scalability 



 Enabling regulatory compliance 



 Secure authentication&nbsp; 
 



<p>Let’s look at each of these in more detail and how methods using zero-knowledge proofs differ from traditional methods.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy within web3 by concealing transaction details, such as sender addresses, transaction amounts, and contract terms. Unlike traditional blockchain transactions that are transparent and visible to all, zero-knowledge proofs enable confidential transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This heightened level of confidentiality ensures that sensitive data remains protected within decentralised systems. Moreover, zero-knowledge proofs facilitate private interactions, allowing users to engage in transactions and collaborations while maintaining their privacy. This advantage is particularly beneficial in business environments where discretion and confidentiality are paramount.</p>



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs surpass traditional methods by offering a higher level of confidentiality. By concealing transaction details and protecting sensitive data within decentralised systems, zero-knowledge proofs address concerns related to data breaches and unauthorised access. Additionally, their ability to enable private interactions ensures that users can engage securely in web3 environments without compromising their privacy. Another thing that sets them apart from existing privacy solutions is their ability to offer increased privacy with similar levels of security as their non-private counterparts.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for greater scalability 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are increasingly used in layer 2 scaling solutions as well as modern blockchain protocols for their ability to improve blockchain scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They achieve this by optimising data processing and reducing blockchain congestion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Compared to traditional methods, zero-knowledge proofs offer an optimised approach to data processing, reducing computational overhead and enhancing efficiency. This streamlined verification process improves scalability by enabling the processing of larger transaction volumes without congesting the blockchain network.</p>

 Using zero-knowledge proofs for better regulatory compliance 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs can be useful in ensuring compliance with data regulations. They provide a more secure way to handle user data while keeping it private. By hiding sensitive bits, zero-knowledge proofs balance showing what’s needed and keeping things secret. This helps decentralised systems follow the rules without giving away personal details. They check data without revealing everything, keeping user info safe from breaches and hacks which happen regularly.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, zero-knowledge proofs are a clever way to aid in sticking to complex privacy rules while still being open. They make sure user data stays safe in decentralised systems, meeting rules and keeping trust and privacy intact in the web3 world.</p>



<p></p>



 Using zero-knowledge proofs for secure authentication 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs offer a secure method for verifying identities or approving actions without revealing unnecessary personal information. They function by allowing individuals to prove specific credentials without disclosing the exact details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In scenarios where secure interactions are vital, like proving age without revealing the birthdate or approving a transaction without disclosing account specifics, zero-knowledge proofs enable individuals to authenticate themselves or authorise actions while keeping sensitive information private. Amid B2B collaborations, where confidentiality is paramount, zero-knowledge proofs ensure secure interactions by permitting verifications without unnecessary exposure of private details, establishing trust without compromising confidentiality.</p>



<p>Overall, they serve as a discreet way for parties to validate identities or approve transactions securely. They enable necessary verifications while protecting sensitive information, and ensuring trusted and confidential interactions, particularly vital in B2B environments where secure collaborations rely on maintaining confidentiality.</p>

 Deep dive: Blockchain scalability with ZK Rollups 



<p>Let’s take a deeper dive into one of the most prominent applications of zero-knowledge proofs in web3. Scalability is a challenge as old as blockchain, and with an ever-increasing adoption of blockchain technology, there is also a constant need for increased scalability. ZK Rollups emerged as a potential solution for this challenge.</p>



<p></p>



 How ZK Rollups work 



<p>ZK Rollups function by grouping multiple user transactions off-chain and then submitting these bundled transactions as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Alongside this batched transaction, a succinct proof, derived from zero-knowledge proofs, is added to validate the correctness of these bundled transactions. To be specific, a ZK rollup follows these steps:</p>



 
 Transaction bundling: Initially, numerous individual user transactions occur off-chain, which are grouped or bundled together into a single package. 
 



 
 On-chain submission: This bundled package is then submitted as a single transaction to the main blockchain. Rather than posting each transaction separately on the main chain, ZK Rollups compress these transactions into a single entry. 
 



 
 Accompanying zero-knowledge proof: Alongside this single transaction, a concise proof is included. This proof is derived using zero-knowledge techniques, ensuring that it confirms the validity of all the transactions within the bundle without disclosing the specific details of each individual transaction. 
 



 
 Verification process: On the main chain, validators or smart contracts verify this bundled transaction using the accompanying proof. The proof allows for a swift verification process without unravelling the details of each transaction within the bundle. 
 



 
 Final confirmation: Once verified, the bundled transactions are confirmed on the main chain. The main chain acknowledges the validity of these transactions, thereby updating the blockchain’s state. 
 



<p>This method significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed and stored on the main blockchain. At the same time, it maintains the ability to verify the accuracy and integrity of these transactions. It optimises blockchain scalability by condensing multiple transactions into a single entry and facilitating a more efficient verification process using the accompanying zero-knowledge proof.</p>







<p>To make this even more clear, the above image visualises these steps.</p>



<p></p>



 The benefits of ZK Rollups 



<p>The efficiency of ZK Rollups lies in their ability to maintain security guarantees of the underlying blockchain while vastly improving its scalability. Users benefit from reduced transaction fees and faster transaction finality, making ZK Rollups a promising avenue for scaling Ethereum and other blockchain networks. This technique optimises the blockchain’s capacity to handle a higher volume of transactions, paving the way for broader adoption and enhanced usability of dApps.</p>



<p>As the development and adoption of ZK Rollups continue to evolve, ongoing research and advancements aim to further enhance their efficiency and usability. The synergy between ZK Rollups and zero-knowledge proofs showcases a promising path towards resolving scalability issues faced by blockchain networks. It offers a scalable solution without compromising the foundational principles of security and decentralisation.</p>



<p>In summary, ZK Rollups represent a significant leap forward in addressing the scalability concerns of blockchain networks. By leveraging the power of zero-knowledge proofs, they pave the way for a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem, laying the groundwork for a future where decentralised applications can operate at scale without compromising on security.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are complex mathematical proofs that effectively allow parties to prove information without divulging the details. They can be used in web3 to improve scalability, increase privacy, boost compliance, and allow for better authentication. They are the cornerstone to the future of web3 and will be central in existing and future web3 use cases.</p>

Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitmart-lists-zero-knowledge-defi-pioneer-panther-protocols-zkp/">here</a></p> Panther Community Votes to Extend the Advanced Staking Program <p>Thanks to the successful approval of PIP-19 in November, Advanced Staking V4 is live for the next four months, and $ZKP holders can now stake their tokens again. Learn more about PIP-19 <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/dao-proposals/proposal-19-extend-advanced-staking?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">here</a>.&nbsp;</p> Team Updates  Panther Expands Its Marketing Efforts with New Hires <p>We recently hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manwendramishra/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Manwendra Mishra</a> as a Product Marketing Manager for Panther Protocol. Manwendra brings diversified experience across industries, including as the first marketer for blockchain analytics firm, <a href="https://www.merklescience.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Merkle Science</a>. Before moving to Web3, Manwendra was a marketer at leading cybersecurity firm, <a href="https://www.radware.com/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Radware</a>(NASDAQ: RDWR).&nbsp;</p><p>Panther plans to further expand its marketing team with two more hires in the coming weeks.</p> R&amp;D Updates  Product Updates <p>In 2023, we made significant product development progress. We started the year with a workshop in Dubai (UAE) to evaluate our progress, examine the market fit of our product, compliance requirements, and institutional perspectives.</p><p>The workshop's goal was to strategically position Panther and our suite of products to align with the anticipated growth and adoption of the DeFi. After the conclusion of the workshop, we recognized that privacy as a feature couldn’t be a differentiator if we can’t enable practical applications of it. And, to achieve this for a DeFi protocol, compliance support is essential. We noted that privacy and compliance should coexist, but it requires more effort and innovation, particularly in leveraging zero-knowledge technology. Additionally, we aimed to enhance the efficiency of our protocol without overwhelming the user experience with an excess of Zero-Knowledge proofs.</p><p>As a result, we revamped our Product Architecture to align with industry needs, incorporating several outcomes from the workshop:&nbsp;</p>  Integrate with third-party compliance providers that can satisfy the new Panther design requirements.  Create a bank account-like on-chain identity ( zAccount) which acts as a link for all transactions users perform. zAccount is further crucial for compliance as it is activated only after a successful KYC completion.&nbsp;  Data Safe mechanism to satisfy AML requirements.&nbsp;  Introduce Zones to allow institutions to become licensed Zone Managers and run a dedicated zone to enable their customers to trade with whitelisted assets and counterparties.&nbsp;  Oshiya (referred to as Panther Miner) for off-chain zero-knowledge proof computation and to reduce the update on every transaction by batching 64 transactions into one. A concept that lets users put their transactions on a “bus queue”.  DeFi adaptors logic to align with the new architecture.  Support interchain communication, scheduled for V2.  <p>After 4-6 months of development, including smart contract development, circuit development, and integrations with PureFi, we began deploying features on the Mumbai test network. This process involved continuous and iterative development of the dApp. We further devised an incentivized testnet plan, organizing the testnet releases into 8 stages.</p><p>Initially, we estimated three weeks of dApp development. However, we encountered internal bugs and external issues during the testing phase, doubling the anticipated duration.</p> Testnet Updates <p>The testnet currently has 400 users and we’ve distributed a total of over 200,000 $ZKP as rewards. The proposed total amount of Testnet rewards is 1.5M $ZKP, with an additional 0.5M $ZKP in reserve to cover any additional rewards, if necessary.</p><p>Have you signed up for our testnet yet?<a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTB8MP6VMtJ2VMERcwLokZ3LLSHZdKn3j32QqLN1FMFRN/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io"> Sign up here</a> to join our community and receive your $ZKP rewards.Here’s a quick recap of our testnet stages.</p><p>Testnet Stage 0</p><p>In July this year, we launched Panther Stage 0. In this Stage, we released the Panther Miner, a specialized miner designed to interact with a blockchain network. This testing stage (and activity in production) is directed towards miners, a key role in the Panther ecosystem, as opposed to DeFi users. Complete announcement <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage0-live/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 1</p><p>After a successful Stage 0, in August this year, we released Stage 1 of Panther’s Testnet. In this Stage, testnet users were allowed to test two of Panther’s most anticipated innovations: third-party compliance integrations and zero-knowledge accounts. Learn more <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/testnet-stage-1-compliance-integrations-is-now-live-heres-how-to-test/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 2</p><p>In November, we released the second stage of our testnet. This second phase was designed to test the user interaction and reward mechanisms that set the foundation for the protocol’s privacy-preserving features. More information on Stage 2 <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/incentivized-testnet-stage-2-is-now-live-and-its-all-about-rewards/">here</a></p><p>Testnet Stage 3</p><p>Stage 3 development is complete, and internal testing has begun. This third phase will allow users to whitelist test Matic in addition to test ZKPs into Panther's Multi-Asset Shielded Pool.</p><p>Further, when it comes to $ZKP, users can now deposit and store $ZKP either as a zAsset ($zZKP) or as a zAccount Gas (Gas $zZKP). At the time of deposit, testnet users will have the flexibility to divide their ZKP deposit amount between the two. The Gas $zZKP can be used to pay protocol fees, relayers, Oshiya, and any external services that enhance protocol services beyond the core.</p><p>Stage 3 is undergoing internal testing at the time of publishing this year-end update and will be released immediately after the tests are completed.</p> V1 Launch Updates <p>We've been working to streamline our development process, make integration testing more efficient, and possibly work on two testnet stages parallelly to ensure we meet the deadline for the V1 release.</p><p>Audits</p><p>The suggested plan is to undergo two sets of audits before the mainnet launch. A pre-audit will be done in January and then a final audit will be done once all stages are released, tested and bugs are resolved. </p><p>V1 Launch and expansion to multiple chains</p><p>V1 is expected to be live after the second Audit. After the successful launch of V1, the plan is to extend V1 to different EVM chains, subject to community voting and approval.&nbsp;</p> Research Initiatives <p>In 2023, we published two research papers in the International Association for Cryptologic Research: (1) A flexible Snark via the monomial basis, and (2) An optimization of the addition gate count in Plonkish circuits.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1255?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">first paper</a> presents a new pairing-based Snark. The principle advantage of which is, in contrast to other Snarks such as Groth16 and Plonk, it allows freedom in the choice of an elliptic curve with the consequential benefit of supporting non-native field arithmetic (a considerable bottle-neck for other Snarks). This research was also presented at the ETH Privacy Conference in Istanbul.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1264?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">second paper</a> proposes a generalization of Plonk’s permutation argument to obtain a protocol on weighted sums which has the benefit of eliminating intermediate gates from high fan-in additions in circuits with Plonkish arithmetization.</p><p>Other research work includes a survey paper (to be completed soon) that focuses on different approaches to Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) clients via snarks.&nbsp;</p>  About Panther Protocol <p>Panther is a cross-protocol layer that uses zero-knowledge technology to build DeFi solutions that strive to meet regulatory standards and satisfy users' on-chain data privacy needs. The goal of Panther is to allow seamless access to DeFi and create a cross-chain-supported architecture that serves different use cases. Panther’s zero-knowledge primitives are also generalizable to KYC, selective disclosures between trusted parties, private ID, voting, and data verification services.</p>

<p>This year, Nym returns to Europe’s largest and longest-running hacker event, <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Chaos Communication Congress</a>, where thousands of activists, technologists, cypherpunks and artists will gather in Hamburg to shape the techno-political zeitgeist.</p><p>It was at CCC in 2019 that <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/happy-birthday-bitcoin-hello-world-nym-mixnet-600cc7539190">Nym first launched the workshops</a> to build out its testnet. A great deal has happened since then and now, the core team will be back to sip Club Mate among the crowds and gather vital feedback for the mixnet, before the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">NymVPN</a> private beta launches in Q1&nbsp;2024.</p>Nym cofounder and CEO Harry Halpin at CCC in&nbsp;2019 At a glance: Nym at CCC&nbsp;2023 <p>If you’re heading to the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/infos/startpage.html">37th CCC</a>, catch Nym at the <a href="http://decentral.community/">Critical Decentralisation Cluster</a><a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/swiss_cryptoeconomics/"> where you will find the Nym team at the Swiss Cryptoeconomics space</a>. Attendees will be able to try an alpha version of the NymVPN for the very first&nbsp;time.</p><p>Most critically, there will be workshops led by Nym Product Manager Marc Debizet to gather in-depth feedback from some of Europe’s finest hackers around the VPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>Meanwhile Nym DevRel, Serinko, will be running a workshop on setting up high-quality Nym nodes and host open discussions about exit nodes and the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-node-galaxy-update-has-just-completed-c54beea6c01a">Tor Null</a>&nbsp;policy.</p><p>On the ground you will also find community OG Huxian as well as Nym core team long-timers Jaya Klara Brekke and Alexis&nbsp;Roussel.</p><p><a href="https://pretalx.c3voc.de/37c3-lightningtalks/talk/AUXLKH/">The Nym core team will present at the Lightning Talk stage on 28 December at 16:45 in Hall G</a> as well as participate in assemblies, so keep your eyes peeled in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> WTF is&nbsp;CCC? <p>Staunchly political, the Chaos Communication Congress has always been fighting government overreach and censorship stretching back to the ’80s with the founding of the <a href="https://www.ccc.de/">Chaos Computer Club</a> hacking&nbsp;group.</p><p>The Chaos Computer Club was co-founded by pioneering activist and hacker<a href="https://archive.ph/KajgH"> Wau Holland</a> in 1981 — in what was once a room of Berlin’s<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommune_1"> Kommune 1</a>, heart of the radical German student movement and later an editorial base for the left-wing newspaper Die Tageszeitung. The group, with foresight, understood that the information sphere was set to change the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Along the way, Chaos Computer Club put its ideas into action, like when it created a DIY modem from toilet pipes — the<a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q996548"> Datenklo or ‘dataloo’</a> — in the face of a government telecommunications monopoly that viewed connectivity with suspicion and criminalised plugging computers into phone lines. Members even conducted the first digital bank robbery using an exploit in the early<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/geschichte/btx-hack-1984-angriff-der-ccc-hacker-gegen-die-bundespost-a-1002443.html"> Bildschirmtext (BTX)</a> computer network and were regarded by the press as<a href="https://www.nycresistor.com/2008/07/04/cats-dataloos-and-a-btx-bank-robbery/"> ‘electronic Robin Hoods’</a> (because, of course, they returned the missing Deutsche&nbsp;Marks).</p><p>It was in 1984 that the first <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">Chaos Communication Congress</a> was held in Hamburg. With only 100 attendees at the inaugural event, CCC now attracts over 10,000 participants. It <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xygxn4/chaos-communication-congress-a-very-german-hacking-conference-5886b73a9848b145c38b3f06">retains its fiercely political heart</a>, a moral compass oriented to ethical hacking, and the idea that technology should be transparent and a public good — and spotlights art, beauty, and humanity as much as it does the digital&nbsp;world.</p> Nym at CCC 2023: help build privacy for&nbsp;everyone <p>Perhaps more than most, the philosophical centre of CCC aligns with the Nym mission of decentralisation and privacy for all of humanity.</p><p>And it was for those reasons that the first steps of the Nym mission to build a working mixnet, to free people from government and corporate surveillance, were taken at Chaos Communication Congress in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>A few incredibly busy years later and Nym proudly returns to CCC, to ready the mixnet for mass adoption.</p><p>The core team will hold a CLI demo, workshops and 1:1 meetings, and is proactively seeking feedback from the attendees of Europe’s biggest volunteer-run hacker event to further refine the Nym network as it gears up for&nbsp;launch.</p><p>So if you’re attending CCC, please do drop by the Critical Decentralisation Cluster to meet the team! You will also find friends of Nym from <a href="https://riat.at/">RIAT</a>, <a href="https://dod.ngo/">Department of Decentralisation</a>, <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero</a>, <a href="https://www.namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a> and more. Find Nym in the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/en/assembly/swiss_cryptoeconomics/">Swiss Cryptoeconomics</a> assembly along with <a href="https://alephium.org/">Alephium</a>, <a href="https://www.ethswarm.org/foundation">Swarm</a> and Hodling. Come chat with the team and see the NymVPN in action for the very first&nbsp;time.</p><p>And if you’re not attending this year, keep your eyes peeled for videos and other updates from CCC in the new&nbsp;year.</p><p>While you wait, here’s some Nym lore — the launch at CCC in&nbsp;2019:</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/%23dev:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-returns-to-chaos-communications-congress-a2a08194a487">Nym returns to Chaos Communication Congress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

		  4.2.0-rc1 is a Testnet pre-release candidate in anticipation of the release of ZEN 4.2.0 to Mainnet later next January 2024.  Pre-release 4.2.0-rc1 will perform a network upgrade on Public Testnet via Hard Fork at block #1396500, on January 3rd, 2024 at approximately 12:00 PM UTC.  Only nodes running on Public Testnet have to be updated.  IMPORTANT: 4.2.0 is expected to be released in January and go live on Mainnet in February 2024. Once active it will not be possible anymore to unshield funds from private addresses to normal transparent addresses using Sphere by Horizen. Unshielding will still be possible to P2SH (multisignature) addresses, but the process to do so will be more involved.  Because of this, we recommend that all users with existing funds in private addresses unshield their funds to their own transparent addresses in Sphere by Horizen before February 2024. Unshielding funds directly to exchange deposit addresses is strongly discouraged.    <p>Main Features (from 4.1.1 to 4.2.0-rc1):&nbsp;</p>Shielded Pool Deprecation:<br>Unshielding RestrictionsPR <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/pull/624">#624</a> is a follow-up in the gradual path of shielded pool deprecation, it introduces a hard fork requiring the unshielding of private funds to target only script addresses. After the hard fork, unshielding to P2PKH addresses or to P2PK addresses will not be allowed. For this reason, the following RPC commands have been (partially) deprecated: z_sendmany and z_mergetoaddress (check inline documentation for additional details).<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please let us know if you have any questions or if you need further support by reaching out to us on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord.</a></p>

<p>Today, we opened a <a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/a12e050e-9f1f-11ee-a9a0-6e1a1ab4deb2/view">Helios poll</a> of the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP), which will run until December 31st. The purpose of this poll is threefold:&nbsp;</p>



 
 to fill three seats on the Zcash Community Grants committee,&nbsp; 



 to solicit feedback from the community on a proposal to pay a stipend to ZCG committee members, and&nbsp; 



 to assess community sentiment on the question of whether a new funding mechanism should be introduced to replace (or extend) the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Elections to the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>Members of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) committee are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel, and serve a one year term. Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year. Last month, <a href="https://zfnd.org/opening-nominations-for-the-zcash-community-grants-committee-december-2023/">we invited candidates</a> to express their interest in serving on the committee.</p>



<p>Five candidates are standing for three seats on the committee. Here is the list of candidates, with links to their candidacy announcements on the Zcash community forum:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/jason-mcgee-for-zcg-december-2023/46154">Jason McGee</a>

 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/kworks-for-zcg-december-2023/46168">Kworks</a> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Last Thursday, the candidates took part in a Community Call, during which they introduced themselves and answered questions from the Zcash community. You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/KbIM4yNRxts?si=NhncKMnXzd1j4oDq">a recording of the call on Youtube</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y-GbVFA1csIgPbvHOR-1ruOlh7YdA-CHvMtd6R8iSdY">ZCAP members</a> should check their mailbox for instructions on how to vote. In the past, Helios emails have sometimes been flagged as spam, so if you can’t find the instructions please check your Spam folder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good luck to all the candidates, and thank you for volunteering to serve on the ZCG committee!&nbsp;</p>



 ​​Funding ZCG Committee Members’ Stipend 



<p>Since its inception, the Zcash Foundation has provided a stipend to members of the Zcash Community Grants committee. Last month, we shared the news that this stipend would be reduced from its current level of $1,725 USD to $650 USD (paid in ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several community members have expressed concerns that this reduction may have a detrimental impact on the Zcash Community Grants program. ZCG committee member GGuy has proposed that the stipend be maintained at its current level by funding it from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, we are putting the following question to ZCAP: Do you support amending ZIP 1014 to provide a stipend of $115 USD per hour (up to a monthly maximum of $1,725 USD) to be paid in ZEC to ZCG Committee members from the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forum discussion of this proposal can be found <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">h</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">e</a><a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/maintaining-zcg-compensation/46067">re</a>.</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves this proposal, we will draft an amendment to <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> to permit for a stipend to be paid from the Major Grants slice, with the hourly rate and cap to be set or changed by ZCAP poll. Note that the text of the amendment will be finalized by the Zcash Foundation after the results of the ZCAP poll are known, and following consultation with legal counsel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If ZCAP approves the stipend, it is expected that any time for which ZCG Committee members claim the stipend would be in furtherance of the stated purpose of the Major Grants slice of the Dev Fund, and the ZCG Committee, as set forth in ZIP 1014.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If approved, the stipend will be subject to the same policies that govern similar payments by ZF, and may be subject to veto if the Foundation judges them to violate U.S. law or the ZF’s reporting requirements and other (current or future) obligations under applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Services (IRS) regulations.</p>



 Assessing Community Sentiment Regarding the Future of Zcash Ecosystem Funding 



<p>Earlier this year, members of the Zcash community began discussing what should happen after the current Dev Fund sunsets in late 2024. In October, we published a <a href="https://zfnd.org/the-future-of-zcash-ecosystem-development-funding/">blog post</a> explaining how the Zcash Foundation will support the Zcash community in debating and deciding whether or not to institute a new ecosystem funding mechanism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During discussions on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/dev-fund-2024-community-poll-discussion-megathread/44527">Zcash Community Forum</a> and community-organized <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1eaKbrNVmmVKX">Twitter Space discussions</a>, some strong opinions have been expressed both for and against the concept of renewing or replacing the current Dev Fund.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help obtain more clarity regarding the future of funding in the Zcash ecosystem, we are initiating an advisory poll of ZCAP on this question: In principle, would you support the introduction of a new funding mechanism to replace the current Dev Fund when it expires in November 2024?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that the result of this advisory poll (which will be released alongside the results of the ZCG election in early January) will help move discussion about Zcash ecosystem funding forward, and help community members draft more specific proposals in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s my great honor to be asked to lead ECC as CEO.</p>



<p>I want to thank Zooko for everything he’s taught me in the six years that I’ve known him. I have deep respect and admiration for Zooko and his contributions to this industry and to mankind. He is a truly remarkable human. There will only ever be one Zooko.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zcash is a special project. Its purpose to empower economic freedom is wholesome and good. Its legacy is indelible. The innovation within and the talent behind it are undeniable. That it flourishes is vital. All the earth must have access to private, self-sovereign money if we are to be free.</p>



<p>To realize it, we must begin to move into a new season with a different rhythm. Our focus will be to find product-market fit. That will require a continuous and iterative process of observation, hypotheses development, and testing. We will work with you to invent new things.</p>



<p>This will be a time of wide-eyed discovery, experimentation, and pulling our strengths together to make magic happen. We will be one team, in concert with one another, rapidly ideating and iterating, while working collaboratively with many across the Zcash and crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>My near term priorities are threefold:</p>



 
 Remove friction and barriers, at ECC and within the community, that impede our ability to iterate quickly 



 Focus efforts to exponentially increase Zcash utility through user-focused products and continual feedback 



 Secure ECC financial sustainability so we can deliver more, for longer 
 



<p>In support of these priorities, a few changes will immediately take effect:</p>



 
 We will optimize ECC’s organizational structure to support efficiency and improve the likelihood of our success. 



 Internal processes and policies will change to support increased focus, empowerment, and voice. 
 



<p>While I have been asked by ECC to formally help forge a new path ahead, ECC is only one participant in the Zcash community. Realizing a renewed Zcash requires a chorus of voices, both within ECC and across the Zcash community. I look forward to collaborating with you.</p>



<p>I’d like to thank Zooko and the other Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board members, including Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, and Zaki Manian, for your leadership, and thoughtfulness. This trust is the honor of my professional life.</p>



<p>I’d also like to thank the many of you across the community who have engaged with me in recent weeks on the future of Zcash — ideating, dreaming, encouraging, and collaborating. You know who you are, and you’re invaluable both to me and this legacy we’re collectively building with Zcash. We all need each other, now more than ever. Let’s go!</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>We are writing to share some significant news regarding the Electric Coin Company (ECC) and our path ahead. We are opening a new chapter in our story, with a new strategic roadmap, under new leadership.</p>



<p>Since 2015, when ECC (then known as the Zcash Company) was formed, Zooko has been our leader — and one of the most important and revered figures in the crypto and blockchain universe. Under his leadership, ECC launched Zcash in 2016 and since then has contributed groundbreaking technology that underpins Zcash — and a majority of respected crypto projects that exist today.</p>



<p>A few highlights:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In Zcash, ECC delivered the first real-world application of zero-knowledge proofs, a novel method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This is one of the most important contributions to blockchain tech since 2008.&nbsp; 



 The Sapling upgrade for Zcash made mobile-wallet shielded transactions possible for the first time, paving the way for broader adoption of private money. 



 Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way. Halo on Zcash made trustless, private digital cash payments on mobile phones possible for the first time.&nbsp; 
 



<p>Now, it’s time to start a new chapter. Josh Swihart, formerly SVP of Growth at ECC, will return to ECC and take over the reins from Zooko as CEO. He will be responsible for all strategic and tactical decisions. Zooko will remain in his role as a director on the board of the Bootstrap Project, the parent company of ECC. And first, he will take some much-deserved time off. Together, we will fully support and enable Josh to lead ECC into a new chapter of service to humanity.</p>



<p>Fulfilling our mission of economic freedom requires not just groundbreaking technology, but also great products that bring joy to the people who use them. So today we’re excited to redouble our focus on the Zcash user, and we feel confident in Josh’s leadership — in finding product-market fit, unlocking new partnerships and collaboration, improving Zcash usability, and increasing adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to a vision for ECC and an optimistic passion for Zcash, Josh has a strong entrepreneurial, technical, and product background. He is committed to fostering broad inclusivity within the Zcash community, and he’ll share more on that with you shortly.</p>



<p>We have challenging but exciting days ahead. We’re here for it. Thank you for standing with us.</p>



<p>Warm regards,</p>



<p>The Bootstrap (ECC parent) Board of Directors: Alan Fairless, Christina Garman, Michelle Lai, Zooko Wilcox, and Zaki Manian</p>

 Quality of life and bug fixes for Aztec’s local developer testnet <p>A few months ago, we released the Aztec <a href="https://aztec.network/sandbox/">Sandbox</a> at zkHack&nbsp;London.</p><p>The Sandbox is a local developer testnet intended to be a first look into how Aztec will ultimately work: as a privacy-first Layer 2 on Ethereum. It allows developers to write Aztec-native smart contracts with public and private logic, testable in Aztec’s Private Execution Environment (PXE).</p><p>In conjunction with our <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/announcing-aztec-sandbox-the-endgame-for-smart-contract-privacy/">announcement</a>, we quietly recruited multiple teams of developers to work closely with us to identify bugs in the Sandbox, expand its feature set, and begin experimenting with novel privacy primitives.</p><p>As a result of close collaboration with these pioneers, we are proud to announce a series of bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and other enhancements to the&nbsp;Sandbox.</p> Our Ambition <p>Our Sandbox announcement blog post called it “the most ambitious software release in Aztec Labs’ history.” And with great ambition comes great quality of life improvements.</p><p>So we’re thrilled to share some of the obstacles our developers have run into and the work we’ve done to improve Aztec’s DevEx in order to highlight the novel application design space enabled by our software.</p><p>Now that the Sandbox is more stabilized and feature complete, we will be welcoming folks into future rounds of feedback.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter to stay in the loop and get the latest with <a href="https://aztec.network/aztec-nr/">Noir</a>, Sandbox, and Aztec&nbsp;Labs:</p><blockquote><a href="https://embeds.beehiiv.com/83354329-29bf-48be-ba17-a99d72424ace">📰 Subscribe to the Aztec Developer Dispatch</a></blockquote> Developer Experience Improvements <p>Early on, developers had to update a bunch of different pieces of software every time we pushed a new update. Docker, NPM packages, dependencies in nargo.toml, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>With the volume of updates we were (and still are) shipping — weekly on Tuesday — this quickly became very annoying. In fact, one of the major complaints about the Sandbox-and the reason this wasn’t an open-invite testnet-was the speed of iteration and the number of continuous changes.</p><p>So we designed a new update flow ( <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2488">aztec-cli update</a>) that updates all components in one go via a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2875">Docker-only install</a> experience, instead of manually juggling 4 different components.</p><p>We also bundled nargo (the Noir package manager) as WASM in the Docker image in the new update flow. This removes the extra step of installing nargo for writing contracts, so developers can get right into <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/contracts/main">writing Aztec.nr contracts</a>.</p><p>We’ve also implemented a slow updates tree to make it easier to read historical public storage in private functions.</p><p>Many external developers kept running into this constraint — if a private function is reading from public data, it is conceivable that by the time the private function executes, the public data has changed. This is one nuance of working with a network that has both private and public state, but we wanted to make it easier for developers to handle&nbsp;this.</p><p>So as mentioned above, we’ve implemented a <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/slow-updates-tree">slow updates tree</a> — this is a contract containing public data that won’t change within a predefined time interval (for example, ‘over the next epoch’ or ‘over the next 500 blocks’). As long as the transaction in question is executed before that time interval, the public data will stay constant as it’s read from the slow updates&nbsp;tree.</p><p>At any time during the epoch, devs can tell the tree to update their particular public values to a new value. This data is stored in a pending tree. Once the epoch is over, the slow updates tree gets updated to use the pending values. This should be a useful data structure for developers who want to explore the new design space opened up by public ←→ private interactions.</p> What’s in a&nbsp;name? <p>Finally, better names. We know that Aztec Labs has not historically been great at naming, so we’re trying to be better at&nbsp;it.</p><p>First, we’ve removed the term ‘commitment’ in favor of ‘note hashes’. This is just more intuitive, since the ‘commitment’ actually comes from the hashing of the note (in other words, by hashing a note, you commit to the contents of that note, since changing any of the contents will change the hash!). <br>We’ve also named the private execution environment of the network as PXE (or ‘pixie’), instead of the other candidate name that we almost went with&nbsp;(PEE…).</p> Tutorials and&nbsp;Examples <p>The challenges of working with a completely new execution environment are not lost on us, so we’ve also been creating additional references for developers exploring a new ecosystem like Aztec’s. Here are some of the improvements we’ve made for tutorials and accompanying examples:</p>  More examples of custom notes — our network abstracts away a lot of the complexities associated with UTXOs, note commitments, and nullifiers. But custom notes are still hard to grasp without examples.  So we created a few more examples!  <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/address-note">AddressNote</a> and <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/65bd8556875a8680bb44fc7ec9321c5df8d8ad38/yarn-project/aztec-nr/field-note">FieldNote</a> are two examples of custom notes that should help developers grasp the note structures.  Aztec boxes — our version of Truffle Boxes. Essentially, a package with a dedicated user interface showing developers how to use Aztec.js and how to write Aztec contracts. These <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/cli/blank_box">Aztec boxes</a> act as a reference for developers to install and see how the different components interact to help create full stack&nbsp;apps.  Portal tutorial, using Uniswap — Aztec portals are one of the most unique features of the Aztec L2. Portals allow for direct interactions with Ethereum, privately. In other words, no one can know where the transaction is coming from, besides the fact that it is coming from somewhere on&nbsp;Aztec.  <p>(Long time followers may recognize this type of functionality as <a href="https://aztec.network/blog/sunsetting-aztec-connect-2/">Aztec Connect</a>, a previous iteration of our network. The <a href="https://aztec.network/">Aztec network</a> gets Aztec Connect functionality, out of the&nbsp;box!)</p><p>Tactically, portals are smart contracts written in Solidity that are related to the Ethereum smart contract that is being interacted with. <a href="https://docs.aztec.network/dev_docs/tutorials/uniswap/main">This Uniswap tutorial</a> helps developers understand how to use these portals to interact with L1 applications from the Aztec&nbsp;L2.</p> Smashing Bugs <p>Finally, bug fixes. There are always going to be a lot of bugs in new software, and the Sandbox is no exception.</p><p>Here are a few of the bugs that we’ve fixed recently:</p>  If the <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3012">length of a note</a> was incorrect in the compute_note_hash_and_nullifier method, developers would just get a ‘no method found’&nbsp;error  We weren’t properly <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/3193">deserializing arrays of&nbsp;structs</a>  Multiple things broke in the Sandbox — here is one&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2953">Example</a>  The sequencer would go into <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/2502">an infinite loop</a> when duplicate nullifiers were submitted  Here are <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug">all of the bugs</a> we’ve fixed in the past 2&nbsp;months  <p>Hopefully, it’s clear that we’ve been busy making the Aztec ecosystem a more enjoyable place for developers to explore the design space opened up by programmable privacy. These improvements should meaningfully improve the quality of the developer experience for interacting with the Aztec Sandbox, and in due time, the Aztec&nbsp;network.</p><p>We are committed to improving the intuitiveness of our execution environment and continuously upgrading our documentation (look at <a href="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+docs">this activity</a>!). All of this work is a result of listening to the challenges that the Aztec developer community is facing, fixing problems transparently, and working diligently to create a credibly neutral network with programmable privacy.</p> To our&nbsp;partners <p>We couldn’t do it without you. You chose to chew glass and soldier through weekly updates, breaking changes, bugs, all to make privacy more intuitive for others.

<p>We are entering a new frontier in life sciences unparalleled in human history, as emerging technologies are changing the biotech industry along a few vectors including decreasing costs in sequencing, synthesis, etc., the ability to program, simulate and iterate in silico and in vivo and entrepreneurial accessibility. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer and understand biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. In recognition of these step-function changes, over the last years, we have backed a dozen companies in the space — ranging from <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/clock-bio-7275d798ba82">cellular reprogramming to combat aging</a> to <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">sustainable material</a>s produced in microbes.</p><p>We believe tomorrow’s industry-defining biology companies will be founded by technologists and scientists who are building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future (see our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/blueyard-3-74255d983edc">thesis</a>). We are excited about empowering this next generation of founders and have renewed our partnership with <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, the student-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders, aimed at fostering innovation in science at the earliest&nbsp;stages.</p><p>This year, Nucleate has expanded in Europe by opening core chapters in Germany and Denmark. Via our partnership, Nucleate has committed a pool of up to $2 million to fund the next generation of founders that have made it through the organization’s six-month Activator Program during 2024. The objective is to back 10 to 20 new teams across the European ecosystem as they migrate from the academic lab to a commercial entity and build the new platforms that re-engineer our society’s biology experiences.</p><p>We are also excited to announce the winners of the 2023 Nucleate Venture Prize. In total we awarded $1.45 million in the form of uncapped SAFEs to fund early-stage companies working across synthetic biology, therapeutics and drug delivery:</p>  Fusix (Technical University of Munich) — Fusogenic oncolytic viruses.  Nanograb (Imperial College London) — Generating paratopic binders for cell specific delivery using&nbsp;AI  PanTOx (University of Oxford) — Platform for novel antibody therapeutics targeting the tumor microenvironment  Dart Biosciences (University of Oxford) — Novel therapeutics platform for monogenic and common&nbsp;diseases  Jodo Biotech (Cambridge University) — Next-generation legume&nbsp;GMOs  Eterna Therapeutics (University of Oxford) — Novel RNA-targeting therapeutic platform.  Hepatic Patch (University College London) — A stem-cell based implantable and ectopic hepatic&nbsp;patch  ChangeBio (Imperial College London) — An engineerable platform technology to convert methane to higher-value products.  HarborSite (Harvard University) — Safe editing using engineered recombinases in genomic “safe harbor”&nbsp;loci.  <p>Read more about our partnership with Nucleate&nbsp;<a href="https://nucleatehq.medium.com/nucleate-announces-the-renewal-of-4-million-in-venture-prizes-and-the-nucleate-venture-fellows-777fa22cf45b">here</a>.</p>

<p>Biology operates at the single-cell level: human tissues are composed of highly heterogeneous cells interacting and regulating each other, and all interactions within the cell reverberate throughout the whole organism. A full understanding of individual cells, including genotype, function and phenotype, could unlock the biology of multiple diseases. However, most high throughput biological experiments are still performed on 96 wells at a time and all single-cell platforms are only able to run very specific assays on a few thousands of cells at a time, while lacking the capability to connect multiple assays or modalities at a&nbsp;time.</p><p><a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a> is developing a novel platform that expedites drug discovery and overcomes the tradeoff between throughput and depth of analysis. The company’s Z-Screen is a step-change in throughput and resolution of experiments, expanding the conventional 96-well format to 50,000–200,000 wells with imaging and single-cell multi-omic capabilities integrated in every well. Large CRISPR, CAR-T, mRNA libraries, or endogenous molecular heterogeneity, can be mapped to their individual manifestations as cell behavior, cell-cell interactions and secretions. The founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/swamy71/">Swamy Vijayan</a>, is an experienced biotech entrepreneur, having previously built Omiome (a DNA sequencing platform sold to <a href="https://www.pacb.com/">PacBio</a>) and <a href="https://www.plexium.com/">Plexium</a> (small molecules targeting protein degradation with several programs advancing to clinical&nbsp;trials).</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Due to the broad application of its technology — from small molecule discovery to cell and gene therapies — we believe that Zafrens has the potential to become a fabric for developing novel therapeutics. Moreover, with its plans for an internal pipeline of RNA-modulatory small-molecules and HLA-agnostic TCR libraries to common cancer mutations, Zafrens also has the opportunity to accelerate the path to initial drug candidates and thereby play a fundamental role in combating cancer and other diseases.</p><p>We are excited to be backing the Zafrens team on their mission to democratize access to therapeutics, irrespective of modality.

TACTO CO-FOUNDERS JOHANNES GROLL, NICO BENTENRIEDER AND ANDRÉ PETRY.



 
<p>Sometimes you meet a team and you just know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we first learned last year about Tacto co-founders André Petry, Nico Bentenrieder and Johannes Groll and the procurement solution they were building, we already had a keen interest in the category. While businesses have for decades used CRMs (customer relationship management systems) to grow their revenue, where was the SRM (supplier relationship management system)? More attention to the supplier and cost side of the equation was clearly needed, as geopolitical tensions, COVID ripple effects and regulatory changes have created unprecedented supply chain uncertainty and price volatility.</p>



<p>For the world’s largest companies producing physical goods, some supplier relationship tools are available via incumbents. But for millions of mid-sized businesses (SMBs), these options are too cumbersome and too expensive; 90% have no procurement solution at all. Instead, they’re stuck tracking every supplier, certificate and quote manually, in email and Excel. It’s a daunting proposition—especially when you realize that even a company making a seemingly simple product like tape might have hundreds of suppliers and procure tens of thousands of different articles.</p>



<p>Those mid-sized industrial companies are exactly who <a href="https://www.tacto.ai/">Tacto</a> was built to serve, so in late 2022, we reached out to their team to discuss the possibility of a partnership. Unfortunately for us, they’d just finished raising their seed round. But we didn’t want to give up—so we started speaking with customers in the sector, hoping to learn more about the business. What we heard made us even more interested in the product André, Nico, Johannes and their team are building.</p>



<p>Customers told us Tacto had helped them streamline every aspect of the procurement process, from requesting, evaluating and responding to quotes; to tracking suppliers’ regulatory certifications; to analyzing prices and preparing for negotiations. Where their employees once spent hundreds of hours on interviews, questionnaires and data entry, the platform now automatically gathers and standardizes that information—and of course, uses AI to help them make sense of it. Tacto has also dramatically simplified compliance with Germany’s new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which imposes stricter supplier reporting to every business with at least 1,000 full-time employees. Even better, it’s easy to integrate—no year-long sales cycles or big IT projects—and, thanks to André, Nico and Johannes’s insistence on an elegant, consumer-grade UI, it’s easy to use, as well.</p>



<p>But customers didn’t just sing the praises of Tacto’s product; we also heard amazing things about its team. André, Nico and Johannes have stellar credentials—all three met at the elite Center for Digital Technology and Management in Munich. They started Tacto in early 2020 after seeing the challenges of procurement firsthand, pushed ahead when skeptics in the space told them it wouldn’t work, and now, have stuck with it long enough to prove those skeptics wrong. They are high-energy, thoughtful and relentlessly focused on performance—and, importantly, they have an impressive ability to attract talent. Tacto’s team members deeply understand the problems their customers are facing, and they work quickly to solve them.</p>



<p>After hearing those rave reviews, we knew we had to try again—so we traveled to Munich to meet André face-to-face. We walked out of that first one-hour coffee with a high degree of conviction in Tacto, and a couple of weeks later, flew back to spend the day with the team and offer them a term sheet. Sequoia was far from the only firm vying for Tacto’s attention—but in that high-pressure environment, we saw for ourselves the qualities that make André, Nico and Johannes great leaders. We were thrilled that they chose us to lead their Series A.</p>



<p>Today, the future is bright. Tacto is now serving customers across a wide range of industries, from mechanical engineering to packaging to medical technology, and impressively, they have grown quickly while retaining every one of their happy customers. In the months and years ahead, as supply chain challenges continue and new regulations expand beyond Germany across Europe, André, Nico, Johannes and their team will be there to make life better and easier for even more companies—and we are excited to support them along the way.</p>

<p>The acceleration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology adoption across industries has indicated widespread organisational acceptance of the novel technology. The advent of this new technology has brought more efficient and creative possibilities. However, the use of language models in AI raises concerns about trustworthiness in its training and the output it generates. This leads us to the question: How can we leverage existing technologies to bridge this lack of trust?</p>



<p>This article explores the challenges surrounding trust in AI system inputs and outputs, how blockchain could be the solution to establish trust, and various integration challenges that need to be accounted for.</p>



<p></p>



 Trust challenges of AI systems 



<p>Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, organisations have made enormous strides to implement AI within their technological systems. Enthusiasm for this new technology promising productivity enhancement, has also generated discussions on whether we can trust these systems. Who has been training these AI models? How can we be sure that the information output it generates is reliable and unbiased? </p>



<p></p>



 Transparency of AI language models  



<p>AI systems require a large language model (LLM) to learn and have a basis to create outputs from. However, due to the lack of transparency surrounding what goes into the LLMs, doubts arise on data input authenticity and reliability.</p>



<p>Authenticity: If the origin, quality, and representativeness of the input data are not transparent, it raises concerns about the authenticity and reliability of the model’s understanding.</p>



<p>Reliability: Lack of clarity regarding the source of training data leads to scepticism about the model’s ability to accurately reflect real-world scenarios and diverse perspectives. This creates uncertainty on whether the model’s output can be trusted and used accordingly.</p>



<p>Explainability: There is a lack of self-explanation in AI systems on how a specific outcome is generated when prompted. This poses a significant hurdle to understanding and trusting AI’s outputs. What data did the system pool together to carry out its decision-making process when prompted?</p>



<p></p>



 Ethical standards in AI training 



<p>AI systems often make decisions based on complex algorithms and data that include principles governing the training of AI models. Thus creating the need for a standardised set of ethical guidelines governing the training of AI models.</p>



<p>One primary concern is the ethical framework guiding the selection of data used in training these systems. The opaqueness surrounding the training data raises ethical concerns, particularly related to bias. If the data used to train AI models contain biases, the model may unintentionally perpetuate those biases in its outputs. Without transparency, it becomes challenging to identify and address biases in the training data. Therefore making it difficult to avoid potential negative consequences.</p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. AI output 



<p>Another significant challenge revolves around the ability to distinguish between outputs generated by AI systems and those by human intelligence. Can we reliably identify whether the output presented is a result of human thought or an algorithmic process? </p>



<p>Authentication is particularly crucial in scenarios where information transparency is essential, such as journalism, content creation, or academia. This distinction between human and AI-generated content also carries ethical implications. It prompts discussions on attribution, accountability, and the potential influence these systems might have in shaping public opinion. As AI becomes more integrated into society, different mechanisms are needed to transparently demonstrate the origin of information.</p>



<p></p>



 Output challenges 



<p>When speaking of trust within AI, we must also evaluate the ownership and intellectual property rights of AI-generated output. The challenge lies in determining whether outputs are established through AI’s novel agency or the accumulation of various other sources that warrant intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The artwork industry can be used to illustrate the debate on whether generative AI should give credit to artists. Since the system draws inspiration from its training model, would the new artwork’s ownership belong to AI? This debate highlights legal and ethical dilemmas, due to a lack of established frameworks that promote fair compensation for contributors. As AI systems evolve, there is a pressing need to redefine traditional notions of ownership. Acknowledgment of the collaborative nature of AI development is needed while safeguarding the rights of those involved in the generative process.</p>



<p></p>



 Role of blockchain in establishing trust 



<p>Based on the trust challenges discussed above, blockchain technology could be the solution as a trust layer for AI. Blockchain’s decentralised design, using transparent and immutable data records, guarantees universal accessibility, enhanced authentication, and verification processes for all users.</p>



<p></p>



 Ensuring transparency in data processes  



<p>One of the fundamental challenges in trusting AI, as discussed, lies in the lack of transparency regarding data input processes. Blockchain can resolve the transparency issue by recording every step of the AI training and data input process. This ensures that the origin and reliability of the data used to train AI models are traceable and verifiable to reflect real-world conditions.</p>



<p>By leveraging blockchain, organisations facilitating AI technology can instil confidence in stakeholders regarding the reliability of its AI-generated outputs. This safeguards against potential misuse and establishes a foundation for accountability in the development and deployment of AI.</p>



<p></p>



 Tracing decision-making processes  



<p>Transparency enabled by blockchain technology can address the inherent explainability challenges associated with AI’s black-box nature. Establishing a transparent trail of the data and model processes integrated enhances the reliability of AI decisions.</p>



<p>The availability of a comprehensible trail can address the lack of confidence and scepticism present in generative AI. Traceability encourages independent evaluation, empowering users to revisit and assess AI’s decision-making steps, thereby contributing to a more accountable and trustworthy AI environment.</p>



<p></p>



 Leveraging immutability to validate data input reliability 



<p>The immutable nature of blockchain technology contributes to providing security to data records and data transactions. Every piece of information entered into the blockchain is time-stamped and linked to previous data blocks, creating an unbroken chain of custody. This not only enhances the accountability of data sources but also enables stakeholders to verify the authenticity of inputs. As a result, users can confidently rely on the integrity of the data feeding into AI algorithms, knowing that any attempt to manipulate or compromise the information would be immediately detectable. On the other hand, blockchain can be used to drive sustainability goals for successful operations in the long run. For further understanding of how blockchain can sustain long-term ESG goals for organisations, refer to this ebook on <a href="https://zaisan.io/ebooks/using-blockchain-for-sustainability/">using blockchain for sustainability.</a></p>



<p></p>



 Authenticating human vs. machine contributions 



<p>Distinguishing between outputs generated by human intelligence and those crafted by AI is critical. The widespread use of AI in optimising many of our daily processes is bound to be used in other various domains, such as work-related situations and advisory roles.  This has caused increasing evaluation on whether information distributed is completely human or contains traces of AI contribution. </p>



WorldID is used as a global digital identity to anonymously prove a person’s unique identity.



<p>Thus the use of smart contracts in the blockchain ecosystem provides a mechanism for creating verifiable identities for both human and machine contributors.  OpenAI’s <a href="https://worldcoin.org/world-id">WorldID</a> initiative is an example of how smart contracts can be employed to authenticate the origin of contributions. Its application will enable a clear distinction between human and AI-generated outputs. Their initiative could address future concerns about accountability and ethical considerations in various domains such as authentic journalism and recognition.</p>



<p></p>



 Establishing auditable trails for tracing errors 



<p>In the complex landscape of AI, errors and biases in outputs can have significant consequences for end users. Blockchain-based systems can offer the solution of an auditable trail that records every transaction and interaction within the AI ecosystem. In the event of errors or biases in AI outputs, this auditable trail provides a comprehensive analysis of the training data and its parameters, facilitating the identification and rectification of issues. This auditable trail also serves as a critical tool for post hoc analysis, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement of AI algorithms to meet evolving ethical and performance standards.</p>



<p></p>



 Challenges between AI and blockchain integration 



<p>The integration of AI and blockchain technology may provide us with a starting point in establishing trust, however, there are still potential challenges that experts should address when considering this integration.</p>



<p></p>



 Scalability 



<p>One prominent concern is the scale and scope of AI applications. AI systems often work with massive datasets, and to fully integrate them with blockchain, a highly efficient, low-cost network is essential. However, the transactional and resource costs associated with blockchain networks remain a significant hurdle.</p>



<p></p>



 Cost efficiency 



<p>Initial setup costs can involve acquiring the necessary hardware, software, and infrastructure to support both AI algorithms and blockchain networks. Maintenance costs also arise as ongoing updates and improvements are essential to keep both technologies optimised and secure. Transaction costs associated with blockchain networks, such as fees for data storage and processing, can accumulate. Particularly when dealing with large-scale AI applications that require frequent interactions with the blockchain. Lastly, organisations will need to invest in skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of integrating AI and blockchain, adding to the overall human resource expenses.</p>



<p></p>



 Interoperability 



<p>There are various blockchain platforms available, and achieving interoperability between them poses a challenge since smart contracts and AI applications might need to interact across different blockchain networks. AI models and algorithms may be developed using different frameworks and technologies. Therefore, ensuring a seamless integration with blockchain platforms can be a complicated process. </p>



<p></p>



 Regulatory Compliance 



<p>The topic of interoperability across both technologies also highlights regulatory challenges on two fronts. The decentralised and global nature of blockchain introduces uncertainty, as compliance requirements vary across jurisdictions. Simultaneously, the use of AI, particularly in sensitive domains, is subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny with a focus on data privacy, transparency, and accountability. Combining these technologies requires a dual compliance effort of addressing regulations specific to each domain and staying up to date with technical developments, to develop a standardised process for compliance.</p>



<p></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The widespread integration of AI technology has prompted critical discussions surrounding transparency, authentication and ethical standards in AI language models. Blockchain, through its transparent and immutable nature, emerges as a promising solution to address these concerns. It offers transparency in data processes, traceability of decision-making, and validation of data input reliability. However, the integration of AI and blockchain presents a set of challenges, such as scalability, interoperability, regulatory compliance, and cost efficiency. Thus, when leveraging this integration, a balance is needed between innovation, and ethical considerations. AI developers should ensure that the collaborative development of AI is transparent, accountable, and trustworthy for the benefit of its users.</p>

<p>1) Can you tell us a little about yourself?</p><p>I’m what everyone knows as ‘JSKitty’ — the infamous dev cat of Labs (since the SnappySnap days)! Young British dev, a never-ending interest in tech, from crypto to global-finance, game-dev and AI, I’ve pretty much touched every computer-related subject that anyone could think of — and my end interest ended up being with crypto, after I found Bitcoin around early&nbsp;2014.</p><p>Before PIVX, I worked at ZENZO, before ZENZO, I worked on multiple early projects, like the “DeepOnion” privacy coin, or “eXperience Points (XP)” back in the 2017&nbsp;bullrun!</p><p>Before all those, I was a Game Developer, with two published games, and a handful of unpublished ones, mostly solo-built, some with friends, but all of them were built in a home-schooled method, I do not have a single academic grade to my name, and I don’t need&nbsp;one!</p><p>2) When and why did you get into cryptocurrency?</p><p>In early 2013–2014 I ended up coming across (in a way that is now lost to my memories) a Bitcoin faucet, the ancient “Freebitco.in” site (which is still running today, damn!), at that point, I was just barely a game developer, had zero knowledge (hah) of Bitcoin, crypto, most of programming, and even finance in general — over the years, I collected Bitcoin, I learned about it, got incredibly obsessed over the technology from the newfound of decentralised systems and “programmable money”, I joined the BitcoinTalk forum and engaged, actually got a fairly reputable BitcoinTalk account in those days, back when coins would often do “Banner Campaigns” where BCT users would advertise a coin on their banner, fun times,&nbsp;indeed.</p><p>3) When and why did you get into&nbsp;PIVX?</p><p>This is an interesting one, around late 2017 roughly, I was effectively a serial-tipbot-dev as a kid, a surprising amount of projects used to have my Tipbots, I built them from scratch, they had various community-building features, and I would bounce from project-to-project hooking them up and watching the communities enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>In that time, I met Snappy and the original-ish tipbot operator (Buer), in which I poked around for the status of it, and saw that it was effectively dead — so I teamed up with Snappy, who LOVED the idea, and immediately helped me to make the ‘PIVX Tipbot’ a reality — and for those months that it ran, I remember it was a huge success, with a bot-powered Radio and DJ system that members would gather and rock with — Snappy would act as a host — that, that community spirit, is what kept me in PIVX, even if the original idea, was merely to propagate a&nbsp;tipbot.</p><p>4) What do you think sets PIVX apart from other cryptocurrencies in the&nbsp;market?</p><p>It’s teams (Core and Labs), it’s long-lived testament of surviving the harshest markets, it’s unique blend of Bleeding-Edge tech with PoS, in which a dozen “PIVX-firsts” occurred and continue to occur. — PIVX as a technology, and a currency, is an incredible feat, to say the least, one that is underappreciated by the wider&nbsp;market.</p><p>5) Can you tell us about your journey as a developer and engineer that led you to the creation of PIVXLabs; mypivxwallet and PIVCards?</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/PjuCvCHDyp">PIVX Labs,</a> or at least the ‘soul’ and idea of it, was born of Snappy — the Catalyst of PIVX Labs as-of-today was back when me, Snappy, Kyeno and various other developers, some long gone now — decided that PIVX needed more than just a Core Wallet, the problem with 2017–2020 PIVX was that there were a severe barrier to entry, as well as a UX that is not up to the modern standards of&nbsp;‘Web3’.</p><p>Labs came to fruition from the demand of Labs being needed — we knew PIVX needed a lighter, faster, easier wallet that anyone in the world, on any device, with any experience level; could setup and use, without compromising on security. <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> was Labs first creation.</p><p>We also knew that PIVX needed more than wallets to thrive as a currency — <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/pivcards/">PIVCards </a>enabled using PIV in the real-world, easier than any other platform on the market — What will we build next? I’m not sure yet, but it will be another pillar to PIVX’s real-world adoption and usage — That, is why Labs&nbsp;exists.</p><p>6) As a developer, what are some of the technical aspects or challenges you encountered while building mypivxwallet, and how did you overcome&nbsp;them?</p><p>In general, there are three-ish ‘pillars’ of MPW’s architecture to decide&nbsp;upon:</p><p>- Convenience.</p><p>- (De)centralisation and/or&nbsp;Privacy.</p><p>- Security.</p><p>Increase one, and generally, the other two decrease, how do you build something perfect in all three? Truthfully, you can’t, there are trade-offs to be made somewhere, for something.</p><p>My first and foremost priority for MPW has been Security: for example, MPW since even the first day, NEVER allowed saving a wallet to disk without an encryption password — ironically, this is a more secure practice than the Core Wallet, which does not force this measure on first&nbsp;launch.</p><p>But for Privacy? This is tough, MPW uses Blockbook explorers to sync your transaction history, which requires the app to send your Public Keys to said Blockbook to retrieve your balance — this is not fun, but the alternative: chain header sync, would lengthen the synchronisation time of MPW MASSIVELY, which is a huge hit to Convenience.</p><p>Sure, only a gone-rogue Blockbook can actually collect, store, analyse that data — but it is still a possibility, depending on your threat model, that may already be too much data exposure for&nbsp;someone.</p><p>Back to security: many platforms, like Password Managers, will encrypt your password data locally, and then upload your encrypted data to their Cloud storage — this means you can retrieve your data from the internet, or cross-sync things across your devices, which is incredibly convenient: but what if that service gets compromised? It’s a ticking time bomb before your data is decrypted by an attacker, and boom, account gone — MPW could add encrypted cloud-sync for convenience, and to give users the ability to recover their wallet even if their device exploded randomly — sure, but is it worth the&nbsp;risk?</p><p>This is our daily challenge, a balancing act of conflicting design philosophies.</p><p>7) How does mypivxwallet simplify the onboarding process for new users, particularly those who may be unfamiliar with cryptocurrency wallets?<br> <br> <a href="https://mypivxwallet.org/">MPW </a>focuses massively on: “less is more” in a User Experience sense — the default design assumption of MPW is to assume the user is the least knowledgeable in any area of the wallet, as such; complex features are walled off behind “Advanced Mode”, which hides complex things by default — users can create an MPW wallet, jot down their seed on paper, and encrypt their wallet, within just 1–2&nbsp;minutes!</p><p>8) With the recent launch of PIVCards could you share a little about this phenomenal PIVX use&nbsp;case?</p><p>PIVCards was, funnily, a completely random whim-idea I had a few months ago and decided to prototype in a single week of spare time — having gotten the ‘itch’ to do something new outside of MPW, PIVCards was a massive technological and logistical challenge, and I am surprised that such a small team managed to build it as well as we&nbsp;did.</p><p>PIVCards has processed almost 400 orders, worth a total of ~$17,500, since the initial prototyping, and we HUGELY underestimated the volume we’d be handling, so PIVCards had a full two/three weeks of additional polishing by me, to get it scaling better and with less manual input needed — now, although still imperfect, the service runs entirely autonomously, with near zero manual labour required aside from the occasional logistical ‘edge-case’ we&nbsp;hit.</p><p>9) Finally, what advice or encouragement would you give to aspiring developers and entrepreneurs who are looking to make an impact in the cryptocurrency industry?</p><p>Find what excites you, fascinates you, what grabs at you with the grasp a black hole has on the cosmos: and dive in to it, trust the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Why keep what you love, as a mere side-hobby, rather than a way of&nbsp;life?</p><p>Work doesn’t have to be ‘for someone’, nor does it have to be boring, unexciting — break the chains of being a corporate cog, find what you love, master it, and with enough time and energy (and very importantly: networking), you will make a living with it, doing what you&nbsp;love.</p><p>Sending gratitude to JSKitty for taking the time to sit down with me and share some insights into his background and experiences.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/decembers-pivx-perspectives-spotlight-shines-on-jskitty-founder-and-developer-of-pivxlabs-487e2cc3ba5f">December’s PIVX Perspectives Spotlight Shines on JSKitty, Founder and Developer of PIVXLabs.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 TL;DR 



<p>As Electric Coin Co. (ECC) and the Zcash community prepare for public retrospectives of zcashd Network Upgrade 5 (NU5) and what has become known as the sandblasting attack, this blog post details ECC’s motivations, challenges, and accomplishments with regard to each.&nbsp;</p>



 
 The NU5 upgrade was an ambitious undertaking to eliminate the need for trusted setups, increase user confidence, and enhance Zcash’s security and scalability. 



 The implementation of Halo, a cryptographic breakthrough, on Zcash made possible trustless, private, digital-cash transactions for the first time on mobile phones. 



 A malicious attack following the upgrade led to significant wallet performance issues, prompting ECC to enter Emergency Mode. Our response involved multiple technical updates, performance improvements, and the release of new mobile-wallet SDKs. 



 Despite the challenges and delays, ECC succeeded in improving the security and resiliency of Zcash. 
 



 



 



<p><a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/j/86440711631">Public retrospective: Wednesday, Dec. 13 at 22:00 UTC/17:00 EST</a></p>



 



 



 What the FUD? 



<p>ECC’s mission is to empower economic freedom, and most organizations that work on Zcash-related projects, like the Zcash Foundation (ZF) and Zcash Community Grants (ZCG), have similar community-minded objectives for the betterment of humanity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, since Zcash came into the world in 2016 a stream of misinformation (and some coordinated propaganda) has been circulated on social media, forums, and other community platforms meant to incite FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).</p>



<p>The rumors claimed that Zcash was compromised, or that it was vulnerable to counterfeiting, or that there was a backdoor that would allow third parties to access a user’s transaction information without their consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And unfortunately, until NU5 was released, there was a major obstacle in confronting these attacks: the trusted setup. When Zcash launched, its zero-knowledge proofs required a <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Ceremony</a>, or trusted setup phase, to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>This technique was pioneered by ECC, and it required multiple parties in different locations using complex security measures.</p>



<p>Regardless of the extra-careful planning and execution plus redundant security, Zcash users and observers had to trust the historical fact that the ceremony participants weren’t conspiring to deceive the public. Trusted setups don’t allow for a mathematically verifiable supply, and as long as these complicated procedures were required for major Zcash upgrades, there would always be doubters and detractors. And the doubters would have a point — mathematics is verifiable, but history isn’t. The reputation and integrity of Zcash was being challenged, and in ECC’s view, this was an issue the community couldn’t afford to ignore.</p>



 NU5: A call to action 



<p>In 2019, ECC engineers Sean Bowe, Daira Emma Hopwood, and Jack Grigg had been working on scalability design and experimenting with a solution for efficient recursion when Bowe made a discovery.</p>



<p>“I just stumbled upon a technique to do this zero-knowledge proof construction on completely ordinary elliptic curves,” Bowe said. “And so over the course of maybe 24 hours, it went from, ‘Ooh, that’s really exciting, that’ll be neat if we can do that’ to ‘Holy crap, now that we don’t have trusted setups or anything, it’s all really simple. It was a series of steps that turned from a nice insight into a complete paradigm shift.”</p>



<p>Halo, as it would come to be known, is a zero-knowledge proving system that enables recursion without a trusted setup in an efficient way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bowe’s discovery was a cryptographic breakthrough heralded by the industry, and in 2021 ECC committed to implementing Halo in Zcash.</p>



<p>Halo on Zcash would make trustless, private, digital-cash transactions possible for the first time on mobile phones. It would serve as a catalyst for Zcash user confidence and provide a path to much greater scalability, while making the protocol more attractive, faster, and less expensive for others to build on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the ECC blog:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Halo on Zcash would enable circuit upgrades without the need for trusted setups, making the Zcash shielded protocol more agile for future improvements, such as supporting additional assets like [Zcash Shielded Assets, or ZSAs]. We want to make it easy for other projects and tokens to benefit from Zcash features, such as privacy through encryption. Trusted setup will become a remnant of the past.</p>



<p>In addition, this upgrade would pave the way for shielded Zcash scale through proof aggregation and blockchain succinctness, two scalability improvements. This would improve the user experience by eliminating frustrating synchronization time that plagues all blockchains today, reducing the traditional blockchain bloat, and allowing for non-escalating fees as usage increases. In conversations with large social platforms who expressed interest in native Zcash support, a viable path to scalability was given as a requisite near-term consideration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In January 2021, after more than a year of Halo R&amp;D, ECC concluded that the benefits of Halo on Zcash outweighed other protocol priorities, and we proposed implementing it in NU5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/8qSA29vWWds?si=6hvbieHC23DzuvmX">Zcash Media video</a> about the original Ceremony, its participants (including Edward Snowden), and how Halo makes trusted setups obsolete.</p>



 NU5 objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our NU5 goals from the outset were to (1) make Zcash more secure, (2) give Zcash users confidence by making the supply mathematically verifiable, (3) make future upgrades easier, and (4) enable future upgrades to benefit from recursive proofs for scalability and programmability improvements.</p>



<p>Our original estimate of 6-7 months turned out to be overly optimistic — as new discoveries were made, opportunities were revealed in the process, and technical complexities arose — and in the end the journey took almost a year and a half.</p>



<p>Along the way, we confronted a number of technical challenges. For example, the complexity of including Orchard support in the zcashd embedded wallet was not properly accounted for in the original estimates for the NU5 timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECC faced time-consuming engineering hurdles, like building a complicated circuit for Halo-plus-Orchard to make it work on mobile devices. And midstream, we made the decision to implement <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/unified-addresses-in-zcash-explained/">unified addresses</a> (UAs) to enable shielded by default in supporting wallets. The design and build-out of UAs were difficult, and if ECC had been practicing product-driven planning and development at the time (like we are now) we believe we would have identified the need for UAs sooner and their implementation would have been smoother.</p>



<p>In addition to battling technical obstacles like these, plus a few <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-4-5-1/">surprise bugs</a>, ECC spent significant time and resources advocating for and defending our roadmap decisions against criticism for: our rationale (getting rid of trusted setup wasn’t worth the time and effort, ZSAs were more important), our planning (we kicked off the discussion publicly before planning enough -and- we planned too much before starting the work), the decision to license Orchard under the Bootstrap Open Source Licence (BOSL), the decision to implement Unified Addresses (UAs), and our overall approach to network upgrades (our priorities were arbitrary and out of touch).</p>



<p>It’s important to acknowledge that we had significant community support during the process, too. Overall, community sentiment was positive. We received valuable insight and feedback from our <a href="https://electriccoin.co/team/">Scientific Advisory Board</a> and crucial security audits from <a href="https://hackmd.io/@qedit/zcash-nu5-audit">Qedit</a> and <a href="https://research.nccgroup.com/2021/11/02/public-report-zcash-nu5-cryptography-review/">NCC group</a>.</p>



 NU5 timeline and accomplishments 



<p>Not including the pre-implementation research and development, NU5 was a 17-month endeavor that delivered novel technology and improved Zcash user experience.&nbsp;</p>

 May 31, 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">NU5 activates on mainnet</a>, eliminating trusted setup for the new Orchard pool and launching a new era for Zcash 
 



<p>When Zcash NU5 activated on mainnet May 31, 2022, it was one of the most important milestones for Zcash since the cryptocurrency launched in 2016. As ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox put it, “an historic step forward for human society.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In launching the Orchard shielded payment protocol utilizing Halo, we eliminated the trusted setup to improve Zcash security and sustainability, made the supply mathematically verifiable, improved scalability because future network upgrades won’t require a complicated setup ceremony, paved the way for increased interoperability by providing a system that could unlock private cross-chain proofs at scale, and introduced BOSL which has returned value to the Zcash community (e.g., Filecoin Foundation and Ethereum Foundation grants to Brave and Edge).</p>



<p>It was a massive effort, and after almost a year and a half of building and wrestling with the technical challenges of NU5, the ECC Core team was ready for some rest. But almost right away, Zcash was hit with another issue we couldn’t ignore.</p>



 



 The sandblasting attack 



<p>In June 2022, almost immediately after ECC launched NU5, a serious problem emerged. The Zcash network began experiencing a huge increase in shielded transaction size and activity. This additional network load caused a “data pileup” that prevented some wallets (Nighthawk, Edge, and Unstoppable) from being able to sync in a reasonable amount of time. Wallets weren’t syncing and some users weren’t able to access their funds.</p>



<p>This was a problem that ECC, as the primary maintainer of zcashd and supplier of mobile-wallet SDKs, was best-positioned to confront.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: A call to action 



<p>Some parties at ECC did not initially want to make the assumption that this unusual transaction load was the work of a malicious actor. Eventually however, the evidence that it was a malicious actor became overwhelming — and we have reason to believe it may even have been coordinated by the same actor or group of actors who spread Zcash FUD, and that they may have been paid to do so.</p>



<p>But solving that mystery was less important than fixing the problem.&nbsp;</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Objectives and obstacles 



<p>Our top priority was ensuring users could regain access to and spend their ZEC (Zcash coins). This is fundamental to our mission of economic freedom and a requirement for real-world, private digital cash.</p>



<p>As an initial line of defense, we released&nbsp; performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80%. We also began working on performance upgrades to our mobile wallet SDKs.</p>



<p>In August 2022, with lots of work left to solve these wallet performance issues, ECC went into Emergency Mode. This was our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode:</p>



 
 Users of Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable can spend their current funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet). 



 Users of those wallets can receive and become able to spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in 1 hour. 



 Users of those wallets see sync updates which are minimally confusing about progress. 



 None of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK. 
 



<p>The wallet performance issues presented a complicated series of challenges to address, and they required developing and implementing (1) a faster algorithm that does not require a linear sync of all blocks on chain and (2) tooling modifications that would give users the ability to spend funds without having a fully synced chain. The solution required changes to every component in the shielded mobile wallet stack: zcashd, lightwalletd, the ECC wallet SDKs, and the ECC prototype wallet.</p>



<p>Internally, fee changes were debated from the get-go, but for the first few months, the ECC team focused on additional performance improvements and worked to resolve the issue without fee changes. Later, we decided to implement fee changes to throttle the spam attack.</p>



<p>As users became frustrated with their user experience, some community members became vocal and publicly criticized ECC for not being prepared for the attack and slow to respond.</p>



<p>In February 2023, we were notified by blockchain security firm Halborn of <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-releases-remediate-memory-exhaustion-vulnerability-in-zcash/">vulnerabilities</a> inherited from Bitcoin Core that may have affected more than 280 chains, including Zcash. This was another all-hands-on-deck emergency on top of the wallet performance issues, and as ECC was the only team notified of the vulnerability, we were the only ones who could make the necessary fixes. The coordination of the disclosure and remediation consumed approximately a month of our time.</p>



<p>To make matters worse, ECC as an engineering organization was attempting to do too many things at once: core node maintenance, supporting CEXes like Coinbase, Binance, and Gemini, backports from Bitcoin, mobile SDKs, mobile wallet applications, and future protocol improvements. ECC <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-restructuring-to-better-serve-zcash/">restructured</a> in May 2023, which further strained resources temporarily.</p>



 Additional challenges 



 
 At the time, ECC internal communication and project management practices weren’t organized for an Emergency Mode situation. This affected our understanding of priorities and workflow across teams. 



 Before the attack, ECC product strategy focused on adoption first, instead of performance and scalability. Users want new features, and working on improving performance slows feature releases. But the attack took Zcash UX to the limits immediately. 



 Technical debt: We had implemented previous network upgrades with only limited performance improvements. 



 ECC vastly underestimated how long it would take to fix outstanding wallet performance issues. 



 Other technical issues arose that caused delays, such as when speed.z.cash bitrotted and then got deleted while ECC was without a devops manager.&nbsp; 



 The ECC Core team had three different managers during Emergency Mode. 



 Emergency Mode slowed development of our planned wallet product, now known as Zashi. However, we were able to leverage the prototype internally to validate and test SDK improvements. 
 



<p>ECC was lucky to have proactive wallet partners — Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable — who worked with us to test releases and submit bugs, then were quick to implement SDKs 2.0 when they were ready.</p>



 Sandblasting attack: Timeline and accomplishments 



<p>In all, ECC’s sandblasting response and implementation by third-party wallets consumed about 16 months. By November 2023, Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable were working again (better than ever), and we announced an end to Emergency Mode.</p>



 Timeline 



 
 June 2022: Network spamming began; shielded outputs jumped from a monthly average of 42,600 to 21,622,590 in June alone 



 July 2022: Implemented performance improvements in zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a> to reduce verification time by up to 80% and began working on performance improvements to our mobile wallet SDKs 



 August 2022: ECC officially entered <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860">Emergency Mode</a>, although we didn’t use that term in public written communications until March 2023; started researching Spend Before Sync 



 September 2022: While working on zcashd and improved mobile sync experience, re-opened research into possible fee change mechanisms (<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-0317">ZIP 317</a>) and syncing efficiencies (<a href="https://hackmd.io/@str4d/dagsync-graph-aware-zcash-wallets">DAGSync</a>/Spend Before Sync) 



 October 2022: Released zcashd <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-3-0/">5.3.0</a> with additional performance improvements to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the zcashd node 



 October 2022: Reaffirmed our immediate objectives regarding syncing issues with our wallet SDKs and <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/29">communicated our criteria for exiting Emergency Mode</a> 



 October 2022: <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ecc-thirty-year-vision/">Communicated our intent </a>to have wallet performance issues resolved by the end of February 2023 



 October 2022: Changes to zcashd increased its robustness against the attack 



 November 2022: Identified and fixed the last known bugs that were blocking the first phase of SDK releases, continued progress on Spend Before Sync, and began prepping both zcashd and mobile wallets for ZIP 317; squashed the last known librustzcash bugs that were blocking wallet release and completed Android &amp; iOS SDK integration 



 December 2022: Completed the implementation of zcashd optimizations expected to save memory and to reduce orphan rates for miners 



 February 2023: Released zcashd<a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-4-0/"> 5.4.0</a> to introduce a number of performance improvements, an update to correct supply reporting, and a clean up of legacy features and support functionality to improve ongoing maintenance of the codebase 



 March 2023: Published an <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/update-addressing-zcash-wallet-performance-issues/">update and release schedule</a> calling for an end to Emergency Mode by the end of May 



 April 2023: ECC released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-5-0/">5.5.0</a> with the completed transaction-fee-structure change (ZIP 317) and infrastructure improvements that laid the groundwork for 5.6.0. 



 May 2023: (Restructuring at ECC) Pushed the release date for zcashd 5.6.0, lightwalletd, and SDKs to mid-June. As zcashd 5.5.0 began to be adopted by miners on the network, the fee structure changes began to blunt the efficacy of the sandblasting attack, reducing the rate of blockchain growth and wallet scanning load. 



 June 2023: Released <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-6-0/">zcashd 5.6.0</a>, introducing the functionality necessary for light wallets to access spendable funds without fully scanning the blockchain; included updates to address issues related to the ZIP-317 implementation and privacy policy features. 



 July 2023: Lightwalletd 0.4.14 was released, which meant the mobile wallet SDK was the only outstanding piece in ECC’s plan to resolve wallet performance issues and exit Emergency Mode. At this point, we had hoped to release the SDKs in mid-July. 



 August 2023: By the end of July, the adoption of zcashd 5.5.0 by the network was complete, and network transaction load had returned to pre-NU5 levels. However, the accumulated chain data to this point still presented a problem for wallet scanning, and so to mitigate this issue ECC announced the pre-release availability of the Spend before Sync capability in our mobile SDKs and made this functionality available to wallet developers for testing. Several bugs and UX issues were discovered. Timeline for the SDK releases was shifted to mid-September. 



 September 2023: New bugs, UX issues, and dependencies arose that pushed the SDKs release date out to the end of September. 



 Sept. 26, 2023: ECC <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/all-ecc-teams-focused-on-wallet-performance/42860/162">released the updated mobile SDK 2.0</a> for both iOS and Android developers. This was the final deliverable for exiting Emergency Mode. 



 Nov. 1, 2023: After a month in production, no related, major wallet issues were reported and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/wallet-performance-issues-resolved-ecc-exiting-emergency-mode/">ECC declared an exit from Emergency Mode</a>. 
 



<p>The culmination of our sandblasting response was that third-party Zcash wallets were working again, and future attackers were further disadvantaged.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this time, ECC released multiple updates to zcashd and lightwalletd, plus new mobile SDKs that, together, introduced new innovations (and learning) in the world of cryptography and decentralized money. These releases provide massive upgrades to privacy, scalability, and user experience in Zcash, and they have implications for all privacy-focused crypto projects.</p>



 



 The work continues 



<p>NU5 and the sandblasting attack consumed nearly three years. But faced with organized adversity, competing emergencies, and community criticism (some of it warranted), ECC did not stray from our commitment to build. With allies along the way, the community overcame unprecedented technical challenges and resource constraints to make Zcash more resilient, reliable, and safe.</p>



<p>We learned a lot, and although we’d love to step back and take a break, we know the work is more important now than ever. We look forward to distilling the lessons from these experiences in the upcoming retrospective, and we’re honored to continue the effort to build for economic freedom and a world-class Zcash user experience.</p>

  Black Holes and the Intelligence Explosion  <p>Extreme scenarios of AI focus on what is logically possible rather than what is physically possible. What does physics have to say about AI risk?</p>   
	By Dan Roberts	 

Published December 7, 2023
  



 
<p>For better or for worse, physicists will try to understand things that are not obviously physics, with physics. As a <a href="https://danintheory.com/">physicist-turned-AI-founder-and-researcher</a>, I liked to imagine black holes as computers. (In some sense, they’re the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound">largest</a> and maybe the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/49">fastest</a> kind.) In this essay, we consider whether some very special computers will become black holes before they become gods.</p>



 Rising machines 



<p>Artificial intelligence has been a part of speculative fiction long before there was a specific genre called science fiction. AI has also been a part of computer science (though not exclusively so) for (almost) as long as there have been computers. In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop coined the name “artificial intelligence” for the study of machines that think like humans, and set out to solve the task in a <a href="https://raysolomonoff.com/dartmouth/boxa/dart564props.pdf">single summer</a>.1 &nbsp;That didn’t really work out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">as planned</a>.</p>



<p>One peculiar thing about progress in artificial intelligence is that the science is far outpaced by the technology: AI is still a “black box” that produces magical results such as winning Go moves, poker bluffs, emotional poems, compelling stories and stunning images. It’s easy to read about how to build such a system—though good luck actually doing so without a huge amount of capital and engineering talent—but nobody knows why, for example, a chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT produces this sentence and not that sentence when given a particular prompt.</p>



<p>But if AI is magic, then it can literally do anything … within the realm of logical possibility. Such possibilities include, according to some whose views are becoming <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">increasingly</a> <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">mainstream</a>, eliminating all biological life on earth.</p>



<p>How can we possibly evaluate these claims? If AI is a black box, how do we know what’s possible? <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-joe-biden-mission-impossible-ai-tech-order-1850980643">How do we separate sci-fi trope from scientific truth?</a></p>



 
 <p>No, seriously, in their above-linked proposal, they say, “We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems [of how to make machines think like humans] if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”</p>   
 



 Simulated in our universe 



<p>To start, I think that AI systems are not black boxes and can be understood in the same way that we understand any other physical system—through physics!</p>



<p>Okaaaay, you say, what does the abstract AI model that implements ChatGPT have to do with, say, the thermodynamics of the gas inside a room?</p>



<p>(It’s really funny and great that you picked that particular comparison to physics, I’d say!2)</p>



<p>To determine the properties of the collective gas in the room—its thermodynamics—from the underlying motion of the ~1025 or so gas molecules—their statistical mechanics—we needed physical intuition and a set of mathematical tools. Together, these let us zoom out of the microscopic perspective—where we keep track of their individual positions and velocities—to derive macroscopic features—like temperature, volume and entropy.</p>



<p>Another type of microscopically complicated system is the deep neural network (DNN) architecture that underlies recent successful AI models. These models are built from taking a simple but programmable mathematical operation—the artificial neuron—arranging them in layers to perform many such operations in parallel—and then stacking many layers in series to get a complicated function that can, if asked, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712">write a play</a> proving the infinitude of primes in the style of Shakespeare. In this case, the microscopic description of the DNN is the literal code that the AI programmer writes, specifying how input is transformed to output.</p>



<p>For a language model, the text is broken up into pieces called tokens that loosely correspond to words; each token is mapped into a high-dimensional vector; the sequence of high-dimensional vectors are mixed up, re-weighted and biased in various ways according to the precise numerical values of the model’s parameters that are learned over the course of a training process; and finally, the model determines a probability distribution over all possible next words given the input and can generate a new word by sampling from that distribution. However, that code is the answer to the how question—how is an output computed from this input—but not the why question—why this output and not another for this input?</p>



<p>This description of how a chatbot works is like the following (microscopic) way of thinking about the pressure exerted by a gas: pressure is force per area; each individual gas molecule imparts a force on the wall every time it randomly collides with the wall; so, we can understand pressure by tracking the position and velocity of every gas molecule in the room, track their collisions with the walls, and add up all the forces. Analogously, this answers the how question for the gas—how does pressure arise—but not the why question—why does pressure rise when the temperature increases?</p>



<p>To answer the why questions, what we found—and, to be clear, by we here I mean historical physicists—is that for some types of microscopically complicated systems, simple macro-level descriptions emerge as the number of the elementary components of the system grows very large. (For example, we can derive the ideal gas law and show pressure is proportional to temperature by studying the distribution of velocities of the gas.) Moreover, we historical physicists were then able to find iterative refinements to these simple descriptions to understand how changing the size of these systems changes their behavior.3 (In this way, we can systematically model deviations from the ideal gas law.) It turns out, that as a complicated system with a large number of elementary components, deep neural networks also have precisely the right properties that enable such a physics-inspired approach to help us understand why they work as they do.4</p>



<p>But this is just an analogy to physics. There also is an explicit reason why physics matters for simulating an AI on a supercomputer.</p>



<p>To see why, consider that when we—and by we here I mean <a href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1726542556203483392?s=20">the people of OpenAI</a>—build ChatGPT, we need a physical object to contain ChatGPT’s parameters—the weights and biases that control the behavior of the artificial neurons in the network and thus define and implement ChatGPT—and make them available to process input prompts. This object is (vestigially) called a graphics processing unit—a GPU—and each GPU has a fixed amount of internal memory for storing the parameters of AI models.</p>



<p>To train and then run frontier AI systems like ChatGPT, you must leverage not one, but many such GPUs, organized together into a kind of supercomputer: groups of eight GPUs are assembled and connected together in a type of box called a GPU node so they can communicate at high speeds, and then GPU nodes are further stacked and connected together in a GPU cluster inside of a room known as a data center.</p>



<p>At the risk of being pedantic, let’s <a href="https://labs.openai.com/s/4VjlheyWjFRHi4yxu06nenOa">imagine</a> that that room—the data center that contains the supercomputer running ChatGPT—also contains the gas whose thermodynamics we were just discussing. As anyone who is old enough to have bought a GPU for its original purpose—gaming—knows, GPUs come with fans because they generate a lot of heat. Needless to say, thermodynamics of the gas inside a data center is very much impacted by running ChatGPT!</p>



<p>In other words, AI systems are physical objects, and AI inference plays out in physical space. As such, all purported superintelligences are ultimately subject to the physical limits of computation. That’s the main point of this essay.</p>



 
 One could say that the proverbial “black box” was originally just a (black) box of gas… 



 In physics, this goes by the name of the renormalization group, which is a kind of physical refinement and extension of the central limit theorem in math/statistics. 



 For some details, check out this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00008">essay,</a> and for a full blueprint of this approach, check out this <a href="https://deeplearningtheory.com/">book.</a>   
 
 







 
 Collapse into a black hole 



<p>To see why this matters, I want you to now take a moment and imagine an AGI with access to unbounded computational resources. To those worried about the risk such systems may pose to humankind, this thought experiment is often tantamount to imagining an all-powerful <a href="https://ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2">god</a> that can do anything. For instance:</p>



 
 It could be an information oracle—the ultimate successor to Google—as it would encapsulate and reason about the sum total of human knowledge.5 



 It could be used to “solve” science and create new technologies that we can hardly imagine. 



 It could escape the confines of your laptop by using the internet to synthesize artificial life.6 



 It could capture you inside the confines of your laptop by simulating you so accurately that you’d have no objective way of knowing whether you’re the physical you or the simulated you… and then torture that simulation to make you do its bidding. Maybe it creates one billion such simulations, making it near certain that the you having subjective conscious experiences is being simulated?7&nbsp; 



 (I’ll patiently wait here while you ask ChatGPT for a continuation.) 
 



<p>Where did this list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumping_the_shark">jump the shark</a> for you? As for me, rather than enumerating the possibilities of god, I started by imagining a black hole.</p>



<p>Lurking at the very extreme of any physical system lie black holes. Try to pack too much stuff—matter or energy—into any fixed volume, and you’ll find yourself a black hole; try to gather a large enough collection of identical objects together, and you’ll also find yourself a black hole. Although it may not be intuitive, this also places a limit on the amount of computation you can put together in any region of space.</p>



<p>To see why, consider what would have to happen if we scaled up our AGI system towards unbounded computation: as our hypothetical AGI becomes larger, we’ll need more and more GPUs to physically run it. This means constructing more and more GPU nodes, and networking them together in increasingly bigger GPU clusters.</p>



<p>So, how big of a GPU supercomputer can we—and by we here I mean literally anyone, whether humanly or artificially intelligent—actually make?</p>



 
 And it would not hallucinate facts or sources when providing responses. 



 Example from Yudkowsky’s recent Time <a href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">essay,</a> where he suggests that “to visualize a hostile superhuman AI …[v]isualize an entire alien civilization, thinking at millions of times human speeds …allowing an AI initially confined to the internet to build artificial life forms or bootstrap straight to postbiological molecular manufacturing.” 



 See e.g. this short <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/c5GHf2kMGhA4Tsj4g/the-ai-in-a-box-boxes-you">post</a> by Stuart Armstrong, or perhaps watch some <a href="https://streamberry.tv/">Streamberry.</a> 
 



 Bounding computation 



<p>Untangling various network cables and contemplating a bound, let’s consider the interplay of economic limitations, technological limitations and, finally, physical limitations.</p>



<p>As anyone working in AI right now knows, procuring GPUs is extremely difficult, so even an order for only a finite number of GPUs will still take an undefined amount of time to materialize. These supply issues are of course not fundamental obstructions to building, but they do point to the heart of economic issues in scaling: how much of the world’s resources can actually be put to training a single AI model?</p>



<p>Estimates for the cost of supercomputers capable of training the current state-of-the-art LLMs are of order $100M. If the next-generation cluster <a href="https://twitter.com/pfau/status/1644741636172251137?s=20">costs $1B</a>, how many more generations remain? Sure, some very big (as in tech) corporations will be able to spend $10B, though beyond that, there are only ~150 companies globally with a market cap above $100B, and today’s biggest company, Apple, has a market cap of (only) ~$3T. Beyond even that, while the U.S. government can command more resources than an Elon Musk—though let us ignore the near-impossible amount of coordination it would take to incorporate frontier AI efforts into a functioning government institution—$100B–$1T is a likely overall U.S. maximum.8 Even so, imagine that we—and by we here I mean literally everyone—band together and devote all economic productivity towards building the biggest computer, there’s still not much room until we surpass the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD">gross world product </a>(which itself just crossed $100T in 2022). Altogether, this points to roughly 2-3 non-government iterations left (e.g., OpenAI can release GPT-6 or 7), or 5 all-in-world iterations left, before the end of economic scaling.</p>



<p>Ignoring the economics for the moment, couldn’t we in principle just keep making our supercomputers faster? Following the current gradient of innovation, we can see this strategy at work both at the level of the GPU—where we’ve been squeezing more and more transistors together on the same chip—and at the level of the cluster—where we’ve been networking together more and more GPUs in increasingly larger data centers.9 However, trends of smaller transistors and larger clusters are powered by breakthroughs in technology—stacks of innovations that enable us to engineer smaller transistors or efficiently power and connect clusters of GPUs—that are increasingly on a collision course with fundamental limits of physics.</p>



<p>While it’s more difficult to do in-context napkin-math as we did two paragraphs ago, we can give some intuition. The driving inspiration for faster GPUs is Moore’s law, one version of which—the empirical observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles roughly every two years—has held since its first observation in 1965.10 Unfortunately, such observations are likely to be discontinued: <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">estimates</a> predict that transistors made of silicon can be shrunk only by an additional factor of four before the hot environment of the GPU will begin to create computational errors.11</p>



<p>Moore’s-over, making bigger clusters is more than simply stacking server racks in bigger and bigger buildings: each node needs to be properly powered and cooled and networked.12 The <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/03/06/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/">interconnections</a> between GPUs are an essential technology of the supercomputer, since each GPU needs to communicate with every other GPU for a supercomputer-sized AI model to function. Note though that as the earthly footprint of any cluster grows, the typical distance between GPUs is growing with the square-root of that footprint (e.g. the typical linear dimension of the data center): thus, regardless of how good interconnect technology becomes, “<a href="https://www.wired.com/1996/08/id/">the speed of light sucks,</a>” and latency is unavoidable in any superbrain.</p>



<p>So at some point (soon) we’ll reach a bound of how transformer-dense a chip can be, and putting more transformer-dense material together in the same room may not help us because the different parts of that material will be increasingly separated in space, making it harder and harder for it to communicate internally. Perhaps we can account for the former limitation by replacing transistors—e.g., move from electronics to photonics—or maybe we can somehow address the latter constraint by inventing better distributed computing algorithms? Now as computational optimists, let’s say we—and by we here I mean … you know what, I suppose that by we here I mean an actual superintelligent AGI—redirected our entire economy to further scaling the AI, converted all of our natural resources—perhaps <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">literally the planet</a>—into GPUs, and remedied the technical limitations above. What then?</p>



<p>Unfortunately there’s still a terminal point to this kind of scaling due to a more fundamental kind of physics: if you put enough GPUs together, eventually something very surprising is going to happen; they’re going to collapse into a black hole!13 &nbsp;The gravitational attraction of each of the GPU servers to one another is outrageously tiny, but, if you stick roughly 1037 of them together, they will eventually matter in a very serious way.14</p>



 
 As a point of comparison, the entire U.S. Department of Defense <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3326875/department-of-defense-releases-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-defense-budget">budget</a> for 2024 is (only) $842B. 



 N.B. there are also gradient-free, if you will, <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">innovations</a> to pay attention to. 



 An alternate version of Moore’s law—which observes that every two years the number of transistors doubles at the lowest price per transistor—has already <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/03/the-transistor-cliff">broken down.</a> 



 In technical terms, this is the scale at which <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/apl/article/106/19/193503/27706/The-fundamental-downscaling-limit-of-field-effect">thermodynamic fluctuations</a> will begin to dominate. 



 Okay here’s some in-footnote napkin-math: a state-of-the-art GPU node (Nvidia’s DGX H100) uses about <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">10 kilowatts</a> of power; ignoring all the other power needs of the data center—e.g., cooling—a cluster of a million such nodes (8,000,000 GPUs)—roughly ~360x larger than the largest <a href="https://inflection.ai/inflection-ai-announces-1-3-billion-of-funding">publicly known</a> AI cluster and a naive sticker price of ~$500B—would require the amount of power needed at peak by all of NYC in the summer. (See, e.g., Table I-3a, Zone J, <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/2226333/2022-Gold-Book-Final-Public.pdf/cd2fb218-fd1e-8428-7f19-df3e0cf4df3e">here.</a>) Generating and delivering even that lower-bounded amount of power would be extremely nontrivial. 



 More in-footnote napkin-math: one of Nvidia’s <a href="https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-dgx-systems/ai-enterprise-dgx">DGX H100 servers</a> contains 8 GPUs, has a volume of 0.15 m3, and weighs 130 kg. Meanwhile, the Schwarzschild radius Rs = 2GNM relates the mass of a black hole to its radius, where Rs is the Schwarzschild radius, M is the mass, and GN = 6.67 × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 is Newton’s gravitational constant. If you try to pack enough mass into a small enough region with linear dimensions R such that R/M = 2GN, you will form a black hole. For any collection of N objects of constant density, the mass of the collection scales like N, but the radius of the collection scales like N1/3. Thus, R/M ~N−2/3, and you will always eventually form a black hole by increasing the number of objects in your collection.&nbsp; 



 For comparison, GPT-4 was trained on an order of only 104 GPUs. I hope it’s obvious, but not even the biggest AGI <a href="https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets">accelerationist</a> is likely to bet on the actual existence of 1037 GPUs. 
 



 Practically speaking 



<p>1037 GPUs is a lot. So is 1036. (And so is 101, if you’re a startup, and 100 if you’re just a person. GPUs are expensive.) So what?</p>



<p>Is there anything on our list of unbounded-compute god-like AGI powers above that we expect is limited at 1036 GPUs but permitted at 1037 GPUs?</p>



<p>Items (i) and (ii) are the entire point of investing in AI today. It would be a tragedy if they were not possible. LLMs with the right guardrails and retrieval abilities already are information oracles. Given that humans can reason and do science—some of us without even any GPUs(!)—it’s not clear that a scaling bound from physics will limit AI.15</p>



<p>The <a href="https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/">original AI doomer concern</a> is born out of the idea of an <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065245808604180">intelligence explosion</a>: future AGI systems will have a general intelligence that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems; thus, these AGI systems will design future AGI system that can do everything humans do, including designing AGI systems…</p>



<p>This idea is sometimes called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/recursive-self-improvement">recursive self-improvement</a>; it’s really just the basic idea that investments—in this case, in intelligence—compound exponentially.</p>



<p>The point of this discussion is really just to illustrate the point that there’s no such thing as unbounded computation. This cycle will stop. All aspiring AGIs and their companies are first subject to practical constraints on computation—such as raising an enormous amount of capital to build or access a supercomputer—but even if those “prosaic” limitations are overcome, any derived AGI systems are ultimately subject to a variety of fundamental physical constraints.16</p>



<p>So, does a physical limit of computation perspective on AI matter in practice?</p>



 
 If your conception of AI is as new technology—perhaps even the most incredibly transformative technology—then, I think, likely no. 



 If your conception of AI is creating an infinitely powerful god (or maybe summoning a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzb_CSRO-0g">demon)</a>—a technology that may as well be unbounded magic—then, I think, likely yes. 
 



 
 For items (iii) and (iv), I really don’t know. We—you and me(!?)—should do some physics calculations and find out! 



 Not to mention any <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">“artificial” compute bounds</a> that may be put in place. 
 



 Cutting tails 



<p>By discussing a limit and embedding it in physics, I hope to differentiate between AI—the technology—from AI—the religion. Of course, if you are worried about an infinitely-powerful AGI god, then (self-consistent) fiction shapes your thinking about AI: anything permitted by logic raises a valid concern. My point is that that’s far too broad: thoughtful applications of physical constraints can cut off the very long tail of AI risk and restrict us to a more limited set of outcomes.17&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limited, but not any less crucial. For this reason, I think we should focus on the costs and benefits of AI as we would other revolutionary technologies, rather than treating it as something mythical. Demoting AI from god to tech, from religion to science, still leaves us the ability to accelerate both technology and science—right up to the limits imposed by the laws of physics. In other words, the really exciting outcome from our list of (i)-(v) above is the one where we build a toolfor scientific reasoning.</p>



<p>To get there, we’ll need new ideas that go beyond <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">pure compute scaling</a>. For researchers, for engineers, and for founders, that’s a (scientific) reason to be optimistic.</p>



 
 Just so we are clear, we are not claiming that a superintelligent AI would, as a cartoon villain set on world domination, choose to ignore the laws of physics and hubristically find itself confined in a black hole. On the one hand, this would certainly be very funny and a hilarious failure mode for any AI that aspires to commit malfeasance via item (iii) above. On the other hand, if you attempted item (v), as I did, you might have noticed that nowhere among ChatGPT’s very imaginatively-boring answers does it make this point; the current AI is blissfully unaware that its successors may be limited by physics. On our third hand, at the very least we may assume that some future chatbots may read this essay…

<p>COPY FROM BELOW THIS LINE TO VERIFY SIGNATURE BELOW</p><p>One of the first and most important things to announce is that no funds on the Verus network or in Verus wallets were compromised due to this attack, as they were not subject to the vulnerabilities this hacker group exploited. We hope that the hackers were unable to fool anyone into giving up the funds from their Metamask or other Web wallets and that the criminals’ efforts resulted in a negative&nbsp;return.</p><p>This should be a cautionary tale for any communities using Discord, and we will detail what we experienced, in hopes that it might prevent another Discord community from experiencing the same or similar issues. The hackers used a Discord session hijack vulnerability that is currently in use across some notorious hacking groups along with social engineering to inflict significant damage on the Discord server where the Verus community spends much of its time when coordinating. These attacks had no effect on the Verus network, and although the hackers did get control of the Discord server, they did not need to get full control or credentials for any account to inflict their damage on the Discord server. We believe the attack could easily have been cut short immediately if Discord could improve their false positive account disablement as well as their response time to critical support requests.</p><p>What we have determined so&nbsp;far:</p><p>1. The group targeted me and worked to establish trust as journalists for weeks, always persistent, never pushy. After working with me on an article, where I contributed the following content (<a href="https://medium.com/@michaeltoutonghi/what-inspired-the-creation-of-verus-coin-and-how-long-has-it-been-in-development-12731aaa9be4">Verus Article from&nbsp;Hack</a>).</p><p>2. After they said they had completed their article, they worked for 2 days on getting me to accept a content release form, even rewriting it after I refused to agree to their first&nbsp;version.</p><p>3. Once they rewrote it, I clicked a link from their Discord server, and although they weren’t able to get login credentials, they exploited a session hijack link, and immediately went to&nbsp;work.</p><p>4. After they had my account, which had setup the Discord server so many years ago, under their control, they kicked off all admins, installed their own admins, and did something that Discord would have to help explain that got Discord to instantly ban my account, the only one besides Discord that could have kicked them&nbsp;off.</p><p>5. Since then, they started announcing scam links, claiming fraudulent giveaways with Ethereum tokens backed by Verus on websites that if someone with a Metamask or similar wallet engages with, there is a risk of taking assets from them on Ethereum or possibly other networks, not&nbsp;Verus.</p><p>6. We still have not heard from or gotten help from Discord Support since this event began, except that they banned my account, and to our knowledge the scammers are still in the old Verus Discord server attempting to scam an ever dwindling group of members who haven’t left by&nbsp;now.</p><p>7. If you know anyone in the old Discord, please inform them to leave the Discord asap and not engage in any of the announcements, as they are made by impersonators, while people trying to warn are banned and the original admins are locked out of the&nbsp;server.</p><p>8. My old Discord ID is now disabled by Discord, and I no longer have access to our conversations. My new account is miketout.vrsc (this ID), which is not the owner of this Discord, and we have implemented a set of processes for all Discord admins to prevent any such event from occurring again.</p><p>Since the Verus Community is much more than a Discord Server, though we still haven’t found a more suitable engagement platform for the way the community works, a number of people have worked to create and secure a new community Discord Server, and we welcome all Verus Community members and well meaning interested people to&nbsp;join.</p><p>Though we are still hoping to have a conversation with Discord about the hack and how they could improve their security to prevent this for all of their user communities in the future, we have taken steps independently to harden the Verus Discord community in a way that would prevent such an attack in the future, even if the link click session hijack exploit is not resolved. We also have even better security thoughts for the future around leveraging VerusID in easy, meaningful ways. If you have experience writing Discord bots and especially secure servers, please get in touch. Until then, we hope you will rejoin or join the Verus Community’s Discord server and the worldwide, unlimited scale, fully decentralized blockchain protocol conversation.</p><p>Get an invite for the new Verus Discord Community Server: <a href="https://verus.io/discord">https://verus.io/discord</a></p><p>COPY UNTIL THE END OF THE LINE ABOVE THIS&nbsp;ONE</p><p>This article is signed by my ID, mike@ on the Verus network with the following signature:</p><p>AX8OKwABQSBhYU0ShQsu6LSRVay8IY7avMhoy3ub8jhznZnlhD5nGRE4h4U5MEWiPg+DXGJRSXd3bWou5TfNHn/zEPfbMA7d</p><p>(if you are using Safari or possibly another browser, you may need this signature, as the copy comes out a bit different):</p><p>AZAOKwABQSCaekvVN3CBbneot9AHby8S0+YCYevJDSfps3iaML8BF0j9PMdO/37JYxHbuDy/R11hWe9tCI5AInjppcQhQ3hD</p><p>You can verify my signature on any Verus node or lite mode API, by copying the article between the instructions above and entering the ID as mike@ and the signature above to check.

 Introduction <p>Did you know that besides being able to mine XLA, you can also be rewarded for providing liquidity on our exchanges? Moreover, by doing so, you contribute to making our order books much healthier and more attractive.</p><p>Actively contributing liquidity to our exchanges allows you to play a crucial role in strengthening and sustaining a stable and highly efficient trading environment for Scala. This active involvement enhances market depth and reduces the risk of sudden price fluctuations, ensuring that XLA’s value remains steady and supports smooth trading experiences.</p> What is a liquidity pool? <p>A liquidity pool refers to a collectively sourced pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked within an exchange, serving the purpose of facilitating trades between different assets. In contrast to traditional markets with distinct buyers and sellers, liquidity pools utilize automated market maker algorithms (AMM), enabling the automatic trading of digital assets through the utilization of these pools. The primary objective of liquidity pools is to address the issue of illiquid markets by encouraging users to contribute cryptocurrency liquidity in exchange for a portion of the trading fees. Unlike traditional trading, utilizing liquidity pools eliminates the need for matching buyers and sellers, allowing users to seamlessly exchange their tokens and assets using the liquidity provided by other&nbsp;users.</p> What exchanges support liquidity pools? <p>Liquidity Pools for Scala are currently supported on these exchanges:</p>  Xeggex: <a href="https://xeggex.com/markets">https://xeggex.com/markets</a>  NonKYC: <a href="https://nonkyc.io/markets">https://nonkyc.io/markets</a>   Earn profits for providing liquidity <p>By participating as a liquidity provider, users have the potential to receive a portion of the trading fees generated within the pool, creating a steady stream of income. Furthermore, users can seize the opportunity to accrue daily profits, which are automatically credited to their AMM accounts.</p> Risks <p>Impermanent Loss</p><p>Assets held in the AMM Account will be incorporated into the liquidity pool for automated market making. Potential impermanent losses may arise due to fluctuations in asset prices, leading to changes in the ratio of the two assets with the price movements. As the price ratio eventually reverts, impermanent losses gradually diminish, and users can ultimately realize profits from participating in liquidity provision.</p><p>Trusting a third-party</p><p>Storing funds on an exchange always involves risk, as it entails trusting a third-party platform with your assets. We advise against keeping substantial amounts on any exchange and instead suggest securely storing them in one of Scala’s official&nbsp;wallets.</p> How to add liquidity <p>Note: The steps to add liquidity are the same for Xeggex and NonKYC, as they share the same user interface. For this guide, we will use&nbsp;Xeggex.</p><p>Step 1</p><p>Visit <a href="https://xeggex.com/markets">Xeggex</a> or <a href="https://nonkyc.io/markets">NonKYC</a> official website and log in to your account. Click on ‘Liquidity Pools’ in the drop-down menu of the main&nbsp;menu.</p><p>Step 2</p><p>Select the trading pair for which you want to add liquidity, for example, XLA/BTC, then click on “Add Liquidity”.</p><p>Step 3</p><p>Enter the amount of XLA you want to add as liquidity. The amount of the other cryptocurrency (BTC in this case) will be calculated automatically.</p><blockquote>Make sure you have enough XLA and BTC in your account, otherwise, the “Add Liquidity” button will be disabled. If not, you need to deposit the required funds on the exchange and then try&nbsp;again.</blockquote><p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully provided liquidity to the XLA/BTC pair and can now begin earning rewards. We look forward to having numerous Scalanauts contribute to creating a more robust and liquid order&nbsp;book.</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/add-liquidity-and-get-rewarded-4795fdf2f292">Add liquidity and get rewarded</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The integration is supported by an automated liquidity management protocol, ICHI Vault, that enables simple yield opportunities on day one for all users on EON. &nbsp; 



<p>The Horizen ecosystem is excited to announce its integration with <a href="https://docs.ascent.exchange/">Ascent Exchange</a> with simple yield opportunities via <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vault</a>. This integration is set to significantly enhance the <a href="https://eon.horizen.io">Horizen EON</a> platform’s capabilities in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, bringing a new level of innovation and efficiency to the industry.</p>



 A New Chapter in DeFi: Horizen EON Meets Ascent Exchange 



<p>This integration represents a major step forward for the Horizen EON ecosystem. By joining forces with Ascent Exchange, Horizen EON leverages Ascent’s expertise in decentralized exchange operations, propelling our platform to new heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This integration allows for more seamless and secure trading experiences, facilitating asset and information transfer across the blockchain network. Moreover, this integration underlines a shared vision for a unified and interoperable digital asset ecosystem, where decentralized applications (dApps) can flourish across various platforms.</p>



<a href="https://ascent.exchange"></a>



<blockquote>
<p></p>



<p>“Our integration with Ascent Exchange is a testament to Horizen EON’s commitment to interoperability and resilience in the blockchain ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent’s expertise, coupled with Horizen’s EVM-compatible platform, marks a significant milestone towards creating a more interconnected and robust DeFi ecosystem. </p>



<p>Ascent Exchange’s early adoption of the Horizen EON platform is set to redefine the DeFi trading space.”&nbsp;</p>
– Rob Viglione, Co-founder of Horizen and CEO of Horizen Labs.</blockquote>



 Simple Yield Opportunities on Ascent Exchange via ICHI Vaults 



  
<p>Ascent Exchange was launched on day one with the support of an automated liquidity management protocol called <a href="https://ichi.org/">ICHI Vaults</a>. </p>



<p>This will enable liquidity providers to earn yield with their favorite tokens on Ascent Exchange. Each ICHI Vault allows a depositor to deposit a single token which will then be used as liquidity in an underlying liquidity pool. The Vault prioritizes deposit token yield while protecting from impermanent loss. ICHI Vaults will be launched for a wide range of assets supported by Ascent Exchange.</p>
 <a href="https://ichi.org/"></a> 



 The Ascent Exchange Impact on Horizen EON 



<p>The integration of Ascent Exchange into the Horizen EON ecosystem is expected to bring numerous benefits. As the first decentralized exchange with ve(3,3) tokenomics on Horizen EON, Ascent Exchange is poised to establish a new benchmark in DeFi trading. This strategic move by Ascent Exchange is anticipated to attract a substantial volume of trading activities and users, thereby reinforcing Horizen EON’s position as a leading platform for developers and DeFi enthusiasts.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“As Ascent Exchange embarks on its journey with Horizen EON. We are positioned at the forefront of decentralized exchanges, leveraging a first-mover advantage that sets the stage for unparalleled innovation. </p>



<p>Horizen EON’s exceptional scalability and efficiency empower us to process an increased volume of transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, revolutionizing our operational capabilities. Fundamental to our ethos, the robust security protocols of Horizen EON ensure an unwaveringly secure and trustworthy environment for our users. Embracing the shared values of decentralization and innovation, we join hands with the vibrant Horizen community, further enriching our community-centric approach. </p>



<p>This pivotal shift not only reflects our evolution but also embodies our commitment to exploring new horizons in decentralized finance, inviting our community to be a part of this exciting journey.”</p>
-Bones, Founding member of Ascent Exchange</blockquote>

  Partnering with Squint: Instructions for the Real World  <p>Devin and his team are bringing cutting-edge AR to the factory floor.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a>

Team Squint



 
<p>Every once in a while, technology brings us a magical moment of delight. I remember the first time I used an Apple AirTag. The navigational arrows, haptic feedback and “10 ft away” message created a simple, intuitive way to find my erstwhile keys—and effectively bridged the gap between my mobile device and the real world.&nbsp;</p>



Magic



<p>Squint brings that same Apple-like magic to industrial work. Much in the same way an AirTag can help you find your keys, Squint is a mobile app for the industrial floor—that shows workers step-by-step instructions for how to use machinery.</p>



More magic, on the factory floor



<p>Imagine you’re a worker in a high-stakes industrial setting, navigating a maze of complex equipment on a factory floor. You’ve just been asked to switch production lines because the factory is understaffed, but you’re not familiar with the new machine you need to use. Your options are: a) ask the worker who’s been at the factory for 10 years and knows how to use everything—but they’re super busy, b) read the paper manual—but it’s buried in a binder in the storage room and difficult to find, or c) just wing it—but that could be dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Squint, you have a better option: simply point your mobile device at the equipment to get instant help. Teams can document and record every step of an important procedure, then the app guides workers through it in the real world, augmented with video and all the institutional knowledge they need to do their jobs effectively and safely. You can even use it to check logs, leave notes for the next shift and report maintenance issues. It’s the digital equivalent of the person who’s been at the factory for 10 years, hovering over your shoulder, helping you out.</p>







<p>As America faces an industrial labor shortage, Squint also offers a sorely needed boost in manufacturing productivity and worker retention. Manufacturing is the nation’s fifth largest employment category and growing, as more companies move operations to the U.S. from Asia. However, a quarter of industrial workers are older than 55 and will soon retire, leaving a widening skill gap behind. To bridge it, companies including Colgate-Palmolive, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Michelin, JTEKT, Siemens and Volvo are using Squint to train and retain employees, increase productivity and ensure safety. Colgate-Palmolive, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhGSvkapruc">found</a> procedures were completed 50% faster with Squint—regardless of a worker’s experience level with the equipment. They also saw greater accuracy and reduced training times, and unlocked new insights through Squint’s built-in analytics.</p>



<p>When I first met Squint founder and CEO Devin Bhushan in 2015, he was a 23-year-old software engineer at Yahoo, tasked with writing the Flurry mobile app all by himself. Despite having no prior iOS experience, he did just that—and helped Yahoo’s customers understand their product analytics. He later joined Splunk, where he led the mobile AR team that made data visible for industrial companies. There, he was inundated by requests from customers to see not just their Splunk data, but all their data—and thus Squint was born. Devin’s experience across mobile, AR and product analytics makes him uniquely suited to lead Squint and pioneer this new category of software.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia had the privilege of leading Squint’s $3.5M seed round earlier this year, and we got a front-row seat to the team’s incredible pace of progress when Devin and founding PM Dylan Conway joined us for Sequoia <a href="http://arc.sequoiacap.com">Arc</a>, our catalyst for pre-seed and seed-stage companies. Over the last six months, Squint’s tremendous market pull gave us the conviction to lean in and lead the Series A.</p>



Squint Founding PM Dylan Conway and Founder and CEO Devin Bhushan at Sequoia Arc



<p>We’re thrilled to be in business with Devin and his team, and excited for the possibilities they’ll continue to unlock with AR and AI. While today Squint is focused on industrial use cases, we can imagine the app someday becoming the instruction manual for any device or place—from your new coffee maker or camera to your Airbnb stay. This is only the beginning for Squint, and we’re excited to be their partners for the journey ahead.</p>

<p>Phone numbers are pervasive and continue to proliferate as digital identifiers. In many ways, they are a person’s most personal digital identifier. However, the traditional framework doesn’t allow users to have true ownership of their numbers, and hence, their primary digital identities. Given that phone numbers are allocated by centralized entities, securing a number often means disclosing personal information, thereby posing a risk to individual privacy.</p><p>This conventional setup is susceptible to SIM swapping attacks, a rising concern as highlighted by the FBI. In fact, the number of SIM swap fraud cases <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220208">increased by 400% year over year since 2020</a>. according to a report by the Federal Trade Commission. Such scenarios have led to numerous high-profile thefts, particularly targeting crypto assets and hijacking prominent social media accounts to mislead followers.</p><p>Moreover, the existing reliance on SMS technology, which debuted over 30 years ago, is outdated and lacks security measures. The architecture remains largely unchanged, without encryption support, thus exposing messages sent via SMS to unauthorized access within a given cellular&nbsp;network.</p><p><a href="https://www.3num.co/">3NUM</a> is poised to revolutionize phone communication systems. They are developing a phone number and messaging system&nbsp;that:</p>  Ensures end-to-end encryption for secure communications.  Provides true user ownership of mobile phone numbers, fortified by public key cryptography.  Preserves privacy, enabling users to join the network without relinquishing any personally identifying information.  Maintains the confidentiality of phone numbers, preventing public disclosure.  Mitigates SIM-swapping threats as it transcends the dependency on SIM cards or centralized, vulnerable services.  Integrates with alternative identifiers like ENS, facilitating user-friendly name addressing as opposed to cumbersome multi-digit numbers.  <p>Mobile communication has become the primary modality for people to stay in touch with each other and with the important events happening around them. The time to upgrade this core infrastructure is long overdue. BlueYard is proud to support the 3NUM team in this important mission.</p>

<p>Multi-signature structures have been around for a while and are securing billions of euros in digital assets. But how do they work? And what are the main differences with a simple single-signature structure?</p>



<p>In this article we will discuss what multi-signature structures are, the use cases of multi-signature structures, and how multi-signature structures work.</p>



 What is a multi-signature structure? 



<p>In essence, a multi-signature structure is a key security feature employed within the blockchain ecosystem to ensure that specific actions require the approval and cooperation of multiple parties before they can be executed. Unlike signatures in the physical world, signatures on a blockchain are performed using digital keys belonging to a certain party.</p>



<p>Instead of relying on a single digital signature, a multi-signature structure mandates that a predefined number of authorised signatures need to happen before a transaction can be executed.</p>



<p>It is important to note that in certain cases a multi-signature structure may also refer to a structure in which an action may require only one signature but has multiple parties that can authorise this action.</p>



 Why multi-signature structures are essential 



<p>But why would anyone use a multi-signature structure in the first place? The answer is simple: security. In a digital ecosystem in which certain actions can not be undone, it is crucial that the integrity and security of these transactions is guaranteed. A multi-signature structure adds an additional security layer to the blockchain ecosystem and addresses some of the security risks of single-signature structures.</p>



 Security risks of single-signature structures 



<p>Single-signature structures, where a single key holder can perform certain actions, are susceptible to various security risks and challenges, such as:</p>



 
 Single point of failure: A single compromised key, whether due to theft, hacking, or human error, can lead to unauthorised access and the loss of digital assets. High-profile hacks and cryptocurrency thefts, such as the infamous Mt. Gox hack in 2014, have often resulted from this single point of failure, putting significant amounts of wealth at risk. 



 Lack of accountability: In a single-signature system, the responsibility and accountability for transactions and decisions rest solely on the key holder. This setup can lead to abuse of power, lack of transparency, and difficulties in tracing fraudulent or unauthorised activities. 



 Loss of keys: The loss of a single private key can result in permanent loss of access to digital assets, which is a common and irreversible issue in the cryptocurrency space. A multi-signature structure can help prevent this while also increasing security. 
 



 Use cases of multi-signature structures 



<p>As is clear from the above, single-signature structures are simple and convenient but can carry significant security risks. Multi-signature structures can address some of these risks in the following ways in various domains:</p>



 
 Secure transactions: Multi-signature structures in wallets, accounts, or smart contracts are used to secure cryptocurrency transactions, requiring the approval of multiple key holders. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorised or fraudulent transactions. 



 Governance: In corporate environments, multi-signature structures can ensure checks and balances by requiring multiple key holders to approve important actions like financial transactions, board resolutions, or contract agreements. Furthermore, they can be useful for any decentralised multi-party decision-making, such as in DAOs or for blockchain governance. 



 Escrow services: Multi-signature escrow accounts keep financial transactions safe, especially in complex deals. Funds are only released when certain conditions are met. Several key holders must agree, ensuring that the deal terms are followed. This adds an extra layer of security and trust in financial transactions, reducing the chances of disputes and fraud. 



 Custody services: Cryptocurrency custodians and exchanges use multi-signature structures to protect customer assets from threats, including insiders and hackers. With multi-signature wallets, access to assets is controlled by a group of key holders (and often third parties for added security). This makes it tough for a single person to access or manipulate the assets without approval. 



 Legal and compliance: Multi-signature structures are important for legal and compliance processes in the digital world. They ensure that multiple parties must agree on actions like signing contracts or complying with regulations. This reduces legal risks and makes sure these procedures are done correctly. Multi-signature structures promote transparency and security in legal and regulatory matters. 



 Emergency recovery: Multi-signature wallets can act as an emergency recovery mechanism, allowing access to digital assets in case of the loss of one key holder, enhancing the security of digital holdings. 
 



 Why is blockchain needed? 



<p>However, why wouldn’t you use more traditional signature-collection methods? In comparison to traditional methods like multiple Docusign signatures, blockchain offers distinct advantages, particularly in transparency, execution speed, and versatility. Docusign, while efficient for collecting signatures, lacks transparency and doesn’t tie actions directly to signing. It merely signifies approval without immediate execution.</p>



<p>Contrastingly, blockchain’s strength lies in its inherent transparency; each approval is linked to an immediate and irreversible execution of the proposed action. Whether it’s a transaction or a governance proposal, blockchain ensures swift and transparent execution, fostering trust among parties involved. Moreover, Docusign doesn’t provide flexibility in assigning different weights or thresholds for signing. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers versatile permission settings, enabling the establishment of varying levels of authorization. This flexibility extends beyond simple signature collection, making blockchain an invaluable tool for diverse transactional and governance needs within enterprises and across various industries.</p>



 How multi-signature structures work 



<p>Multi-signature structures can be created in multiple ways, such as via account systems, smart contracts, and wallets. While the set-up process for each of these ways can differ, these multi-signature structures all function in a similar way. In order to explain how multi-signature structures work, we will explain multi-signature structures using an account system that can be found on popular blockchains such as <a href="https://eosnetwork.com/">EOS</a>, <a href="https://www.wax.io/">WAX</a>, and <a href="https://xprnetwork.org/">XPR</a>.</p>



 Understanding account systems 



<p>Unlike blockchains like Bitcoin or Ripple which use a single keypair for all transactions, an account system has two different permissions. Permissions can be seen as requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for a transaction to go through. Each permission has certain actions associated with it. A default account has 2 native permissions, namely:</p>



 
 Owner: Shows ownership of the account and is needed to make any changes to the ownership of the account. 



 Active: Used for transferring funds, voting for validators, and making other high-level account changes. 
 



<p>Each permission has one or more key(s) associated with it. Each key associated with a permission has a certain weight, and each permission has a certain weight threshold which needs to be met before a transaction requiring that permission is accepted. This is how an account system works.</p>



 Single-signature structure 



<p>The default structure for these accounts is always a single signature structure. But what does that mean?</p>







<p>As can be seen in the image above, the owner permission has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. The same goes for the active permission which has a default threshold of 1, and 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it. This means that only the (private) key associated with the owner or active permission is required to perform any transaction requiring the owner or active permission, respectively.</p>



<p>In essence, similar to a Bitcoin address, only 1 signature is required to perform any action on this account. This is a single-signature structure.</p>



 Multi-signature structure 



<p>Multi-signature accounts function similarly to default accounts, the main difference between the two is the permissions structure. In a default account all permissions have a threshold of 1 and only have 1 key with a weight of 1 associated with it, whereas the permissions in a multi-signature account have a threshold of 2 or higher and have multiple keys or permissions of other accounts with (possibly) varying weights associated with them. This also means that multiple keys or account permissions will have to sign any transaction from the multi-signature account.</p>







<p>An example of a possible permissions structure in a multi-signature account can be seen in the image above. Just like the default account described earlier, this account has both the owner and active permission.</p>



<p>However, the owner permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 3 and has 3 keys associated with it: The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 2, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the owner permission, both John’s active key and either Bob’s or Stacy’s active key would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>The active permission in this multi-signature account has a threshold of 2 and has 3 keys associated with it. The active key from John’s account, which has a weight of 1, the active key from Bob’s account, which has a weight of 1 and the active key from Stacy’s account, which also has a weight of 1. This means that to execute any transaction requiring the active permission (any combination) of 2 of the active keys would have to sign the transaction before it can be executed.</p>



<p>Multi-signature structures like these can be configured in any way, with as many participants as needed, for any goal, ranging from security to governance.</p>



<p>Lastly, it is important to note that in these account systems, or smart contracts, custom permissions can be created for certain actions, such as voting, staking, etc. In order to keep the other permissions separate and secure.</p>

<p>Homo- (Greek prefix meaning ‘same’); -morphic (Greek suffix meaning ‘having a specific shape/form’)<br>Intuitively, one could deduct that homomorphic encryption indicates that the initial data and the encrypted result (cipher) could share the same form. Based on this property, it can be inferred that computation can be performed on the encrypted data, without prior decryption. By decrypting the result, you get the same output as the computation performed on the unencrypted data. While homomorphic encryption can be either additive or multiplicative, fully homomorphic encryption supports both types of operations. Unlike ZKPs, which are proofs of computational integrity, fully homomorphic encryption allows for encrypted data computation, without revealing additional information about the original data. This could provide the missing link for ensuring private transactions on blockchains’ public ledgers.</p><p>We were joined by Rand Hindi, CEO of Zama, to discuss fully homomorphic encryption solutions, how they differ from ZKPs &amp; MPC, and how they can be leveraged to ensure compliant programmable privacy.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Rand’s background and his interest in privacy  Meeting Pascal and founding Zama  Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)  Zero knowledge proofs vs. Multi-party computation vs. Fully homomorphic encryption  Taking fully homomorphic encryption 'mainstream'  Zama’s products  fhEVM  How multi-party computation would secure fhEVM  Multi-key homomorphic encryption &amp; functional encryption  Deploying an FHE rollup  FHE use cases  Privacy  Zama’s business model  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/randhindi">Rand Hindi on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zama_fhe">Zama on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FhenixIO">Fhenix on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  dYdX Foundation: The recently launched dYdX chain features new governance and token economics, that empower stakers and promote validator decentralisation.
