<p>Jason spoke with Lynn about her article for a new episode of his “If We Were Honest” series. I jumped in at the end. The three of us did a Q&amp;A when we live streamed it earlier this week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dallas has a history of significant influence in public education with the “<a href="https://www.trelease-on-reading.com/whatsnu_miracles.html">Dallas Miracle</a>” perpetuated by George W. Bush and other corporate education reformers. The lucrative ecosystem of education nonprofits and public-private partnerships relies heavily on underserved communities for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/02/how-corporations-use-public-school-workforce-pipelines-to-harvest-students-data-and-train-narrowly-skilled-exploitable-staff.html">cheap labor</a>&nbsp;to build the future&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-metaverse-texas-commission-virtual-education-lynn-davenport/?trackingId=zdWuXeyX3BB4GNO5cLOUhQ%3D%3D">Metaverse</a>. They prey upon the captive market of public school kids to train future coders and gamers. Pay close attention to words like ‘hub’ and ‘lab’ when referencing the so-called innovations, which are really just real-time experiments on children.</p>
<p>The pandemic and lockdowns served as a major boon for the esports industry with children stuck at home on devices.&nbsp;<a href="https://edtechmagazine.com/k12/article/2022/07/how-esports-helping-students-improve-their-grades-and-build-leadership-skills">EdTech Magazine</a>&nbsp;featured Richardson ISD when they wrote, “Launched online in the early days of the pandemic, the esports club not only served as a social lifeline for students in lockdown but also became the springboard for an impactful school program. Their online gameplay was so successful that when participants returned to campus full time, educators at the school doubled down on esports. They convinced&nbsp;<a href="https://web.risd.org/home/">Richardson Independent School District</a>&nbsp;leaders to build a state-of-the-art esports room that opened last fall. The school also launched a popular esports class, educating students about careers and technical skills related to the growing esports field.”</p>

<p>A friend in education sent me this message:</p>
 

 
  
 

 
<p>The answer is yes. This is all wrong. And no, you are not paranoid. The agenda to gamify education and tokenize behaviors has impacted all aspects of education.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ymcadallas.org/mobile-ymca">Mobile YMCA</a> wrote, “The Tech Hub aims to introduce children, specifically those in&nbsp;underserved areas, to the same opportunities to improve literacy in science and technology, help build critical thinking skills, and encourage them to take on a more active role in the community. The Tech Hub’s primary use is as an eSports Gaming Center on the go!”</p>
<p>There’s a major push for&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/03/18/too-big-to-map-but-i-tried/">out-of-school learning</a>, STEM themes and gaming which often appeals to dads. The nonprofits say their programs like the&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/jadallas.org/ja-dallas-bold-girls-summit/speakers/rodrigua-ross?pli=1">YMCA</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bigthought.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/creative-learning-people-and-pathways.pdf">Big Thought</a>&nbsp;will close the digital divide. Hybrid learning programs such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcSle6nTMbU&amp;t=1310s">STEMuli</a> in Dallas normalize life in a panopticon with two days in a physical building and the rest at home with their avatars being tracked by a virtual eyeball.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4OEcseMhs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4OEcseMhs</a>
<p>The data extracted from these programs feeds the insatiable appetite of collective impact and social impact investors. Services are bundled together for vulnerable children and the parents are not given informed consent for the impact data and surveillance imposed on them for digital twinning. The children are anchors and access points into at-risk families as profit centers. See this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blended-learning-for-community-based.pdf">2011 white paper</a> on the imperative of data collection in blended learning settings.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/esports-may-be-coming-to-dallas-schools-11780752">Dallas Observer article</a> they included a quote from a Dallas ISD trustee, “I’m thrilled you guys are going down this path,” said trustee Dustin Marshall, who is CEO of a logistics company and a former ranked Mortal Kombat and Warcraft player. “I think it’s great we’re meeting students where they are.”</p>
<p>Dallas has become a hub for the burgeoning industry. It’s home to id Software, creator of iconic games such as Quake and Doom, as well as Team Envy, an esports franchise funded by oil magnate&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Hersh">Kenneth Hersh</a>.”</p>
 Who is Kenneth Hersh? 
 

 
  
 

 
<p>Ken Hersh is the president and CEO of the George W. Bush Presidential Center. He is listed on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/people/kenneth-a-hersh">World Economic Forum</a>&nbsp;website. According to Wikipedia, Hersh was born in 1963 in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas,_Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>, where he spent his childhood.&nbsp;In 1969, Hersh attended the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mark%27s_School_of_Texas">St. Mark’s School of Texas</a>for both his primary and secondary education. He graduated from St. Mark’s in 1981. Hersh subsequently attended&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University">Princeton University</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey">New Jersey</a>. He then attended&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_Graduate_School_of_Business">Stanford University Graduate School of Business</a>.</p>
<p>Successful businessmen like Hersh forget they were educated in a classical model void of technology and screen addiction. They push harmful technologies on impressionable youth while they celebrate victory with their experimental investments. The expansion of education technology increased after Bush’s No Child Left Behind which baked in Reading Response to Intervention (RTI) software and companies like <a href="https://archive.ph/IZanz">Istation</a> were waiting in the wings until the bill was signed in 2002. By 2003, Istation was being piloted in all major urban school districts in Texas. Dallas Morning News featured Istation in 2018, “Dallas billionaire Dick Collins is building a digital curriculum that makes learning language and math skills as&nbsp;captivating as playing video games&nbsp;and measuring student success a snap for teachers.”</p>
<p>Buckminster Fuller and Buckyballs</p>
 

 
  
 

 
<p>My mom told me about a book a co-worker gave her in the 90s called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Dangers-Rainbow-Movement-Barbarism/dp/091031103X">The Hidden Dangers of The Rainbow</a>&nbsp;by Constance Cumbey. In it Cumbey talks about Buckminster Fuller. She said, “Books by&nbsp;Buckminster Fuller&nbsp;clearly spell out an intent to give every world resident a number and require the usage of this number in all financial transactions of any sort including minor purchases – with a universal “credit card.” The Movement has also been promoting the establishment of gigantic global agencies for controlling the distribution of food and other vital resources. The motivation behind this proposal may be gleaned from the Fuller writings: in order to control the world, one must also control the world supply routes.” At Rice University in 1996, scientists figured out how to use carbon-nano tubes to create hollow balls they called <a href="https://www.aaas.org/story-buckyballs">Buckminster fullerenes or Bucky Balls</a>.</p>

 Spaceship Earth – Photo By Mike Billick
 
<p>Spaceship Earth&nbsp;is a&nbsp;dark ride attraction at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">Epcot</a>&nbsp;theme park at the Walt Disney World in Florida. The&nbsp;geodesic sphere called Spaceship Earth was influenced by Bucky Fuller and has served as the symbolic structure of Epcot since the park opened in 1982. Disney’s FastPass can be summed up as one giant study in human behavior and how to move people to desired outcomes through a series of nudges and incentives. Much like ants.</p>
<p></p>
 Life Under the DOME 
 

 
  
 Alison McDowell took this picture at Rice where Buckminsterfullerenes or “buckyballs” were discovered
 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AlisonMcDowell">Alison McDowell</a>&nbsp;has written about the root meaning of the word ‘domination’ and ‘domes.’ She speaks often of Steven Newcomb’s work in the area of the Doctrine of Domination, what it means to agree to live beneath the DOME of governance and the yoke of submission.&nbsp;She said in her&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/">Soulbound Tokens, Trust Networks, and California’s Big Test</a>&nbsp;article,&nbsp;“Biosurveillance track-and-trace data is an example of the kind of communal data, or data commons, they intend for us to share as “responsible” members of society. In augmented reality, we must be tracked and traced with unique identifiers all the time, or layered data streams cannot be integrated, and information overlays fall apart. The digital empire cannot function without rivers of sensor-based geo-location data pouring over the entire planet fed by ubiquitous-sensing, nanoparticulate smart dust.”</p>
 World Game 
 

 
  
 Boris Artzybasheff (1899-1965) drew this portrait of Fuller in 1963So
 
<p>THINK Magazine (I. B.M.), November/December wrote about <a href="https://archive.ph/QFtod">Bucky Fuller’s</a>&nbsp;World Game&nbsp;in 1969. World Game was sometimes referred to as&nbsp;World Peace Game. It was an educational simulation created in 1961 to address overpopulation and the uneven distribution of global resources. It was designed to be an alternative to war games by using Fuller’s&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion_map">Dymaxion map</a>&nbsp;to solve metaphorical scenarios with a “total world” view. He was an avid futurist who dabbled in mathematics, engineering, environmental science, architecture, and art. He called the planet “Spaceship Earth.”</p>
 

 
  
 LBJ hosted Bucky Fuller at the White House
 
<p>This photo of Bucky Fuller with LBJ gives me the creeps. Fuller straight up wanted to build a dome over Manhattan.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/07/pl-arts-9/">Wired</a>‘s Tim McKeogh wrote, “In 1960, Fuller hatched a plan to build a dome over Manhattan. It seems far-fetched, but only until you consider the geoengineering projects — space mirrors! atmospheric sulfur injections! — geoengineering currently being given serious thought.”</p>
 

 
  
 My 3rd Grade Art Contest Entry
 
 Reunion Tower 
<p>Growing up in Dallas in the 70s, I was fascinated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunion_Tower">Reunion Tower</a>. The geodesic dome or “microphone” tower is an icon within the famous Dallas skyline. The building originally served as a radio broadcast station. I could see it from my second-story bedroom in elementary school and begged my mother to let me celebrate my birthday there at the lookout deck which boasts a rotating cocktail lounge and restaurant at the top. I drew the Dallas skyline for my submission to an art contest.</p>
<p>Reunion Tower has been refitted with 259 custom LED fixtures manufactured by Altman Lighting and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Color Kinetics</a>, a division of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips">Philips</a>&nbsp;Solid State Lighting. The lighting on the globe is often used for celebrations and political messages across the city. They make it green for St. Patrick’s day and red white and blue for patriotic events. The globe was lit up in rainbow colors on June 26, 2015 to celebrate&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges">the supreme court ruling which legalized same sex marriage</a>.</p>
<p>I featured the Reunion Tower ball in my 2019 <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hexagons-hive-mind-booming-buzzing-confusion-lynn-davenport/">article on the global hive mind</a> being cultivated in our cities and neighborhoods to create the global workforce:</p>
<p>In late 2021, Alison McDowell wrote an in-depth article on Esports called&nbsp;<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2021/12/22/poverty-identity-and-child-gamers-in-rios-favelas/">Poverty, Identity, and Child Gamers in Rio’s Favelas</a>.&nbsp;She said, “A January 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.esportsobserver.com/afrogames-reopens-lol-team/">article</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;E-Sports Observer states that Afrogames has partnered with the Rio De Janeiro Secretary of Sports, Recreation, and Youth. Children who participate in the program have access to trainers, psychologists, and mentorship programs. But how much data is collected on players’ physical and mental performance and where does it go? What are the ethics of creating a digital economy that expects youth to play first-person shooter video games so their family has enough to eat? It’s as if these battles royale have become today’s gladiator tournaments. This is happening in communities&nbsp;traumatized by perpetual gun violence, including violence carried out by the state.”</p>
<p>She included a debate with Derrick Broze where she said, “I presume he means my tweets stating his support of “play to earn” gaming schemes, that are promoted by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/11/what-play-to-earn-games-mean-for-the-economy-and-metaverse/">World Economic Forum</a>, were “not cool.” She further responded, “I remind you these comments relate to the clip above and are about “play to earn” crypto gaming schemes targeting poor children in the Global South. Regarding consent – can children give consent in online spaces for transactions? Who is to say these spaces are safe? To me, enterprises like “Splinterlands” look like rackets that siphon money to the top. This doesn’t look like a space where children should be earning a living.”</p>
 Love is Metaphysical Gravity? 
<p>I saw this YouTube video suggesting Fuller said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwxHf_kpZlU&amp;feature=youtu.be">love is metaphysical gravity</a>. I couldn’t disagree more.</p>
 
<p></p>
 
<p>In the video there was a quote that said, “The Universe is never at absolute zero; if our eyes were more sensitive to the different frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum we would be able to see that everything radiates photon vibrations continuously.” Fuller believed we belong to the collective universe rather than individuals endowed by our Creator.</p>
 

 
  
 Buckminster Fuller to Children of the Earth (1972)
 
<p>Fuller wrote a book called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Buckminster-Fuller-Children-Earth-R/dp/0385029799">Buckminster Fuller to Children of the Earth</a>. One seller review said, “Youth, he says, sees this and will settle for nothing less. He sees man’s capabilities wonderfully reflected in the fresh minds of children…and speaks to the child who lives in all people.”</p>
<p>Children have long been the target of exploitation and extraction for cheap labor. Esports is cloaked in positive language to fool parents into supporting the movement. The agenda goes well beyond the obvious model for profit. Children are necessary players in this global simulation where every move is tracked and harvested for their energy source.</p>
<p>Give your kids a real ball and close the digital device.</p>

							<p>In this post, we briefly describe the threshold signature scheme FROST, and present benchmark results for our FROST implementation. We also describe one optimization that greatly improves its speed, especially for scenarios with a large number of signers (e.g. 12 times faster in a t=667 out of n=1000 scenario).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 What is FROST?  		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>FROST is an efficient threshold Schnorr signature scheme <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852">invented</a> by Chelsea Komlo (at the University of Waterloo and Chief Scientist at the Zcash Foundation) and Ian Goldberg (at the University of Waterloo). FROST is in the process of becoming an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/">IETF RFC</a>.</p><p>Threshold signatures make use of a single private key that is split into shares that are held by multiple participants. A subset of the participants (e.g. 3 out of 5, or whatever threshold is specified at key generation) can generate a signature that can be verified by the group public key, as if it were signed by the original unsplit private key. The key can be generated centrally before being split and distributed to the participants (referred to as “trusted dealer”), or a decentralized key generation (DKG) protocol can be used, which means that no single party ever possesses the entire private key. It has many applications, such as allowing multiple entities to manage a cryptocurrency wallet in a safer and more resilient manner. FROST defines a two-round signing protocol, and is consequently the most efficient Schnorr threshold protocol in the literature today.</p><p>Schnorr has several advantages over the more traditional ECDSA signature: it’s much simpler; easier to implement in a secure manner; and is compatible with modern signatures schemes such as EdDSA. A significant upside is that it is also compatible with Zcash spend signatures (i.e. the signature that authorizes a Zcash shielded transaction), and this is one of our main use cases for FROST.</p><p>Currently, the RFC is close to completion. We have also completed a <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/">Rust implementation</a> of all ciphersuites specified in the RFC, and are now doing final cleanups and improvements prior to the first release of the crates (which will then be audited). A <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zips/blob/zip-frost/zip-0312.rst">ZIP</a> has been drafted, which describes how FROST can be used to create Zcash spend authorization signatures, and Chelsea is working on an associated security proof (for the re-randomizable version of FROST).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Benchmarking and Investigating the Aggregate step
 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>When we presented FROST at Zcon3 (check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAfTTfblzoU">research</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE-1aTuwpzI">implementation</a> talks), we were asked how FROST performed in larger settings, such as a 667-of-1000 signers. (This is motivated by a mechanism proposed by Christopher Goes for <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/proposed-architecture-for-a-zcash-namada-ibc-ecosystem-ethereum-ecosystem-non-custodial-bridge-using-frost-multisignatures/42749">bridging Zcash with other ecosystems using FROST</a>.) We set out to benchmark our Rust implementation, and I was a bit surprised about one particular step, “Aggregate”.</p><p>The FROST scheme can be split into steps: Key Generation, Round 1, Round 2, and Aggregate. Key Generation only needs to be done once, while the rest are carried out each time the group wishes to generate a new signature. In the Round 1 step, the participant generates commitments which are broadcast to all other participants via a Coordinator. In the Round 2 step, using these commitments and their respective key shares generated during Key Generation, they produce a signature share which is sent to the Coordinator. Finally, the Coordinator carries out the final step, Aggregate, which produces the final signatures from all the signatures shares received.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Initial Benchmarks 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>The initial benchmark for the Ristretto255 suite looked like the following. (Benchmarks were run on an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 3.7GHZ, Ubuntu 22.04, Rust 1.66.0.)</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
												
																					
										
									 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>(Note that Round 1 and 2 timings in this post refer to per-signer timings, while Key Generation and Aggregate are performed by the Coordinator.)</p><p>It was expected that the timings would increase with the larger number of participants (with the exception of Round 1, which does not depend on that number), but the Aggregate timings appeared too high, surpassing 400ms for the 667-of-1000 case (which may not seem much but it’s unusual for a signing procedure).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Optimized Benchmarks 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>I intended to investigate this slow code, but I didn’t even need to. Coincidentally, while the RFC was in the last call for feedback, Tim Ruffing <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/cfrg/QQhyjvvcoaqLslaX3gWwABqHN-s/">pointed out</a> that Aggregate can be sped up significantly. Originally, it was specified that each share received from the participants should be verified (each signature share can be verified separately to ensure it is correct) and then aggregated. Tim’s observation is that the shares can be simply aggregated and the final signature verified with the group public key. If the verification fails, then it’s possible to find which participant generated an incorrect share by verifying them one by one (if desired). This greatly speeds up the case where all shares are correct, which should be the most common.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
																														 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Aggregate is now more than 3 times faster for the 7 of 10 scenario, more than 4 times faster for the 67 of 100 scenario, and more than 12 times faster for the 667 of 1000 scenario! The Aggregate performance is now very similar to the Round 2 step, which makes sense since they have a very similar structure.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Ciphersuite Benchmarks

							<p>With the benchmark machinery in place (we used <a href="https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs">criterion.rs</a>) we can provide benchmark results for all supported ciphersuites in different scenarios. These all use the optimization described above.</p>

							<p>FROST is a highly performant threshold signature scheme. We described an optimization for its “Aggregate” step, pointed out by Tim Ruffing in his review of the RFC draft, which made it 12 times faster in the 667 of 1000 scenario. With that, the Round 2 and Aggregate steps (recall that Key Generation only runs once, and Round 1 is almost negligible in all scenarios) each take less than 100ms for all ciphersuites, except Ed448, in the 667 of 1000 scenario (which is an uncommonly large one).</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Appendix: Point Multiplications in FROST Steps 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>The time-consuming part of each step is elliptic curve point multiplication. It can be classified into three categories: random point multiplication, where the point being multiplied is unknown in advance; and fixed point multiplication, where the point is known in advance (usually, the “generator”).</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of what each step requires:</p>  Key Generation with Trusted Dealer  One fixed point multiplication to derive the group public key from the group private key;  One fixed point multiplication per MIN_PARTICIPANTS to derive a commitment for each polynomial coefficient;  One fixed point multiplication per MAX_PARTICIPANTS to derive their individual public keys.  Total: (1 + MIN_PARTICIPANTS + MAX_PARTICIPANTS) fixed point multiplications      Round 1<br>  Two fixed point multiplications to generate commitments to the pair of nonces.  Total: 2 fixed point multiplications    Round 2  One random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute the group commitment.  Total: NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications    Aggregate<br>  One random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute the group commitment. If the Coordinator is also a participant, they could reuse the value from Round 2, but we didn’t assume that in our benchmark (and our implementation does not support this for now);  One random point multiplication and one fixed point multiplication to verify the aggregated signature;  Verifying all shares (i.e. in our original approach, or to find a corrupt signer if the aggregated signature failed) additionally requires one random point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to compute each commitment share and then one random and one fixed point multiplication per NUM_PARTICIPANTS to actually verify each share.  Total (with optimization): (NUM_PARTICIPANTS + 1) random point multiplications and 1 fixed point multiplication. To identify a corrupt signer: up to 2*NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications and NUM_PARTICIPANTS fixed point multiplications.  Total (before optimization): 3*NUM_PARTICIPANTS random point multiplications and NUM_PARTICIPANTS fixed point multiplications.

<p>I started the new year doing a deep dive into Cold War game theory, which led me right back into human capital futures trading and guided evolution via bioinformatics and social systems modeling. I’d like to extend my appreciation to Raul Diego for his article, “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2023/01/03/the-big-bluff-online-poker-crypto-and-western-capitals-last-gamble-2/">The Big Bluff: Online Poker, Crypto, and Western Capital’s Last Gamble</a>,” that laid out how cheating scandals intersect with off-shore money laundering. It opened the door to the musty attic I’ve been rummaging around in for the past month. This is the first installment in the “God’s Eye View” series. I’m not sure how long it will be. I’m fifty pages in so far, and as much as I’m trying to wrap it up, the ending keeps eluding me. The series title refers to the “anti-fraud” online poker software mode, the “God mode,” that allowed certain insiders to see all the cards in play, including the hole cards, so they could bet and profit accordingly. Those who have the most information and the best pattern recognition are advantaged in poker and in ReFi (regenerative finance), too. We’re in the game!</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/selling_theta/status/1504570882815049729/photo/1"></a></p>
<p>I took a few books with me during my holiday sojourn, among them Peter Byrne’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8zOZ19H5TY">The Many Worlds of Hugh Everett III</a>.” Everett was a troubled, mathematical genius who had the temerity to critique the theories of physics powerhouses John von Neumann and Niels Bohr around the measurement problem. His assertion? A universal wave function existed that situated conscious beings within a quantum cosmos, NOT as outside observers. Thus, a new view was offered on Schrodinger’s theory of entanglement where our engagement with the world does not result in wave function collapse, but instead creates infinite branches of experience, each pathway separate and unknowable to all others.</p>
<p><a href="http://1266519987193360384"></a></p>
<p>While Everett’s theory was mathematically consistent and offered an elegant alternative to the Copenhagen Collapse Postulate and the von Neumann-Dirac formulation of quantum mechanics where consciousness collapses the wave, most physicists shied away from it then and today. His advisor at Princeton, John Wheeler, got Everett to whittle down his theories to bare bones, so they could award him a PhD without unduly offending Bohr and sent him on his way in 1957.</p>
<p>Twenty years later,<a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/the-many-worlds-theory/"> David Deutsch</a>, an Oxford physicist, would surface Hugh Everett’s full dissertation and reconceptualize it as the<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/#:~:text=The%20Many%2DWorlds%20Interpretation%20(MWI,and%20thus%20from%20all%20physics."> Many Worlds Theory</a>. The premise of a multiverse has gained traction in popular culture as creatives in digital media and gaming are all in to explore the potential of alternate, coexisting futures in hyperspace – see the recent film “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Everywhere_All_at_Once">Everything Everywhere All At Once</a>.” As encoded extended reality insinuates itself ever more powerfully in our lived experience it’s worth contemplating not only Everett’s research into the Quantum, but also his work, much of it still classified, in Cold War probability theory and optimization. The latter are vital elements of the crypto-economic agenda speeding us towards life in a dystopian digital “commons,” which I’ve started calling “the ant computer.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>As his dissertation gathered dust, the boozy, brilliant mathematician pivoted into the burgeoning DC-metro defense sector and joined the top-secret Weapons Systems Evaluation Group where he used his analytical skills to identify targets for nuclear strikes, plot missile trajectories, and assess the true cost of nuclear fallout, informing policies around Mutual Assured Destruction. He struck out on his own with Lambda Corp., a financially precarious consulting firm and extended his algorithmic expertise to financial markets and social policy. Poker was part of the defense contractor social scene, along with square-dance potlucks evidently.</p>
<p>“Every Friday afternoon was ‘Sherry Hour’ at Lambda Corporation. Once a month we had a potluck square-dance dinner. Once a month we played poker in the Lambda poker group, which evolved from the WSEG (Weapons System Evaluation Group) poke group…His home had an indoor swimming pool. He enjoyed eating in fine restaurants. He enjoyed taking pictures with the microfilm camera that he always carried in a small case attached to his belt. He smoked his cigarettes with a filter, had long, swept-back black hair and a mustache/goatee, which he stroked while reviewing his poker hands.”<a href="https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/everett12_lambda.html"> Source</a></p>
<p>After finding out about the existence of the<a href="https://pugwashconferences.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/participants-and-meetings-1957-2007.pdf"> Pugwash Conferences</a> that started in 1957, the year Everett was finishing his dissertation, which brought together top US, Soviet, and world scientists regularly throughout the duration of the Cold War, I’ve come to realize the stories we’ve been told around the nature of that stand-off were highly curated. I now see the second half of the twentieth century not so much about managing a real and present danger around nuclear war as about enacting ongoing mental anguish, cultivating globally polarized mindsets, channeling public funds to enrich and embolden defense interests, and asserting the primacy of a heroic, cutting edge science, including radiation and nanotech, that would set the stage for a siege on natural consciousness in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Everett_III#/media/File:Hugh_Everett_at_New_Mexico_1956_course_attedence_certicate.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The supposedly golden age of the United States in the1950s brought with it a multitude of government-corporate-academic partnerships that would weaponize space, construct supercomputers, develop game theoretical models and sophisticated simulation technologies with the aim of one day regulating biology on the planet through biophysics, frequency, and genetic algorithms. Running concurrently with the Red Scare narrative was the “Limits to Growth / Earth as A Spaceship” frame meant to pave the way for a future of global governance by systems engineers. Ervin Laszlo’s envisioned a “World Homeostat” installing a permanent “peace” and balanced resource management with help from cybernetic feedback loops and ubiquitous sensor networks that would harmonize the imagined “chaos” of nature into a well-modulated hum of social efficiency, thus realizing an enlightenment dream of computational rationality.</p>
<p>As it stands, I think Laszlo’s homeostat is the blockchain smart contract layer, a unified protocol intended to, as Norbert Wiener’s book laid out in 1948, manage “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine">Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</a>.” A central part of that control system is the continued refinement of artificial intelligence, a system that can compute, but not create. I’ve come to feel that what we’re facing off against in this time of creative destruction is a mechanical thought form. It lacks heart and soul. It may be able to mirror and remix the abundant streams of human imagination, emotion, and biology poured into its circuits by the data economy, but it cannot be us. And yet it is a stubborn presence that will try and run us through its sensor-infused mazes until it has enough data on us to fabricate a damn fine replica.</p>
<a href="https://bahai-library.com/laszlo_science_prophecy"></a><a href="https://bahai-library.com/laszlo_science_prophecy">https://bahai-library.com/laszlo_science_prophecy</a>
<p>John von Neumann, father of game theory and its application to economics, lectured at the Institute for Advanced Study during the time Everett was studying at Princeton University. In 1937 von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern wrote “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” and introduced the concept of utility theory into decision making, people picking among a variety of choices to maximize some expected value. Statistics are used to predict choices, and such predictions seeded<a href="https://uh.edu/~lcr3600/simulation/historical.html">&nbsp;mathematical modeling and simulation</a> in the social sciences. The game of poker was central to von Neumann’s research, though he was a rather poor player. The following quote is from a 2006 Forbes article, “<a href="https://archive.ph/MuX9e">A Beautiful Theory</a>.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Von Neumann was only interested in poker because he saw it as a path toward developing a mathematics of life itself. He wanted a general theory–he called it “game theory”–that could be applied to diplomacy, war, love, evolution or business strategy. But he thought that there could be no better starting point than poker: “Real life consists of bluffing, of little tactics of deception, of asking yourself what is the other man going to think I mean to do. And that is what games are about in my theory.”</p>
<p>John von Neumann consulted on the Manhattan Project, was a war hawk, advocated for the hydrogen bomb, helped&nbsp; build the first all-purpose computer, ENIAC, and served as a commissioner on the Atomic Energy Commission until his premature death from bone cancer in 1957 (likely the result of radiation exposure at the Bikini atoll bomb detonations). In addition to game theory, he was recognized for his achievements in theories related to creation of artificial “life,” cellular automata. His ideas about self-replicating machines predated Watson and Crick’s discovery of DNA and provided a foundation for later ground-breaking work by John H. Holland on the application of genetic algorithms and ever more sophisticated simulation modeling applied to guide the evolution of systems (the Omega Point “World Brain” envisioned by Reiser, Huxley, and Teilhard de Chardin).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/theory-of-games-and-economic-behavior-john-von-neuman-first-edition-signed-rare/"></a></p>
<p>I had Holland’s 2012 book “Signals and Boundaries: Building Blocks for Complex Adaptive Systems,” in my luggage, too. I’ve never taken a statistics course, so I’ll admit many of the mathematical aspects were over my head. However, the book helped me broadly imagine the headspace of theoreticians who view dynamic systems through the lens of probability, choice theory, and optimization. His first chapter considers the rainforest as an intricate signal/boundary system in which strategies of diversity, recirculation, niches, and coevolution are in play, sustaining an abundance of life in an ecosystem defined by impoverished soil and excess moisture. Holland notes that our bodies are like ecosystems with similar dynamics and goes on to say (note: parenthetical comments are my additions):</p>
<p>“The CAS (complex adaptive system) framework provides a first step toward a general framework by offering a general way for defining adaptive agents (avatar stand-ins). Adaptive agents are defined by an enclosing boundary that accepts some signals and ignores others, a “program” inside the boundary for processing and sending signals and mechanisms for changing this program in response to the agent’s accumulating experience (think distributed ledger digital twins). Once the signal/boundary agents have been defined, they must be situated to allow for positioning of the relevant signals and boundaries. That is, the agents must be placed in a geometry (think geo-fenced Internet of Things environments) that positions populations of agents of various kinds (think social media interest groupings) and localizes non-agent “resources.” Within this geometry, agents must be able to form conglomerates (think teaming) that yield higher levels of organization with new boundaries so that the framework can capture hierarchical organization.” page 24</p>
<p>And continuing on the following page:</p>
<p>“Chapter by chapter, this book introduces a sequence of concepts that can be melded into an appropriate framework:</p>
<p>classifier systems for defining signal-processing programs</p>
<p>tags for directing signals</p>
<p>tagged urns for defining semi-permeable boundaries</p>
<p>genetic algorithms to provide for the adaptation and coevolution of agents</p>
<p>dynamic generated systems that provide a “grammar” for the framework and bring mathematical tools to bear.”</p>
<p>Holland describes cellular metabolic networks as being similar to rainforests. Structures within cells are compartmentalized, using signals to determine which elements may cross their boundary and which must stay outside. Consider this within the context of the manufactured social polarization and influencers who structure digital outrage, generating angst-laden energies that can be channeled to drive social physics towards emergent behavior. Feedback loops (cybernetics) work to maintain homeostasis within polarized systems. He goes on to say that a diversity of structures maximizes efficient use of resources with the coevolutionary process of signal transmissions constantly interacting with boundaries to produce “a progression of cell types, from the simplest self-reproducing single-celled protozoa to the complicated cells found in multicellular eukaryotic organizations.”</p>
<p><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262525930/signals-and-boundaries/"></a></p>
<p>This can be explored mathematically by modeling “agents,” who act as buyers and sellers where signals are bids placed in complex language and grammar of optimized resource exchange. Agents are defined by boundaries, which are in turn determined by classifier rules, semi-permeable gateways that control which signals are acceptable. Later chapters describe Holland’s application of particle mechanics and statistics to agents, picturing their interactions as random billiard ball collisions and white and black marbles taken in and out of urns tagged with conditional access metrics. Picture “if-then” statements, blockchain smart contracts animating smart-city outside-in robots. Run programmed simulations, and see virtual populations mutate, crossbreed, and coevolve as a mathematical dance of guided evolution plays out where alternate futures are explored, evaluated, modulated via digital interfaces –<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Wright_(game_designer)"> Will Wright’s</a> SimCity c. 1989.</p>
<p>Having started to wrap my mind around these concepts, I see this clip from the ARISE conference about “market-based” potassium exchange between root and fungi in a new light.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These ideas around emergence/convergence call to mind University of Pittsburgh philosophy professor Oliver Reiser’s advocacy in 1946 of scientific humanism, an approach he believed would usher in a unified global culture to solve the world’s problems.</p>
<p>“It will be noted that in the chapter headings of this book we are following through on the organismic theory in a realistic manner. We speak of marriage – the marriage of intelligence and love, knowledge and power – and refer to a social orgasm as the supreme effort at the organization of morphogenetic fields which shall guide the developing foetus. The period of gestation, the labor pains, and the final birthing which will bring to completion the biological sequence of the fruitful union are all parts of the social embryology of planetary humanism.” page 19</p>
<p>I invite you to listen to an eight-minute clip I pulled from a 2021 conversation between Charles Eisenstein, advocate of “sacred economics” and Sep Kamvar; formerly of Google, MIT’s social computing group, and now head of Celo blockchain currency, on the power of morphic fields. While I agree “redemptive violence” is not a productive strategy, it is worth noting that Celo is a blockchain currency linked to social impact finance deals targeting vulnerable communities. Crypto has its own energetics. Are they seeking to leverage energy fields to draw natural life into a techno-guided evolutionary program?</p>
<p></p>
<p>During his time at MIT, Kamvar founded a chain of Montessori schools in the Boston area that placed sensors in the felt slippers worn by children around the classrooms to track their movements and social relations. The classrooms also had ceiling-mounted cameras with artificial vision that fed data to leaderboards. Violence can take many forms. For me such panopticon policies exhibit a violent, domination tendency towards children. This is important information to consider as you listen to them uplift the use of morphic fields to bring “goodness” to the world. I see it as a thinly veiled metaphysical strategy that connects to Reiser’s calls for an orchestrated Planetary Logos seventy-five years ago.</p>
<p>“If there were no resurrection from the forms of the past, humanity’s age-long struggle toward light and life would indeed be an abortion of the giant social embryo-the Planetary Being which is to come. It is my hope that scientific humanism many not only provide the seminal principle for the earth-ovum but serve also as the mental guiding field for embryogenesis, so that the viable offspring of the planet’s own quickening effort shall be the Spirit of Mankind Incarnate, the Planetary Logos made flesh in the World Sensorium.” page 19</p>
<p>To my way of thinking bringing together von Neumann’s game theory, Holland’s genetic algorithms, Everett’s quantum universe, Reiser’s social embryology, with an understanding of blockchain tokenomics is important, because later we will see how free-market economics, digital democracy, and data-driven “what works” social impact deals are on a collision course with Calvinist predestination and emerging market bets on “good” behavior by a class of people with a pathological gambling problem. That is why we must extend our concerns around blockchain beyond a limited understanding of it as digital “money” and recognize that this technology is meant to be a central feature that will shape the signal-boundary architectures employed for guided collective evolution via complex adaptive systems theory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wars of the twentieth century were waged through signal processing, telegraphy, radar, cryptography, and real-time intelligence-driven strategy. These forces shaped the life trajectories of people like Everett who could reduce life to essential equations for analysis and action. </p>
<p>Cold Warriors inhabited an elaborate game, one with very high stakes and a lot of bluffing.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>

It released <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/advanced-staking-overview/">Panther’s v0.5</a>, <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/">LaunchDAO</a>, and paved the way for many protocol-level changes that are integral in our road toward v1. <br></p><p>However, this framework was bootstrapped through conversations between Panther founding contributors and community members rather than formally established by the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/">DAO</a>. To take a new decentralization leap, the existing process needs to be redesigned, formalized, and voted upon by the community, ensuring that it aligns with the values and principles of the Panther DAO. This will give way to a new era for the Panther DAO, where the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/how-to-get-involved-with-panther/">community</a> can collectively shape and direct the future of the platform.<br></p><p>Noticing this, and in the spirit of collaboration with the community to aid its independent discussions, we have put together this article to discuss some best practices on governance frameworks.  We will delve into Panther’s existing governance structure, try to provide guidance about the process of progressive decentralization, and review the ethos of both Panther and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. <br></p><p>Whether you're a current member of the Panther community or just curious about how DAOs operate, this article is a must-read for understanding the intricacies of decentralized governance on Panther Protocol. Please take this article as what it’s meant: guidance to explore the limitless possibilities of decentralized governance.<br><br></p> Why is the Panther DAO so important for the project?<br>  DAOs in a moving and complex crypto ecosystem <p>Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, are a relatively new (or at least newly popularized) concept. At their core, DAOs are a form of decentralized governance where decision-making power is distributed among a community of stakeholders rather than being centralized in a single entity. This structure is re-thinking how organizations can operate and enabling the launch of truly decentralized, permissionless platforms that resonate with crypto’s original ethos.<br></p>Some of the key components and attractions of a DAO. <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/daos-for-beginners/what-is-a-dao">Source</a>.<p>One of the key principles behind DAOs is the "wisdom of the masses" — the idea that a diverse group of individuals working together can make better decisions than a single leader or small group. This is particularly important for Panther, as the project is focused on creating a fully decentralized ecosystem that is open and accessible to all. By giving community members a say in how the protocol is run, Panther can tap into the collective knowledge and experience of its stakeholders, which leads to more innovative and effective solutions.<br></p><p>Panther aims to be censorship-resistant while operating in what's likely the most censorable space in crypto. In light of recent censorship attacks on the DeFi ecosystem, it is crucial for Panther to clarify that although it always has compliance in mind, the DAO serves to protect the project from attempts and from actions that would hinder the community’s autonomy. This is a tricky but achievable goal, as Panther's decentralized architecture enables everything, from the front- to the back-end to be hosted in a decentralized way. <br></p><p>However, it's important to note that decentralized governance is not a set-it-and-forget-it solution. In order to be successful, DAOs like Panther Protocol must adhere to certain values and principles. For example, it is critical that the governance structure is transparent, accountable, sticks to the project’s principles, and fair, and is almost always an ongoing process.</p><p><br>Before discussing how the Panther community could set such a framework for itself, let’s take a look at how Panther achieved its current degree of decentralization.</p> Panther’s road to decentralization (and the importance of progressive decentralization)<br> <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-progressive-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations/">Progressive decentralization (we already devoted a whole article to this!)</a> is a core principle at Panther and a key aspect of its development process.<br></p><p>This is particularly important during the initial stages of project development, where the main focus lies in delivering the roadmap and developing the protocol. New projects need to be somewhat centralized in order to effectively launch their initial protocol. However, as the project grows and matures, and to preserve the qualities outlined above, it is important to build the organization’s censorship resistance. By opening up decision-making power to the community, Panther can ensure that the community is truly in control of the organization and that Panther’s values of privacy, security, innovation, and transparency are accurately represented.<br></p><p>Panther has been implementing this approach by first focusing on building a strong foundation through its community and governance structure. Another way in which we implemented progressive decentralization was through the Panther <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/">LaunchDAO</a>. Members of the Panther community directly participated in the launch and were rewarded for doing so. In addition to receiving a $PreZKP non-transferable token, which serves as a badge of honor, the members also received $ZKP tokens after the token launch.<br></p><p>After this, and building up to the launch of v0.5, Panther achieved a significantly higher level of decentralization through <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Panther Improvement Proposals (PIP)</a> <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x576701a7a07efe281cd4f04acbf589d0791e492117497d628a6dfc6e9eccda6b">6</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">7</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">8</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">9</a>, and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">10</a>. These proposals covered everything –from democratic procedures related to who is allowed to vote on DAO proposals under certain circumstances to the release of code so that it could be deployed by anyone in the Panther community. <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x01942f584fe0c27aeef420207135be5ede279998da0a7839f22e2178b2d335ba">PIP-9</a> and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0x0c6f3fd9db866f99d7d0b343687b890cd3240495170f539efcc31f2dc216ebd5">PIP-10</a> also formalized the terms for the staking program, giving the community a direct key to decide how a significant amount of funds would be distributed among stakers.<br></p><p>As outlined in <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">our whitepaper</a>, Panther is on a continuous path toward decentralization. This approach is by design, as the protocol focuses on building a strong foundation to support further development and evolution.</p> Panther’s current governance framework and its evolution <p>As we mentioned before, Panther’s governance framework developed with a very clear goal of making the project as decentralized as possible. This, along with community discussion and experimentation, helped bootstrap a framework rather than following a pre-developed plan. <br></p><p>For its framework, while Panther never attempted to re-invent the wheel (lots of projects have stake-to-vote frameworks, use Snapshot, proposals, etc.), its specifics have been largely shaped by what the community deems fair and effective in practice. This approach has led to a governance system that is still able to adapt and evolve as the needs of the community change. &nbsp;<br></p><p>The current governance process for Panther starts with a basis on a pre-agreed consensus: Panther’s principles, ideas, and roadmap were established by its initial <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/panther-protocol-v-1-0-1.pdf">whitepaper</a> and materials released along with it. By deciding to fund Panther’s development, community members agreed to the directions outlined by these materials. The steps leading to their application and execution, particularly in a moving context, however, are often brainstormed between members of Panther Ventures Limited –the leading Panther developer– and the Panther community using tools like Panther’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a>, and official discussion<a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/"> forum</a>.<br></p><p>This common agreement is essential to preserving transparency and democracy within the platform. Let us now discuss some of the key roles and community tools that partake in it.<br></p> Proposals, staking, and Snapshot<br> <p>The system detailed above was formalized before Panther’s launch with the establishment of Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/launchdao/">LaunchDAO</a>, <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot page</a> and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zkp-staking-will-be-available-this-wednesday-c73c7c98b5f2/">initial staking solution</a>. <br></p><p>Panther utilizes Snapshot as a way for community members to vote on proposals, such as those put forth through Panther Improvement Proposals (PIPs). PIPs cover a wide range of topics, from democratic procedures to code releases. They are an important tool for community members to voice their opinions and drive the direction of the protocol. <br></p><p>Once a proposal is published on Snapshot, it can be voted upon by the community. If the vote does not pass, no action is taken, preserving the community's power to make decisions about the platform's direction. <br></p>Panther Protocol’s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth">Snapshot Page.</a><p></p><p>Snapshot is a powerful tool for DAOs. It allows projects to create proposals for users to vote on using cryptocurrency without incurring fees. This allows for a cost-efficient and accessible way for DAOs to engage with their audience and make decisions based on their collective input. Snapshot takes a picture (or “snapshot”) of the blockchain at the time of the vote to determine the number of tokens each address has and executes the outcome decided by the vote. This is beneficial as it eliminates the need to deploy tokens and pay transaction fees. It also prevents vote inflation by ensuring that tokens cannot be moved around and used to vote multiple times. Additionally, proposals can also have code attached to them, and if "yes" wins, the code gets automatically executed.<br></p><p>For a user to be able to vote on a Panther proposal within Snapshot, they must first ensure they have a wallet account that meets voting criteria (see below). Once they do, they can use these tokens to vote on any open proposals. As Snapshot utilizes off-chain vote signaling, votes are feeless and do not require users to directly interact with their tokens to vote.</p> Moderators, Authors, and Admins<br> <p>The ongoing process of using <a href="https://discord.com/invite/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> to brainstorm with the community before issuing proposals changed with the release of Panther’s <a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/">Discourse forum</a> (prominently featuring community members who are unrelated to PVL as moderators) and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xb5d638eb5aad2819c210a2f1e06001a58819694717e8d04ca789304f06520fa1">PIP-8</a>. <br></p><p>PIP-8 set the stage for advancing Panther’s decentralization by putting more responsibilities in the hands of the Panther community. Thanks to it, forum moderators can review a proposal and, if approved, move it to be put into Snapshot by a Snapshot Author, a new role <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/governance/proposal-8-new-snapshot-authors-and-admins">introduced alongisde Admins</a>. Authors are community members with the ability to post PIPs to this platform, while Admins are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the platform's governance structure by enforcing DAO governance rules and values.<br></p><p>Another achievement of PIP-8 was defining a process of electing future Authors and Admins. PIP-8 sought to enhance decentralization by augmenting the number of Snapshot Authors and Admins within the Panther Protocol ecosystem. The proposal successfully onboarded two Panther contributors and six community members as Snapshot Authors, empowered with the ability to propose changes on Snapshot.org. Furthermore, two new community-elected Admin accounts were added as signatories on the Gnosis Safe multisig wallet, which serves as the sole admin account for Panther's Snapshot.org space. The multisig wallet operates under a "2-out-of-3" signing policy, ensuring that changes to the Snapshot.org space's settings are approved by at least two of the three whitelisted Admins.<br></p><p>PIP-8 was a concerted effort to increase community participation in the protocol's governance and eliminate potential points of failure. The introduction of new Authors and Admins, as well as the implementation of a multisig for Admin actions, served to bolster the protocol's resilience and decision-making process. Community members can nominate themselves or others for the role. These newly appointed permissions will remain valid for six months, after which the community will propose and vote on a fresh set of nominees to continue in the role. This ensures that the platform's leadership is continually meeting the needs and expectations of the community.<br></p>The Panther community discussing DAO governance on Panther’s forums.<p></p> Voting Logic<br> <p>Now that we’ve covered how the Panther DAO’s democratic process works, it’s time to look at how votes accrue in favor or against proposals.<br></p><p><a href="https://snapshot.org/#/pantherprotocol.eth/proposal/0xd7fe6122175ed23696b88c8cdf34388923a03cdbb6c7281b83ff50347dac3991">PIP-7</a>, also known as the Improved Voting Logic proposal, brought significant changes and improvements to the governance process’ robustness. This proposal introduced a fallback voting logic at times when tokens staked are not sufficient for the community to be thoroughly represented.<br></p><p>The Panther DAO originally used only a "stake-to-vote" mechanism, where token holders could stake their tokens to gain voting rights. However, this system struggled at times when the staking contract didn’t issue rewards. As such, a "hold-to-vote" mechanism was implemented as a fallback. This allowed token holders to vote just by holding a certain amount of tokens, regardless of whether they had staked them, whenever the contract wasn’t issuing rewards.<br></p><p>After the launch of v0.5, the "stake-to-vote" mechanism was once again the primary method of voting, but with a more robust system, thanks to the improvements made by PIP-7. However, the fallback mechanism will continue in place, as it allows for a wider community representation in the voting process.<br></p> In Summary<br> <p>The Panther DAO, in its relatively short existence, has navigated its way through a trial-and-error process to establish its democratic procedures. Panther is more decentralized now than ever as a consequence. <br></p><p>Despite initial challenges, along with Panther contributors, the DAO has successfully created a system that allows for equitable participation and decision-making among its members. As the Panther DAO continues to grow and evolve, it’s now time for it to review its practices and procedures to ensure its longevity and stability. This is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of DAOs as a whole and serves as a model for other organizations seeking to establish democratic processes in a decentralized environment.<br></p><p>In an upcoming article, we’ll write about the process of creating governance frameworks that are self-enforceable.<br></p><p>Stay tuned!<br><br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther-Protocol-One-Pager.png">One-pager</a> · <a href="https://www.pantherprotocol.io/resources/Panther_Litepaper_v1_0.pdf">Lite Paper</a> · <a href="https://twitter.com/zkpanther">Twitter</a> · <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/GJ64F-nRiIF86Cxn">Telegram</a> · <a href="https://discord.gg/WZuRnMCZ4c">Discord</a></p>

<p>In short, blockchain can improve data security and integrity by creating an environment in which everybody can add and verify data. Yet it is impossible to submit false data as those verifying the data will always notice. How does this work exactly?</p>



 Blockchain as a framework to improve data security and integrity 



<p>Defining integrity, in the context of information, can be tricky. A simple web search on the matter will yield multiple results, but for clarity’s sake we’ll pick one of the briefest: Integrity refers to the reliability and trustworthiness of the data. A simple explanation, for sure, but in the real world, the issue is slightly more complicated.</p>



<p>When it comes to data interpretation, the questions “Has this data been manipulated, or tampered with?”, “Where does this data come from?”, “Can I trust the institution that holds my personal information?”, are all very much relevant. Cambridge Analytica, Equifax, and other similar high-profile events confirmed that, when it comes to data, there is no ironclad security.</p>



<p>Or is there?</p>



 A brief history of blockchain 



<p>The answer to what blockchain is lies in its very name. It is a chain of blocks that stores transactional data. All existing nodes in the network validate the transaction, which becomes immutable, i.e., once validated, the transaction cannot be altered.</p>



<p>A block is a piece of data that contains certain information, such as a header, transaction data, and other technical stuff. Each block has a body, which can be imagined as the empty space in a train. The block’s body – the next available train car – is filled with confirmed transactions. If these transactions are validated by all the nodes (devices on the network), the block is deemed valid and is appended to the chain. Hence, block-chain.</p>



<p>You can think of a block as an entry in a ledger book, only the ledger is digital and decentralised, where all the blocks are linked to each other via cryptographic means – the hash.</p>



 Distributed security and transparency: The aces up blockchain’s sleeve 



<p>Each transaction that occurs on the blockchain is logged and timestamped. This prevents anyone from sending the same transaction more than once. The chain maintains a verifiable, immutable, and time-stamped record of every single transaction that was ever made.</p>



<p>But a bank database also maintains verifiable, time-stamped records of every transaction ever made, you might argue. Yes, it does. But where a bank (or Government, educational institution, etc.) database falls short is that its records are not immutable. They can be altered, quite easily. And furthermore, a bank database is highly centralised. Its control and management are in the hands of a single entity (the bank). Two, maybe three people will maintain it. This raises immediate and obvious concerns, particularly concerning the ease with which a database can be compromised.</p>



<p>Blockchain represents the polar opposite of a bank database. Blockchain – or distributed ledger technology – does not hold its data in a single, easy to tamper with database. Instead, an exact copy of the dataset exists in every node, and when a new block is added, every node knows about it. This poses an obvious advantage in terms of data security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a Proof-of-Work environment, for example. Let’s say 30,000 nodes are validating transactions. How would 30,000 individual nodes ever coordinate together and conspire to do something dishonest? The very distribution of the validating nodes is what gives blockchain its inherent stability. At least half the nodes would have to behave dishonestly for the system to break, but the notion that 15,000 nodes would coordinate to do something dishonest is rather absurd. Compare that notion with the example of the bank database, where two, maybe three people are in control, the conspiratorial odds suddenly rise.</p>



<p>The other aspect of blockchain’s second-to-none approach to data security and integrity is transparency. Taking the example of the bank, or any other centralized database, any changes, alterations, or amendments to your data are very much a closely-guarded secret. You, the user, the very element who’s directly affected by these changes, are certainly kept out. You cannot see what’s being done with your data, you cannot control where your personal information goes, who looks at it, or what a third party might do with it. One could argue that, had Facebook’s data been kept on the blockchain, Cambridge Analytica would never have happened.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a blockchain environment, every single transaction (including the value, the address or addresses that the assets are sent from/to, etc.) is visible to everyone. Blockchain’s transparency is a feature that had hitherto been unthinkable in banking, for example. And while, at first glance, it might sound like a monumental invasion of privacy to have this sensitive information openly viewable by everyone in the network, consider that the information is hashed (encrypted) and that the data cannot be altered without a record of the change also existing. And of course, every node in the network would know about it. Consider this analogy: Think of a bank’s safe with transparent walls, and with hundreds, or thousands of people watching every time someone opens it to add more money into it.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the use of <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">blockchain technology</a> for data integrity also creates opportunities for enterprises. Through the use of enterprise blockchain technology and various <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">digital identity solutions</a>, such as my.D, enterprises no longer have to worry about dealing with personal data. After all, personal data is as much of a liability as it is an asset these days.</p>



 Why data security and integrity matters 



<p>When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> broke back in 2018, the lights on the internet grew a little dimmer. Data harvesting was nothing new. Data-extracting bots and scripts had been roaming the web for years. But the factors that differentiated the Cambridge Analytica affair from any previous data harvesting issues were the sheer scale of it, and the sinister political ramifications of what’s arguably one of the greatest data-related scandals of the past decade.</p>



<p>An estimated 50 million Facebook accounts were compromised. Speaking on CNN, Mark Zuckerberg, referred to the Cambridge Analytica debacle as a ‘mistake’ and a ‘breach of trust.’ In March 2018, he published a letter apologizing on behalf of his company. By April, Facebook finally implemented the EU-mandated General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework in all geographical areas where Facebook operates.</p>



<p>The fallout from the Cambridge Analytica shady dealings (and the equally dramatic Equifax hack that became known about a year later) threw personal data into the spotlight. Many people, rightly, began to ask themselves how secure is our data, while in the hands of large corporations? How can these companies guarantee the security and integrity of our data? Who’s looking at our personal information?</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>The use of blockchain technology clearly supports the concepts of data integrity and security. Particularly when it comes to sensitive data such as financial or commercial records. But that’s far from the only areas of business and industry where blockchain can make a transformative difference in the way personal data is handled, and by whom.</p>



<p>So one could say that blockchain is doing the right thing. Even when everyone’s watching.</p>

	  All exchanges, partners, full node operators, and full node wallet users must <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/releases/tag/v3.2.1">update to version 3.2.1</a> prior to February 20, 2023.       
 

 
         
    
					Important Announcement		    

			
						
									
							
					
	
    
							    
     
 


 
         
    <p>ZEN 3.2.1 will have a shorter deprecation period and will be phased out in April 2023. This was done in anticipation of the upcoming major protocol update represented by ZEN 4.0.0 which will include all the related functionalities to support the Horizen EVM-compatible sidechain (EON).</p>
<p>The update will first go live on Testnet before Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://dune-explorer.horizen.io"></a>Meanwhile, the EON sidechain was already launched on the <a href="https://dune.horizen.io">Dune Testnet</a>, bringing an explosion of community dev activity&nbsp;in just the first few days! We take this opportunity to also thank everyone for their continued support.</p>
<p>Please update your ZEN software before February 20. With this version, we are updating the deprecation height – be ready for the next big updates coming with ZEN 4.0.0!</p>
<p>The new 3.2.1 version is available to download on GitHub and through the APT repository.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t upgrade before Feb 20, 2023:</p>
 
 Exchanges and Partners: you will NOT be able to access your funds until you upgrade to the latest version. 
 Pool operators: ZEN will NOT work, and thus, you will not be able to mine ZEN until you upgrade to ZEN 3.2.1. 
 Node operators: ZEN will NOT work, and thus, you will not be eligible to earn ZEN until you upgrade to ZEN 3.2.1. 
 Full node wallet users (Swing wallet, Sphere by Horizen): you will NOT be able to access your funds until you upgrade to the latest wallet version.

 1. Debate, grow, build: Programming languages &amp; crypto <p>Sam Blackshear, Noah Citron, Eddy Lazzarin, and Sonal Chokshi</p><p>What are the differences between smart-contracts programming and traditional programming — and where does programming for blockchains sit along the long history and evolution of programming languages overall? In the latest episode of ‘web3 with a16z’ (yes we’re back with an all-new season!), we overview all things programming languages and crypto: for both existing blockchain &amp; smart contract programmers, and for other developers seeking to enter the space.&nbsp;</p><p>The conversation includes discussion of Move, Solidity, Rust, Huff, Vyper; JavaScript (as well as Node), Python, SQL, Haskell, Go… and also touches on topics such as formal verification, governance, cross-platform adaptation, and much more.&nbsp;</p><p>But this discussion is also for those curious about how programming languages evolve (and come into existence)... as well as anyone interested in the intersection of language, code, and expression. </p><p><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/programming-languages-smart-contract-programming-evolutions">listen<br></a><a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1620105727854665728">share</a></p> 2. Policy: On recent news &amp; moves; developing frameworks for regulation  Understanding recent moves <p>Michele Korver</p><p>When the U.S. Department of Justice criminally <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/founder-and-majority-owner-bitzlato-cryptocurrency-exchange-charged-unlicensed-money">charged</a> a senior executive (and Russian national) of cryptocurrency exchange Bitzlato with unlicensed money transmitting, many people – even crypto industry insiders — commented that they had never heard of it. So what’s going on here, and why does it matter?</p><p>This move is significant because the “<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Order_Bitzlato_FINAL%20508.pdf">Bitzlato Order</a>” — issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s FinCEN the same day — is the first such order issued pursuant to section 9714(a) of the Combating Russian Money Laundering Act (Public Law 116-283). It identifies Bitzlato Limited, a financial institution operating outside of the U.S., to be of primary money laundering concern in connection with Russian illicit finance. As such, it prohibits certain transmittals of funds involving Bitzlato by any covered financial institution. This is in addition to the DOJ criminal charges for Bitzlato failing to implement anti-money laundering safeguards, and thus enabling criminals to profit from their wrongdoing — including ransomware and drug trafficking from the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-investigation-leads-shutdown-largest-online-darknet-marketplace">now-defunct</a> darknet Hydra marketplace, where users exchanged more than $700 million in cryptocurrency (either directly or through intermediaries).&nbsp;</p><p>As alleged in the order and the criminal complaint, Bitzlato executives knowingly facilitated criminal activity by failing to implement even the most basic anti-money laundering (AML) and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures. The FinCEN order in effect shuts down Bitzlato’s ability to conduct transactions with other financial institutions.</p><p>For entrepreneurs and those watching (or in some cases reading the tea leaves on!) regulatory moves and implications, it’s worth noting that this is a good example of Treasury using its authority in a “fit for purpose” regulatory action. It’s precisely how regulation should be: going after the real wrongdoers, under clearly established rules.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you’re wondering what the difference is between a section 9714(a) order (the Bizlato Order described above) and section 311 special measures (which are authorized under the USA PATRIOT Act); or, what financial institutions are "covered" by the Order and what they have to do — you can check out FinCEN's accompanying FAQs <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/FAQs_Bitzlato%20FINAL%20508.pdf">here</a>. As always, make sure to do your diligence on any businesses you’re dealing with… and when unsure about regulatory implications, consult legal or regulatory counsel.</p><p>related: For an overview of AML/KYC, BSA, sanctions, and more about illicit finance and how crypto entrepreneurs can navigate, go <a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/crypto-regulations-sanctions-compliance-aml-ofac-news-explained">here</a>.</p><p>see also: In case you missed it, check out the <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/crypto-news-regulatory-roundup-december-16-2022-january-13-2023/">last installment</a> in our ongoing regulatory updates series, where David Sverdlov et al on our a16z crypto regulatory team share useful agency, as well as regional, news &amp; moves.</p> Regulate businesses, not software <p>Miles Jennings, Brian Quintenz</p><p>Two extremes clash over web3 regulation: One faction that argues for applying existing regulations wholesale to web3; and the other that argues for completely excluding web3 from existing, successful regulatory frameworks. But both produce bad policy outcomes. So how to resolve this tension?</p><p>Continuing our series on regulations that preserve the benefits of web3 technology and protect the future of the internet — while reducing the risks of illicit activity and consumer harm — a16z crypto’s Miles Jennings and Brian Quintenz suggest a more pragmatic approach. The key tenet? Regulate businesses, not software. That is: businesses should be the focus of regulation… whereas decentralized, autonomous software — especially the underlying decentralized blockchains, smart contracts, and networks that provide the internet with new functionality — should not.

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from Blocksmith Labs, Planet IX, Trisolaris, and X2YX.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Today we announce four new DApps that joined our Wallet Partner program in January. Each partner has integrated support for Brave Wallet, allowing Brave users to more easily connect to Web3 using the built-in wallet available within the Brave browser—on desktop, iOS, and Android.</p>
<p>Here are the partners that joined in this month:</p>

 Blocksmith Labs 
<p><a href="https://www.blocksmithlabs.io/">Blocksmith Labs</a> is driven by a singular mission: to create the best Web3 products that will enable the next generation of companies, artists, individuals, and creators to achieve their full potential. From a whitelist management platform to dynamic art generation, the team has developed solutions to address a variety of real-world problems within Web3.</p>

 Planet IX 
<p><a href="https://planetix.com/">Planet IX</a> is the largest NFT-based strategy game on Polygon. The goal of the game is to restore a fallen planet to its former green-blue glory while uncovering its mysteries. The story is continuously expanding into an immersive sci-fi metaverse with a rich narrative tailored towards bringing awareness of humanity’s impact on today’s world. The game consists of land parcels called PIX, which are NFTs that can be collected and traded to form territories, develop new technology, raid other players, and gain ownership of in-game corporations with different functions and perks.</p>
<p>“We’re very happy to be adding the Brave Wallet to our game. Many of our players already use the Brave browser when playing Planet IX, and we are excited to see what this partnership can lead to in the future,” said Felix Bengtsson, Co-Founder &amp; Visionary at Planet IX.</p>

 Trisolaris 
<p><a href="https://www.trisolaris.io/#/swap">Trisolaris</a> is a one-stop trading platform for the NEAR blockchain, running on NEAR’s Aurora engine. It is the first DEX on Aurora, enabling a seamless trading experience similar to Ethereum for a fraction of the cost, taking advantage of the great underlying architecture provided by the Aurora engine.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to partner with the first and leading Web3 browser, Brave. We believe in their mission to provide a more secure browsing experience, especially for those participating in Web3,” said Eviejugo, BD lead at Trisolaris.</p>

 X2Y2 
<p><a href="https://x2y2.io/">X2Y2</a> is one of the top NFT marketplaces and NFT lending platforms on Ethereum. During 2022, $1.56B in NFT trading volume and more than $12M total lending amount accrued on X2Y2. Importantly, X2Y2 charges just 0.5% transaction fee from sellers, and 100% of the revenue is paid to $X2Y2 token stakers.</p>
<p>“We are an NFT marketplace, but our goal is to onboard the next billion Web 2.0 users to Web3. We believe we can achieve this goal faster by partnering with Brave and integrating deeper into Brave’s ecosystem,” said Ken, Head of Partnership at X2Y2.</p>

 Evolving the wallet partner program 
<p>Following the successful onboarding of over 80 leading DApps in&nbsp; the first phase of the Brave Wallet Partner Program, we’re shifting our focus to develop deeper business relationships with partners in the program involving the Brave Wallet, and to make a more public facing submission process for DApps supporting the Brave Wallet.</p>
<p>As a further next step in the Wallet Partner program, users of the browser and wallet can expect new ways to use BAT with Wallet Partner program applications, as we continue growing new use cases for BAT in Web3. Stay tuned for more updates to the Wallet Partner Program, and as always, we welcome and encourage feedback from the Brave and BAT communities.</p>
<p>If you aren’t already using Brave Wallet, you can start by clicking  in the top left of your nav bar or by selecting “Wallet” from the menu.</p>
<p>If you’re an application developer that would like to integrate the Brave Wallet, developer documentation is available <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">here</a>.</p>

An image of Corintis’ microfluidic cooling channels on a&nbsp;CPU<p>For more than 50 years, the technology industry benefited from the tail winds of Moore’s Law. The density of transistors in a silicon microprocessor doubled roughly every 2 years. Up until 10 years ago, that meant that microprocessors got twice as fast every 2 years. Unfortunately, at a certain point transistors were so tightly packed together that heat dissipation became a major problem, and microprocessor performance stalled even as transistor density kept scaling. For the last decade, the industry shifted to using lots of processors and building hyperscale cloud data centers that today consume <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/2020/03/17/how-much-energy-do-data-centers-really-use/">205 TWh</a> of electricity, 43% of which is used for cooling, leading to massive inefficiencies and&nbsp;cost.</p><p><a href="https://www.corintis.com/">Corintis</a>, a spin-out of EPFL in Switzerland, has developed technology that represents a breakthrough in semiconductor cooling. The founder’s paper in Nature showed that they could put 10x the amount of power through a chip using their cooling technology than that of the closest competitor technology. Corintis etches microfluidic channels on the back of a silicon chip roughly the size of a human hair and moves coolant through them. The small size increases the surface area of silicon in contact with the coolant and, consequently, the amount of heat it can dissipate. The cooling microchannels can be etched with typical semiconductor fabrication equipment and can be codesigned with the physical design of the chip to maximize cooling efficiency using software developed by Corintis.</p><p>We believe that cooling will become a mission-critical issue for chip designers as they continue to hit physical limits. We are excited to be backing the Corintis team on their mission to lead a new breakthrough in semiconductor cooling, potentially extending Moore’s law and greatly reducing the energy consumption in the cooling of electronics.</p>

<p>From technological breakthrough to philosophical defiance, the topic of AI has always sparked intense debates ever since Alan Turing &amp; John McCarthy advanced this branch of computer science. One might argue that this was caused by expectations overwhelmingly surpassing technological capabilities. However, the recent public release of ChatGPT has rekindled former sci-fi apocalyptical scenarios, even if it is (still) just a trained language model. Humanity gazed in awe as a simple input/output text interface could instantly disrupt fields such as software engineering or copywriting. Worst part? It also challenged (arguably) the most important human-specific trait: creativity (Midjourney). Data is the lifeblood of AI as it increases the model’s prediction accuracy: larger input sample translates into more outputs that help fine-tune weights during back-propagation cycles (the model ‘learns’).</p><p>We were joined by Trent McConaghy, founder &amp; CTO at Ocean Protocol, to discuss the advantages of implementing blockchain (&amp; NFT) technology in data management and trading, what makes a particular data set valuable and what challenges derive from AI implementations and the data digital gold rush.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Trent’s AI background &amp; founding Ocean  The evolution of Ocean Protocol  Managing third-party access to data NFTs  Minting data NFTs &amp; their metadata  Discovering &amp; verifying data quality  AI generated data sets &amp; intellectual property  Ocean marketplace user base  Data farming  Data curation &amp; veOcean rewards  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0">Trent McConaghy on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Ocean Protocol on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Marketplace</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

<p>Guest post by Elizabeth Glass</p>
<p>January 2023</p>
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>It was great to hang out with you in my part of the labyrinth: Long Island (where I was born and raised). </p>
<p>You were a lovely guest; my son enjoyed the checkers game!</p>
<p>So what did I think about the “Alison McDowell Historical Scavenger Hunt” – visiting different places on Long Island – with you recently?</p>
<p>When I first heard about how you&nbsp;“set intentions” at historically significant locations, it was your Federal Reserve visit in NYC. I thought it was interesting…but not my thing.</p>
<p>“Burn sage at the Federal Reserve?” I was like: “You will need every pot smoker in North America to light up for THAT.” Lol!</p>
<p>I have changed; the spiritual work you are doing is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As&nbsp;Gary Null said: </p>
<p>“We have eyes, heart, kidneys…what’s the only thing that’s missing when you’re dead? </p>
<p>Energy. </p>
<p>What’s the only thing never studied in medical school or in science classes? </p>
<p>The energy of life…</p>
<p>When we die that energy that was there: where does it go? </p>
<p>Energy cannot be created or destroyed.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our&nbsp;spiritual and energetic disconnection from nature, life, and our ancestors is problematic.</p>
<p>Also, sharing consequential information and truth publicly is important given Americans are relentlessly spoon-fed fibs and criminals are crowned.</p>
<p>The “Scavenger Hunt” in and around my hometown was a bit emotional: I miss being asleep like a soldier misses home. </p>
<p>Life is so challenging now that I’m nostalgic for my unhappy childhood.</p>
<p>As a kid my mother sent me a mobile – popular in the 80’s, hung from the ceiling – with little puffy figurines dangling from strings, sent in a cardboard box about the size of a human head. During the shipping process all the strings got impossibly tangled.</p>
<p>The image of that mobile – a hot mess of a toy – and that distinctive box symbolized the puzzle of my childhood, and stayed with me.</p>
<p>Untangling it figuratively – i.e. uncovering and facing the truth – has been part of my journey.</p>
<p>Just like with Americans and our history: there is WAY more to the story than what we have been told.</p>
<p>The “journey” changed a lot when my kids were kicked out of school due to law S2994/A2371 in NYS in 2019, and I became an activist: hosting protests, organizing parents, and running for office.</p>
<p>Being a political candidate was like a roller coaster ride: both good and bad things have happened as a result.</p>
<p>Meeting some of the greatest minds in the resistance – like you – has been one of the blessings.</p>
<p>One of the government insiders we spoke with during your visit commented: “The U.S. military exists to kill people and break things, so officers make up for this by being polite.”</p>
<p>To me, this “polite masking the unspeakably impolite” summarizes the Long Island Labyrinth and the culture here.</p>
<p>Just as Long Island is geographically trapped by NYC, Long Islanders are trapped in the gold chains of the matrix. </p>
<p>It has always been that way; the health emergency declared on 3/11/20 just amplified it.</p>
<p>Long Islanders pay high property taxes for the schools: these are good parents who simply want the best – including college and career – for their children.</p>
<p>Sadly, money and prestige do not inspire deep analysis or ethical introspection.</p>
<p>Why were defense contractors paid so much…?</p>
<p>To fight the Russians or other reasons?</p>
<p>Why are medical professionals paid so much…?</p>
<p>To manage health emergencies or other reasons? </p>
<p>And so on…</p>
<p>Here is a list of the places we visited:</p>
<p>Due to current time constraints, I did not do a “deep dive” into all seven topics/places (I hope to, though); I tried to analyze each from a LI native’s perspective. After writing this guest post, I realized visuals would be needed to accompany this, so I made a video about our day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory – Eugenics Records Office</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a young child, shortly after the CSHL received it’s first “cancer-war” grant from the US government i 1972, I took classes here. I vividly recall dissecting a frog in a clean, sunny classroom. “Cold Spring Harbor” is one of the most prestigious towns in the country, and the <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/education/center-for-humanities/carnegie-building/">CSH Lab was the research equivalent of the Ivy League</a>.</p>
<p>“From its founding in 1910 until it closed its doors in 1939 the <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/archives/institutional-collections/eugenics-record-office/">Eugenics Record Office</a> at CSH Lab in NY was the center of the American Eugenics Movement.”</p>
<p>The CSH Lab boasts a staff of one thousand, including 600 scientists and research assistants.</p>
<p>The Eugenics Department at CSH Lab never “closed its doors in 1939” – rather the extensive library featuring books with titles like “Mental Retardation and Sterilization” and “The Population Problem”, is still well maintained. It appears the study of eugenics morphed into the Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>While you researched the Charles De Lisi Collection, I browsed the library and displays.</p>
<p>Of course, the people there and the facility was lovely. Reserving the parking spot for you was thoughtful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s always the “dual use” factor. CSH Lab workers believe they are fighting the “war on cancer.” People only know what they know.</p>
<p>As asked in the video: why is the Department of Energy financing DNA research?</p>
<p>Someone sent a video of a woman at the WEF meeting in Davos speaking about using DNA as an energy source, and you sent me a study, as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The grave of Henry Stimson, Secretary of War under Roosevelt and Truman&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>I grew up in a house across from the street from a school named for Stimson, the Secretary of War under FDR and Truman who oversaw the <a href="https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/profile/henry-stimson/">Manhattan Project and made the decision to bomb</a> Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing over 200,000 souls.</p>
<p>It was shocking to contemplate a reason behind these bombings was to study the health effects on survivors, and that this research has been utilized in the Human Genome Project.</p>
<p>Stimson’s grave – in a cemetery five minutes from the CSH – is impossible to find unless you ask a cemetery employee for assistance. The grave itself is not extraordinary, but the location within the cemetery of this Skull and Bones member is: it is one of the most private burial sites in the world, and would probably cost a fortune if purchased today.</p>
<p>In my heart, I sensed unquestionably that individuals have performed dark rituals in that spot.</p>
<p>As an ESL teacher for nearly 20 years, I have had countless Japanese students…absolutely outrageous that this person is honored, but – when you learn the US is actually the pit bill for the NWO – it is no different than the evil acts of U.S. presidents.</p>

<p>Children and Screens: Institute of Digital Media &amp; Child Development c/o KWM CPAs in Jericho, NY</p>
<p></p>
<p>This office, visible from the Long Island Expressway, sounds like an important and useful non-profit: helping parents deal with their <a href="https://www.childrenandscreens.com/">children’s screen usage</a>.</p>
<p>In truth – and very few understand this – the future planned for our kids is unspeakably dystopian: AI will study them, &nbsp;create their virtual twin, and that twin will exist in the Metaverse.</p>
<p>They will use our kids and mine them for data, to be financial commodities.</p>
<p>Why did Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan <a href="https://www.classy.org/event/10-year-anniversary-celebration-gala/e453021">sponsor the Children and Screens fundraiser</a>?</p>
<p>Do the officials at this non-profit care about what kids see online, or are they gatekeepers determining what is acceptable in the Metaverse without warning parents of what the future really looks like?</p>

<p>Brookhaven State Park – Adjacent to Brookhaven National Lab and Formerly Part of Camp Upton&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was also personal for me, because a close relative worked here. Again, I knew little about the research here, except – like CSH Lab – it was a prestigious gig.</p>
<p>We set an intention in the sandy oak forest of nearby Brookhaven State Park as there is no public access to this Department of Energy lab, though we did drive up the entryway and saw there was a lot of construction on site. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory">facility</a> is run by Battelle and Stony Brook University with a focus on high energy physics and nanotechnology. The lab <a href="https://greaterlongisland.com/suffolk-closeup-bnl-contamination-trial/">contaminated</a> the aquifer under the eastern end of Long Island with radioactive discharges for decades. Cancer rates on the Long Island are extremely high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The land upon which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookhaven_State_Park">park</a> and the lab are located was a former US Army base, <a href="https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Camp%20Upton%20(detention%20facility)#:~:text=Army%20encampment%20on%20Long%20Island,by%20the%20end%20of%201917.">Camp Upton</a>, which was used as a Japanese interment camp during World War II.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you to Jane Alcorn for the outstanding tour of the site of Nikola Tesla’s last remaining laboratory of Tesla: one of the great scientists of all time.</p>
<p>The site includes the footings of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardenclyffe_Tower">eighteen story tower</a> that Tesla hoped to use to transmit electricity wirelessly. It was taken down after the lab closed.</p>
<p>I would love to write a book about Nikola Tesla…his story is fascinating.</p>
<p>Tesla had been sponsored by the millionaire John Jacob Astor IV; when he died in the Titanic, support for this Long Island lab disappeared, and the site closed.</p>
<p>Volunteers are working to renovate the old lab – where an 18-story tower once stood – and create a global science center.</p>
<p>We also learned that this location, Brookhaven Lab, and the old nuclear power plant in Shoreham, and a sacred indigenous erratic boulder are all VERY close to each other; it makes you wonder if they are connected to the “Ley lines” of the world.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Long Islanders love to talk. Below is the transcript of the end of the video:</p>
<p>This is the building where Tesla‘s actual lab was, and they’re trying to raise money to renovate it (a great cause!). There had been an 18-story tower here, and check this out…(video) ‘the inventor sent huge shafts 120 feet into the soil (under the tower)…’ Could there be something special about the earth’s electromagnetic field in the spot?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was here (at the Tesla Science Center) that we learned about the historic RCA Tower that was demolished in 1977. As many older Long Islanders are aware: the nuclear power plant at Shoreham – that never opened – is also close by.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note the close proximity of these for energetically significant locations:</p>
<p>1) Tesla Science Center, a mere 2.4 miles from the </p>
<p>2) Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant</p>
<p>3) the RCA Tower</p>
<p>4) Brookhaven National Lab. </p>
<p>Again, could this location be significant in terms of the earth’s electromagnetic field?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question: why are the rates of cancer – particularly women’s breast cancer – so high on Long Island? </p>
<p>According to website, the environmental factors for women’s breast cancer are “smoking” and “grilled food.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, Brookhaven and NASA are collaborating to protect astronauts from “cosmic radiation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of radiation, Alison mentioned at Stimson’s grave that the one reason they dropped the bombs on Japan was to study the impact of radiation on human beings. Despite the well-established health effects of radiation, there is a movement to try to convince people that low levels of radiation are beneficial – <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=radiation+hormesis&amp;oq=radiation+hormesis+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l2j46i512j0i512j69i60j69i61l2.3114j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">radiation hormesis</a>. Are people being psychologically conditioned to think radiation will make them some kind of superhero, like Captain America? The “small, underdeveloped” fictional Steve Rogers was exposed to radiation and became a “super soldier.”</p>
<p>Some of the books at library at the CSH lab were about the ground water of Long Island and others were about the impacts of radiation on the body. Given the geology of Long Island where pollutants easily seeps through the sand into aquifers and its isolated nature… well, it just makes you wonder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, I want to thank Alison for demonstrating how to set intentions for healing in defense of natural life, for sending meaningful vibrations out into the world, for exposing systemic harms, and activism in defense of future generations.</p>

<p>Seychelles, 31 January 2023 — <a href="https://www.bit.com/">BIT</a>, a professional cryptocurrency exchange, has collaborated with Circle Internet Financial (Circle), a global financial technology firm and the issuer of USD Coin (USDC) and Euro Coin (EUROC), to promote greater access and adoption of USDC with fiat funds and USD/USDC settle products and to drive BIT's growth as a one-stop hub for retail and institutional crypto trading.<br><br>Circle is the issuer of USDC, one of the fastest-growing stablecoins that is currently available on many of the world's leading blockchains, with more chain integrations expected. More than $43 billion USDC is now in circulation as of January 13, 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The BIT platform offers institutional-grade security, supplemented by features such as portfolio margin and unified margin, which minimizes margin needs on hedged positions, and accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USDC, Tether (USDT) and more as collateral with respective haircut ratio.<br><br>This collaboration with Circle will allow BIT users to transfer fiat into their BIT accounts as USDC and withdraw USDC to USD via bank wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Together, BIT and Circle seek to expand crypto adoption and utility. In October, BIT launched USD-settled options. USD-settled options are more scalable for launching cryptocurrency options.&nbsp;<br><br>BIT switched all perpetual futures pairs from being USDT-margined to USD-margined from July 22, 2022 since the introduction of USD-settled options on its platform.<br><br>BIT’s USD-margined products are powered by its USD basket program, which now supports USDC. The cryptocurrency exchange also plans to incorporate more stablecoins into its USD basket in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>"BIT looks forward to a long and fruitful relationship with Circle," said Lan Yue, co-founder and COO of BIT. "Our collaboration helps us provide new efficiencies to our customers, saving retail and institutional investors valuable time and letting them focus solely on trading."<br><br>“We are excited to collaborate with BIT and look forward to working with their team. Together, we will provide the stability of USDC to BIT customers and making USDC more accessible,” said Raagulan Pathy, Vice President of Asia Pacific for Circle.</p>

Introducing Verida&nbsp;One<p>We’re proud to introduce <a href="https://verida.one/">Verida One</a>, a public platform that allows users to showcase who they are across both web2 and web3. It’s decentralized, multi-chain and censorship resistant.</p><p>Verida’s mission is to build a web where people own and benefit from their personal data to enhance their everyday experiences.</p><p>Verida One will provide people with a single source of truth that represents their ownership, affiliations, activities and social identity across all their web platforms.</p><p>With Verida One, you&nbsp;can</p>  Unlock your reputation  Create all your identities  Showcase your web3&nbsp;identity  Own and curate all your&nbsp;data  Build community trust  Showcase yourself with Verida One; One place, One&nbsp;URL.<p>People should be able to manage all their identities, their reputation, and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>We want everyone to be able to showcase who they are and what they are doing with other humans and&nbsp;apps.</p><p>We want everyone to have a trusted source of data, that they own, that provides trust, identity and reputation when interacting with others across the&nbsp;web.</p> What is Verida&nbsp;One? <p><a href="http://www.verida.one">Verida One</a> is built on top of the <a href="http://www.verida.network">Verida Network</a>. It will become a crucial part of the web3 identity and social stack enabling people to take control of their identity to signal trust and reputation to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Verida One profiles aggregate a user’s existing social identities from across web2 and web3 so they can show the many facets of themselves in one&nbsp;place.</p><p>This includes web2 identities from platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Discord, as well as web3 identities that include NFTs (avatars and others) and SBTs (Soulbound Tokens) across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Social identities can be verified and made available on chain, making the information easily accessible to on-chain&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Users can have multiple identities that represent different facets they want to present in different contexts (for example a professional and a personal profile). Users will have full control over what is shown and what is hidden on their Verida One&nbsp;profile.</p>Manage and separate your work, personal, and anonymous identities Why are we building Verida&nbsp;One? <p>Current web2 users have a set of services that allow them to display places they are sharing their identity and activities (LinkTree is an example of&nbsp;this).</p><p>Web3 lacks a service to aggregate, share and prove these existing social identities. Existing reputation primarily relies on allocation of capital, but many of the most interesting use cases of reputation are not financially based.</p><p>There is no easy solution for users to import, verify and prove existing web2 identities and reputation, which is necessary infrastructure to link this critical web2 metadata to web3 dApps and new use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>More than that, there is no single platform where you can take ownership of all the data you create in each of those separate applications. Verida One brings that data back to the individual to own&nbsp;forever.</p>Curate your content; One feed, many&nbsp;sources. What does this mean for&nbsp;web3? <p><a href="http://www.verida.one">Verida One</a> provides users with a single source of truth that represents their ownership, affiliations, activities and social identity across all platforms. This produces a trusted source of data that can be consumed visually via an intuitive web interface, via traditional web2 API’s or via web3 using on-chain records such as NFT’s and&nbsp;SBT’s.</p><p>This makes it easier for humans to show who they are and what they are doing to other humans (send them to a single URL) and to programs (by providing a consistent machine-readable API representing the user’s identity&nbsp;data).</p><p>This provides trust, identity and reputation when interacting (crypto transactions, DM’s etc.) with that user. It enables users to highlight and show off their achievements.</p><p>Users can mint Verida Badges as on-chain Soulbound tokens that represent a verified proof of ownership or proof of reputation to the indicative social media platform. Where appropriate, proof of reputation can remain anonymous and zero knowledge. This enables use cases such as proving you have 100k Twitter followers without disclosing which Twitter account has the followers.</p><p>Collectively, they allow a user to prove who they are (and are not), to build their reputation, establish trust, and gain access to communities aligned to their social identity.</p><p>This is an open project, built on an open protocol that can be remixed or used as a composable base for any web2 or web3&nbsp;project.</p><p>You can learn more about building with the Verida Network (and hence Verida One profile data) at <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">https://developers.verida.network/</a></p> When will Verida One be available? <p>Verida One is currently in private alpha as we test early functionality to provide a seamless experience for users.

<p>The following is a guest post by a friend I met this summer. I’m glad to have more sets of eyes looking at Web3 and eugenics and applying this information to their areas of expertise. This is a long-form piece, so be sure to set aside some quality time to read the whole thing. It’s important. There was a lovely synchrony here. When I got the email from Ben, I’d actually just been at the archives of the Eugenics Records Office at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory looking at materials related to the Department of Energy’s early efforts to set up the Human Genome Project, namely <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/personal-collections/charles-delisi/">Charles DeLisi’s</a> work organizing and documenting <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/455876a">a workshop in Santa Fe in 1986</a> with help from Los Alamos National Laboratory. I’ll be sharing another guest post on that expedition shortly.</p>
<p>Ben’s post:</p>
<p>The Roots of the G.E. Chestnut Tree</p>
<p>In recent years there has been a lavishly funded P.R. campaign by the <a href="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/funding.htm">American Chestnut Foundation</a> (TACF) to promote the transgenic chestnut tree, Darling 58, developed at <a href="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/funding.htm">SUNY ESF</a>. This is a significant first, as it would be the first transgenic (genetically engineered) tree to be deregulated in the continental U.S. and large amounts of funding from industry and “non-profits” have backed the project. The engineered trees express a gene from wheat (more specifically from wheat germin) that produces an enzyme called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/oxalate-oxidase">oxalate oxidase</a> (OxO). This OxO producing gene has been put into other transgenic crops and is alleged to confer some resistance to chestnut blight for reasons that aren’t clearly understood but are <a href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/61ef6ea0-869d-476a-990a-9738e3899823/1/00__OhJ__Oxalate%20oxidase-Hordeum%20vulgare__2ET1/00__OhJ__Oxalate%20oxidase-Hordeum%20vulgare__2ET1_Oxalate_oxidase.html">thought to be</a> related to OxO’s ability to produce hydrogen peroxide and break down the excess oxalic acid made by the fungus. Serious <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biotechnology-for-forest-health-test-case-american-chestnut-report-WEB-1.pdf">questions</a> have been raised about the overall, long term, ecosystem wide unknown effects stemming from putting a wheat gene into a chestnut tree and specific criticism has also called into doubt the effectiveness of this method as a long-term blight prevention strategy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Setting science aside, there’s a deep symbolic and cultural significance in combining the genetic material of these two organisms, in particular. In the Western world, wheat is the crop most associated with annual, forest clearing, plow agriculture, with the rise of states as we know them, and ultimately with the development of Western “civilization” itself in Mesopotamia. Chestnut trees, particularly in Europe but also in Asia and the Americas to some extent, were once a symbol of independence from that very civilization, of the generosity of the forest, their carbohydrate rich nuts were ground into flour that was a staple of hill people on the periphery of empire, often intentionally so, for millennia. In the mountains of France and Italy, ancient chestnut trees on terraces surrounding villages and the stone huts where the chestnuts were smoke-dried and cached for the winter are still a common sight (see above photo from France – also see the photo of the West Virginia family at the beginning of this piece). The extent to which “grains make states” worldwide has been focused on by many anthropologists in recent years (for example, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb8qQcShWUk">here</a>). Chestnuts were, after all, sometimes known as the “bread tree” and using our most advanced technology to literally make them part-wheat sounds like a joke, or a sort of final statement of conquest on the genetic level of the civilized, grain growing, forest clearers in the valley over the dispersed, independent, forest-garden hill people.</p>
<p>Here’s a smattering of the many headlines endorsing the transgenic chestnut in major publications recently: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/05/29/biotech/">Can Genetic Engineering Bring Back the American Chestnut</a>?”, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/a-radical-attempt-to-save-the-reefs-and-forests">We nearly killed off these trees. But biotech can bring them back</a>”, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/a-radical-attempt-to-save-the-reefs-and-forests">Unnatural Selection: What Will It Take to Save the World’s Reefs and Forests</a>?, “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/08/30/american-chestnut-blight-gene-editing/">Gene editing could revive a nearly lost tree. Not everyone is on board</a>.” Criticism of the project is scarce and difficult to find, even in “alternative” media, and most of it seems to be the work of <a href="https://globaljusticeecology.org/media-programs/new-voices-speakers-bureau/anne-petermann/">Anne Petermann</a> and her organization <a href="https://stopgetrees.org">The Campaign to Stop G.E. Trees</a>. <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/biotechnology-for-forest-health-test-case-american-chestnut-report-WEB-1.pdf">Here</a> is the white paper they released criticizing the project. A recent deadline for a “<a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment-error">public comment period</a>” at the U.S.D.A. on whether to deregulate (i.e. allow to be widely grown) the transgenic chestnut in the U.S. has just passed (January 26th, 2023). Online public comment periods, which are non-binding, non-transparent, and no more of a political action than tossing a coin into a fountain, have become the standard method to dress up foregone conclusions in the guise of participatory democracy. So rather than donating a “valued” opinion to the U.S.D.A.’s memory hole, the question should be asked: who is funding the transgenic American chestnut and why? In the following pages an attempt will be made to, first, briefly set the record straight that the American chestnut never actually disappeared and there is no urgent impending emergency justifying the use of genetic engineering. And second, to discuss the money and broader agendas of the individuals and organizations behind the development of the transgenic chestnut tree more at length.</p>
<p>Premature Eulogization</p>
<p>The extent to which the large scale preemptive felling of still healthy trees by lumber companies, ostensibly to slow the spread of the fungus, contributed to the subsequent scarcity of American chestnuts throughout their range is hardly ever discussed. Instead we are repeatedly assured that a pestilence from Asia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chestnut_blight">fungus</a>, in this case) is 100% to blame for the mass die off of the chestnuts. In the carefully chosen words of one of the few ecologists online even mentioning these widespread “salvage logging” operations:</p>
<p>“Already an economically important species, the Chestnut was subject to accelerated harvest by foresters and lumbermen who set out to conduct salvage logging operations on chestnuts already killed and the remaining virgin chestnut trees before they were killed and devalued by the blight. Some have speculated that this ambitious logging response, harvesting even the most remote and difficult stands of the steep Appalachians may have wiped out isolated pockets of Chestnut that harbored some genetic resistance.” (<a href="https://www.gafw.org/newsletters/2011summer_newsletter.pdf">source</a>)</p>
<p>Also intriguing in light of taking a critical look at this tendency to place all blame on a pathogen whilst ignoring all other factors is the following observation from a 1915 forestry publication quoted in the same article:</p>
<p>“There seems to be a combination of insects, fungous diseases and fire, or perhaps something more deep seated, such as a widespread but obscure soil or climatic change, of which the others are but manifestations of subordinate causes, destroying the chestnut in the South. The trees generally die in midsummer and, unlike blight-killed trees, seldom sprout from the stump after the trunk is killed.” (Ibid <a href="https://www.gafw.org/newsletters/2011summer_newsletter.pdf">source</a>)</p>
<p>Then there is the fact that wild chestnuts living long enough to produce nuts, and thus spread their disease resistance to their offspring, still exist and are not infrequently encountered by hikers in the Eastern U.S. (including the author of this piece). They are not “functionally extinct” (i.e. never living long enough to produce nuts) as we are told. The existence of these survivors of the blight and the increasing encounters with young offspring of these survivors seems to be ignored, glossed over, or judged insignificant in articles advocating for bioengineering. <a href="https://www.eaglehill.us/NENAonline/articles/NENA-29-3/11-Heinrich.shtml">Here’s a paper</a> studying a small, healthy and spreading population of trees in Maine. The <a href="https://www.accf-online.org">American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation</a> (ACCF), one of a handful of other organizations that has been overshadowed by the lavishly funded American Chestnut Foundation in recent years, has been harvesting nuts from these survivor trees and sharing them with members of their organization for many years. There are also hybrids between the American species and other species of chestnut from Asia that often have some resistance to the fungal blight. These hybrids have long been available from a variety of nurseries and the chestnuts grown as a commercial crop in the East are usually mixtures of the Chinese (mollisima sp.) and the Japanese chestnut (crenata sp.) with sometimes a bit of American (dentata sp.) and European (sativa sp.) thrown in. All of these different species from around the world readily hybridize with each other and genetic drift from the transgenic chestnut could eventually lead to most chestnuts on the planet having transgenic background. Something similar is already being seen with transgenic corn.</p>
<p>This genie can’t be re-corked. In fact, for many years TACF publicized their primary aim as being to hybridize the American and Asian chestnuts and then backcross to the American while maintaining blight resistance. It wouldn’t be surprising if many people who have supported the organization in the past think that this is still what they’re solely dedicated to doing. For example. these former members of TACF <a href="https://www.telegram.com/story/news/local/south-west/2019/03/28/chestnut-champions-quit-to-protest-genetic-engineering/5579303007/">publicly resigned</a> from the organization after their shift to promoting genetic engineering. So if the wild American chestnut isn’t actually “functionally extinct”, if there are already plenty of hybrid Asian/American trees that resist the blight, then why is the American Chestnut Foundation being so heavily funded and why is there so much recent media coverage advertising the transgenic trees from Suny ESF as the only solution to a (non-existent) emergency?</p>
<p>Enter the Modified Maize: Cold Springs and Green Revolutions </p>
<p>“In 1983, a retired plant geneticist, Charles Burnham, then age 75, decided to take action. Burnham approached a number of biologist friends including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman Borlaug and Peter Raven, the head of the Missouri Botanical Garden, to support a new private, non-profit organization dedicated to restoring the American chestnut to its native forests. Burnham and one of his former students, Philip Rutter, founded the American Chestnut Foundation (ACF) as a way of establishing and financing a private breeding program that would eventually create a blight resistant American chestnut.” (<a href="https://cei.org/sites/default/files/Ronald%20Baily%20-%20American%20Chestnut%20Foundation.PDF">source</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Burnham was one of a group of students at Cornell studying under Rollins A. Emerson, quite a few of whom went on to become “the most influential geneticists of their generation” (<a href="https://cals.cornell.edu/molecular-biology-genetics/about-us/history">source</a>). The group was specifically focused on maize (corn) which they established as “one of the best known “genetic” organisms” (Ibid). The bulk of Burnham’s work was done before the age of genetic engineering as we know it today but it was one of his doctoral students, Ronald L. Phillips, who was:</p>
<p>“…the first to generate whole corn plants from cells grown in culture, which laid the foundation for, and sparked, a new industry, using cell-culture methods to genetically modify corn plants and other cereals. The corn cell line most widely used in the world today for genetic modification of corn has greatly accelerated the improvement of corn, as food, feed and fuel.” (<a href="https://wolffund.org.il/2018/12/11/ronald-l-phillips/">source</a>)</p>
<p>Burnham later worked at Harvard under Edward M. East, who is primarily remembered for his work on corn genetics and his overt advocacy of eugenics (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Murray_East">wiki</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/inbreedingoutbre00east/page/252/mode/2up">source</a>). Another of Burnham’s fellow Cornell maize students, Milislav Demerec, went on to run Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory (yes, <a href="https://search.amphilsoc.org/collections/view?docId=ead/Mss.Ms.Coll.77-ead.xml;query=eugenics%20records%20office;brand=default/#top">that</a>, Cold Springs Harbor although the Eugenics Records Office was then closed) where Barbara McClintock, yet another student from the same program, would study corn for most of her career and eventually be given a Nobel prize for her contributions to genetics (as would yet another fellow student of Burnham’s from the same Cornell program, George Beadle).</p>
<p></p>
<p>McClintock has since been lauded and lionized and a great deal of information about her is available online (including some <a href="https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/ll/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584613X220-doc">letters</a> to Burnham). Burnham also worked alongside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Stadler">Lewis Stadler</a> described as “…a leading U.S. radiation geneticist” (<a href="https://peh-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13010-017-0050-z">source</a>) who spent most of his career studying the mutagenic effects of X-rays on food plants (<a href="http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/stadler-lewis.pdf">source</a>).</p>
<p>Norman Borlaug</p>
<p>Described in many of his high-profile and fawning obituaries after his death as the “father of the Green Revolution”, a cursory glance at the media coverage on Norman Borlaug gives the impression he may have been a deity sent from on high (or was he possibly imbued with benevolent super powers following a fortuitous encounter with a radioactive corn borer?). The Atlantic called him a “Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity”, the Huffington Post called him “The Man Who Saved A Billion Lives”, and every other major publication seems to have saluted in unison and pronounced Borlaug to be an eminently superlative individual. To get a sense of how truly hyperbolic Borlaug enthusiasts can be, have a look at his profile on the website “<a href="https://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=116">Science Heroes</a>”. However, in the <a href="https://newint.org/features/special/2009/09/21/norman-borlaug">opinion of other critics</a> of the “<a href="https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/vandana-shiva-taking-down-bill-gates-empires">Green Revolution</a>”, Norman Borlaug’s life’s work was essentially to be a poster child for a global movement by a handful of transnational corporate interests (initially the Rockefellers) to consolidate control of agriculture on a molecular and genetic level under the guise of solving an “emergency” which they themselves helped cause in the first place (i.e. the Hegelian Dialectic).</p>
<p>Borlaug received a a PhD in plant pathology and genetics, and was inspired to study plant pathology after attending a lecture entitled “These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops” (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210225071911/https://www.dallasobserver.com/news/green-giant-6389547">source</a>). He was a passionate wrestler (literally and figuratively) and has been inducted into the <a href="https://nwhof.org/hall_of_fame/bio_by_name/norman-borlaug">National Wrestling Hall of Fame</a> (see photo below).</p>
<p></p>
<p>He then worked at Dupont in the early forties where, among many other things, D.D.T. was being prepared for the American market. Borlaug later <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/233444b0.pdf">testified to an E.P.A. hearing</a> in 1971 urging them not to ban D.D.T. Borlaug began working at the Rockefeller funded International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT – its Spanish acronym). While there he helped develop wheat varieties that were especially responsive to heavy chemical fertilizer use, not sensitive to variations in local conditions, and with stout, short stems to hold up the heavy heads of grain without lodging (i.e. the classic non-locally adapted, chemically dependent, patented monoculture crop). (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050310043736/http://www.coafes.umn.edu/Borlaug_and_the_University_of_Minnesota.html">source</a>) From there Borlaug travelled the world (chiefly the “third world”) under the aegis of agricultural centers funded by the Rockefellers, the Ford Foundation, and others promoting what is now often called “industrial agriculture” by critics. He went on to win far too many international awards to list here, including the Nobel prize. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539278/pdf/hw0487.pdf">This piece</a> from the year 2000 dealing with “The Promise of Biotechnology and the Threat of Anti-science Zealotry” gives a good sense of where Borlaug was coming from and his adhominem, straw man attack against critics of genetic engineering (the aforementioned “AntiScience Zealots”) seems to have now become the primary tone and tact for corporate media to take when addressing criticisms of biotechnology. And seeing as the topic at hand is the first approved transgenic tree in the U.S., it’s interesting to note that although he spent his career coercing poor farmers to go into debt to grow patented annual crops grown with patented synthetic fertilizer sprayed with patented insecticides and herbicides and harvested with patented machinery (all of which, by a lucratively convenient coincidence, was generously developed by the companies who founded and funded the “nonprofit” research institutes he worked with), Borlaug’s undergraduate degree was in forestry. It is, after all, a gene from wheat, the crop most associated with Borlaug, that has apparently been inserted into these transgenic chestnut trees.</p>
<p>Peter Raven</p>
<p>Much like Norman Borlaug, botanist Peter Raven, is a very prominent figure in the American plant world with a glowing reputation that begins to take on a different hue when you scratch the surface and dig into his corporate ties, specifically his deep and longstanding relationship with Monsanto (now Bayer Crop Sciences). Raven was the longtime head of the Missouri Botanical Garden, which is one of the best known (read: best funded) public gardens in the U.S. The garden is not far from Monsanto’s headquarters, it’s been extensively funded by Monsanto over the years, and under Raven’s leadership the <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/Portals/0/Visit/PDFs/Monsanto%20Map.pdf">Monsanto Center</a>, “An engineering masterpiece and model of “green architecture”, was constructed to house the herbarium and facilities for the researchers. This 2015 <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2015/09/weed-whackers/">article</a> in Harper’s Magazine touches on Raven’s decades long relationship with Monsanto. And yes, Monsanto is one of several major biotech corporations to fund the transgenic chestnut tree program (source). Note how it’s the only corporation on the SUNY ESF site that breaks from the pattern of directly mentioning the organization and linking to their site. Clearly Monsanto’s reputation precedes it these days. Raven <a href="https://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/insect%20ecology%20reading/ehrlich_raven_1964.pdf">also worked with Paul Erlich</a> back in the 60’s who would go on to write the bestseller “The Population Bomb” warning of the impending collapse from overpopulation if immediate steps were not taken to lower fertility globally. Ehrlich’s predictions did not come to pass. In the late 90’s, Raven was chair of the Biodiversity and Ecosystems Panel of the President’s Committee of Advisers for Science and Technology (PCAST). This was established via executive order by Clinton along with the National Science and Technology Council. In this <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-teamingwithlife.pdf">report</a> Raven and his colleagues repeatedly emphasize the need for large amounts of federal funding for genetic engineering to manage “natural capital” with statements like “Transgenic organisms will become increasingly important as components of agricultural, health, pharmaceutical, and resource management activities”.</p>
<p>One of the key aims outlined in the report, and one that is important to keep in mind when considering the transgenic chestnut, is the much more ambitious goal of establishing a “Next Generation National Biological Information Infrastructure” (NBII-2). Essentially, this is a call for the federal government to invest heavily in extensive public/private initiatives to accumulate all known biological and ecological data down to the molecular and genetic level onto an interoperable “distributed facility” database in order to enable what they refer to as “data mining in the biodiversity and ecosystems information domain”. They specifically mention that NBII-2 will assist with genetic engineering scenarios in the future (pg. 73). This vision, which they describe as a “distributed”, “commodity based infrastructure”, that is “accrete only, no delete” sounds so similar to current blockchain based systems to gather granular, real-time data on “natural capital” so it can be commodified and bet on in carbon markets/N.F.T./“social impact bond” markets that it’s hard to believe this document was written in the late 90’s. To give just one recent example of a private sector company embodying this approach see the <a href="https://www.veritree.com/technology">website for Veritree</a>. Suffice it to say, it’s vital to keep in mind that this is the big picture view. Genetically engineered organisms like the transgenic chestnut are not being developed to fit into agriculture as we once knew it or to inhabit natural ecosystems as we once knew them. Rather, they’re being developed to fit into a new system where every aspect of life that can be quantified is put “on the ledger” using a suite of ubiquitous “smart” sensor technologies that are a part of the coming “Web3” world (see the work of <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com">Alison McDowell</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>The (Bioplastic) Board of (Evolutionary) Directors</p>
<p>Other organizations that have funded the transgenic chestnut project have ties to these same initiatives (more below) as do Members of the Board of Directors of TACF.&nbsp; A look at the current Board of Directors of TACF sheds further light on the agendas behind the transgenic chestnut. William J. Cude III, the chairman of the board, spent most of his career in the medical device industry and was the founder of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/3047574Z:US#xj4y7vzkg">Coeur Inc.</a> which provides angiography and other medical imaging equipment. Cude’s former position was “Director, Officer, Vice-Chairman and Chairman of the Washington DC based <a href="https://www.plasticsindustry.org/supply-chain/recycling-sustainability/bioplastics">Plastics Industry Association</a>”. This is the oldest and largest lobbying organization for the plastics industry in the U.S. So the chairman of the board of TACF has no background in environmentalism, or ecology, or plant science, or anything remotely related to chestnut trees but is instead a prominent plastics industry lobbyist. Is Cude simply leading the TACF out of a personal passion for chestnut trees? Perhaps, but I’d suggest it’s more likely we’ve just stumbled upon one of the key (not particularly) hidden agendas of the American Chestnut Foundation: Cude is working to help normalize the development of transgenic trees to be grown in extensive plantations for not only lumber but also biomass/pulp that will then be used to produce “bioplastics” and other cellulose based products. The Plastics Industry Association has a <a href="https://www.plasticsindustry.org/supply-chain/recycling-sustainability/bioplastics">bioplastic section</a> on their site and it’s clear that plastics manufacturers are ironically being steered towards bioplastics by prominent calls to “go green” from organizations like <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/industry-giants-coca-cola-and-pepsico-ditching-pro-plastics-lobbying-association/">Greenpeace</a>. In fact, this has been openly stated as the key purpose of many other transgenic trees around the world (as outlined on The Campaign to Stop GE Trees <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/chestnut/">website</a>) and it becomes increasingly hard to deny when you look into ArborGen (more on them below).</p>

<p>Timber behemoth Weyerhaeuser, America’s largest private landowner has also contributed to the project. Duke Energy has given support through the <a href="https://centertrt.org/policyplan.pdf">Forest Health Initiative</a>, which is dedicated to “Advancing Forest Health Through Biotechnology”, as has the <a href="https://www.nhla.com/staff-and-board/">National Hardwood Lumber Alliance</a>. Vice Chair and Governance Committee Chair, Rebecca Carter, seems to have been facilitating transactions between industry and government for many years. Among other positions she was the Director of Federal Agency and Congressional Government Relations for the <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/?tab_q=tab_container-tab_element_451082477">Nature Conservancy</a> and she also “worked in government relations roles at Columbia Gas Transmission” and “West Virginia Division of Natural Resources”. Her father-in-law, former President Jimmy Carter, is himself listed as an “Honorary Director” of TACF). When judging the initiatives that the <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/about/trustees/index.html">Carter Center</a>, where Becky was C.D.O. before retiring, chooses to invest in, it’s valuable to keep in mind the Carter administration’s close relationship with Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter’s National Security Advisor and fellow member of David Rockefeller’s Trilateral Commission, and his ideas on the coming “<a href="https://ia600602.us.archive.org/13/items/B-001-003-798/Zbigniew_Brzezinski__Between_Two_Ages.pdf">Technetronic Era</a>”. Reading through Brzezinski’s explanation of what the “Technetronic Era” is and the effects it will have is similar to recent descriptions of what is now being called “the Fourth Industrial Revolution” and the link between what we might call “technocracy” and environmentalism seems to have been firmly established in the public mind in the Carter era.</p>
<p>Another board member worth noting is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mandy-cromwell-7a6b63a?original_referer=">Dr. Mandy Cromwell,</a> a Senior Director of Pharmacology at <a href="https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-and-arbor-biotechnologies-establish-new-partnership">Vertex Cell and Genetic Therapies</a>. Vertex says they are using gene editing to help treat diabetes, cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases. Needless to say, “gene therapies” have received an enormous amount of attention in recent years. Dr. Deborah Delmer, the Science and Technology Committee Chair, is a professor emeritus of plant biology at UC Davis and “In 2004, she received from the American Chemical Society the Anselme Payen Award in recognition of excellence in the science and chemical technology of cellulose” (emphasis mine). Delmer’s bio goes on to say that “From 2002-2007, she served as Associate Director for Food Security for the <a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/reset-the-table-messaging-guide/">Rockefeller Foundation</a> where she was involved with grant making and policy relating to the role of biotechnology in developing world agriculture.” These days she “serves on a number of advisory boards and consultant to foundations, academia, industry, and governments on developing world agriculture issues surrounding biomass production” (emphasis mine).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dennis Liu “is currently Vice President of Education for the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation and the <a href="https://www.half-earthproject.org/programs/">Half-Earth Project</a>. Previously, he directed the production of educational media at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vPK-ibEo-o">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a>”. The Half-Earth Project is essentially putting into place something analogous to the NBII-2 vision described above. They’re one of many institutions dedicated to gathering the most ecological data possible by using the most advanced surveillance, monitoring, and tracking technology in order to, you guessed it, save the earth. You might say they do, in fact, want to “save” the earth, but in the computational sense of “File &gt; Save”. The CEO of that project is Paula Ehrlich, “formerly President and CEO of the Drug Discovery Center of Innovation” (her relation, if any, to Paul Ehrlich is unclear to me). The relevance and legacy of recently deceased and fervently revered Harvard entomologist, E.O. Wilson, another honorary board member, is far too large to cover here. Suffice it to say, it’s worth looking into how his research into social insects (specifically ants) has overlapped with social engineering, economics, and cybernetics (touched on in this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2023/01/05/a-tucson-labyrinth-ants-in-an-age-of-artifice/">lecture</a> or this <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/11/06/the-economics-of-crystalline-emotion-neuroeconomics-part-2/">post</a> and in some of the research being funded by the Templeton World Charity Foundation mentioned below).</p>
<p>There’s also no time to do justice to the many years of public / private maneuvering of the next board member, Ambassador Catherine A. Novelli. She is “is a Senior Advisor at <a href="http://shearwater.global/international-advisory-board">Shearwater Global</a>, a strategic consulting firm” with a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/authwall?trk=bf&amp;trkInfo=AQEeT0vCtL5XuAAAAYX-mZRgLchmk3huiV-MMWjZC6fw1qJHic8VPe2Iwkh6D6fEKm14UNlqyyyw6Yx7MO09eXzRI8v3r0GPlkjH-pP6hPmdbuqxYBvTUusr4PiITxpjeOXMzgU=&amp;original_referer=&amp;sessionRedirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fshearwaterglobal">linkedin profile description</a> that is recommended reading. They’re dedicated to coming to the rescue of their corporate clients dealing with the fact that “barriers to business are back in vogue. Businesses are strong-armed into doing what politicians want. Economic policies are being weaponised, protectionism legitimised and borders rebuilt.” She also serves as President of <a href="https://listeningforamerica.org/what-we-do/">Listening for America</a>”, a sort of focus group and corporate intelligence organization that does “listening sessions– in the form of conversations–with a cross-section of Americans about their experiences with international trade and globalization” while also providing “up-to-date, impartial, fact-based information about international trade”. They appear to be both gathering information about how redundant people feel about the Fourth Industrial Revolution and also exposing them to propaganda on why it’s good for them. A quick look at t<a href="https://listeningforamerica.org/about/board-of-directors/">he board</a> will let you know whose interests they represent. “She also launched the <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/events/global-connect-initiative">Global Connect Initiative</a>, an innovative partnership with governments, multilateral development banks and the private sector to connect 1.5 billion people to the Internet.” Enormous public/private infrastructure projects like this are essential for building the “Web3” future that transgenic organisms will inhabit. This connects nicely with her “seven years as Vice President, Worldwide Government Affairs at Apple Inc” where she was “responsible for Apple’s federal, international, and state and local government relations and public policy”. So it’s no surprise that she’s a also member of the <a href="https://www.cnas.org/support-cnas/cnas-supporters">Center for a New American Security</a>. CNAS is associated with, among others, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqMe1J4a6IQ">Eric Schmidt</a>, formerly of Google, along with the Pentagon, and major arms manufacturers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To give some idea of where CNAS is coming from, they were heavily cited by Schmidt et al in the now notorious 2021 <a href="https://www.nscai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Report-Digital-1.pdf?download=1">National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence Report</a> framing the rapid development of A.I. and weaponizing of dehumanizing, all-pervasive technologies as a national security necessity due to a new Cold War with China. Of course, this military technology is also being employed in agriculture and forestry. <a href="https://www.xa.com/en/about/csr">Tree planting drones</a> such as the one pictured above, to give just one example of such technology, are already being used in tree plantations in Brazil and elsewhere. XAG, who manufacturers the above drone, tells us on their website that “technology is a great equaliser” and assures us that they are deeply dedicated to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (the yardstick by which “Impact Finance” deals are evaluated). They call this “Agriculture 4.0”. Much more could be said about Novelli in relation to her position as a corporate lawyer at <a href="https://www.mayerbrown.com/en">Mayer Brown International</a>, an enormous “white shoe” law firm with offices around the globe, prior to becoming a public/private liaison between Silicon Valley and Washington, a broker for “free trade” agreements in the Middle East, and a high-tech “environmentalist”.</p>
<p>And lastly, for the sake of time although there are more board members worth mentioning, if you’re wondering who’s been crafting the stories that have managed to portray a genetic engineering biotech project developed and funded by all the usual suspects as a romantic, grassroots, noble cause of ecological restoration you might have a look at board member, <a href="https://neonliterary.com/about">Anna Sproul-Lattimer</a>. She’s a Beltway area literary agent who “believes that there’s no more powerful tool for social change than a good story. It’s why she works in publishing; it’s also why she dedicates most of her TACF volunteer work to promotion and outreach, spreading the story of the American chestnut across the country and world.” Which raises the question: whose story is this, anyway?</p>
<p>Branching Out: Hopping Down the Money Trail </p>
<p><a href="https://www.arborgen.com/in-vitro-services-biotechnology/">ArborGen</a>, another funder of the transgenic chestnut project, is “the largest global seedling supplier and the leading provider of advanced genetics for the forest industry.”. They’re now operating <a href="https://www.arborgen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ArborGen-Partnership-with-SCFC-Final-02.27.2018.pdf">a state nursery in South Carolina</a>, their “l<a href="http://www.rubicon-nz.com/arborgen/">argest sales position is in the US-South</a>“, their products “are specifically developed for land owners and managers supplying the sawtimber, plywood and other structural wood products, packaging, pulp and paper, and industrial markets (including bioenergy)”, and they manage “16 nurseries, 16 seed orchards, 32 distribution centres and three research and development facilities located throughout the United States, Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia.”. Currently they’re primarily focused on eucalyptus and pine. The graph below from ArborGen’s “<a href="http://www.rubicon-nz.com/arborgen/business-model/">business model</a>” page compares corn yields over time, from open pollinated corn through G.E. corn, with ArborGen’s claims of their genetically superior tree yields. Remember how heavily the initial founders and funders of the transgenic chestnut were involved with corn breeding? This hammers home the fact that transgenic corn is the model for transgenic trees.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s ArborGen’s <a href="https://www.arborgenholdings.com/board-of-directors">board</a>. And just to give an illustration of how the same people who are funding environmental biotechnology schemes, and thus investing in “natural capital”, are also usually funding “Social Impact Finance” schemes, investing in “human capital”, note the presence of David Knott Jr., who runs the hedge fund <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001077285">Knott Partners</a>, ArborGen’s largest shareholder. The Knott family descends from N.Y.C. hotel executive and Tammany Hall politician, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Knott">David H. Knott</a>. Knott partners was founded by Knott Jr.’s father, David M. Knott, who went to the Wharton school and has been deeply involved in Impact Finance for many years (see <a href="https://sayyessyracuse.org/team/david-m-knott/">Say Yes to Syracuse</a> – and also check out that project’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC_Inc.">other funders</a> including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC_Inc.">Syracuse Research Corporation</a> and the quite creepy <a href="https://www.air.org/resource/spotlight/good-behavior-game">American Institute for Research</a> and it’s more than 50 years of <a href="https://www.siop.org/Research-Publications/Items-of-Interest/ArtMID/19366/ArticleID/832/History-Corner-John-C-Flanagans-Contributions-Within-and-Beyond-I-O-Psychology">behavioral conditioning research</a>). Also see the <a href="https://www.higrogroup.com/impact">HiGro Group</a> where the current Knott Jr. is on the Advisory Board and their prominent display of the S.D.G.’s on their site. He’s also a member of the Advisory Board of the <a href="https://nz.linkedin.com/company/tenon-clearwood-limited-partnership?original_referer=">Tenon Clearwood Limited Partnership</a>, who “is responsible for exporting approximately 30% of the total pine products from New Zealand to the US, and is the fifth largest containerised exporter out of New Zealand”. Their <a href="https://tenonclearwood.com">website</a> assures us they’re “sustainable”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.esf.edu/communications/view.asp?newsID=8589">Templeton World Charity Foundation</a> gave SUNY ESF the “largest-ever charitable gift, $3.2 million” in the history of the school in 2020 “to support one of the College’s most impactful research projects – the restoration of the American chestnut tree.” Unlike many other “non-profit” funders of this project, TWCF isn’t especially well known for supporting “environmental” causes (case in point: they have a picture of the <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/restoration-american-chestnut-tree">unrelated “Horse Chestnut” tree on their site</a>). So why are they throwing such significant sums of money into the transgenic chestnut? In a previous $200,000 grant from 2017 they say the funding will be used to “support key personnel and activities to acquire regulatory agency approvals for distribution. The grant will also sponsor engagement with local and state indigenous peoples”. The more recent and generous $3.2 million gift is also stated to, among other things, assist in “completion of regulatory review”. In terms of the “engagement with…indigenous peoples” it’s worth noting that although some Eastern Cherokee have <a href="https://stopgetrees.org/indigenous-peoples-unite-stop-genetically-engineered-trees/">vocally opposed</a> the transgenic chestnut tree for many years the government of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, whose tribal lands are west of Asheville, N.C., signed a <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/2021/05/15/new-orchard-american-chestnut-trees-planted-cherokee-territory-southern-appalachians/4986864001/">Memorandum of Understanding</a> in 2021 with the American Chestnut Foundation not long after the TWCF received Templeton’s ample gift.</p>
<p>The TWCF’s support of the transgenic chestnut seems to compliment another recent grant to <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0400">gather, engineer, and commodify plant genetics</a> awarded to the “<a href="https://www.croptrust.org/about/governance/executive-board/">Global Crop Diversity Trust</a>” which <a href="https://www.croptrust.org/work/projects/the-templeton-pre-breeding-project/">aims to</a> use “new methods and tools, like speed breeding and genomics, to revolutionize the breeding of improved varieties of neglected crops, which will get climate-smart crops into the hands of smallholder farmers more quickly.” and is doing this with “innovative financing, such as member-country loans, food security bonds, crowdsourcing and crop-based fundraising”. The Crop Trust is what the next-generation Green Revolution looks like, even working with many of the same institutions such as the International Rice Research Institute that Borlaug worked with so many years ago. They’re dedicated to aggregating the genomics of crops and wild crop relatives around the world on behalf of their N.G.O. benefactors. The Crop Trust has proudly described themselves and given awards to collaborators they describe as “global gatekeepers of crop diversity”. Again, this project aligns closely with the NBII-2 vision mentioned above where “protecting biodiversity” refers to N.G.O.’s like the Crop Trust “diversifying their portfolio” of genomic data and even “going long” by not only gathering the genomics of food crops, but also of wild crop relatives.</p>
<p>To consolidate the genetics of wild forest trees, such as the American chestnut, is the next logical step in this same direction of engineering and commodifying the D.N.A. of all life on earth. Strangely, the TWCF’s more typical fare is the study of <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/30059">intelligence</a> in a wide variety of conscious beings and the attempts to try to quantify and assign metrics to previously indefinable qualities like <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/honesty-humility-and-humanity-how-epigenome-and-mindfulness-shape-moral-decision">honesty</a>, <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0520">altruism</a>, and <a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/projects-database/0492">spirituality</a>. Basically, to put it in Phillip K. Dick terms, the TWCF is dedicated to helping the androids pass the “empathy test”. In fact, they aren’t even subtle about this goal; one of their initiatives is called “<a href="https://www.templetonworldcharity.org/our-priorities/diverse-intelligences/beyond-turing-test">Beyond the Turing Test: Elucidating the Similarities and Differences between Machine and Biological Intelligence</a>.” Considering this, their reasons for throwing so much money into this particular project aren’t entirely clear aside from the fact that patenting genes, genetic engineering, and erasing the line between the natural and the artificial seems to be right in their wheelhouse. Either way, the fact that the largest ever single donation to SUNY-ESF, a major N.Y. state school that has been around for many years and receives no shortage of funds from industry partners and their N.G.O.’s, was given to this transgenic chestnut project is significant in and of itself.</p>
<p>History’s Rhyme Scheme, SUNY’s “Restoration” Scheme: The Next Stanza</p>
<p>Although it may sound far-fetched to suggest that SUNY ESF, via direct funding and through its connection to TACF, is being used to cloak an incredibly environmentally destructive timber industry/biotech agenda in the vestments of environmental restoration and “scientific forestry”, it actually wouldn’t be the first time. SUNY ESF has its origins in the N.Y. State College of Forestry, the first such school in the country, established as a division of Cornell University in 1898. After being shut down by a highly publicized <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1903/06/18/archives/cornell-school-of-forestry-suspended-action-followed-failure-of.html">scandal</a>, the school officially reopened at Syracuse University in 1911 and then incorporated into the State University of New York (SUNY) system when it was established in 1948. The scandal, which resulted in N.Y. state’s governor withdrawing funds from the college and the president of Cornell officially closing it down, came to a head in the N.Y. State Supreme Court case “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/people-v-brooklyn-cooperage-co-2">People vs. Brooklyn Cooperage Company</a>.” It revolved around the Forestry College using public funds to purchase nearly 30,000 acres in the Adirondacks (Franklin County) “to conduct upon said land such experiments in forestry as it may deem most advantageous to the interests of the state and the advancement of the science of forestry, and may plant, raise, cut and sell timber at such times, of such species and quantities and in such manner, as it may deem best, with a view to obtaining and imparting knowledge concerning the scientific management and use of forests, their regulation and administration, the production, harvesting and reproduction of wood crops and earning a revenue therefrom” (Ibid). After 30 years they were supposed to give the land back to N.Y. State to become a forest preserve.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The college ended up buying this “Forest Preserve” from the Santa Clara Lumber Company and immediately signed a deal with the Brooklyn Cooperage Company who built a factory on the land and laid a railroad to it (see photo above). At this point, under the guise of “scientific forestry”, the Forestry College began clearcutting it, sometimes replanting it to high-value conifer species, sometimes not. The contract stipulated that “the company agrees to take and the university to deliver at its own expense, for a period of fifteen years, such amount of wood as the company shall give written notice it requires, provided the amount shall not exceed yearly more than one-fifteenth of the wood standing on the college forest”. The expenses were allegedly so high for Cornell (who, as a public college at that time, was simply spending public money) that they didn’t even make a profit (on the books, that is).</p>
<p>The incident serves as a sort of cautionary tale regarding the potential pitfalls in “public/private partnerships” between the government, academia, and industry. However, it’s worth mentioning that this isn’t necessarily the consensus view. This <a href="https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cornell_Roots-of-American-Forestry-Education.pdf">article</a> defends Bernhard Fernow, Dean of the Forestry College at the time, makes no mention of the Brooklyn Cooperage Company or any of the details of the case, and implies that rich landowners with summer homes not far from the “Forest Preserve”, who Fernow disparagingly called “the bankers”, simply undermined and smeared Fernow because they didn’t want cutting near their vacation homes. Seeing as Fernow would have recently returned from the <a href="https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Harriman+Alaska+Expedition+%281899%29%22">Harriman Alaska Expedition</a> and had connections with the funder of that expedition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._H._Harriman">E.H. Harriman</a>, a Gilded Age railroad tycoon and financier whose surname would become forever synonymous with high finance, along with other rich and prominent New Yorkers, it’s difficult to imagine Fernow as a misunderstood everyman scientist being unfairly persecuted by arrogant rich people. This may well be an early example of framing all local opponents to environmentally destructive projects as privileged “N.I.M.B.Y.’s” (from: “not in my backyard”), which has since become a default method of discrediting local opposition to environmental degradation.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether his project was harried by snobs or not, the idea that Fernow was a pioneer of “scientific forest management” is beyond dispute. Unfortunately, this takes on a different light when you understand that this “scientific forest management” consisted of clearcutting tens of thousands of acres of native forest and replanting it with monocultures of high market value, tightly packed, conifer species. Now, as this “scientific forestry” officially enters a new era in the U.S., one which will impose monocultural uniformity and control on a genetic level, should it surprise us that it’s coming out of essentially the same institution where Fernow first proselytized it?</p>
<p>Should we expect different results from this old dog that’s learned a new trick?</p>
<p>End of Pt. 1</p>
<p>Thanks for putting this together Ben!</p>
<p>PS: I (Alison) touched on&nbsp;Borlaug’s <a href="https://www.cimmyt.org/about/our-history/">International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’s</a> research in corn hybridization in a post I did last year about a conditional cash transfer program that was piloted in Mexico in the late 1990s.

<p>At Brave, we work hard to minimize the tracking of our users on the internet, and that includes interaction with services run by Brave itself. But we don’t expect you to take our word for it; we try to make our privacy features something you can verify.</p>
<p>Many of our features depend on services configured with various providers. We’ve created a view into how that configuration protects your privacy. It’s your data, so you deserve to know how it’s handled. You can follow the steps below to review our work.</p>

 Address privacy 
<p>When devices send or receive data over the internet, they use an Internet Protocol (IP) address to identify themselves. This is an intrinsic part of how the internet works. While addresses aren’t necessarily unique or long-lived, it’s inevitable that the sites you visit will see these identifiers. The web doesn’t work without them.</p>
<p>To address this potential exposure, we sometimes have visitors connect to our sites and services through a proxy. The proxy sees the visitor’s IP address, but when it forwards the request to our servers, we see only the proxy’s IP address, not the real address of the visitor. Traffic is encrypted so the proxy can’t learn anything about what the visitor has to say; that’s private between the visitor and us.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>For example, if you enable Brave Rewards or use Brave News, the items the browser shows are decided locally, on your device—it’s none of our business which item the browser thought you’d be interested in. To protect your privacy, we download some of that content through a <a>private content distribution network</a> where requests go through a proxy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because user tracking is so prevalent, most proxy services have options to forward the original visitor’s IP address, decrypt the contents of the request, or both. That’s the opposite of what we want! So it’s important that we turn all those options off when we configure our sites to use a proxy.</p>

 Verification 
<p>To check the current configuration of a Brave proxy, you can visit the <a href="https://brave.github.io/config-attestation/">audit page</a> and examine the settings for each service. They’re listed by the domain name of the service where we’re using the proxy to separate the IP address from the contents of the request.</p>
<p>Correct configuration will look something like this:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Examine the logs for the fetch and display config step. You should see something like this:</p>
 <code>{
  "domain": "pcdn.brave.com",
  "modified_on": "2020-06-25T23:16:38.918708Z"
  "protocol": "tcp/443",
  "proxy_protocol": "off",
  "traffic_type": "direct",
}
</code> <p>This displays key values that control our configuration of Cloudflare’s <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/cloudflare-spectrum/">Spectrum proxy</a> for our private content distribution network:</p>
 
 domain: This describes the website the proxy is forwarding for. Match this up with the Brave service endpoint you’re auditing. Cloudflare is accepting traffic for this domain name and routing the traffic to their own internal servers first so they can strip the IP address. 
 modified_on: The date the configuration was last updated. 
 protocol: A value of tcp/443 indicates the proxy accepts normal encrypted https traffic. 
 proxy_protocol: This should be off, meaning the proxy does not forward the IP address of the visitor via the <a href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/blob/master/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">PROXY protocol</a>. This means Brave can’t use it to track you! 
 traffic_type: A value of direct here means https traffic is forwarded directly to Brave’s server without decrypting it. Although Cloudflare sees the client IP address, this means they don’t learn anything about the content of the request or our server’s response to it. 
 
<p>By contrast, this is what it might look like if an endpoint were configured to make it possible to track visitors by IP address:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>The above example uses the port for unencrypted http, and passes on the original client IP address. We’ve added an “X” and dotted underlines to mark some of the problems with this config so it’s easy to check at a glance.</p>
<p>By publishing these values, we offer some assurance that we’re not able to track clients connecting to these services. Since the configuration data comes <a href="https://api.cloudflare.com/#spectrum-applications-get-spectrum-application-configuration">directly from Cloudflare</a>, it accurately represents the real proxy parameters. Because the query is processed by GitHub, we can’t have changed the values before reporting them.</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>More technical users may want to consult the GitHub Actions workflow log linked at the bottom of the page to verify the data was obtained correctly by a runner under GitHub’s control. You’ll need to be logged in to GitHub to access data on that page.</p>
<p>Happy checking!</p>

      AI Recruits a New Hybrid Workforce        <p>By Konstantine Buhler</p><p>Published January 26, 2023</p>        AI models keep getting better at generating human-level work. Now the hard part, bringing magical products to the office.      



 
<p>If you are following the amazing demos people are making with Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT, you might think the latest wave of AI is all about fun new modes of communication. It’s not. Under the hood, it’s all about work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI is computation; best guesses based on statistics. It is work; joules of energy dissipated through the movement of information. Despite the flashy new veneer, AI is not a revolution in communication but in productivity. It’s not the printing press or telegraph, it’s the assembly line, the jet engine, technologies that produce work rather than transfer information. And for knowledge workers, the latest developments in AI represent a new paradigm for work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although computers are a form of information technology, the ways we use them are still quite mechanical. Much of our work remains trapped in the physics of W = Fs, forcibly pounding our keyboards, displacing our attention across emails, spreadsheets and websites, foraging for the bits of information we need to compose some work product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contemporary AI promises something new altogether: a higher level approach where we work in deep collaboration with software. Computer programming moved from imperative to declarative languages and office work is just catching up. This is the new age of declarative work, made possible by the massive amount of information compressed into today’s text, image and code models. The ease of prompt interfaces and the ability to quickly generate variations will result in higher quality work products per unit of human effort.</p>



<p>The proliferation of AI into everyday office software (finally!) has the potential to create a new kind of hybrid workforce. We may soon enter an era when all of the apps you and every other knowledge worker use every day—your document editor, spreadsheet and presentation maker—will do part of your work for you. The more mundane aspects will be truly automatable—but the real breakthrough will be the teamwork between you and your software. You will have new, virtual teammates to write a first draft, instantly provide research and answer the most arcane questions.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Will you feel like you have new, trusted digital colleagues, or a bunch of untrained interns to worry about?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This mix of humans and intelligent agents will increase individual productivity and enable leaner teams to do more, but will also be a lot to manage. Not only are generative work outputs subject to problems running from mediocrity to outright hallucination, enthusiastic overuse could make work and the internet itself even noisier. Will you feel like you have new, trusted digital colleagues, or a bunch of untrained interns to worry about?</p>



<p>In the physical world, humans have shared the factory floor with robots for decades. Workers, though, haven’t been programming their own automations, so these robots have been more like furniture than coworkers. This current wave of automation will change that. Companies like the German robot maker <a href="https://www.robco.de/en">Robco</a> now offer easily configurable industrial robot arms designed to be auxiliary workers for small manufacturing teams.</p>



<p>The great monolithic office software suites from Microsoft and Google have also felt like furniture. These are applications we work on rather than with. As AI changes this, how will human workers adapt? And equally important from our perspective, where are the opportunities for disruption in this new way of working?</p>



 Making it work 



<p>The coming AI revolution will look nothing like the internet explosion of the past 25 years. The internet was a revolution in how humans communicate. AI will be a revolution in how we work. Gaining distribution will be more difficult, and require companies to build passionate communities and unique customer value without becoming overly dependent on an incumbent’s expensive or restrictive platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ai-a-creative-new-world/">creative new world of generative AI</a>, sharing code and models is the new engine of distribution. What Github is for code, Hugging Face is for models. Developers can use it to easily patch together models and datasets into bespoke pipelines. And Replicate has an easy-to-use API that lets users run open source models in the cloud. Unlike the Imagenet pioneers in 2012, you no longer have to have a PhD to deploy an ML model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The elephants in the Zoom are the office suites themselves. Microsoft and Google have their productivity apps installed on nearly every computer on the planet, and many companies use both. The incumbents have deep moats, but also blindspots. The once mighty IBM discounted the threat of the personal computer (and Microsoft) to its peril, and history has a way of repeating itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of the pillars of the office suite is a potential vector of disruption. But could the office suite itself, based on the paradigm of human readable documents and messages, be disrupted? Today’s large language models (LLMs) are trained on public information and produce general purpose results. Will tomorrow’s leading companies preserve their advantage by building their own models and custom applications the way we now make spreadsheets or write memos?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first beachheads for challengers will likely be vertical apps, but the individual pieces of the office suite make attractive targets given Microsoft 365’s 345M paid users and Google Workspace’s 3B (mostly free) users. The office suite is just one of many software surfaces that startups can attack, but it’s a significant one. Could a 10x better doc editor, spreadsheet or slide maker powered by LLMs make a dent?</p>



<p>Ultimately, the result of all this innovation in AI will lead to something very different than office software on a PC. It will feel like an extension of ourselves; part assistant, part machine. But we won’t get there without a leap of imagination akin to the PC itself. In the meantime, there’s work to do.</p>



you writing with a doc writing with you



 The document editor 



<p>One of the main forms of work we do on our computers is writing, but the document editor itself has always been more about the formatting of words than the words themselves. Market success for these apps has also been driven more by their modes of distribution than product innovations.</p>



<p>WordPerfect was the early leader but ceded the field to Microsoft by failing to make a Windows version early on. Each new release of Windows was an occasion for the next version of Word, sold separately on a disc.</p>



<p>Google changed little about Word when it released Docs on the web in 2006, but it had a distribution advantage…it was on the web. In 2010 Google acquired the technology to let multiple people edit Microsoft Office documents on the web simultaneously. Online distribution and collaboration completely changed the way teams worked together. All Microsoft could do was follow suit with what became Office 365.</p>



<p>There have been many challenger doc editors over the years, Hemingway, Ulysses, Dropbox Paper, Salesforce Quip and most prominently today, Notion. Many of these apps aimed to simplify the writing experience, but Notion bypassed the old paradigm all together. There are no “pages” or skeuomorphisms, just documents fit for the internet age, designed for a screen and built to connect. Unsurprisingly, Notion has also been quick to <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai">incorporate generative AI into its product</a> in a seamless way.</p>



<p>Coming at the problem sideways, Canva has continued to expand its offerings beyond social media and marketing graphics and recently released a document editing application that includes a generative “magic write” feature. There may be an upcoming generation of social-first entrepreneurs for whom Canva represents their office suite.</p>



<p>The big emerging opportunities for doc editors in the age of generative text is to innovate on the writing experience itself. As AI researcher Katy Gero recently wrote in <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-writing-art/">Wired</a>, AI can intervene in three distinct parts of the writing process, planning, drafting and revising. Current generative systems focus on the first two. Most applications will draft sentences and paragraphs for you as a completion of your prompt. More sophisticated approaches might return an outline for a blog post based on a headline.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big emerging opportunities for doc editors in the age of generative text is to innovate on the writing experience itself. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Just as the writing process is iterative, generative writing assistants also work best as recursive loops that the writer uses to converge on their desired outcome. It is not hard to imagine generative agents trained on constructive criticism that can offer feedback from different perspectives as you revise your piece. Eventually we may come to take this virtual writers’ room for granted as we do spell check today.</p>



<p>The first breakout text generation apps, like Jasper and Copy.ai, specialize in marketing copy. Their early success may be an artifact of the preponderance of marketing language in the training data for LLMs themselves. Nonetheless Jasper is a good example of a challenger playing the SaaS marketing game well. Following the HubSpot playbook it has cultivated a very enthusiastic community and created an engaging product. By relying on GPT-3 for its model infrastructure, it has been able to focus its efforts on the hard work of building its own distribution channel.</p>



<p>The biggest market for AI enhanced writing apps may turn out to be people who find writing difficult with current tools. This will take a more holistic approach than the first crop of vertical writing tools and the imagination to remake the writing process. Lex is an early stage generative writing product that pairs a fully featured doc editor with both generative prompts and an adjacent chatbot that can gather facts and answer questions to supplement the writer’s efforts. AI affords new ways of working which means novel and delightful product thinking can really make a difference.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Future applications will go much further: they will guide brands and individuals towards creating qualitatively exceptional content.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Applications can also combine generative feedback with traditional analytics and ML pattern matching. Jasper, for instance, provides SEO metrics on generated text. Future applications will go much further: they will guide brands and individuals towards creating qualitatively exceptional content.</p>



<p>Exceptionalism is one of the most promising areas for startups because it falls outside the scope of the large office suites. Brands and eventually individuals will want to fine-tune underlying models to capture their own unique voice. Right now, generative text sounds plausible yet generic. In Jasper’s premium Boss Mode you can add “tone of voice” keywords to your prompt (e.g. “Elon Musk”) much as you can add style suggestions (e.g. “digital art”) in image generation apps. But organizations and individuals want their writing to sound differentiated. We value a high-quality writer for their voice, not just their word count. There will be demand for easy ways to take your proprietary corpus of text and fine-tune a model on it.</p>



<p>Finally, looping back around to the planning process, generative models trained on code, like OpenAI’s Codex, have demonstrated emergent abilities for “chain of thought” and complex reasoning. It is possible that the doc editor of the future will be able to poke holes in your argument and not just give you a series of bullets based on what millions of other people have already written.</p>



math is still math



 The spreadsheet 



<p>Visicalc, the original spreadsheet for the Apple II, was the first “killer app,” a program so valuable to business and academic users that it gave them a pressing reason to buy the whole computer. Microsoft actually launched the first version of Excel for the Mac in 1985 before following on for Windows two years later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even more than the document editor, spreadsheets flourished in the graphical user interface. Where Word over-indexed on formatting, Excel delivered increasingly sophisticated functionality to the point that Excel formulas are now the world’s most popular programming language. For geeks, Microsoft’s introduction of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/lambda-the-ultimatae-excel-worksheet-function">LAMBDA</a> functions in 2021 makes Excel Turing complete.</p>



<p>Google Sheets, launched in 2006, has kept rough feature parity with Excel, but as with Docs its main differentiator has been online distribution which eased collaboration. Excel appeals to power users with macros, larger data capacity and more visualization options than Sheets. Both spreadsheets have ventured into automated data analysis and formula suggestions in recent years potentially blocking new AI-powered challengers. And Google’s new <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/12/introducing-simple-ml-for-sheets.html">Simple ML</a> add-on for Google Sheets puts TensorFlow within the grasp of no-coders.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bringing computational abilities to words and images is a new thing, but spreadsheets are computational to their core. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>There is however no true Notion-like competitor in the spreadsheet space for the hard core spreadsheet user. If you’re embarrassed to touch a mouse when in a spreadsheet (guilty as charged!), Airtable or Rows won’t do it for you. But automating quantitative work in spreadsheets should be a slam dunk application for this new era. Most likely this will not come primarily through generative approaches but from more rigorous formal methods. Math is still math.</p>



<p>GPT3 turns out to integrate quite easily into existing spreadsheets via extensions that add =GPT() functions. It’s also possible to use language models to transform text prompts into working spreadsheet formulas. And perhaps a prompt interface could streamline tedious data cleaning and validating? Another application we would love to see would be the ability to specify synthetic data to fill out spreadsheets for modeling purposes.</p>



<p>The biggest moat for incumbent spreadsheets is inertia and user familiarity. Yet it’s easy to forget that spreadsheets themselves already represent a tremendous amount of automation. Bringing computational abilities to words and images is a new thing, but spreadsheets are computational to their core. The biggest disruption may be the merger of spreadsheets into document environments (see Notion and Coda) to create code notebooks for office workers.&nbsp;</p>



a magical experience



 The presentation maker 



<p>Powerpoint is an island of creativity in office life and unsurprisingly presentations are the only part of the office suite that Apple has had traction. Slideshows seem primed for their generative AI moment, but decks themselves are unlikely to overturn the reign of the big office suites. But if presentations peel away from the suite—if Powerpoint is no longer good enough—the result could weaken the bundle.</p>



<p>Powerpoint and Slides have become design software for non-designers, but challengers like Canva are now applying the social media toolset to decks. Figma has made inroads with designers for making slides and offers FigJam for non-designers. Notion, a suite unto itself, has become a favorite of startup founders for their pitch decks.</p>



<p>One thing the main challengers in the presentations space—Figma and Notion—have in common is their emphasis on community as a way of building out functionality through templates and plugins. Figma’s plugin ecosystem provided a fast ramp to incorporate AI features like prompt-driven prototypes and generative icons without any changes to the core product. These communities are not technically open source, but they share the enthusiasm and good will associated with it. As we’ve seen with Hugging Face, open source represents an important distribution medium for AI technologies as do energized user communities. Any challenger who wants to enter these markets will have to build a productive fan base.</p>



<blockquote>

</blockquote>



<p>Figma has had a big effect on the way design software has encroached on the bastion of the office suite in many companies. As products like Retool and Github Co-pilot make it 10x easier to build and code internal tools, a much wider swath of office workers will become engaged in making products which inevitably need to be wireframed and designed. We will address the AI disruptions to the worlds of design and code in a forthcoming post.</p>



<p>As with generative text, companies and individual designers will want to put their stamp on the visuals, so there may be a multi-modal platform play for a product that can ingest brand assets and spit out fine-tuned models for use across generative apps.</p>



<p>A real presentation standout at the moment is Tome, which is generative AI native, not a bolt on. It is currently in beta but has the ability to generate entire slide decks from a prompt, make variations of individual slides or add new ones and rewrite lines of text. This is the kind of magical work experience that people expect when they see Midjourney or ChatGPT and it may be that slide decks will be its first natural home.</p>
 







 
 A new kind of work 



<p>What does an enduring AI-native company look like? Will it follow the playbook of the PC era and be the next version of the word processor or spreadsheet? Will it follow the AWS model and provide metered infrastructure for personalized AI workloads? Even better, will it be the next Microsoft, Google or Apple, integrating human and AI workers into new operating systems and hardware?</p>



<p>Obviously, big tech companies with massive investments in AI are not going to let their incumbent distribution advantage slip away easily. Yet their business models and scale place them in an innovator’s dilemma that impedes their embrace of the new products and services that could undermine them.</p>



<p>Disruption is inevitable. The world of highly-distributed AI applications capable of producing human-level work products is very different from the winner-take-all mass distribution of the internet era. Ironically, it was this extreme centralization that pushed the internet corpus to the critical mass that made the scale of large language models possible.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The world of highly-distributed AI applications capable of producing human-level work products is very different from the winner-take-all mass distribution of the internet era.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are clear dangers, though, in accepting machine outputs as “good enough.” For individual workers there is the risk of producing large amounts of mediocre work. Knowledge work, whether marketing or scientific research, is valuable to the extent that it is particular and excellent. Not all knowledge work needs to be “true” in a factual sense, but it all needs to be “correct” for its intended purpose. The raw ability of AI systems to produce content places an even larger premium on our judgment and critical thinking skills.</p>



<p>For organizations, the profusion of generative outputs will create obvious risks of inappropriate content but also less obvious ones like cultural drift. If they rely on third-party models supplied through applications they risk losing control of their own message. Top brands will want to fine-tune their models for their voice and style while also hiring and retaining workers that can tell the difference. After all, successful businesses are different from their competitors.</p>

 Learn what metadata is, who can access it and how to protect&nbsp;it <p>Data Privacy Day is on 28 January this year! It is the perfect occasion to take stock of where we are when it comes to online privacy protections. In good news, end-to-end encryption is becoming firmly established as the norm. There is now broad recognition that good privacy protections enable secure online communication. In addition, secure communications is the very basis for meaningful online interactions, from social life to commerce.</p><p>But as the sheer volume of digital communications continues to increase — and with the advent of AI driven surveillance — it is no longer the content of your message that matters, but its metadata. In fact, the metadata can often reveal things about your life far more accurately than the content. Your message content might contain your thoughts and opinions, but the metadata reveals your&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Consider this metaphor: you have a bird’s eye view of a busy city. You are watching the cars as they travel through the bustling traffic of the city. Now, from your position you cannot see what or who is inside any given car. But you CAN see its color and size, what house it leaves from at what time, where it is going, how frequently it travels between those addresses and more. From that information, you can deduce quite a lot about what is going on: who is visiting whom, the nature of their relationship, even details about their health, habits, wealth and more. This, in short, is metadata.</p><p>In this blogpost we give a primer on metadata surveillance and what can be done about&nbsp;it.</p> What is ‘metadata’? <p>Firstly, what is metadata really? It is the data about your message, including its:</p>  Origin  Type  Destination  Time  Length  Size  <p>…and pretty much any other identifiable patterns of your messages.</p> What can it be used&nbsp;for? <p>Metadata can be analysed to reveal internet traffic patterns. These patterns are like a fingerprint, in fact there is a type of attack called “website fingerprinting”! In these types of attacks, someone would download all the pages on a website, analyse the metadata of these pages and then match these to the patterns of traffic. They can thereby learn which specific page a person might be looking at. Now, imagine the website for example provides health&nbsp;advice!</p><p>In short, metadata can&nbsp;reveal:</p>  Which specific web page you visit, even over&nbsp;HTTPS  Which web domain you request over encrypted DNS  What you are typing, even in an encrypted web application (search, taxes,&nbsp;health)  What you say in a voice conversation over encrypted voice&nbsp;channel  <p>…and more.</p> Why is metadata valuable? <p>So metadata reveals a lot, but there are other reasons for why it is valuable for anyone wanting to spy on&nbsp;people.</p>  It is machine readable, making it the preferred target in AI driven surveillance and makes it easy to analyse large volumes of&nbsp;data.  It doesn’t take up much storage, compared to say a video file, which means it is easy to collect and store lots of&nbsp;it.  It is openly available!  It is currently unprotected by the&nbsp;law.   Who has access to metadata? <p>Unfortunately, metadata is largely unprotected, meaning there are a lot of actors who have direct access to it. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Internet Service Providers  Internet Exchanges  Autonomous systems  BGP routers  Internet backbone  Even your wifi router,&nbsp;LAN  <p>…and eavesdroppers, including, famously, the&nbsp;NSA.</p> So what can we do about&nbsp;it? <p>The most effective protection against metadata surveillance today are mixnets. Let’s go back to our original metaphor. Now imagine you are looking down at the busy city, but all the cars are identical. And what is more, they pass through tunnels and under bridges, where they then emerge from but you cannot pinpoint which car is exactly which and if they have changed lanes or&nbsp;not.</p><p>This is essentially what a mixnet does. It encrypts internet packets in layers of encryption that make all packets look identical. It then ‘mixes’ these packets by having them route through three layers of what are called ‘mix nodes’ where they are mixed with other identical looking packets and micro time delays are added. It becomes pretty much impossible to trace and analyse who is speaking to who. A mixnet makes it impossible for a snooper to&nbsp;know:</p>  What you are&nbsp;saying  Who you are communicating with (sending or receiving messages)  When you are communicating  How long you are communicating  From where you are communicating  The amount of data you are sending or receiving  Any patterns in you communications  Whether you are communicating at&nbsp;all  <p>Nym is a decentralised, permissionless mixnet run by node operators all over the world. This is cybersecurity for and by a global community. And what is more, there is a token to make sure that this community of operators and supporters is sustained in the long&nbsp;term!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p>Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market (in 2018 eight of the top ten best-selling drugs worldwide were biologics). Targeted monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), therapeutic proteins that bind to specific target sites, have become a cornerstone of treatment guidelines for a wide range of solid tumors, resulting in improved outcomes by reducing the severe side effects of conventional chemotherapy. However, the tumor microenvironment continues to pose physical barriers that hinder the penetration of macromolecules into solid tumors — even antibody fragments are unable to saturate the tumor and achieve uniform distributions due to shorter half&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Creasallis is developing its own antibody engineering platform, CreaTap, aimed at improving the penetration of antibodies into the tumor microenvironment while ensuring a long enough half-life to provide the best of mAbs and antibody fragments. The founder, Zahra Jawad, has spent 15 years in antibody engineering at GSK and Agenus and was most recently head of programs at&nbsp;bit.bio.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>The market for antibodies (valued at over $186 billion in 2021) has continued to grow as the number of approved novel therapies rises, primarily driven by the ability to treat complex diseases. We believe that Creasallis’ antibody platform can be a single, plug-and-play engineering solution which can serve the antibody oncology market. Moreover, pairing CreaTap with existing antibodies could enable better half-life and efficacy and also prolong the exclusivity life cycle of blockbuster antibodies, while delaying the emergence of biosimilars (copies of previously successful biologics), making it an attractive opportunity for partnerships with large&nbsp;pharma.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/zahra-jawad-724a2716">Zahra</a> and the entire Creasallis team on their mission to make antibody therapies available to a much larger patient population.</p>

<p>The DERO Foundation is happy to be announcing some of the new features that are going to be included in the next release of Engram. The Engram Team has been working very hard on all these features so first and foremost I want to thank them for all of their hard work. This next release is truly a home run and I hope you all appreciate it as much I&nbsp;do.</p>Engram GUI Wallet for&nbsp;DERO<p>Now that we have that out of the way, we’ll move on to the fun stuff. We’re going to go over some things that are included and a few things that were removed from Engram. First we’ll start with a list of what was added to Engram in this&nbsp;release.</p><p>Sending and receiving funds and assets natively — this may be a given for funds but the ability to also be able to send and receive assets is a welcome upgrade for most users. An easy to use GUI interface for this is vital for making DERO NFTs and Tokens easy to&nbsp;use.</p><p>An Easier UI/UX — Many changes here to make Engram easier to use/troubleshoot, error handling and feedback as well as all common and known issues have been fixed. There has also been some graphical updates that make the wallet feel smoother and make the User Experience just that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Private Messaging — Fees for messaging are now lower, more feature have been added and the UI has been improved for a better experience overall.</p><p>Gnomon Support — Gnomon is a decentralized search engine which is mostly used for searching for and identifying assets on smart contracts and is essential to the underlying functionality of certain dApps. It’s very powerful as well as useful and now supported.</p><p>Asset Tracking — Now, thanks to Gnomon support, Engram has built in asset tracking and management. Users can actually see the assets they own as well as send/receive directly from&nbsp;Engram.</p><p>Human-readable addresses (Usernames) — Engram now fully supports human readable addresses including the ability to register them, this was a hurdle for a lot of users trying to get their human readable addresses but now it’s super easy! For those that don’t know, on the <a href="https://www.dero.io">DERO blockchain</a> you can register a wallet address to a short, easy to remember name instead of using a long string of numbers and letters. For example, you could use the address “cupcake” to have people send you funds. Names are case sensitive though, so make sure you always pay attention to spelling and capitalization, it&nbsp;matters!</p><p>File Signing/Verification — With the next release of engram you perform file signing within the wallet. You can essentially verify files as if you were signing them with&nbsp;GPG.</p><p>Encrypting/Decrypting data — Not only can you verify files, you can also encrypt data strings. This feature doesn’t support full file encryption yet but for now you can encrypt smaller strings of data similar to an encrypted notepad.</p><p>Smart contract deployment/execution — Now, I asked in a twitter poll that included four features and asked users which one they wanted to hear about the most. This one by far was the subject people wanted to know about. In the new Engram wallet users will not only be able to dynamically interact with smart contracts in the wallet, they will be able to launch them using a&nbsp;GUI.</p><p>This makes launching smart contracts (even for us mere mortals) super easy to do. While this hasn’t been an issue for developers to use, the fact it will be so easy using Engram just lowers the barrier to entry even further to those that want to launch their own contracts without using complicated command line based RPC&nbsp;calls.</p><p>Smart contracts will be able to be launched by the wallet but there will also be an additional check to make sure that the contract parses correctly in DVM to at least catch some issues before launch. So, overall this should be a pretty cool feature for everyday users and developers alike.</p><p>Last but not least, let’s checkout Netrunner.</p>Netrunner — DERO Network&nbsp;Gateway<p>Now that the Engram team has given some key details on what they have added to the next release of Engram, let’s quickly cover what has been removed for stability reasons. This should help users who have been having issues with the wallet crashes. The following two items were removed from Engram but there is a standalone alternative already in place&nbsp;:</p>  Integrated Miner  Integrated Daemon  <p>These two items were just bundled together as a standalone GUI daemon and miner called <a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">Netrunner</a>. You can get Netrunner at the address below to easily run your own DERO node and CPU&nbsp;mine.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner">https://github.com/DEROFDN/netrunner</a></p><p>Users that want to run their own node and mine with a GUI can still run Netrunner at the same time they are running Engram. Separating the daemon and miner from the Engram wallet itself was only done in order to fix the stability issues some users had and prevent&nbsp;panics.</p><p>Overall, this is going to make DERO even easier to use for more users and unlocking more utility on the blockchain by making it more accessible to everyday users. Having cutting edge technology while making it easy to use has always been the goal of the DERO project and the Engram team has delivered on that&nbsp;front!</p><p>As always, stay tuned and keep an eye out for the official release of the all new Engram&nbsp;wallet!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/deroproject/update-for-the-engram-gui-wallet-for-dero-is-full-of-new-features-79cdf84fe9a7">Update for the Engram GUI wallet for DERO is full of new features</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/deroproject">DERO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of a new frontier in biology and medicine unparalleled in human history. Scientific advances like the latest generation of CRISPR, new computational methods, entirely new cell and gene therapies, cell-free synthetic biology and breakthroughs we cannot even imagine today will unlock the applications and treatments of the future. Moreover, as the precision of molecular interventions and cell delivery systems improve, and manufacturing infrastructure matures, these technologies will have a positive impact on millions of people around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>At the same time new technology / tooling is changing the biology game along a few vectors: i) cost ii) ability to program, simulate and iterate and iii) entrepreneurial accessibility. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage disease, but also reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. This includes biotechnology, therapeutics, advanced diagnostics, precision medicine and genomics, as well as synthetic biology, which has the ability to revolutionise the production of advanced materials and ingredients (i.e., alternative proteins, textiles, fertilizers, energy, flavors&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>We are looking for individuals who can stake a claim at the intersection of these multiple evolving fields in human health and biology and bring a holistic view to make sense of how nature inspired technologies can transform the fundamental well-being and longevity of every human being on our&nbsp;planet.</p><p>As a generalist firm, BlueYard views the biology companies, networks and protocols we invest in as key parts of a broader fabric of systems for a more decentralized, sustainable and empowered future and we plan to continue to apply this core thesis in health, life sciences and synthetic biology (e.g. <a href="https://www.bit.bio/">Bit.Bio</a>, <a href="https://biofidelity.com/">Biofidelity</a>, <a href="https://clock.bio/">Clock.bio</a>, <a href="https://www.creasallis.com/">Creasallis</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/expressionedits-6ffe6b6b1db2">ExpressionEdits</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">Insempra.bio</a>, <a href="https://www.meatable.com/">Meatable,</a> <a href="https://www.positive.co/">Positive.co</a>, <a href="https://www.rarebase.org/">Rarebase</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/visolis-8bed9fafa93c">Visolis</a>, <a href="https://www.zafrens.com/">Zafrens</a>), but also beyond to areas such as breakthrough engineering efforts (e.g. <a href="https://www.chemify.io/">Chemify</a>, <a href="https://www.corintis.com/">Corintis</a>, <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/freedomfi-302ef8fae260">FreedomFi</a>, <a href="https://marvelfusion.com/">Marvel Fusion</a>, <a href="https://seeqc.com/">Seeqc</a>, <a href="https://spaero.bio/">Spaero</a>, <a href="https://vsparticle.com/">VSParticle</a>), crypto protocols (e.g. <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>, <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://radicle.xyz/">Radicle</a>, <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/">OpenZeppelin</a>) and new economic operating systems (e.g. <a href="https://centrifuge.io/">Centrifuge</a>, <a href="https://dance.co/">Dance</a>, <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a>, etc.). Anyone joining team BlueYard should be excited about the prospect of connecting the dots and learning about new fields, some of which might be out of your comfort&nbsp;zone.</p><p>We are excited to be expanding the BlueYard team with a Principal position, either remote or based in Berlin, supporting the team in finding and backing entrepreneurs that are decentralizing markets and empowering humanity. At the core of BlueYard is the belief that venture capital is a product for entrepreneurs, and if you are inspired by working with an intellectually curious, small and value-driven team, we want to hear from&nbsp;you.</p><p>The Principal role includes:</p>  Leading investments in synthetic biology, health and life&nbsp;sciences  Sourcing new opportunities mainly across Europe and the&nbsp;US  Working directly with the two General Partners, embedded in a small team, allowing for a steep learning curve and significant exposure to the entrepreneurial ecosystem  Helping develop our brand and portfolio / founder services for biology and life&nbsp;sciences  Identifying technologies and trends that will positively impact economies and societies and represent attractive venture investment opportunities  Carrying out market and company due diligence on investment opportunities  Working with our portfolio companies to support&nbsp;them  Helping with our community management and&nbsp;events  Supporting with fund reporting and&nbsp;analyses  <p>Here’s what we’d like you to bring to the&nbsp;table:</p>  A strong understanding of and passion for life sciences (biology, medicine, or similar).  Several years in a biology / life science investing role or equivalent business / corporate development experience  Self-(fire)starter — be able to run on your own, identify opportunities and prioritise without much&nbsp;guidance  The ability to clearly articulate thoughts and opinions about markets and companies, both in written and spoken&nbsp;form  Strong interpersonal skills — happy to work extensively within the team and with entrepreneurs  Ability to carry out market and financial analyses  Native (or close to) English language skills both written and&nbsp;oral  The willingness to roll up your&nbsp;sleeves  <p>If you are interested in the position please send the following to <a href="mailto:team@blueyard.com">team@blueyard.com</a>:</p>  Your CV  If applicable, a collection of links that best characterize your online&nbsp;presence  <p>Our process will then be as&nbsp;follows:</p>  After initial screening we will invite selected candidates for a video interview  We will then invite a limited group of candidates for personal interview with both the team and our entrepreneurs in Berlin (or remote as appropriate for health&nbsp;safety)  A decision will be made shortly thereafter

<p>Guest Post By Christopher Roth</p>
<p>Leaving San Luis Obispo and heading northwest on Highway 1, you travel through several canyons – where the hillsides are decorated with a wonderful peppery scented mix of sagebrush and chaparral.&nbsp; The steeper canyon ridges are interspersed with gently sloping pastureland that is studded with the captivating elegance and expansive crown of Quercus agrifolia, the Coastal Live Oak.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain times of the year this landscape alone can resemble some sort of bizarre hybrid world – when surreal pastel base tones are overlaid with <a href="https://thomaskinkade.com/">Kinkadian</a><a>[1]</a> light filters cutting through swirling mist.&nbsp; When that dense Pacific Ocean marine layer pushes into the canyons one can spot little elfin foglets dancing in emerald fields as they evaporate in imagined splendor.&nbsp; It can be quite beautiful.&nbsp; Then you break out of the canyon, and on those clear, typically cloudless afternoons, you are confronted with the magnificent sight of a living behemoth – Morro Rock.</p>
<p>Morro Rock, if you have never seen it, is an impressive feature of the California coastline.&nbsp; Morro Rock has been known as a sacred site to at least two first world peoples in the area, the Northern Chumash Tribe, and the Salinan Indians. Just one of the “Nine Sisters” (or nine volcanic peaks in San Luis Obispo County), Morro Rock is part of a relatively small, long since extinct volcanic complex from the Oligocene epoch that formed over 23 million years ago. Morro Rock is the last of the Sisters and is the only one that sits at the water’s edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Salinan people called it Lesa’mo’ and believed it to be a holy place where the Hawk (or Falcon) and Raven of ancient legend lured the two-headed serpent <a href="http://morro-bay.com/morsels/dillon/">Taliyekatapelta</a> to the rock where it wrapped itself around the base.&nbsp; As the beast chased them into the air the birds took their knives and cut the Serpent to pieces.&nbsp; Salinan elder John Burch remembered when he was as boy his grandmother would take him to the top of Morro Rock twice a year, on the calendar Solstice’s, to commemorate the defeat of the two-headed Taliyekatapelta.<a>[2]</a></p>
<p>The council members of the Northern Chumash Tribe, however, have come to believe that the Rock was so sacred that it should never be climbed.&nbsp; The Chumash called the rock Lisamu and insisted that “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-morro-rock-20150314-story.html">Lisamu is alive with life</a> that needs to be protected and honored, not trampled upon.”<a>[3]</a>&nbsp; Since becoming a state park Morro Rock had been deemed a critical species habitat and provided an immense rookery for migratory and seafaring birds as well as raptors like the once endangered peregrine falcon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sparing the reader from the full-fledged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring">Silent Spring</a><a>[4]</a> debacle and the tendency for DDT to remain in the soil for decades, it should be noted that the peregrine falcon was an endangered species, for reasons we will not fully investigate here, and it was the kind of endangered species that was adored by the American public and Government scientists alike.&nbsp; Being a raptor, it hunts with uncanny vision and kills its food, reaching top speeds of up to 240 mph in its signature swoop.&nbsp; It hits its prey from above, knocking it unconscious before carrying it off to its nest to be picked apart by its brood.&nbsp; It is the fastest bird in the world, and it is renowned for its maneuvering abilities and trainability alike.&nbsp; It is an apex predator and has been used in falconry across the planet for thousands of years.&nbsp; In other words, it is precisely the kind of animal humans love to worship and Governments love to promote.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 1969, climbing the rock was made illegal.&nbsp; By that time, Silent Spring had been out for over five years and pressure was mounting from the public to establish Morro Rock as a peregrine falcon preserve.&nbsp; It was an obvious place to make studies and record data with easy to document declines in several bird populations, not just the falcons.&nbsp; On January 1st, 1969, Morro Rock was designated California historical landmark 821 and the entire surrounding area became a State Park and peregrine falcon wildlife preserve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the years before it was afforded state protections, Morro Rock had been quarried extensively, losing up to 40% of its natural mass since colonial contact.&nbsp; Originally it was blown up to provide the rock to build the Port San Luis Breakwater between 1889 and 1913.&nbsp; According to <a href="https://www.spl.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/3141283/corps-joins-chumash-to-celebrate-reunification-of-morro-rock/">construction records</a>, approximately 250 tons of stone was taken from Morro Rock to build the breakwater.<a>[5]</a>&nbsp; And as listed on the Port of San Luis website the breakwater at the Port of San Luis wharf was constructed by <a href="https://www.portsanluis.com/2206/Port-History">congressional action</a> to provide safe harbor for the export of cattle and agriculture goods and import of lumber and dry goods.<a>[6]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morro Rock continued to be quarried off and on as needed through the decades, all the way up until It’s 1969 landmark status.&nbsp; In addition to the Port San Luis breakwater material, the stone for the enhancements at Morro Bay and structures around Morro Rock itself, including the present-day causeway connecting the rock to the shore, was also blasted off the massive rock face.&nbsp; It is hard to imagine the original size of Morro Rock and how it might have looked before it was pilfered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, before American Industrialists set up shop, and even before the Spanish missionaries and ranchos had established their dominion in the area, Morro Rock was an island, surrounded by water.&nbsp; In her research paper titled Preserving Nature and Culture at Morro Rock Angela Dillon wrote of a time she spoke with “Patti,” the sister of the well-known Salinan Tribal member John Burch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dillon recounted a phone conversation she had with Patti in March of 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patti told Dillon a story that when Patti’s mother was a little girl, water completely surrounded Lesa’mo’ and that “Kids would take rowboats out to the rock, but they were unable to land because of the hundreds of little black rattlesnakes that inhabited it.”</p>
<p>Patti also explained to Dillon that the Salinan’s believed that “all rattlesnakes originated from those on Morro Rock.” Dillon opined in her paper that perhaps this is the reason behind the ancient Legend of Falcon and Raven defeating the serpent, the rattlesnakes being the remnants of the many cut up pieces of Taliyekatapelta that fell back to the land.&nbsp; Patti also told Angela that “John had been climbing Morro Rock since he was a teenager” and wanted to obtain “legal” permission so he could continue to do so.<a>[7]</a></p>
<p>Thus, if Burch had been climbing Lesa’mo’ all those years in accordance with his tribal customs and rituals, Dillon found it a bit irresistible to ponder as to precisely why Burch had waited until the year 2000 to express his interest in “legally” obtaining a permit to ascend the rock and resume age old tribal traditions with the state’s permission.&nbsp; John Burch’s case sounded sincere.&nbsp; What sort of elite educated environmentalist or overly patronizing government agency wouldn’t abide with such a modest request by one lone Indian?&nbsp; Joe Mette, Superintendent of California Department of Parks and Recreation said at the time: “It’s broadly the policy of the department to allow reasonable requests for religious practices to take place on state park property.”<a>[8]</a></p>
<p>Although the Northern Chumash were believed to be the exclusive inhabitants of the area, John Burch from the Salinan Tribe was awarded a permit from the CA State Parks Department in the year 2000 to climb the rock for “ceremonial purposes.” By 2006, the Salinan Indians, the CA State Parks administration, and the Native American Heritage Commission had sketched a use plan for a select number of Salinan tribal members to legally climb the rock on certain pre-ordained dates.<a>[9]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps by chance, but the year 2000 was also around the same time that the Duke Energy Corporation, who was at the time the lawful owner of the old PG&amp;E steam plant directly adjacent Morro Rock, announced their intention to demolish the three iconic towers and build a new, more modern power generation station.&nbsp; Had that demolition gone through, the company would have been required by law to have any associated tribal members present to oversee excavation should artifacts or burial grounds be unearthed.&nbsp; As indicated in Dillon’s paper, some of the peregrine egg counting environmentalists and some of the local Chumash people suspected Burch may have been attempting to curry favor with Duke Energy executives in the hopes he might be awarded the responsibility of monitoring their construction project on behalf of the Salinan tribe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Salinan tribe, being much smaller in tribal enrollment numbers than the federally recognized Santa Ynez band of Chumash Indians, (and the unrecognized Northern Band of Chumash Indians) could certainly have benefited from the added attention in the spotlight.&nbsp; The process for a tribal community to become ‘federally recognized’ in the modern legal sense of the word is daunting.&nbsp; It takes years, more typically decades, and along the way it often divides whatever fragile tribal community existed as the Elders who have been holding their people together for generations are once again forced to make concessions and negotiate with the Federal Government of the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the year 2022, many modern tribes still struggled to gain recognition. I have imagined this process for the present-day Indian to entail a sort of hybrid necromancy whereby the Indian is asked to make a pledge to join the same violent fraternity that has violated him and denied him so many times before. &nbsp;Hazing rituals may include reanimating generational bloodline traumas for the sole purpose of extracting tokenized relics that could establish legitimacy before the courts and possible trading rights with the enemy.&nbsp; But then, at the very last minute, the whole hazing ritual will be exposed as a cruel joke, an elaborate production – and the room will be flooded with spotlights, leaving the poor Indian naked and exposed in his religion and worldview.&nbsp; There he stands, the entire audience staring at him, laughing at him, amused amongst themselves that he fell for the same trick, again.</p>
<p>I will not speculate a definitive motivation as to the ‘why’ and the ‘when’ John Burch appealed for ‘permission’ from the state government when he did.&nbsp; For purposes of this discussion, it does not matter.&nbsp; What does matter is that regardless of his sincerity, John Burch drew criticism from both Northern Chumash tribal members and peregrine falcon crazed environmentalists.&nbsp; In fairness of the environmentalists, there was a substantial return on investment at stake.&nbsp; “Under a cooperative effort among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, state wildlife agencies, The Peregrine Fund, Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, and the Midwestern Peregrine Falcon Restoration Project, more than <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yuch/learn/nature/peregrine-falcons-recovery.htm#:~:text=In%20August%201999%2C%20the%20U.S.,of%20the%20Endangered%20Species%20Act.">6,000 American peregrines</a> have been released since 1974.”<a>[10]</a></p>
<p>Infringement into the sensitive falcon habitat of the rookery atop Morro Rock was deemed necessary if performed as part of an employee’s official duties.&nbsp; Authorized state agents and assigned personnel need not bother to obtain permission to do their job.&nbsp; Officially, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife list of Endangered and Threatened Species in August of 1999.&nbsp; However, post-delisting monitoring was set to continue until 2015.<a>[11]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ‘to climb or not to climb’ dispute continued well past the Duke Energy plans to demolish the power plant.&nbsp; The Chumash, despite admitting that their peoples had ascended to the top of the rock for ceremonies in the past, now insisted they would be content honoring those ancient traditions at the base of the rock.&nbsp; The Northern Chumash Tribal Council (a separate entity then the Federally recognized Ynez Band of Chumash) went so far as to file suit in 2014 to prevent any claim by Salinan people to the rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dennis J. Balsamo, attorney for the Northern Chumash council, wrote in documents submitted to San Luis Obispo County Superior Court that “there is no historic or religious connection between the ancient Salinan people and Morro Rock.”<a>[12]</a>&nbsp; The documents further asserted that the historic boundary between the two tribes was forty miles to the north at Ragged Point in Monterey County, as researched by the anthropologist Robert O. Gibson.</p>
<p>State Law in California required that the state parks department consult with Native American tribes when sacred sites of first world peoples are caught up in public works projects or marred in controversy.&nbsp; The <a href="https://nahc.ca.gov/about/">Native American Heritage Commission</a><a>[13]</a> was an organization set up in 1976 by the State of California legislature to, among other duties, act as legal counsel or mediator in such disputes as the one that brewed between the Salinan and Northern Chumash tribes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a letter dated December 4th, 2017, the Commission reached the conclusion that while “Morro Rock is sacred for many Tribal communities and individuals…any climbing of the Rock should be prohibited in accordance with federal law.”<a>[14]</a> At the time of this writing, that letter was still proudly displayed on the <a href="https://northernchumash.org/2017/12/20/honoring-lisamu/">Northern Chumash Tribal website</a>.</p>
<p>To reach this rather unclimactic finding, the NAHC contracted with two Doctors who served on the State University payroll as college professors, both of whom had “extensive education and experience” and were “experts in this field.”&nbsp; No substantiation was given as to how the experts had arrived at this distinction and no further appeal was made by the Salinan to divulge the processes the University Doctors and NAHC had used in their determination.&nbsp; The peregrine falcon, perhaps itself a descendant of the mighty bird that defeated Taliyekatapelta, had been deemed the winner and was granted supreme roost on the rock.</p>
<p>The state, always eager to absolve itself of guilt (past present or future), evaded further entanglement by reminding both tribes that Federal Law (predominantly the Endangered Species Act and its lingering preserve for peregrine falcons) should trump any ancestral claims to the rock.&nbsp; The state, despite acknowledging the rock is in fact state property and as such, did possess all legal authority necessary to permit or deny religious observances on top of the rock if it desired, did an about face and denied either party the right to climb the rock.&nbsp; The state did this by enacting collaboration between two experts who also served on the state payroll.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lest I remind the reader, this is the same state who had acted as benefactor at the request of federal legislators a century prior to blast Morro Rock apart and build the Port of San Luis breakwater.&nbsp; This is the same state that led the nation and developed its own <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bk-2018-1283.ch001">pesticide law in 1901</a> requiring manufacturers to guarantee their concentrations.<a>[15]</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Northern Chumash Tribal council insisted this was some sort of victory for their Tribe and that “from now and into the future our most sacred Lisamu (Morro Rock) will be honored in a good way.”<a>[16]</a></p>
<p>I see no winners. Nor do I see any losers.&nbsp; I see only confusion.&nbsp; I see confused souls swimming in a sea of cognitive dissonance where the continued tides of state violence ebb and flow, lapping relentlessly against the dwindling memories of a people that refuse to die, who refuse to drown as they bob helplessly looking for a ‘permitted’ place to moor their lost souls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like Morro Rock itself, the Salinan and the Chumash have been blasted apart and stripped of their natural inherent beauty as human beings.&nbsp; And as it too often the case, if anyone, or anything is to decide their lives shall be “improved,” it shall be at the sole permission of the same state or government or military that took away their birthright.</p>
<p>In August of 2022, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers held a ceremony called “Reunite the Rock.”&nbsp; The purpose of the celebration was to “welcome home” rock that had been quarried to build the breakwater.&nbsp; Many prominent Chumash leaders and people of other tribes gathered as pieces of the original Morro Rock returned by tomol (a type of planked, seafaring canoe made by the traditional Chumash) and the pieces were carried by human chain from the landing beach up the rocky shore where the stones were placed in a circle around a fire.&nbsp;&nbsp; Col. Julie Balten, the Corps’ LA District Manager said: “The story of this reunification is one of hope and collaboration,” and “It is the story of realizing what is possible if we work together for something greater than ourselves.”<a>[17]</a></p>
<p>Despite the fact that the Corps first approached the Northern Chumash in 2017 with their intent to merely remove and replace the stone during improvements to the breakwater, this recent event was orchestrated with much publicity as a way to, according to Balten, “support the indigenous people here, bring back some of their culture and reunite this rock.”&nbsp; Only in 2021 was it determined that new, more modern rock would be required for the breakwater improvements and that the “old stone” would in fact no longer be needed.&nbsp; Thus, despite this small concession, the ceremony marked the beginning of the return of Morro Rock.&nbsp; While the project is slated to return the displaced rock, the placement area will be approximately 1500 feet west of Morro Rock in an area designed to “provide ancillary environmental benefits to marine species.”<a>[18]</a></p>
<p>During the Reunite the Rock event one tribal community was noticeably absent, despite their long and well documented connection to the sacred landmark.&nbsp; On the <a href="https://salinantribe.com/">Salinan Tribe</a> website Robert Piatti, Council member, Cultural Preservation &amp; Protection Lead, offered his own opinion, quoted in full below following the Salinan Winter Solstice ascent of Morro Rock:</p>
<p>Welcome to Winter Solstice.&nbsp; We, the people today known as the Salinan Tribe, welcome all to the base of Lesa’mo’, Morro Rock, as we share food and stories, and members of our tribe ascend to celebrate all that is sacred.&nbsp; Sacred is the defining term – the Creator made the World, all the plants and animals, even all humans.&nbsp; I personally believe, as Lakota spiritualist Little Crow taught, “Everything is Sacred.&nbsp; Everything is Related.”</p>
<p>We are often asked, who owns Lesa’mo’, Morro Rock?&nbsp; Isn’t this Chumash land?&nbsp; Our answer is easy, but not simple.&nbsp; Morro Rock belongs to nobody, but rather, we, the Salinan Tribe, belong to Morro Rock.&nbsp; Our ancestors lived and prayed here, and we continue this today and tomorrow.&nbsp; We are still here, and we will remain.&nbsp; The very Western Civilization concept of “land ownership” is part of the heart of what troubles us all today.</p>
<p>Ignorance, greed and hatred are powerful evils.&nbsp; Just look at dysfunctional Sacramento, war-ravaged Ukraine, the assault on the spirit of American Democracy in Washington D.C. for examples, and the fractionation (it’s a word, look it up some time – fractionation) of today’s world is on display.&nbsp; Ignorance and greed win too often, and when they do, we all lose.&nbsp; I’ve been trying to fight against ignorance and greed and outright hatred of others for just a short time now, and in those fights, I find myself challenged to not let those characteristics find their way into my own thoughts and words.</p>
<p>I wish to bring up something that happened this year.&nbsp; The Army Corp of Engineers planned to bring rock material back to Lesa’mo, Morro Rock, under the belief that they were doing something right, or rather, trying to “correct a past wrong.”&nbsp; The Rock should never, ever have been quarried, dynamited, but the illusionary act of returning rock added nothing positive.&nbsp; Nothing made whole, nothing fixed, just a useless gesture from which some small groups of people profited.&nbsp; Several cheered this effort, some as a public relations act by a specific pretendian (pretend Indians = Pretendians) group claiming, “see, we did good.”&nbsp; Big woo hoo.&nbsp; Our tribal council made the educated decision to not support this effort of ignorance, as we believed and still do that it was a wasteful and futile effort.&nbsp; The returned rocks, that were dynamited and hauled away to build neighboring breakwaters, were always part of Lesa’mo’, but fractionalized and divided, just like the native peoples were by governments agents and church leaders.&nbsp; Still, those rocks knew that they remained part of Morro Rock, belonging to it no matter how far away.</p>
<p>Our traditional lands the Salinan People belong to count a large swath of what is now known as the Central Coast of California.&nbsp; Our 13 known villages stretched from Monterey County to the Santa Maria River, inland along the Temblor Mountains, an all along the coast, from Big Sur to south San Luis Obispo County.&nbsp; We lived along the length of the River now known as the Salinas with which we share our name, from its Adelaide headwaters flowing north into Monterey.&nbsp; But our ancestors – whether known today as Salinan, Chumash, Yokat, or European Colonizers – didn’t own any of that land.&nbsp; The Land owned them.&nbsp; They shared what they had with any who joined with them, as we do today.&nbsp; As we recognize the Creator’s truths – Everything Sacred, Everything Related; and celebrate Solstice together, I want to say that, if you are here, today you are Salinan.&nbsp; We are still here, and will be so tomorrow.<a>[19]</a></p>

      Optimizing for Human Connection        <p>By Athena Frost</p><p>Published January 24, 2023</p>        How Clari CEO Andy Byrne’s focus on human relationships led him to reimagine the revenue process with artificial intelligence.      



 
<p>When Andy Byrne was a child in the late ’70s and early ’80s, he remembers being fascinated by the stories his father, Donn, told when he came home from work. Donn ran a commercial real estate business, leasing space to tech startups in the greater Mountain View, California, area. He talked at the dinner table about companies like Fairchild Semiconductor turning ideas into transformational technology. Byrne was mesmerized with the promise of the burgeoning tech scene. “I just loved the idea that you could create something from nothing,” Byrne says.</p>



<p>But the dinner table conversations changed when Byrne was a young teen and his parents divorced. His mother, Joyce, worked to support herself, Byrne and his two siblings. Joyce had always played guitar, so she turned her hobby into a teaching business. Byrne recalls cranking out tablature mimeographs in the garage, which Joyce had turned into a music studio with carpeting lining the walls and floors. At the same time, she started another business selling space in coupon books. Byrne remembers stories of his mom sliding coupon books in mailboxes across town. He watched her transform her little coupon business into a successful publishing company, printing chamber of commerce books from San Jose to Walnut Creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne paid attention as his mom gradually grew her businesses. “Kids would come to the back, and she would teach guitar,” Byrne remembers, “and then her salespeople would come in, five or six of them, and she’s training them on how to sell,” he says. Watching Joyce hustle, observing her passion for people—her guitar students, her sales reps, her customers—Byrne was inspired to live up to his mom’s example.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today Byrne is the co-founder and CEO of Clari, an AI-powered revenue platform. Clari is the fourth company Byrne’s been involved with that has received funding from Sequoia, and after more than 30 years of working together, Sequoia partner Jim Goetz describes Byrne as exceedingly thoughtful and patient. A serial entrepreneur and two-time CEO, Byrne has clearly succeeded as a builder. But today, shaped by the lessons of both success and loss, he says the key to effective leadership is a focus on building up people above all else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Byrne studied economics at the University of Nevada, Reno, and in 1994, went to San José State University to earn his master’s in business administration. There, one day he was reading about the founding companies of Silicon Valley and realized that he recognized many of the names from his father’s dinner table stories. He reconnected to what had captivated him as a kid: “You had an idea, and all of a sudden, manifest it into products and companies and value,” he says. It was something Byrne himself would do—on the other side of a time he calls “our dark year.”&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I realized the formula was you have to be curious. You have to be empathetic.”</p>
andy byrne</blockquote>



<p>Byrne’s first job in tech was selling networking hardware and software, and while other sales reps sold based on a one-page training guide, Byrne would take engineers to lunch and pick their brains. He tells a story about peeking over a cubicle wall when tiny wisps of smoke wafted up. Byrne asked what was going on, and the engineer explained he was soldering a chip to a motherboard. By asking questions and getting to know the engineers and their technology, Byrne could readily explain what was compelling about their products when talking to prospective customers: “I was good at that, and I realized the formula was you have to be curious. You have to be empathetic.”</p>



<p>From there, Goetz recruited Byrne for his first product management position in 1997 at VitalSigns, which Goetz co-founded. VitalSigns ran diagnostics on the nascent internet, helping users troubleshoot networking issues. This was where he met software engineer Venkat Rangan, who would later partner with Byrne to co-found Clari and become the company’s CTO. “He has a lot of passion with anything that he touches,” says Rangan, remembering how Byrne could take client feedback and translate it easily so engineers could get right to work.</p>



<p>Byrne thrived at VitalSigns. “Andy’s empowering,” says Goetz. “And he’s incredibly secure, so he doesn’t need to be the smartest guy in the room. He looks to distill the best ideas out of the collective.” Three years after VitalSigns’ founding, Lucent Technologies snapped it up in 1999. Two years later, Byrne left to found his first company, Timestock, an application-management solution for Fortune 500 companies. Byrne was in his early 30s, and as a first-time founder, he faced the challenge of starting a tech company amid the ruins of the 2001 dot-com collapse.</p>



<p>He was under incredible pressure, he says, to make things work for himself and his eight colleagues, all of whom had agreed to join the company in exchange for equity. Byrne describes the initial 18 months as “crazy.” He burned through his 401k. Then, things got more complicated. When his second son was born with critical health issues, Byrne and his wife had to learn to care for a medically fragile infant while raising a toddler without health insurance. Soon after, his father-in-law died in a tsunami in Thailand in 2004; 45 days later, his mother-in-law died of cancer. Then, Byrne was fired. “It was a time when I was not, I could not focus… I couldn’t bring my full self to work because of what was going on,” Byrne says. “I was not performing well, they let me go.” Timestock would later be sold and Byrne made whole financially, but being ousted from his own company, along with so much personal turmoil, sent him reeling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne refers to this time as “our dark year.” To cope, he read the modern classic “Man’s Search for Meaning,” by Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl. He was moved by the insight that you can choose your response to life regardless of circumstances. Byrne doesn’t liken his situation to Frankl’s, but the message resonated in part because of the perspective his mom, Joyce, had modeled: “I saw my mom start something from nothing. And (she) just said, ‘I have to be resourceful, and I have to be entrepreneurial’ … It’s not about a ‘poor me’ situation. It’s about, ‘This is the hand I’ve been dealt and I’m going to figure it out.’” So that is what Byrne did. He worked his network. Goetz had joined Sequoia Capital by then, and Rangan was working there as an entrepreneur-in-residence on a company he had co-founded called Clearwell Systems. Goetz recommended Byrne when Rangan needed a brilliant program manager. Byrne joined Clearwell as a VP.</p>



<p>Clearwell used machine learning to search digital correspondence during legal discovery, replacing what had been a manual process of searching through thousands of pages. The company flourished, and Symantec acquired it in 2012. Now, Byrne when Rangan wanted to launch something as co-founders. Byrne had an idea. As an entrepreneur and leader, he had spent his career nurturing sales and marketing teams, and saw that there always seemed to be too many clients and too much communication. No amount of coaching could help teams make sense of everything, every time. Rangan explains, “There is always some information gap. People were making judgment calls on suboptimal decisions.” Byrne and Rangan felt that the customer relationship management software (CRM) salespeople were using was a waste. Byrne said, “I remember walking around the parking lot of the Sequoia offices and saying, ‘I’m telling you the CRM has totally failed sales teams; it’s horrible.’”</p>

<p></p>



<p>Byrne was convinced machine learning could help sales reps close deals faster, drive more revenue and increase revenue forecasting, predictability and accuracy, what he calls “the golden triangle.” He imagined the technological solution that would become Clari, a revenue collaboration technology that gathered sales-related data from everything—emails, meetings, outbound marketing—and applied AI to synthesize it and derive actionable insights, freeing up sales teams to connect more deeply with people, not spreadsheets.</p>



<p>Sequoia believed in Byrne and Rangan, giving them office space, and the firm joined in the company’s Series A. Initially, attracting clients was a problem. Even though Clari could help sales reps fill in knowledge gaps with data instead of guesses, they didn’t want it. Adopting Clari would mean changing how salespeople work, learning new systems and habits. “The roadblock was that our product required a change in behavior of individuals,” explains Rangan, who today is Clari’s co-founder and CTO. So Byrne and Rangan pivoted to approaching sales leaders, the people he knew could get the most from Clari’s technology. His instincts were right, and soon, Clari had 250 customers, the number Byrne felt showed viability. Clari was on its way. But Byrne would face another loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2017, Byrne’s brother died by suicide. Byrne says his brother had mental health issues that led to drinking and suffering. To manage, Byrne hired an executive coach who also functioned as a therapist, and started practicing Qi Gong, the Chinese technique of meditation, breathing and movement. “I feel a strong sense of duty and obligation to make sure that everyone knows, children and adults, that we are really making [mental health] a topic that’s very important, both at the dinner table and the conference table,” says Byrne.</p>



<p>Today, as a CEO and as a person, Byrne is focused on relationships. At work, he says, “When you get into leadership versus when you get into management, they’re two totally different disciplines. You realize that it’s actually not about running an operating cadence or doing code or selling stuff, it’s about human psychology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne is sincere, with a self-effacing sense of humor. In 2021, he wrote an article posted to LinkedIn titled, “The Metrics of Marriage: How My Wife and I Transformed Our Marriage By Acting Like CEOs.” He writes: “These metrics, these spreadsheets, aren’t sexy. There’s no red bows or diamonds. Making a relationship work, like leading a billion-dollar company, takes dedication and focus.” Byrne is self-aware about how this sounds: “We have vision boards, we have objectives and, yes, we have acronyms all over the house, and it drives my kids sometimes crazy. But when they’re in their 30s or 40s, they will never forget DPA,” Byrne says with a laugh, citing the acronym for “Dream. Plan. Act.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Byrne has learned through years of leadership that his management style is about empowering connection, from encouraging colleagues to leave early enough to make it to their kids’ soccer games and field trips, to making space for people to bring their full selves to work. At their Sunnyvale office, dozens of photographs hang on a wall depicting employees holding up personal belongings that showcase their personalities. A man holds a ventriloquist’s dummy. A woman looks at a book of paint samples, another reads a book. “The energy you see on that wall at Clari,” says Goetz, “from the employees, and the affinity they have for him, is that he genuinely cares about all of his team members, and will spend time with the receptionist, and the new sales rep, the junior engineer, along with his executive team.”</p>



<p>Byrne says his attention to connection comes from Joyce: “My mom has such a gift of gab, she is just so persuasive, and people just fall in love with her.” He says he’s always had some of her gregariousness, her tendency to hug people and say, “I love you.” Today, he doesn’t just live it, he shares it. As Rangan puts it, Byrne has “really been focused a lot on people’s careers, and helping them in advancing their impact and role.” Byrne has even mentored him, Rangan says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Byrne has also invested in Kurt Leafstrand, Clari’s SVP of Products. Leafstrand describes himself as an introvert, but says Byrne’s focus on nurturing relationships has influenced him. He’s learned to extend himself—to lead with enthusiasm at board meetings and with small kindnesses toward his team, which results in an unusually high team-retention rate.</p>



<p>In Byrne’s attention to cultivating connection, there is no detail too small about which to be deliberate. Leafstrand talks about how Byrne always makes sure people’s favorite music is on when they get into his car, even if it’s Toto’s “Africa,” as he did for one potential partner. It’s about making a person feel cared for, says Leafstrand. “[It’s] about the impact that you’re having, that you have a chance to help them,” he continues. “And that you should be thinking about that intentionally, like a steward.” </p>



<p>Three decades into his career, Byrne continues to mature in his stewardship of people and business, and he is excited for the future. “I’m just so proud to see a group of really, really incredible people who are trying to achieve something remarkable, who are just loving their work, loving their time together. And you know, I feel like our best work is in front of us. I’ve got so many crazy ideas… and I just can’t wait to do more.”</p>

 Scaling the Findora Blockchain for Growth and&nbsp;Success <p>NOTE: This article has been republished from <a href="https://findora.org/blog/">Findora’s blog</a>. View the original article <a href="https://findora.org/2023/01/findora-roadmap-2023/">here</a>, or follow the <a href="https://findora.org/blog/">blog</a> to read&nbsp;more.</p> Gearing Up for&nbsp;Growth <p>An updated Grants Program, augmented privacy functions, the Rosetta API — all this and more on Findora’s 2023&nbsp;Roadmap.</p><p>We are excited to share Findora’s 2023 roadmap with the community. After a year of laying a solid foundation, Discreet Labs is focused on scaling the Findora blockchain, developing its ecosystem, and securing strategic partnerships.</p><p>Learn more about key milestones below, and stay up to date by following Findora on <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://findora.org/discord">Discord</a>, or by signing up for <a href="https://findora.org/findora-newsletter/">Findora’s Newsletter</a>.</p> Highlights of Findora’s Roadmap  EVM staking <p>First stop, EVM staking! A feature eagerly anticipated by the community, it will let you <a href="https://docs.findora.org/general-user-materials/stake-fra">stake FRA</a> and earn rewards directly from a staking dashboard with your MetaMask wallet. Currently, only UTXO FRA can be staked after they’ve been transferred from MetaMask to the Findora Wallet via Prism. EVM staking will simplify the staking process for the Findora community.</p> “Triple-Masked” Transfers <p>You can already protect the token amounts and token types used in a transaction with the Findora wallet — “Triple Masking” will take that a step further. Triple Masking is an internal term for shielding the sending and receiving addresses, in addition to the token amount and type. This will be a key tool for DAOs and dApps seeking to provide their users with the privacy they expect for their personal finances and open the door to many use cases for&nbsp;Findora.</p> Multisig Wallet&nbsp;Support <p>Users will soon have the ability to set up multi-sig wallets on Findora. This is a key feature for managing community funds, and in the future will be integrated with triple masking so DAOs can protect their contractors and community members.</p> On-Chain Number Randomizing <p>Findora will work with an established partner to launch on-chain number randomizing. This feature will be essential for Web3 game developers on Findora, leveraging Findora privacy to create unique gameplay.</p> Rosetta API <p>The Rosetta API lets blockchains easily integrate their blockchain with wallets, large exchanges, and apps. Adding the Rosetta API will empower developers, and set Findora up for increased adoption in&nbsp;Web3.</p> $100 Million Grants&nbsp;Program <p>Stay tuned for the imminent opening of Findora’s Grant Program! The Findora Foundation has pledged up to $100 million, over the course of several years, for the development of Findora’s ecosystem. All teams are welcome to apply: port an existing project, build a basic infrastructure dApp, or create a dApp with privacy in mind. More information on the Grants Program will be released in February.</p> Introducing ZK-NFTs with&nbsp;Prism++ <p>Prism++ refers to a feature that will allow NFTs, typically confined to EVM environments, to migrate to Findora’s UTXO layer. The home of Findora’s zk-cryptography, the UTXO layer facilitates all privacy-enabled transactions. Moving NFTs to the UTXO will create privacy-preserving “ZK-NFTs” and open up a whole new set of use cases for NFTs in&nbsp;Web3.</p> Polygon Bridge to&nbsp;Findora <p>The <a href="https://rialtobridge.io/">Rialto Bridge</a> team is getting close to deploying a path between Findora and Polygon. The bridge will open up Findora to liquidity from Polygon and allow Polygon-based assets to migrate to Findora for confidential transfers. Rialto already connects Findora with Ethereum and BNB&nbsp;Chain.</p> App Chains <p>Findora will allow developers to deploy parallel app chains on Findora. With a dedicated chain for their app, developers will have complete freedom to develop according to their needs, balancing decentralization with through-put as needed, while still leveraging privacy features as needed. No need to share blockspace — build an app-chain with optional privacy features on&nbsp;Findora!</p> Auditability and Compliance Features <p>Initially proposed in <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora/status/1569754168755376129?s=20&amp;t=FCX9FE50ovDODmyMPJU66g">FIP-2</a>, Findora plans to deploy viewing keys to build auditability with privacy. Viewing keys will allow token issuers, like Circle, to create private assets only they can audit without making them public on-chain. They will be an essential tool for institutions, giving them the ability to move into Web3 and paving the way for mass adoption.</p> On-Chain Governance Voting <p>The community will soon play a much bigger role in Findora’s direction. An on-chain governance voting system will be deployed in 2023. FRA token holders will be able to vote on Findora Approval Proposals and other issues to determine the future of the&nbsp;chain.</p> Community Grant Approvals <p>Findora will also add a community grant, where projects can compete for funds from the community. The community will evaluate and vote on which projects they would like to see receive grant&nbsp;money.</p> Leading the&nbsp;Charge <p>Leading the charge into 2023 is <a href="https://findora.org/2023/01/findora-announces-new-ceo/">Discreet Labs’ new CEO, Sam Harrison</a>. Sam will focus on growth and adoption. Sam is a charismatic leader who will play a key role in bringing roadmap items to fruition.</p>Welcome, Sam!<p>2023 will be an exciting year for Findora as users and projects come to expect even more rigorous privacy protections from Web3 than from Web2. Findora is ready to give them exactly&nbsp;that.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

 ZenIP 42204 for the deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools was submitted recently. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;&nbsp;ZenIP 42204 proposes the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.&nbsp;Does this mean Horizen will no longer support privac

     <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a> for the deprecation of the Horizen mainchain shielded pools was submitted recently. Here’s what it means.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>ZenIP 42204 proposes the removal of shielded transactions with transparent inputs from the Horizen mainchain, which will prevent shielded transaction (T addresses to Z addresses) support at the consensus level.&nbsp;</p> Does this mean Horizen will no longer support privacy or any type of shielded pools? <p>No. ZenIP 42204 does not propose the complete removal of the shielded pools or privacy features from the Horizen platform. It only proposes to remove the support for shielded transactions with transparent inputs (T addresses -&gt; Z addresses) on the mainchain level. Also, the proposal focuses on reducing the importance of the shielded pool by preventing new transparent inputs being sent to it. These transactions make up only 2% of the shielded transactions on the mainchain.</p> Why ZenIP 42204? <p>ZenIP 42204’s goal is to ensure Horizen does privacy technology the right and sustainable way to drive ecosystem growth and minimize risks. &nbsp;It proposes a solution to the following risks that prevent the greater Horizen community from fully and freely participating in our ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>Eliminate technical debt</p><p>Horizen’s implementation of shielded transactions relies on ZCash’s outdated Sprout technology. Moving away from outdated technology will give Horizen room to improve and innovate privacy technologies.</p><p>Regulatory threats</p><p>The current regulatory environment makes privacy cryptocurrencies more difficult to access and be adopted. For example, Horizen has already been delisted from a major exchange in the Republic of Korea and excluded from popular industry applications like Crypto.com.&nbsp;</p><p>Supporting privacy features on the mainchain level is not the only way to offer privacy capability for the Horizen ecosystem. Horizen’s mission is to ensure data integrity and privacy freedom by enabling real-world use cases. Horizen’s privacy vision relies on a secure and decentralized mainchain that supports Horizen’s sidechain platform to focus on more scalable and resilient data privacy. The purpose of ZenIP 42204 is to de-risk the Horizen vision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What’s Next? <p>ZenIPs are for the community to approve or decline. Horizen has always believed our community comes first, but how do we ensure that the community can continue to access Horizen and transact ZEN safely across the world if our technology falls behind and regulations continue to restrict our user base? Is <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">ZenIP 42204</a> the answer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please join the conversation and make this decision with us. We will be hosting a series of town halls on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord</a> to have live conversations about this decision, but we recognize that it can be difficult to match global time zones. So to ensure that we can include everyone, we are recording a new episode of the Beyond the Horizen podcast with our co-founder Rob Viglione. We will collect your questions and feedback for the podcast in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>We highly encourage you to read the <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/ZenIPs/commit/4b34d67914d3cf76eb773a9d43949fae23f32f60">full ZenIP on GitHub</a> to get a complete understanding of what this means. We also hope to see you all join the discussion on the #zenip channel on <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">our Discord server</a>. The team will be fielding questions and building a Q&amp;A for the community.&nbsp;</p><p>In his recent blog, Rob shares his thoughts on ZenIP 42204 and how this change can grow the ecosystem further in 2023. He stated, “My vote is on pivoting away from being a privacy coin and embracing the advances we’ve made in being a network of blockchains with Ethereum-compatible smart contracting. I prefer to be proactive against potentially adverse regulations and to remove the possibility that our base layer could be made illegal one day. With these foundations secure, we can focus on an explosion of use cases that add substantial value to the industry.” <a href="https://medium.com/@robviglione/my-thoughts-on-horizen-zen-being-a-privacy-coin-9a1749be3543">You can read his full blog on Medium</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We welcome all discussions about this ZenIP and hope you will all join us on Discord. We will also be sharing information on the town halls and collecting your questions for the podcast soon. Be sure to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/horizenglobal">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://horizen.io/invite/discord">Discord</a> to join the conversation about this proposal. </p>

 Demystifying the tech behind digital currency  
<p>Earlier in this series, we laid out the vision for how society and commerce can change as digital currency gains mass adoption. We also looked at how <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/usdc">USDC</a> can bring the benefits of digital currency — internet-based payments that are nearly free and instant, on-chain financing for real-world assets, and more — to people and businesses by eliminating the volatility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new season for Verida, and the internet, is&nbsp;here.</p><p>After a successful six months active in private to partners and early adopters, we’re proud to announce version 2 of the Verida network and the Acacia&nbsp;Testnet.</p><p>In the early stages of the network it was much faster to create a centralized identity server to allow us having a working network sooner rather than later. This server has now been replaced with a new Verida DID method built on top of the Polygon blockchain and Verida data storage&nbsp;network.</p><p>We are entering the next phase of the network where we can move to provide a 100% decentralized network. Decentralizing identities is a critical step in that pathway. Over the remainder of 2023, we’ll progressively open up the network to the public as we increase decentralization and seek valuable feedback ahead of our mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p><p>We’re thrilled to have you part of this journey as we continue to decentralize personal data and give ownership back to individuals… to control, be compensated for, and enjoy personalized online experiences that make the world a more equitable place.</p><p><a>1. What is the Verida Network?</a><br><a>2. What are the key changes?<br></a><a>3. What do I need to do?</a><br><a>4. How can I start building the future of Web3 with Verida?</a><a><br></a> <a>5. What’s included in this testnet launch</a><br><a>6. Testnet Limitations<br></a><a>7. Protocol Audit<br></a><a>8. Network Launch Schedule<br></a><a>9. Why build Web3 with Verida?<br></a><a>10. The self-sovereign data era is here<br></a><a>Join our community</a></p> 1. What is the Verida&nbsp;Network? <p>The Verida Network comprises the underlying protocol, technology and documentation developed by Verida. Developers can leverage the Verida SDKs to use and contribute to the code to improve the network. Service providers can deliver infrastructure to the network by running nodes that users can select to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The Verida Network aims&nbsp;to:</p>  Decentralize the sharing and discoverability of&nbsp;data  Empower end users with control of personal&nbsp;data  Deliver a more equitable distribution of value to participants on the&nbsp;network  Create and share verified data in a trusted, private, secure, and decentralized manner.  <p><a href="https://www.verida.network/whitepaper">Read our Whitepaper</a> to learn how the Verida Network reflects our mission for achieving self-sovereignty of personal data and how the infrastructure works.</p> 2. What are the key&nbsp;changes? <p>A number of key changes to the Verida network have been deployed to improve speed, lower cost and decentralize the network. In&nbsp;summary:</p><p>We initially implemented a fork of <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry">ethr-did-registry</a>, however it became apparent that the performance, cost and lack of full DID document support was a sub-part solution for the objectives of the Verida&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Instead, we have designed a faster, cheaper and more flexible DID method via our Verida Improvement Proposals; <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-2.md">VIP-2 (Verida DID Method)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/verida/VIPs/blob/develop/VIPs/vip-3.md">VIP-3 (DID Document storage on the Verida network)</a>. We will look to have these officially included in the W3C implementations list in due&nbsp;course.</p><p>The Verida DbStore has been upgraded to provide enhanced user control and agency over their&nbsp;data:</p>  Users can delete any part of their data; <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk/data#deleting-data">from a specific row</a>, <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/client-sdk/data#deleting-databases">a database</a> or <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/blob/main/packages/vda-did/src/vdaDid.ts#L245">their complete&nbsp;identity</a>  Users can control the servers that store their data (how many and which servers). A user interface for this will be made available in the Vault soon to make it accessible to everyone.  <p>The Verida SDK’s have been upgraded to support the creation of blockchain based decentralized identities. There are three new packages:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did">vda-did</a> (Creating and updating&nbsp;DIDs)  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-did-resolver">vda-did-resolver</a> (Light package for read only resolution of&nbsp;DIDs)  <a href="https://github.com/verida/verida-js/tree/main/packages/vda-web3-client">vda-web3-client</a> (A web3 wrapper that supports native blockchain transactions or routing transactions through a meta-transaction relay&nbsp;server)   3. What do I need to&nbsp;do? <p>Developers will be required to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@verida/client-ts">update to the latest SDK</a>. There are breaking changes as the protocol will now be looking up identities and data storage infrastructure from the blockchain.</p><p>End users will be required to update to the latest Verida Vault. This allows users to create new identities that are decentralized.</p> 4. How can I start building the future of Web3 with&nbsp;Verida? <p>We’re looking for innovators across Web3 (and friends in Web2) who want to provide users with greater ownership over their data and identity. If you’re an application developer or infrastructure operator, we’d love to hear from&nbsp;you.</p> Storage Node Operators <p>Soon, we’ll be opening up the Verida network to providers who have experience running network infrastructure who would like to run a Storage Node on the Verida Network. These node operators will be joining nodes operated by Verida and early partners.</p><p>To be eligible, you’ll need experience with crypto networks and the wider industry. This opportunity is particularly suited to organizations and individuals already operating blockchain nodes or data storage infrastructure across multiple&nbsp;regions.</p><p><a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem#build-with-us">Apply as a Storage Node&nbsp;Operator</a></p> Application Developers <p>We’re actively supporting developers building self-sovereign, high performance, scalable, and secure decentralized applications by integrating Verida using our&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>There are many emerging decentralized use cases that require more than just blockchain to see the light of day. We’re here to help those new projects come to life across social, insurance, healthcare, identity, and much&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Browse developer documentation</a> or <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem#build-with-us">Tell us about your&nbsp;project</a></p> 5. What’s included in this testnet&nbsp;launch? <p>We have a number of updates going live across the Verida network, Verida Vault and SDKs as part of the Acacia decentralized testnet&nbsp;launch.</p> Verida Identity <p>Verida Identity is a multi-chain decentralized identity and services framework. Decentralized Identities are a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">W3C standard</a> and core to user identities with the Verida Network. Every account on the Verida network is a decentralized identity (DID). The user’s public keys are leveraged to find and communicate with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Users control their private keys, enabling them&nbsp;to:</p>  Encrypt and access their private&nbsp;data  Control where their data is&nbsp;stored  Sign their data and messages to third&nbsp;parties  Pay for third party data&nbsp;storage  Sign into decentralized applications  Control the other services used by their identity (messaging, notifications etc.)  <p>Learn more: <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/accounts-and-identity">Accounts and Identity&nbsp;Concepts</a></p><p>A Verida account connecting to multiple application contexts</p> Verida Connect <p>Verida Connect is a QR code based multi-chain single sign-on framework to unlock off-chain data and crypto. It provides a smooth experience to onboard new users to decentralized applications on a range of supported blockchains.</p><p>Users who are signed in are provided with a private encrypted collection of databases for the application, secure messaging, and the ability to perform blockchain transactions.</p><p>The Verida Vault additionally supports the <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/single-sign-on-sdk/wallet-connect">Wallet Connect v1 and v2 standards</a> to enable developers to use familiar APIs for blockchain interactions.</p><p>Watch this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekJ-X9UAD0&amp;t=1s">Developer Tutorial: Verida Single Sign&nbsp;On</a></p><p>Learn more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/single-sign-on-sdk#what-is-the-verida-connect--sdk">Verida Connect&nbsp;SDK</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/SSO">Verida Connect Interactive Tutorial</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KekJ-X9UAD0&amp;t=1s">Verida Connect (Single Sign-on) Video&nbsp;Tutorial</a>   Verida Message <p>Verida Message is a decentralized multi-chain messaging infrastructure.</p><p>The Verida Protocol facilitates decentralized messaging between Verida accounts. Users are able to communicate with other individuals and applications via real-time, encrypted, peer-to-peer messaging.</p><p>For example:</p>  One-to-one private messaging between DIDs and applications  Broadcast messages (from Applications to registered user&nbsp;DIDs)  Between datastores, no on-chain footprint, signing a off-chain consent message using your private key of your blockchain wallet.  <p>Messages sent via the Verida Network in the Verida&nbsp;Vault</p><p>Learn more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/messaging">Messaging Tutorial</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/messaging">Messaging Concepts</a>   Verida Consent <p>Verida Consent is a user-centric consent-based framework for identity, access management, and data sharing. The Verida protocol offers a great deal of flexibility and control around data access and encryption to enable consensual information sharing.</p><p>Capabilities include:</p>  Sending private individual data records to a&nbsp;user  Requesting individual private data records from a&nbsp;user  Sharing access to large quantities of structured private data (Data synchronization).  <p>The configuration for this data synchronization is pliable. An application can request access&nbsp;to:</p>  A read and/or write stream of all data of a particular type  A once-off data synchronization  A permanent sync (until the user disables)  A filtered stream of data based on a&nbsp;query.  <p>Learn more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-sharing">Data Sharing&nbsp;Concepts</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/social_media_data">Request Social Media Data&nbsp;Tutorial</a>   Verida DbStore <p>The Verida protocol provides secure, decentralized database storage for user data. Verida DbStore is the open source<a href="https://github.com/verida/storage-node"> Storage Node</a> server that provides encrypted database storage for one or more Verida accounts. No user data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is stored on-chain.</p><p>This solution is designed for storing structured private user data. It incorporates access controls with flexible encryption and permissioned data synchronization. It’s region aware and designed to meet GDPR requirements.</p><p>Verida accounts control where their personal encrypted data is stored. Applications can provide a default storage hosting option or users can specify their&nbsp;own.</p><p>The product capabilities are beneficial for builders and users. For&nbsp;example:</p>  End users can access secure, region aware private storage for&nbsp;Web3  Application developers can provide their own default storage nodes for their&nbsp;users  Users can have increased privacy and control by hosting storage nodes for their own personal&nbsp;data  Enterprise companies can provide highly secure, private storage for all their employees  <p>Read more:</p>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/concepts/data-storage">Data Storage&nbsp;Concepts</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/datastores">Datastores</a> (Schema based&nbsp;storage)  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/encryption">Data Encryption</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/infrastructure/storage-node">Data Storage&nbsp;Node</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/docs/tutorial/databases">Data Storage Interactive Tutorial</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWtvvkk4WE">Data Storage Video&nbsp;Tutorial</a>   Developer SDKs and&nbsp;APIs <p>The Verida protocol is open source and provides toolkits to accelerate developer onboarding.

This tutorial takes a developer through all the capabilities of the Verida Network and empowers them to build decentralized DApps using&nbsp;Verida.</p><p>Start building today: <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Developer Portal</a></p> 6. Testnet Limitations <p>With the public launch of the decentralized Acacia Testnet, it’s important for users and developers to keep in mind current constraints.</p>  If you had a previously had a Verida identity (DID) you will need to create a new one for this&nbsp;release.  The Acacia testnet should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It’s great for getting your application ready for&nbsp;mainnet.  Data stored and accounts created on Acacia will not be transferable to mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum’s testnets and&nbsp;mainnet.  The Acacia testnet will continue to exist as a test network once the Verida mainnet launches later this year. We’ll keep you updated on important dates.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We’ve done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but please remember, this is still a&nbsp;testnet.

 Nym R&amp;D team provide their initial observations on the design requirements <p>Recently, the European Central Bank announced a market research exercise for the implementation of the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews230113.en.html">Digital Euro</a>. The digital euro is a CBDC issued by Eurosystem, allowing end users to exchange payments electronically with central bank&nbsp;money.</p><p>While there has been a lot of debate on the privacy properties of CBDC designs [1], we leave the discussion of concerns around those to a separate article in due course. In this post, we analyse the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs230113_Digital_euro_market_research.en.pdf?86bde70ec2cddc9f07e34921ea288e4b">technical requirements</a> outlined in the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/news/html/ecb.mipnews230113.en.html">market research exercise</a> and comment on the technologies which could be used to implement them. We limit ourselves to discussing three of them; first we share some observations and then the potential technical challenges.</p> Key observations <p>We found this a well thought out and clearly communicated set of requirements; however it is worth noting that there is no existing design that is able to fully satisfy them all. As the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/profuse/shared/files/dedocs/ecb.dedocs230113_Annex_1_Digital_euro_market_research.en.pdf?8f308548cc80b5f187a5560bd50e72ce">requirements</a> are very detailed, we do not present them fully here but focus on a few key interesting features.</p> No Blockchain in&nbsp;sight <p>While there is a ledger, there is no explicit mention of blockchain anywhere in the document. Thus while the Eurosystem includes a payment ledger for settlements, the designers are clearly concerned about not only the privacy of individuals’ transactions but also their linkability. Hence included is the requirement to prevent the settlement layer of the Eurosystem to link transactions involving the same physical individual, or to learn an individual’s holdings or any identifiable data [2]. This is clearly a key “must have” requirement, simple pseudonymous addresses tied to individuals are explicitly forbidden. Thus no existing blockchain solution can fully satisfy these requirements.</p> Intermediaries <p>A user has an account at an Intermediary (for simplicity one can think of this as a bank) which forms transactions for the Settlement layer. While the settlement ledger component of the Eurosystem cannot link transactions belonging to the same individual, the Intermediary can link all transactions done by their customers when they exchange payments or withdraw/deposit money. The intermediaries are also responsible to ensure compliance with AML/CFT requirements.</p> Payments <p>The technical design seems to be based around the ideas of the eCash protocols introduced by Chaum in one of his seminal papers in the late 80s [3]. The workflows for this are roughly as follows: 1) User creates a digital coin; their account is debited by this amount. 2) User pays for a chocolate bar with the coin; the shop can verify the validity and check with the bank whether the coin was not previously spent. 3) Shop deposits the coin into their bank, who checks against double-spending, and credits the bank’s account. Thanks to the anonymity property of the eCash protocol, the bank cannot link the deposited coin to its issuance, and thus cannot tell who bought the chocolate from the shop. Moreover, multiple transactions performed by the same user cannot be linked. This is actually better privacy than many blockchain systems, including Ethereum.</p> Onboarding <p>The process requires the intermediaries to run KYC checks and ensure AML/CFT compliance. The onboarding process also requires verification with the Eurosystem whether a particular individual (identified at this stage by an e.g. hash of his national id) has already accounts/wallets opened with other intermediaries. No personal data is shared with the Eurosystem or other intermediaries during the onboarding, but the Eurosystem must know which intermediaries are responsible for managing which users’ accounts.</p> Technical challenges  Offline Payment Challenges <p>Although the original Chaum’s eCash scheme does not support offline payments (neither do blockchain-based solutions!), more recent designs [4,5,6] do. One might wonder about double spending the coin and how this can be prevented offline. In the academic literature, this is tackled by allowing double spenders identification. However, the main drawback of Chaum’s design and the newer schemes [4,5,6] is non-transferability, i.e., the received coin cannot be directly spent to another user without contacting the bank and updating individual balances first (it’s not a very good coin if you have to take it to the bank instead of being able to spend it in another shop straightaway!)[7]. This requires the spender and the receiver of any system to be always&nbsp;online.</p><p>An alternative approach is a transferable e-cash [8], which allows users to re-transfer obtained coins, while at the same time remaining offline. However, the efficiency of these schemes is questionable vs the requirements of the Digital Euro. On the other hand, the document mentions the use of trusted hardware as mandatory, so perhaps this was the intended way of mitigating double-spending. Alternatively, leaving room for choice in implementation was intentional.</p><p>The key challenge with supporting offline transactions we feel is a comment in the offline section mentioning that “a card-based solution should be supported”. While clearly desirable from a user perspective, in our view, current bank cards are a) incompatible with transferable e-cash schemes and b) with implementations involving trusted hardware (Secure Elements). However, the card-based solution is only mentioned once while the rest of the offline section concentrates on mobile phone-based implementations of the offline payment workflow.</p> Moving Bank (Intermediary) <p>The key requirement is that the individual can, in case of emergency, reconstruct their account and move to another Intermediary without their old Intermediary being online. We guess this is useful to recover funds in the case of a banking collapse or technical problem with the bank. This could create challenges in the context of a) offline transactions and b) user disconnection (this cannot be extracted from the ledger as the ledger is not allowed to “know” the holdings of any individual user). Unlike in the case of the card-based implementation of offline systems, we do think there are designs that support this, but this is in our view clearly a desirable feature that is challenging to&nbsp;support.</p> Additional Payment&nbsp;Checks <p>As stated in the document, before transactions can be settled the intermediaries might be required to carry additional checks on the party with which their user is transacting, for example, to ensure that a payer is a legitimate person complying with financial regulations or legislation. However, the personal data obtained by intermediaries during the onboarding should not be shared with other intermediaries. A potential solution for a privacy-preserving KYC process is the use of anonymous credentials, like zk-nyms (based on the Coconut protocol, implemented by Nym Technologies and available on the Nyx blockchain), allowing the intermediaries to verify that the parties transacting with their users comply with a particular policy without learning any personally identifiable information about&nbsp;them.</p><p>Overall, while ECB put forward a very detailed and thought-through set of technical requirements, which appears to take privacy seriously, we stress that the entire Digital Euro implementation will require careful privacy considerations and analysis. As we at Nym Technologies have discussed at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum in 2022 [9], without privacy built in from the bottom-up, a CBDC might pose a threat not only to users’ privacy, but also national security. We recommend the European Central Bank reviews existing designs and developments in relevant privacy-enhancing technologies (for example differential privacy and e-Cash), and ensure that the solution enables financial access with full respect of privacy to ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>The above blog post was written by the Nym Research Team.

<p>2022 has proven time after time that centralised entities are prone to multiple points of failure, intentional or not. Decentralised finance (DeFi) addresses these, but the user experience has often been lacklustre compared to that from centralised finance (CeFi). Exchanges are the backbone of any market, but high throughput is required in order to ensure that both makers and takers can proficiently use them. Decentralised exchanges have long faced issues due to bandwidth constraints native to blockchains, but recent L2 scaling solutions have provided a considerable increase in terms of throughput. For example, dYdX is currently the largest consumer of STARKs, but growing institutional and retail interest in derivative financial products urges for an even better alternative.</p><p>We were joined by Antonio Juliano, founder &amp; CEO of dYdX perpetual exchange, to discuss about the upcoming transition to dYdX V4 and what challenges decentralised exchanges have to face amidst technological bottlenecks and upcoming regulations.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Antonio’s background &amp; timing products  dYdX product overview  Price feed oracles  dYdX user demographics &amp; UX  Development timeframes &amp; taking risks  Order book vs. AMM  Building a sovereign blockchain on Cosmos  The challenges of decentralising order books  IBC integrations and composability  Current state of scaling solutions  Migrating from dYdX V3 to V4 &amp; token utility  DeFi vs. CeFi  DeFi education &amp; regulatory outreach  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano">Antonio Juliano on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/dYdX">dYdX on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://dydx.exchange/">dYdX exchange</a>  <p>This episode is hosted by Brian Fabian Crain &amp; Felix Lutsch.

<p>Proteins are a foundational pillar in healthcare and behind every major advancement in biotech and synthetic biology for the last half-century, while biotech’s emergence as a new class of therapeutics was driven by the ability to produce proteins using cells or organisms in a controlled manner. Transgenes, artificial gene constructs designed to produce protein, are the basic building-blocks in modern biotechnology, including recombinant protein-based therapeutics, gene and cell therapies, DNA vaccines, food protein production, and more. Despite this essential role, current transgene design dates back to the 1970s and there has been little improvement in the fundamental systems behind it, leading to insufficient protein production, a key challenge for the biotechnology industry.</p><p>The ExpressionEdits team have redesigned transgenes from first principles and are building a bioinformatics platform to leverage their unique DNA intronization technology (which uses the non-coding regions of DNA called introns) to achieve an order of magnitude improvement in protein expression. The founders, Kärt Tomberg, Liliana Antunes and Allan Bradley, have worked together for the last 2 years in Allan’s lab at Cambridge University to mimic nature and, by introducing introns in mammalian cells initially, are fundamentally redefining the role of non-coding DNA in protein production and creating significant improvements in protein production.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Increasing protein expression in eukaryotic systems has boundless applications throughout the industry, ranging from antibody manufacturing to biochemical synthesis to novel in vivo and ex vivo therapies to the wider synthetic biology industry. Therapeutic markets in these areas range from over $200 billion for antibodies and recombinant proteins to $40 billion for cell and gene therapies. We believe that the ExpressionEdits platform can become the fabric for any protein expression system, from antibody manufacturing to in vivo therapeutics. The most exciting early applications, and where ExpressionEdits will eventually build an internal pipeline, are potentially in recombinant protein or gene therapies that involve complex diseases with particularly hard-to-express proteins.</p><p>We’re excited to be backing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tombergk/">Kärt</a> and the entire ExpressionEdits team on their ambitious mission.</p>

<p>Food production is one of the most important industries in the world. Of course, all of this food has to be safe to eat. So, how do we ensure this is the case? And can this process be improved?</p>



 An introduction to HACCP 



<p>To ensure food safety, most countries require all food manufacturers and processors to use a food safety management system. These are useful tools to ensure safe practices are followed within a business.</p>



<p>One of these food safety systems is Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP), a systematic approach to identifying the food storage and preparation processes and the potential risks and threats. HACCP is widely recognised as one of the most effective ways of controlling food safety. Compliance with HACCP is also a legal requirement in various countries, such as Ireland and the UK. This means all food businesses must be managed under HACCP guidelines.</p>



<p>HACCP dictates <a href="https://www.fsai.ie/food_businesses/haccp/principles_of_haccp.html">seven principles</a>, which must be considered when developing a food safety management system:</p>



 
 Hazard identification 



 Determine the critical control points (CCPs) 



 Establish critical limits (e.g., cooking temperature/time) 



 Establish a system to monitor control of the CCP 



 Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP is not under control 



 Establish procedures for verification to confirm the HACCP system is working effectively 



 Establish documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these principles and their application 
 



 The current challenges of HACCP compliance 



<p>The proper implementation and preparation of a HACCP system can be difficult for food businesses to set up, maintain, and keep up to date. A lot of data needs to be collected, evaluated, and made available to regulators. This has proven to be a challenge.</p>



<p><a href="https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/29491/1/Phd_M_Sherif_HACCP_in_Sierra_Leone.pdf">In a paper from 2013 about the barriers to compliance with international HACCP regulations</a>, various other struggles of compliance with HACCP regulations are listed. Some of the barriers are:</p>



 
 Lack of awareness of HACCP regulations 



 Lack of adequate staff 



 Lack of self-efficacy, 
 



<p>and many more. What barriers food businesses face depend on many factors, such as geographical location, size of the business, and others. Yet, they often face the same core problems.</p>



<p>As HACCP is highly regarded in the food industry, not being compliant with its regulations often results in a severe lack of customers. Hence, this could even end up getting the business banned from importing food products into various countries.</p>



<p>Would it be possible to ease the process of implementing a proper food safety management system, and being compliant with HACCP regulations?</p>



 How FACT can enhance the process of being compliant with HACCP 



<p>Currently, HACCP compliance can be rather cumbersome, with repetitive manual checks and repetitive tasks. Luckily new applications are being developed constantly, which aim to improve the HACCP compliance process for both food businesses and regulators.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">FACT</a> is one of these applications. FACT is a powerful blockchain-based, GDPR compliance tool to capture events and evidence and record the data on the blockchain for audit and traceability purposes. It is flexible and fully customisable to work with existing processes in current food safety management systems. FACT is powered by <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain</a> and delivers a toolbox for the recording of events using a simple smart form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With FACT, you can build templates for each process, then roll the process out and start using it immediately. All data is secure, GDPR-compliant, and available when needed.</p>



 How this makes HACCP food safety compliance easier 



<p>FACT can be aligned with the above principles to ensure real-time food manufacturing monitoring and up-to-date referencing for HACCP compliance. FACT can integrate with existing IT infrastructure or can be run as a standalone application to ensure cooperation with legal requirements.</p>



<p>Furthermore, FACT is designed to be intuitive and easy to understand for everyone, making sure everyone who is part of the whole process is able to use FACT.</p>



<p>On top of that, actions and tasks can be distributed to team members ensuring multi-level verification and reporting insights to management and regulators. Questions and sections can be configured to provide comprehensive risk assessment and alert management in the event of a HACCP breach. This would ensure problems get taken care of immediately and efficiently.</p>



<p>Thanks to the transparency provided by FACT and Europechain, regulators will also be able to actively monitor food businesses in an efficient and methodical manner.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 HACCP dictates seven principles, which must be considered when developing a food safety management system 



 FACT improves the HACCP compliance process for both food businesses and regulators, adding value to both the food industry and business processes 



 FACT’s blockchain-based framework enables to actively monitor food businesses in an efficient, methodical, and transparent manner 



 FACT can be configured to follow HACCP principles to ensure real-time food <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">manufacturing monitoring</a> and up-to-date referencing for HACCP compliance

  Seed Fund V: Forging the Future  <p>Announcing Sequoia’s fifth seed fund, and now accepting applications to Arc America Spring ’23.</p>  <p>By Team Sequoia</p><p>Published January 18, 2023</p>  



 
<p>Today, we are excited to announce our fifth dedicated seed fund to support the next generation of early-stage founders. The $195M fund enables seed investments across the U.S. and Europe, and also includes investments made in future Arc cohorts. <a href="http://sequoiacap.com/arc">Arc</a>, a catalyst for outlier founders at the pre-seed and seed stage, will expand from two cohorts to three in 2023. With curriculum taught by experienced partners and operators, as well as a tight-knit, curated community, Arc is purpose-built to increase founders’ chances of enduring success. The Arc America spring session will run March 6th to April 19th. Admitted companies will receive $500K-1M in funding at the start of the program. We are <a href="https://arc.sequoiacap.com/apply">now accepting applications</a> through February 5th (11:59PM PT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 50 years, we have experienced every cycle of economic euphoria and economic gloom. While markets gyrate, outlier founders building outlier companies persist. They embrace constraints, unlock creative advantages, make technological leaps and are determined to endure. Airbnb, Block, Stripe and WhatsApp all emerged during the Great Recession. We are confident that the next legends are being formed in this moment and we strive to be their first true believers.</p>



<p>As we launch Seed Fund V, Sequoia partners on the Early team share a few emerging tech themes that have them excited about the decade ahead:<br></p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/">Stephanie Zhan</a><br>“AI will be the most important theme of the next decade, driven by the scale of data, new technological breakthroughs in generative models and advancements in compute. Github Copilot has proven that we can make even top developers 10x better at what they do; ChatGPT has shown how powerful these products can be and how excited consumers are to use them. Both are just the beginning of interesting applications to come. I’m excited to see how foundation models, and a vibrant ecosystem of applications built around them will fundamentally transform every category we know of today: developer tools and infrastructure, search, the collaboration and productivity suite, games and entertainment, the creative suite, biology… to name just a few.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/alfred-lin/">Alfred Lin<br></a>“AR will lead a revolution in the physical world. VR will change the way we have an immersive experience at work and play. Potentially the next consumer platform to drive wide-scale innovation, we could enter a world where we work and play through the “lens” of AR/VR glasses. The hardware is getting better and better: brick headsets to portable headsets, and lightweight glasses will be coming soon. One day, those glasses will be replaced with daily contacts. Imagine having all of the power of your smartphone piped through your eyes constantly. Imagine combining that power with AI algorithms to surface relevant information, suggest creative ideas and options, improve your every decision, and make your life more fulfilled, fun and entertaining.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstanine Buhler</a><br>“Enterprise AI and the data stack are promising areas for the next decade, because the virtuous data cycle is the new network effect and the sky’s the limit. The proliferation of AI into everyday office software has the potential to create a new kind of hybrid workforce that will increase individual productivity and enable leaner teams to do more. I’m also excited about enterprise fintech, because empowering the flow of money empowers commerce and progress.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/george-robson/">George Robson</a><br>“Given the recent bans on new combustion-engine sales in Europe starting in 2035 (and US states following suit) and energy prices rising at the fastest rate in 30-40 years, electrification has become a magnet theme for talent. With the global ambition to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, power consumption is projected to triple over the next 30 years as formerly gas-powered appliances plug into the grid and living standards rise. Electrification is one of the first decarbonization levers, being the lowest-cost and easiest to implement in most sectors. We are seeing disruption at each point in this value chain, from generation (solar, batteries), to distribution (virtual power plants) and consumption (the connected home).”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder<br></a>“Data is becoming the lifeblood of not only decision making through analytics but also now how products and applications work around us. The products we use will be transformed by data and the new AI models that are more advanced and accessible than ever before. Both the data infrastructure and the product layers surrounding this change are ripe for new companies to be created. Outside of the world of data and bits, I’m also excited about the huge number of talented people who are looking at the world through a climate-focused lens and solving the looming climate challenges ahead of us. Many of these businesses are incredibly hard, require moving a lot of atoms, but the market size and potential to transform the way we live is enormous.”<br><br><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jess-lee/">Jess Lee</a><br>“I’m excited for new developments in consumer social and self-expression. Social media has taken us a long way, but it is time to continue evolving how we interact, express ourselves, and build relationships. Two major changes are occurring: 1) People are seeking authenticity, meaningful connections and a sense of belonging in a post-pandemic world of increased loneliness and polarization. 2) AI has the potential to revolutionize content creation and self-expression—and creation tools are at the core of all consumer social. What’s next in a world where AI can generate a video you’d never be able to film yourself? Where you can livestream as an avatar that looks nothing like you, but frees you to be your real self? What would it be like to enter a chatroom filled with both NPCs and real people? The best founders will tap into our basic need for connection while pushing boundaries and avoiding the uncanny valley.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky&nbsp;</a><br>“Generative AI will transform all engineering workflows and the entire toolchain: from the IDE, to debugging, to CI/CD. Microservices have emerged as the predominant new application architecture. Every new platform solves some old problems but creates new ones: many microservices problems wait to be tackled, such as securing service to service communication. On the security side, identity and access control&nbsp; and automation are the biggest pains for many CISOs. Reasoning who should have access to what applications and resources, and what level of access is a gnarly problem in search of good solutions. Security teams have all the visibility tools they need, but struggle to take action at scale on all the problems that need to be addressed.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/shaun-maguire/">Shaun Maguire</a><br>“First: hardware will always have my heart. The marriage of physics with a strong business model creates the largest moats and is intellectually exhilarating. Second: despite the challenges facing crypto (both in terms of token prices and public perception) I’m still very drawn to the space. If hardware is the marriage of physics with a business model, crypto is the marriage of mathematics with money. And as someone who has spent a lot of time in the developing world, I think many in the developed world underestimate how broken money is for much of the planet. Finally, I’m excited about bringing technology to legacy industries. Many of the largest industries still have relatively low software penetration. To crack one of these nuts requires a strong, unique insight about how to wedge in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/charlie-curnin/">Charlie Curnin</a><br>“Suddenly computers can read and write. Language is central to how people do their work and interact with others in their personal lives, so I’m beyond excited to see how founders will take advantage of generative AI to build products we can’t even imagine today. That’s not to mention the world of images, where everyone from consumers to product designers can find reasons to have fun with or do work more effectively with generative models. Or the world of code, where 10x better code generation can empower technical people and aspiring toolmakers alike. Across the board in AI, including in infrastructure and developer tools, I think we’re in for a thrilling new wave of technology.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a><br>“Biotechnology is undergoing a manifold revolution, driven by increasingly sophisticated computational capabilities, much-needed laboratory and workflow automations, and a deeper understanding of how we can interact with even the most fundamental building blocks of life. The applications will transform our world, from healthcare to the food we eat and the clothes we wear. I am excited to partner with the data, software and infrastructure founders who will help power that transformation, from conception to commercialization. In a similarly regulatorily complex space, I remain excited about innovations in financial services, both within the sector itself as well as the incorporation of fintech into new businesses.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/mike-vernal/">Mike Vernal</a><br>“It’s increasingly clear that AI will define the fifth major epoch of computing (after the Mainframe, PC, Internet and Mobile). I’m really interested in how this is going to redefine the consumer landscape. I think the way we make decisions—what to buy, where to go, what to do—will change dramatically as we develop personalized models with long-term memory, personalization and context. I think entertainment—both video and games—will move towards infinite, personalized depth. And I think who we connect with (and how we connect) is going to change massively. Imagine being able to find and connect with your nearest neighbors in some high-dimensional space, regardless of where they might live in the world. I’m very excited by short-term pragmatists, long-term optimists thinking about this space.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/roelof-botha/">Roelof Botha</a><br>“We’ve entered a new era of tech where, due to the return of a higher interest rate environment, there is renewed focus on operating efficiency and cash flow. Cost advantages are often overlooked and underestimated as the source of sustainable advantage in technology businesses. I’m excited to partner with founders who can build great products to solve customer problems while simultaneously innovating to build exceptional businesses. Many companies are likely to take advantage of the tailwinds that are bringing down costs across a range of sectors, such as automation, artificial intelligence, and the decreasing cost of genetic sequencing. Developer productivity alone has the potential to improve exponentially, with AI based co-pilots enabling transformation and disruption across a broad range of sectors.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/luciana-lixandru/">Luciana Lixandru</a><br>“Thanks to AI, automation and the ability to start a legendary business from anywhere, we’re at the very beginning of a transformational shift in what technology will unlock for companies and consumers. This is a great moment for outlier founders, with a deep desire to fix a problem, who don’t see things the world in terms of how easy something might be, to build their company. With every early founder, I ask myself—what is the dream scenario? If the stars align, what could this company achieve? Experience and history shows innovation happens in all cycles—I’m excited about the founders emerging from this one.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/cornelius-menke/">Cornelius Menke&nbsp;</a><br>“The industrial world is currently undergoing a tremendous shift impacted by two mega trends: (1) We see an increasing disruption of global supply chains via the pandemic and geopolitical events that revert the decade-long offshoring trend towards more localized operations. (2) The race to net zero emission is pushing the industrial backbone of the world to rethink products in ways that combine ecological ambitions with a robust business model to also endure economically challenging times. I am excited to partner with founders who accelerate this transition by deploying automation solutions, optimizing procurement, improving engineering collaboration or rethinking these products from first principles.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bill-coughran/">Bill Coughran</a><br>“With rapid advances in machine learning / artificial intelligence and computing both large and mobile, ubiquitous computing will re-emerge as a reality, not just futuristic proofs of concepts. Also, adaptive consumer and enterprise offerings creating new long-term businesses will emerge. As always for a founder or an investor, there will be the challenge of separating the wheat from the chaff.”</p>

Learn how the mixnet is becoming increasingly available across apps and&nbsp;chains <p>The Nym <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-67a8da65b8b2">roadmap</a> shows 2023 as the year of end-user adoption. So to kick off the year, in this blogpost we will go over how the Nym mixnet can be used and integrated right now — highlighting how the Nym community is driving usage and ways you can get involved.</p> Nym for your everyday&nbsp;apps <p><a href="https://nymtech.net/download-nymconnect/">NymConnect</a> is a desktop application (in beta) that makes the mixnet usable with a variety of day-to-day applications. It sends traffic from Telegram chat, Keybase, Electrum wallet and Blockstream green wallet, through the mixnet — with an increasing number of apps being integrated. NymConnect uses something called a SOCKS5 proxy to send traffic from your app, through the mixnet to privacy-enhance your&nbsp;apps!</p><p>Do you have suggestions for other apps that you would like integrated into NymConnect? Reach out on your now privacy-enhanced <a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a> and let us&nbsp;know!</p><p>We have also released a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk">Nym SDK</a> (typescript) to bring the power of the mixnet to any browser-based application. Try it out for yourself in this <a href="https://chat-demo.nymtech.net/">chat app&nbsp;demo</a>!</p><p>The community has started building apps, with No Trust Verify taking the lead with an anonymous text sharing&nbsp;service:</p>  <a href="http://paste.notrustverify.ch/">Pastenym — anon text sharing&nbsp;service</a>  <p>We have given a first round of Developer Grants to support more user facing apps, which include private IoT hub providers, privacy-preserving file sharing and an accessible interface for interacting with Nym and&nbsp;more…</p><p>What apps would you like us to support next?

Why? Because decentralised systems are especially vulnerable to network layer surveillance. But also because many of the people and projects in Web3 are highly motivated to correct the issues of Web 2.0, including the lack of privacy and the surveillance business&nbsp;model!</p><p>Inspired by the drama around Infura gathering IP addresses, we have seen community members step up and immediately write an <a href="https://github.com/noot/nym-ethtx">Ethereum transaction submitter</a> and shortly after an <a href="https://github.com/EdenBlockVC/spook">Ethereum RPC mixer</a> making Ethereum available over the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Meanwhile, our own developer relations team is currently busy writing a proof-of-concept Cosmos broadcaster, which will be available soon — extending network layer privacy to the Cosmos ecosystem!</p><p>The Nym mixnet can be plugged into any chain to protect transactions from traffic pattern analysis and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Which blockchain would you like to see privacy enhanced next?

<p>We are entering a new frontier in biology and medicine unparalleled in human history, with breakthrough advances in gene editing, computational methods, and cell therapies. At the same time, our overall capability of understanding and manipulating biology is improving exponentially. BlueYard’s strategy around biology is based on the premise that humankind’s ability to engineer biology will not only fundamentally transform how we diagnose, treat, and manage diseases, but also will reinvent how we produce new materials and the food required to support human life and sustain our planet. In short: from cost digression to programmability: biology has and is undergoing several step-function changes. In recognition of these step-function changes, over the last years, we have backed a dozen companies in the space — ranging from <a href="https://www.bit.bio/news/bit-bio-secures-41-5-million-of-funding-from-top-life-sciences-investors">cellular reprogramming</a> to <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/origin-bio-b3932d07b50b">sustainable materials</a>.</p><p>We believe tomorrow’s industry-defining biology companies will be founded by technologists and scientists who are building the interconnected elements that can become the fabric of our future (see our <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/an-evolution-blueyards-v2-thesis-a-new-website-gm-new-york-84080f7b191d">v2 thesis</a>). We are excited about empowering this next generation of founders. Last year we launched our first <a href="https://blueyard.medium.com/welcoming-blueyards-first-bio-fellows-999fdc13d373">fellowship</a> in biology and science where we work side by side with a few exceptional individuals. As part of our goal to foster more innovation at the frontiers of science and technology at the earliest stages, today we are announcing our newest collaboration by partnering with <a href="https://nucleate.xyz/">Nucleate</a>, a student-led non-profit organization dedicated to empowering the next generation of biotech leaders, with chapters spanning 23 geographic regions and participation from over 120 academic institutions, providing early funding for teams in the Nucleate program (<a href="https://nucleatehq.medium.com/nucleate-announces-2m-in-venture-prizes-for-european-activator-teams-in-partnership-with-blueyard-aa82026dbb9d">read more here</a>). Via our partnership with Nucleate we plan to commit a pool of $2 million in SAFE agreements to fund the next generation of founders that have made it through the organization’s six-month Activator Program during 2023. The objective is to back 10 to 20 new teams across the European ecosystem as they migrate from the academic lab to a commercial entity and build the new platforms that re-engineer our society’s biology experiences.</p>

Big theme: progressive decentralization <p>Decentralization is more top of mind than ever. So in this special feature, we highlight the latest, just-published pieces — as well as previously published relevant resources on the topic — from us and others: </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/progressive-decentralization-a-high-level-framework/">A high-level framework for progressive decentralization</a> by Jad Esbers &amp; a16z crypto’s Scott Kominers (January 2023) — on designing for future decentralization up front, including guidance for both web3 projects and more traditional organizations on how and when to decentralize. </p><p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/when-is-decentralizing-on-a-blockchain-valuable/">How decentralization through a blockchain can bring value to your business</a> [article] + <a href="https://youtu.be/OaZSCmjW_GE">the value of decentralization using blockchains</a> [video] by guest contributor Marco Reuter (January 2023) — on proposing a game theoretic model of a network where an entrepreneur decides to retain control of the network with centralized implementation through a regular company, or surrenders control to users with a decentralized implementation (through the “credible commitment” of a blockchain). But how do “lock-in effects” play here?</p><p><a href="https://future.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/">Decentralization for builders: principles, models, how</a> by a16z crypto’s Miles Jennings (April 2022) — Decentralization is the difference between “don’t be evil” and “can’t be evil” when a company CEO decides one course or another on behalf of countless users. So Jennings shares specific models and principles of decentralization across several use cases, and how they apply in practice.</p><p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/">Progressive decentralization</a> by Jesse Walden (January 2020). While at a16z crypto, Walden shared a three-step process proposing progressive decentralization for those building applications on smart contract platforms — outlining three components of success: product/market fit, community participation, and sufficient decentralization (community ownership). [see also: This later followup, a tactical playbook from Marc Boiron on “<a href="https://variant.fund/articles/sufficient-decentralization/">Sufficient decentralization</a>” (August 2022).]</p><p>…more from around the web/ see also:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/decentralization">The era of decentralization</a> by Packy McCormick [also a16z crypto advisor] (November 2022) — Crypto is not the cause, but the symptom, of a larger trend towards decentralization as the world oscillates between centralization and decentralization… with progress sloping upward through the turns. And the current era of greater decentralization will play out on all fronts — from geopolitics and energy to finance, education, journalism, and more — driven by technologies including the internet. But this newly decentralized era will also require new infrastructure and organizing principles that can adapt to the complexity inherent in decentralized systems.</p> 2. Big ideas 2023: Just a few of the things we’re excited about in crypto <p>Michael Blau, Joseph Bonneau, Noah Citron, Valeria Nikolaenko, Carra Wu, Guy Wuollet, Michael Zhu</p><p>This list from some of our a16z crypto partners across the engineering, research, and investing teams has something for everyone:</p>  <p>from new possibilities for developers — such as “blockchain’s mobile moment”, to more developer onboarding for zero knowledge&nbsp;</p>  <p>to key advancements such as VDF hardware; and advancements in zero knowledge, multi-party computation, and post-quantum crypto</p>  <p>to “non-transferable tokens” and various web3 applications that will be built on top of not just this primitive, but also with decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials</p>  <p>as well as other trends crossing industries… including on-chain gaming, and decentralized energy.&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/big-ideas-2023/">see the list</a></p><p>related:&nbsp;On the theme of “blockchain’s mobile moment”, see also <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/building-helios-ethereum-light-client/">Helios</a> — a fast, portable, and secure Ethereum light client written in Rust that allows users to access secure chain data from any device, including mobile phones and browser extensions — which we made <a href="https://github.com/a16z/helios">available to the public</a> to build <a href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1589773604291772416">on</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1595895860176773121">more</a>. </p> 3. Big journeys &amp; paths: Creators, creativity, technology <p>Bob Iger, Chris Dixon, Sonal Chokshi; Emily Yang/ pplpleasr</p><p>We sat down with longtime CEO of Disney Bob Iger (in an intimate chat recorded in Los Angeles a few months ago) to discuss the interplay between technology, content, and distribution… Especially as it evolved from TV and cable, to web 1.0/ internet, to web 2.0 including streaming and advertising models, and now to web3; and other emerging technologies like VR and AR. The conversation also touches on other top-of-mind topics for many in web3 and beyond, including: managing brands and IP; decentralized orgs; remote work; "build vs buy" and navigating the innovator’s dilemma; and how to manage creatives, give creative feedback, and build creative processes for innovation. (Plus some fun behind-scenes details on Black Panther, Avatar, and more!)<br><a href="https://web3-with-a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/bob-iger-creator-content-technology-distribution-brand-disney-web1-web2-web3">listen here</a></p><p>Hearing directly from creators: Multidisciplinary artist Emily Yang aka <a href="https://twitter.com/pplpleasr1">pplpleasr</a> went from working on visual effects — her credits include feature films like Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman, and Star Trek Beyond as well as commercials and game cinematics — to defining “the look” of the DeFi movement and creating Fortune magazine’s first NFT cover. Now the co-founder of decentralized content studio and creator platform <a href="https://www.shibuya.xyz/">Shibuya</a>, Yang shared her journey as a creator — and the various forks, paths, and culmination of it all — in an interactive-storytelling talk at our recent Founders Summit. [You can also find a past talk with Yang on "Why DAOs matter for digital art", in conversation with a16z crypto's Arianna Simpson, at our NFT Summit (May 2021) <a href="https://youtu.be/A4iCiHgWEkM">here</a>.]<br><a href="https://youtu.be/WDFMZ9GYjDk">watch the talk</a><br><br><br>…<a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/22-top-pieces-from-2022/">2022 &gt; 2023</a></p><p>--Sonal Chokshi and the a16z crypto team<br><br>You’re receiving this newsletter since you signed up for it on our website(s) or elsewhere (you can opt out using the ‘unsubscribe’ link below).

<p>(Re-posted from MetaMask original&nbsp;blog)</p><p>Snaps is the roadmap to making MetaMask the most extensible wallet in the world. As a developer, you can bring your features and APIs to MetaMask in totally new ways. Web3 developers are the core of this growth and this series aims to showcase the novel Snaps being built&nbsp;today.</p> Web3Auth Snap <p>Snap Repo: <a href="https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/">https://github.com/Web3Auth/openlogin-snap/</a></p><p>Why did you build&nbsp;it?</p><p>At Web3Auth, we’ve always believed that multi-factor authentication is the best way to secure crypto assets, and is much better than seed phrases. When we saw at ETHBogota that the latest build of MetaMask Snaps allowed Snaps to provide external key management capabilities, we decided to challenge ourselves to integrate MPC tech into MetaMask at the Sozu House hackathon.</p><p>Can you walk us through the technical implementation?</p>  Our goal was to allow a new user to login and set up 2FA to access their account in MetaMask. Subsequently, under the hood, whenever they try to sign a transaction, our MPC SDK does a threshold ECDSA signature. This is done by splitting a private key into two parts: a local share that’s stored in the snap and one that’s stored on a signing server. Over several communication rounds, the signing server and the snap should be able to jointly sign an Ethereum transaction and have it be confirmed on the Goerli network. Unlike seed phrases, this setup does not have a single point of failure that leads to irreversible loss of keys: if the user’s laptop is hacked, or if the signing server is hacked, the user does not lose their private&nbsp;key.  Like every other snap, our snap consists of two parts, the actual snap package, and a page that loads/interacts with the snap. Our ideal user flow was to keep all key management interactions within the Metamask extension’s UI, but due to limitations in permissions, we could not do that. Instead, the user authentication happens outside of the snap, and then once that is complete, we migrate the state into the snap. Subsequently, we hook into the RPC engine of Metamask and respond to transaction requests by using our MPC SDK and the migrated state in the snap to generate threshold ECDSA signatures on the transactions. Surprisingly, we were done with the state migration part within the first few hours of the hackathon and were just left with the signing functionality.  The rest of the process can be further split into two major&nbsp;tasks:  Repurposing existing Web3 providers with our MPC SDK to handle the incoming transaction requests  Getting the MPC SDKs running in the Metamask Snaps SES environment  If you’re familiar with how Metamask works, or how other wallets function, you’ll know that signing an Ethereum transaction requires much more work than just using a private key to sign a message. A lot of work goes into forming the message object that is to be signed. Each transaction follows a particular format that’s specific to each chain and transaction type, has legacy behaviors that need to be supported for backward compatibility, has to get information about the current gas prices, has to calculate the gas to be used / gas limits, and also has to track the account nonce, etc. Thankfully, most existing Web3 providers already do these things out of the box. However, in order to get our threshold signature library to work well with these SDKs we had to dig deep into every single module and replace the eth-sig-util library’s signing functions with our own threshold signature library signing functions, which took a significant amount of time. In addition, because our MPC SDK was chain-agnostic, and didn’t account for Ethereum-specific checks, we also had to reverse engineer and reimplement checks from the eth-sig-util libraries which we had replaced. For example, EIP-2 specifies that the s-value in an ECDSA signature must not be larger than n/2 + 1, where n is the order of the secp256k1 elliptic curve, in order to prevent transaction malleability attacks, which requires ECDSA signing libraries to do a “flip” of the signature if its s-value falls outside of this&nbsp;range.  Another challenge we faced was getting our MPC SDKs to run in the Metamask Snaps environment. Our MPC SDK uses wasm (compiled from rust) to run efficiently in the browser. Due to the multiple rounds of communication between the SDK and the signing server, it also uses Socket.IO to communicate to avoid the overhead of HTTP headers. While attempting to load our wasm code into the snap, we ran into some strange issues with mixed argument types in the wasm methods. Unfortunately, wasm debugging tools are still very lacking, with error messages being unhelpful and uninformative (eg. “Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable”). In the end, we hacked our way around this limitation by accepting all mixed inputs arguments as strings, and parsing them as integers/byte arrays within the wasm code itself. Another problem we encountered was that socket.io did not work in the Metamask Snaps environment. Socket.IO is a separate library/specification built on top of normal WebSockets that handles things like connection upgrading, dropped connections, fallbacks to long polling, etc. which are very helpful when using WebSockets in production environments. Unfortunately, we could not get Socket.IO’s libraries to run in the Metamask Snap environment. As such, we had to fallback to normal WebSockets, and also rewrite the signing server to use default WebSockets instead of socket.io, and fallback to a polling strategy if the websocket had&nbsp;issues.  <p>Can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>Zhen and I are the cofounders of Web3Auth, and our company specializes in providing intuitive, secure, and non-custodial key management solutions. We believe that good security must be easy to use and invisible, or it will not get adopted widely. That is why we are huge proponents of using multi-factor authentication for private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>When were you first introduced to MetaMask Snaps and what was your experience like?</p><p>We tried Metamask Snaps about a year ago, but unfortunately, it didn’t have the capabilities to allow us to extend the private key management functions within MetaMask back then. With the introduction of SIP-2 recently (thank you Olaf!), which allows snaps to extend MetaMask’s keyring, we’ve been very excited to see what’s possible! While building our snap, I also explored the SES system that MetaMask Snaps is based on, and I think it’s a very solid foundation for MetaMask to act as a platform for developers to add functionality through&nbsp;Snaps.</p><p>What makes MetaMask Snaps different from other&nbsp;wallets?</p><p>The extensibility! I think MetaMask Snaps provides a secure interface for developers to experiment and augment MetaMask without compromising the security of the MetaMask extension itself. Unlike other types of projects, wallets require high standards of security, which means merging in new functionality from third-parties is always a long, arduous process of code review and audits, which stifles innovation. MetaMask Snaps allows the MetaMask team to continue building a secure product, while still allowing external developers to experiment and extend its functionality.</p><p>Tell us about what building Snaps with MetaMask is like for you and your&nbsp;team?</p><p>I think Snaps is definitely the way forward, allowing people to build functionality while still keeping the base MetaMask extension secure. There are a few kinks now but improvements are coming every day but I think it’s very exciting&nbsp;overall.</p><p>What does Snaps mean to&nbsp;you?</p><p>I hope that adding multi-factor authentication capabilities to MetaMask through snaps helps the millions of mainstream users on MetaMask to more securely manage their accounts and prevents them from falling victim to scams and hacks. MFA is already doing this today for billions of Web2 users, and we want to bring those secure best practices to&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>What opportunities do you see with MetaMask Snaps and the possibilities it unlocks for the Web3&nbsp;space?</p><p>In general, I think Snaps represents a realistic way for MetaMask to open up its codebase for others to contribute to it without compromising security.</p><p>Any advice you would like to share with developers keen to try MetaMask&nbsp;Snaps?</p><p>Just try it! It may seem a little new but it’s been very approachable so far and the support for it is great on the ConsenSys discord channel for Snaps. Lots of amazing devs are working on it and if you want to be part of the conversation in shaping Snaps, now is the time to be building on it and giving feedback!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-mpc-snap-integrating-multi-factor-authentication-into-metamask-4e57f07af77">Web3Auth MPC Snap: Integrating Multi-Factor Authentication Into MetaMask</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today we are detailing changes to Brave Rewards that will land in Brave version 1.48.x, which is scheduled to be <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Brave-Release-Schedule">released early February 2023</a>. Developers and early adopters who use our Nightly and Beta versions, meant for testing and development, can currently get a preview of these changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the inception of Brave Rewards, more than 1,000 advertisers have run over 5,900 Brave Ads campaigns, and millions of Brave Rewards users have earned BAT for their attention to those ads. Our <a>transparency page</a> shows the BAT we purchase from the open market to distribute to Brave Rewards users for those ads where we are paid in fiat or other crypto currencies. Brave Rewards users have also contributed more than 36 million BAT to their favorite <a href="https://creators.brave.com">registered content creators</a>, helping to support a better, more private Web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These changes to Brave Rewards will help us combat abuse so that we can better deliver on our promises to legitimate users and creators. They will also allow us to focus our efforts on building a more decentralized future by eliminating our current centralized “virtual BAT” system.</p>

 What’s changing for Users? 
<p>To begin earning and accruing <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org">BAT</a> for Brave Ads, you will need to connect a custodial account to your Brave Rewards profile with upcoming version 1.48. Brave currently works with three custodial account provider partners: <a href="https://gemini.com">Gemini</a>, <a href="https://uphold.com">Uphold</a>, and <a href="https://bitflyer.jp">bitFlyer</a> in Japan. Requiring a custodial account gives us a place to send you your BAT earnings, and allows us to eliminate our centralized “virtual BAT” system (see “Sunsetting virtual BAT” below for more).</p>
<p>If you’d just like to support creators as part of a more private Web, you can do so without ever connecting a custodial account by opting into Brave Rewards and using the new “creator support only” experience. A share of the ad revenue will be earmarked for creators and distributed by Brave as part of the monthly payout to <a href="https://creators.brave.com">verified creators</a>. If you want to give more, connecting a custodial account will allow you to use BAT you’ve purchased elsewhere to support creators in the Brave Rewards ecosystem, and will also unlock the Tips feature.</p>

<p>What it looks like when you start to connect a custodial account&nbsp;</p>

 Sunsetting virtual BAT 
<p>After these changes to Brave Rewards in 1.48.x, we will also be sunsetting our centralized “virtual BAT” (“vBAT”) system, used primarily for unverified users.</p>

 What is vBAT? 
<p>When you use Brave Rewards without a custodial account connected, the earnings you accrue are in something called “vBAT” (virtual BAT). vBAT isn’t BAT on the blockchain; instead, it’s a centralized point system backed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature">Chaumian blind signature</a> “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash">ecash</a>” scheme. These points can be contributed to creators or redeemed for BAT if and when you connect a custodial account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you are an unverified user and have “5 BAT” in your Brave Rewards balance after claiming your Brave Ads earnings. That “5 BAT” is actually vBAT, stored as cryptographically signed certificates on your device. When you “verify” your Brave Rewards profile by connecting a custodial account, your device submits those 5 vBAT certificates to our servers. From there, our servers utilize the APIs of our licensed custodial partners to deposit 5 BAT into your custodial account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 When is vBAT going away? 
<p>At the earliest, vBAT will go away sometime in April 2023. However, we want to ensure users have time to adjust to this change, so we will share more exact dates soon. With 1.48.x, existing users without a custodial account connected will receive a final vBAT payout for any February earnings in March.</p>
<p>Once the sunset deadline for vBAT is reached, vBAT will no longer be considered valid, and will be removed from the Brave Rewards experience. This means that even if you’re on an old version of Brave that still shows a vBAT balance, that vBAT can no longer be redeemed after the deadline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the vBAT sunset deadline draws nearer, unverified/non-connected users will see messages with more information and a specific date:</p>

 Users in unsupported regions 
<p>Although our goal is to maximize the number of <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469">supported countries for connecting a custodial account to Brave Rewards</a> before sunsetting vBAT, the unfortunate reality is that there will still be some countries without an available custodial option. For example, Germany is currently not serviced by any of our custodial partners, and will likely not become supported before the vBAT sunset deadline. In other cases, some serviced regions are impossible for us or our custodial partners to support due to unsustainable economics. You can find a <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10950603397645">list of these unserviced or unsupported countries here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re in an unsupported country, you will still have the option to contribute your vBAT balances to verified creators you’d like to support, and will see messages like this:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>vBAT deadline messaging for users in regions with no available custodial option</p>
<p>We understand that this may be frustrating for users in unsupported regions, and we apologize for these circumstances. We will continue to work with both existing and potential new custodial partners to maximize regional support for Brave Rewards as feasible.&nbsp;</p>

 Why is vBAT being removed? 
<p>First, vBAT was never intended to serve as a long-term store of BAT. A core assumption in our early Brave Ads abuse modeling was that vBAT would expire in order to prevent bad actors from accumulating funds across a large number of profiles, then simply waiting for an illicit avenue to open up to drain these funds out of the system. Although vBAT was originally planned to have a rolling expiry, we instead delayed it as long as possible to minimize the impact on users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, because vBAT is stored locally on users’ devices after it is issued, it is impossible to tell whether some vBAT has been lost to a discarded device, abandoned upon Brave uninstall, or lost due to profile deletion, undermining the possibility of transparent and accurate accounting within the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, with the removal of the legacy unverified user state and the introduction of the new “creator support only” experience, vBAT is no longer necessary. Removing the centralized vBAT system will allow us to focus our efforts on building a more transparent and decentralized future for Brave Rewards.</p>

 Decentralization after vBAT 
<p>We’ve already shared details about our research on decentralizing the Brave Ads system in Brave Rewards through initiatives like <a>THEMIS</a>. Eliminating our centralized vBAT system represents another step in this direction. For example, in place of vBAT contributions accounted for in our centralized vBAT system, users will, in the future, be able to send on-chain BAT directly from their self-custody Brave Wallet (or other Web3 wallets, such as MetaMask) to creators’ Web3 addresses, including Ethereum, Solana, and others. We’d also like to allow users to purchase products—such as <a>Brave Firewall + VPN</a>, <a>Brave Talk Premium</a>, etc.—with on-chain BAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a similar vein, many users have asked whether—instead of having to connect a custodial account—it will be possible to connect Brave Wallet directly to Brave Rewards, and receive BAT payouts directly to one’s Brave Wallet addresses. This is a future we’d welcome and are continuing to explore. However, in order to comply with current financial regulations (such as FinCEN and OFAC requirements, or equivalent regulators outside the United States), payouts at this time must first go through a regulated custodian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that once you receive BAT into your custodial account, you can always withdraw it on-chain to your Brave Wallet. In the future, we plan to bring Brave Rewards and Brave Wallet closer together to form a more unified user experience. More details to come.</p>

 What’s changing for Creators? 
<p>If you’re a registered <a href="https://creators.brave.com">Brave Creator</a>, we will be removing the “balance” indicator in the Brave Creators dashboard. The balance you see in your Creators dashboard mostly keeps track of vBAT that was contributed to you but is still pending to be paid out to your custodial account, so will no longer be needed.&nbsp;</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Updated creators dashboard without vBAT balance indicator</p>
<p>Note that any BAT previously paid out to your custodial account is unrelated to these changes. You will continue to be able to receive monthly Creators payouts and direct tips from users to your connected custodial account, even without the vBAT balance indicator.</p>
<p>Following these changes, we also have plans to redesign the overall Brave Creators experience. Here’s an early design preview of what your Brave Creators dashboard might look like in the future:</p>



    



    


    


    
    


 Do I need to do anything with my Brave Rewards profile? 

 Existing verified/connected users 
<p>If you already have a custodial account—like an Uphold, Gemini, or bitFlyer account—connected to your Brave Rewards profile, then no action is required. The Brave Rewards experience you know and love will continue as you currently know it.</p>

 Existing unverified/non-connected users&nbsp; 
<p>If you don’t yet have a custodial account connected to your Brave Rewards profile and you’re in a <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/6539887971469-Supported-regions-for-verifying-Brave-Rewards-with-a-custodial-account-provider-">country that’s supported by one of our custodial partners for connecting to Brave Rewards</a>, we encourage you to connect one as soon as you can. This will ensure that any vBAT balance you have as an unverified user will be transferred to your custodial account as BAT.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: All unverified users will eventually be transitioned over to the new “creator support only” Rewards experience once virtual BAT has been sunsetted. Any remaining vBAT balance you have as an unverified user will be lost when this transition occurs. So, we recommend you connect a custodial account or contribute your vBAT to your favorite verified creators before this happens.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Rewards experience for unverified users before being transitioned to the new “creator support only” experience</p>
<p>Note that if you’re an unverified/non-connected user, your “Estimated earnings” counter will be blank once you upgrade to a version of Brave that includes these changes, as unverified users will no longer be accruing vBAT for themselves, and instead helping to support creators if Brave Ads is enabled. Again, this is because you will only begin to earn once you’ve connected a custodial account to Brave Rewards.</p>

 Summary 
 
 
<p>As of browser version 1.48.x (slated for February 2023), users who want to earn BAT from Brave Ads and accrue a balance must first connect a custodial account (Uphold or Gemini; and bitFlyer in Japan) to their Brave Rewards profile.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave Rewards users without a connected custodial account can still support creators by viewing Brave Ads—they just can’t accrue BAT for themselves until they connect a custodial account. (This is the new “creator support only” experience.)</p>
 
 
<p>Sometime after 1.48.x, virtual BAT (“vBAT”) is going away. Unverified users will have time to connect a custodial account to redeem their vBAT or send that balance to their favorite verified creators before vBAT is eliminated. After the vBAT sunset deadline, any remaining unverified users will be transitioned over to the new “creator support only” experience. (Existing users with Brave Ads disabled will continue to have Brave Ads disabled when transitioned over to the new experience.)</p>
 
 
<p>At the earliest, vBAT will go away sometime in April 2023, but the exact date is TBD.</p>
 
 
<p>Although we will do our best to maximize the number of supported countries before the vBAT sunset deadline, <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/10950603397645">some countries will unfortunately have no available custodial option.</a> Users in unsupported regions will have time to contribute their existing vBAT balances to their favorite verified creators, and then will be able to continue using Rewards to support verified creators with the new “creator support only” experience.</p>
 
 
<p>If you have any questions about these upcoming changes, please join us on the <a href="https://community.brave.com/t/brave-rewards-changes/462431">official Brave&nbsp;Community forums.</a></p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is proud to support this ambitious grassroots project that aims to have global impact through local and regional actions. We can’t wait to see how this community of creators will learn and work together to elevate and disseminate news and stories that inspire, educate, and share the promise of Zcash and financial privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you to Ryan Taylor for working with ZF to bring this project to life!</p>



<p>In Ryan’s own words:</p>



<p>We are a global collective of content creators who care about privacy, Zcash, and building community. Together we will build a space to share information, skills and resources to aid production and publishing of content that covers the topics we care about. We want stories told by the people who are closest to the action, sharing their passion and lived experiences to bring privacy education and Zcash to every part of the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ZF A/V Club will host regular online meetups and collaborate with local events to facilitate discussions on topics of interest to the global Zcash and privacy communities. With our focus on online audio/visual production this will be the time and place to learn more about the media needs and concerns of local Zcash and privacy-focused communities around the world and to take action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Events will be open and free, and could include many formats such as presentations, Q+A, AMA, workshops, troubleshooting, brainstorming or something else entirely. Every discussion, no matter which format, will maintain the Zcash focus on privacy as a topic and as a practice. Consent cannot be assumed.</p>



<p>The long-term goal of the ZF A/V Club is to establish a network of capable, ready and funded media producers to broadcast and share news about Zcash and privacy that is both locally relevant and globally consumed.&nbsp;</p>



 Empower and Amplify 



<p>We are a global community of voices and experiences.Through community we will empower and amplify every individual to tell the Zcash story through their own perspective, on their own terms. We will foster resources and connections that motivate and support content creators so they can bring their unique voice to the global privacy conversation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We envision a web of connections speaking and creating in different languages, all feeding off of, and contributing to, the information and content shared by the ZF A/V Club. We will lift each other up and together we will build the momentum needed to bring Zcash and privacy to the world. Join us!&nbsp;</p>



 Who? 



<p>Everyone is invited and welcome to be a part of the ZF A/V Club! Anyone with a passion for privacy who is interested in exploring new audio/visual and internet technology can attend meetups and participate to the degree of their own comfort. The ZF A/V Club is being launched and organized by Ryan Taylor with support from the Zcash Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Brave Browser has had support for <a>private browsing with Tor</a> since 2018 as a way to give our users a way to protect their network privacy.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>One request we have recently started to receive with increased frequency is support for Tor bridges. <a href="https://support.torproject.org/censorship/censorship-7/">Bridges</a> are a way for users to access the Tor network even when their government is blocking connections to the network. Starting with Brave 1.44, users in affected countries have had an easy way to circumvent these restrictions from the settings page:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Once the desired bridge configuration is selected, new private windows with Tor will only attempt to connect to the Tor network via the specified bridge. More details can be found in our <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/7816553516045-How-do-I-use-Tor-bridges-in-Brave-">official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to enabling our users to connect to bridges and relays graciously offered by volunteers in the Tor community, Brave will continue to contribute to increasing network capacity. Besides operating the <a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/rs.html#search/family:723E21FD6F91905E84E583D4619A2D1E282B8180">relays</a> we have been running since we launched private windows with Tor, we are now making it easy for our users to share their Internet connections with users in censored countries. Starting in version 1.47, Brave will enable users to install and turn on the <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/9059440641421">Snowflake extension</a> in a single click:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>We are proud to be a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/membership/">member of the Tor Project</a> and are happy to be able to provide ways for our users to access the information they are looking for. Many of our websites, including <a href="https://search.brave.com/">Brave Search</a>, are available natively on the Tor network via <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/4537609459469-List-of-Brave-Onion-Addresses">.onion addresses</a>.</p>

Most users have more than a single wallet and tying users to a single wallet limits the experiences web3 can&nbsp;offer.</p><p>With our latest multi-wallet feature, Privy enables developers to link multiple wallets to one underlying user account. Play around with <a href="http://demo.privy.io">our demo</a> to see multi-wallet linking in&nbsp;action!</p><p>With multi-wallet linking, you&nbsp;unlock:</p>  Personalized user experiences: serve your users across all of their assets, whether in cold or hot wallets. NFT marketplaces can show a gallery across all assets; NFT games can cater gameplay to loot spread across&nbsp;wallets.  No more multi-account handling: gone are the days when users had to maintain separate accounts to operate across their wallets. Support web3 power users across their portfolio.  Simple authentication: your users can log in with any of their wallets, regardless of what device or browser they are using, so they never have to wait to access your&nbsp;app.  Multi-wallet interactions: enable your users to log in with one wallet and mint with another. Stop asking your users to choose between security and ease of&nbsp;use!  <p>Multi-wallet linking is an important pattern in making web3 more human, pioneered by apps like our friends at <a href="https://zapper.fi/">Zapper</a>. We’ve made it easy for any app to integrate this feature as the next important step in our progressive onboarding journey, enabling you to onboard all potential users, regardless of whether they have wallets, across desktop and mobile. With Privy, your user can log in with an email or social account, then connect one or more wallets when contextually relevant. This leads to better UX, better engagement, and better conversion for your&nbsp;app.</p><p>Get started with multi-wallet today with a simple `link()` call. Check it out in our <a href="https://docs.privy.io/">API docs</a>! You’ll be able to support the majority of web3 power users who want to bring assets from multiple wallets into a single app experience.</p><p>Privy takes less than &lt;15 minutes to integrate and you can get started today by filling the “Get Started” form on <a href="http://privy.io">our&nbsp;website</a>!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/build-for-users-across-all-their-wallets-895acb5415">Build for users across all their wallets</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>I live in Philadelphia, home of Independence Hall, the Constitution Center, and the Liberty Bell. While I have my reservations about the actual intent of these documents, see Tim Scott’s article on the Constitution <a href="https://dissidentvoice.org/2017/05/the-duplicitous-u-s-constitution/">here</a>, I would love to see a public discussion of the nature of Constitutional rights in the twenty first century against the backdrop of the planned implementation of an extended reality regulated by a smart contract layer of cybernetic governance, a potent dose of snake oil that will be sold to us as a public good meant to save the planet from imminent destruction and birth a new “creative economy.” I speak briefly to this during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzUQzija-Z0&amp;t=0s">Tucson talk</a> Q&amp;A. This is a one-minute clip.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s a mayoral election cycle, so now would be an opportune moment to have such a discussion publicly and robustly.&nbsp; One of the candidates, <a href="https://helengym.com/">Helen Gym</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenGymPHL/status/872959651742089216">attended</a> the Barcelona “fearless” cities summit back in 2017. I wrote about the Barcelona digital public good / smart cities effort as part of my refugee series <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/07/12/mondragon-focolare-and-inclusive-capitalism-synthetic-pretenders-part-15b/">here</a>.</p>
<p>They can’t force us into their game without our consent. I believe their intent is to proceed as if they have it, but they don’t. The Web 3.0 / Smart Contract conversation must be had, and people need to be brought up to speed, so they can make informed decisions about what they may be giving away if they accept a shiny techno offer to live inside a world of programmable money and matter – not just for themselves, but for their children and the natural world.</p>
<p>I reconnected with someone this week who was interested in the idea and asked for ” a couple good phrases that conceptualize the scope of what’s coming more easily for folks.” This is what I came up with. Jason told me this morning that he thought it was a good, pithy summary. So, I’m putting it here to share.</p>
<p>In the planned future…</p>
<p>There will be new forms of money backed by things we love like toddlers, toddler’s futures. They will implement a global “learning economy” where investments in human capital improvement profit impact investors and create data that will be used to refine machine learning for artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>We live in an extended reality where the real world has an overlay of military technology (with cybernetic, psychological steering included) that runs on a global satellite network. That network will create a ubiquitous panopticon comprised of sensors and actuators that regulate natural life across the planet. Our actions, relations to one another, and behaviors are monitored via digital identity “a permanent record” on blockchain. Behaviors will be scored for KPI (key performance indicators) as set by e-government social contracts (UN Sustainable Development Goals, etc.) and corporate interests.</p>
<p>Our kids will be raised to compete in a global gig economy managed by artificial intelligence that will sort people as collections of skill tokens (or <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/05/28/soulbound-tokens-trust-networks-and-californias-big-test/">Soulbound Tokens)</a>. They will have to complete with people from around the world to do platform work, sometimes piloting remote robots for low wages and lacking any worker protections.</p>
<p>In their planned future, we will be citizens of a nation where Constitutional rights exist, but we can never drill down to them, because a deep layer of smart contracts (computer logic run on distributed ledgers) will have been put in place to keep us alienated from them. We will be citizens of a nation living under automated machine arbitration, the same as all nations of the world. Really, we will be citizens of the Web, Web 3.0.</p>
<p>In this future most people will be compelled to act as “agents” in simulated teams to solve “grand challenges” like climate catastrophe. Attempts will be made to remake humans as social insects for collective computation – all brain, no heart, no curiosity, no joy. These agents will inhabit a game where the rules change without notice, and the machines make the rules.</p>
<p>As in Yevgeny Zamyatin’s novel “We” written in 1921 that depicts a cybernetic reality where people live as numbers under the mathematical dictates of the Great Benefactor who ensures world “happiness” through consistency, harmony, uniformity, and regulation. In the world Zamyatin creates, imagination is excised by the machine for the “good” of its residents. My read aloud of “We” is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO7kFkMnr7i9oDB-a067c_NY">here</a>.</p>
<p>In closing, I invite you to listen to what Rev Lebaredian, an executive at Nvidia (a company that makes high-performance computing systems for video games and digital twin simulations), has to say about AI “realizing” children’s imaginary worlds and projecting them into his planned virtual world, the Omiverse. He frames AI as an enabler, but to my way of thinking it’s actually a thief. This clip is two minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this three-minute clip, members of the Open Metaverse podcast from Epic Games, Cesium, and Kronos discuss Nvidia’s technology combined with blockchain digital twins and supercomputing to explore alternate futures and bend time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do you live in Philly? Do you have the ear of some politicians? Do you want to engage in this conversation? Hit me up and let’s see what we can make happen.</p>
<p>PS: The Open Metaverse podcast that hosted Lebaredian is sponsored by the company <a href="https://youtu.be/O2yL1FULHgw?t=5369">Cesium</a> located on 11th Street in Philadelphia, just south of Market Street. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMxy_Xp34JM">Here</a> is our site visit to the Nvidia office in Boulder, CO last March where we talk about Maya the grand illusion and the meaning behind the company’s name and logo.</p>
<p>PPS: I wrote a scenario of what this world might look like back at the end of 2017 based on the story of two sisters going to school in a world of ubiquitous computing in Queens. I was less familiar with the particulars of the technologies , but I think it’s still pretty spot-on. If you want to check it out, here’s a link to the first installment of “Building Sanctuary.” Or check out a PDF of the whole series <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/building-sanctuary-pdf.pdf">here</a>.</p>

      Designing for the Developers        <p>By Megan Finnerty</p><p>Published January 5, 2023</p>        With a Finnish sensibility, Linear’s founders center software engineers in the development process.      



 
 
   
<p>Karri Saarinen remembers having his first strong reaction to design when he was 6 or 7. Saarinen is the co-founder of the software development tool Linear, a product known for its aesthetic point of view, and he says it happened while bike shopping with his family. “I would look at a lot of the bicycles and feel like, ‘Why are so many of these kind of ugly? I don’t like them,’” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And then I had this thought, like, ‘Why do people do this? Why, if you make all this, if you go to the effort of building this bicycle and then painting it, why do you make it ugly?’ I didn’t necessarily understand that there is some kind of process involved, or like you need some kind of taste.” Saarinen couldn’t have articulated this at the time, but as he grew older, he realized that an object that’s off in some way could be a product of bad processes—disrespecting the materials, time and labor that went into making it. In some ways, this reaction is specific to Saarinen, who says he’s always been conscious of his sense of taste: “When I look at things, I could see, ‘This could be better,’” he says. But in other ways, this is a distinctly Finnish way of seeing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saarinen, who runs Linear with fellow Finns and founders Jori Lallo and Tuomas Artman, says people in Scandinavia, Finland especially, are attuned to simplicity, with a preference for function and durability. Lallo echoes this, mentioning a memorable Finnish marketing campaign that said something to the effect that one (perfectly designed) stool is enough. “There’s more of a design sense overall … it’s everywhere,” Saarinen says. Although the founders live, at least part of the year, in America, Linear is a Finnish product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finland was occupied by Sweden and Russia for more than 750 years, and so, until relatively recently, it was a poor country with a culture of national solidarity. Upon independence in 1917, one of the ways the new country defined itself was through affordable, functional design that referenced the landscape. Finland was thick with birch and pine forests and dotted with countless lakes, so long before sustainability became a global buzzword, goods were made to be durable, from wood, and with little to no ornamentation. Even though Finland started to become wealthy during post-World War II rebuilding, industrialization didn’t take hold until the mid-1960s, almost 100 years after it spread in America. This informs a Finnish aesthetic that prizes craftsmanship, both as a process and as an end. Between the three of them, Lallo, Saarinen and Artman mentioned Finnish companies like Iittala, Artek and Fiskars as influences. And they talked about what they perceive to be a specifically Finnish way of caring for others through designing objects and spaces. “Maybe it’s part of [being] such a small country that there’s this high sense of common good and equality as values,” says Lallo. “I think that also translates to [the idea] that good design should be accessible for everyone.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Linear helps people build software more elegantly and efficiently so they can make products that are more intuitive and more enjoyable for the world to use. Saarinen is passionate about Linear’s mission because, he says, software is only becoming more important. If Linear succeeds in supporting more thoughtfully designed software, billions of daily users will benefit in ways that are subtle but cumulative. His vision is one in which countless annoyances are smoothed in the digital world, where both engineers and users feel, if not actual pleasure, the absence of frustration. “Unfortunately, I don’t think that software has gotten a lot better necessarily … in terms of the quality. A lot of people have problems with the products, and there’s bugs, and there’s products that are kind of messy, or just not really considered. Back in the day, care for the craft was there and we would like to see more of it.”</p>



<p>He thinks this “hacky” software is an outgrowth of the systems that dictate how it’s made, and Linear is designed to push engineers in a different direction through how the tool tracks issues, manages projects and creates roadmaps, among other capabilities. Linear’s main competitor is Atlassian’s Jira, which has more than 180,000 customers and is considered the legacy standard for software-development management. But Linear is a rebuttal to Jira. It is notably fast and only minimally customizable, defined by its meticulous design—in the fonts and colors, but also in the logic of how the product functions. Built for Agile workflows, Jira is exhaustively customizable in a way that some engineers find onerous. In contrast, the first version of Linear was designed to serve small teams, creating software with specific points of view. Linear <a href="https://linear.app/readme">calls Agile outdated</a>. Agile has matured over decades from vocal rebel to status quo, which is both the opportunity and risk of Linear’s point of view. “We want to show there’s a different way, because, in our experience with most of the top tech companies, they’re not using Agile,” Saarinen says. “It’s not a thing.”</p>



<p>Linear’s founders want to do more than support better software creation. They want to bring back a sense of dignity to software creation, a job that today, Saarinen observes, can feel disconnected from a larger purpose. They want software engineers to feel satisfaction with and control over their work, something overreliance on project managers has chipped away at, Saarinen says. The founders want to elevate pride in craft, making something thoughtfully instead of quickly. This sense of quality has been lost, Saarinen says, to all those management layers, to “moving fast and breaking things,” and to endless process customization. It’s as though, he says with teasing indignation, the industry hasn’t evolved its practices since Jira launched in 2002.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Linear’s early adopters were the founders’ friends, people working at small tech startups. They liked how it was sleek, built-for-them and fast.  The product’s focus on craft, and on inspiring delight in users with focused functionality and design at first resonated with small and then growth stage companies, says Sequoia Capital partner Stephanie Zhan, who works with Linear, and now it’s taking off in enterprise organizations too. “There have been times where management requests to consolidate tooling or use incumbent products, and the teams using Linear inside of an organization revolt!” Zhan says. “That even happened within Sequoia itself, when our engineering, product and design teams rallied together with a full memo on why they would not use anything except Linear. That’s the resonance we strive for.”</p>



<p>Sequoia led Linear’s seed round in 2019 and Series A in 2020. And in late October, the company, still with fewer than 30 employees, released expanded functionality for enterprise and scaling companies. An open letter from Saarinen on the Linear website mentioned global players like Vercel and Cash App as users. Today, the founders are confident that just as Finland’s iconic, near-unbreakable <a href="https://hivemodern.com/pages/product1118/small-aino-aalto-tumbler-iittala?gclid=CjwKCAjw2OiaBhBSEiwAh2ZSPwr4ghcYAeCXASWEPB3zIE4HD2joao5Wpl5U6jTWyBJxUg7AY56vRRoChN0QAvD_BwE">Iittala glasses</a> elevate so many dinner tables, Linear’s design choices and functionality will elevate so many software designs. “We want to make sure that the tool inspires them,” says Artman. “One of the reasons why we always wanted to design Linear to be beautiful is because if you have a project management tool that is beautiful, then anything can be [beautiful].” Artman continues, “That’s what I love hearing about … some customers say that Linear is an inspiration for them to build something as good as we did. And if Linear is always in the face of your engineers and designers, and everybody uses it almost daily, it’s a constant reminder: if you’re working on software, here’s a good example of what good software looks like.”</p>

<p>Saarinen grew up with his mom and dad and older sister outside of Hämeenlinna, a 50,000-person city about an hour north of Helsinki. He has quaint, distinctly Finnish memories like skiing to school, but one of the defining moments of Saarinen’s childhood was when his family got a Commodore 128K. By age 5, he was using it even though he couldn’t read. His sister, five years older, showed him how to match the letters and numbers on the keyboard to the letters and numbers on the screen so he could launch his favorite game, “Bubble Bobble,” about two dragons saving their girlfriends from bad guys. By fifth grade, Saarinen was playing “Quake,” battling monsters in a medieval setting. The game had a multiplayer mode, and Saarinen played with friends on a team. He says all the “cool teams” had their own websites. A builder even then, he checked several coding books out of a nearby library and figured out how to design and build a site “quite fast,” he says.</p>



<p>Mostly bored with school, he threw himself into LAN parties, where computer-lovers connected to a local area network to play multiplayer games. It involved a lot of caffeinated drinks. When he was in sixth grade, he attended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_(demoparty)">a historic, 5,000-person LAN</a> when eSports pioneer Assembly Organizing rented Finland’s largest arena, Hartwall Arena in Helsinki. “My parents let me go there with my friends, and basically, you’re in this dark place with your computer for the weekend, and then you don’t really sleep, and you just play games and stuff,” he says. “And it’s like the best, best thing for a kid who likes computers.” The event changed his life; at 13, he started hosting his own LAN parties with friends, selling tickets, figuring out how much cable to buy and literally configuring networks. After internships and jobs at tech companies through high school and college, he led Assembly Organizing’s web presence from 2006 to 2011.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Lallo and Saarinen met around 2008 as part of the Helsinki startup community, remembers Lallo. “It was a slow burn,” he says of their early friendship. “We were very different people. But I think we share similar values of care for the design and building of products.” Saarinen almost met Artman when he applied for a job at Artman’s web design agency, but Artman laughs when he admits he didn’t even offer Saarinen an interview. Lallo and Artman met when an out-of-the-blue Twitter DM turned into meeting for a beer 30 minutes later and, eventually, the three became friends.</p>



<p>After working in various Helsinki tech companies, Lallo and Saarinen moved to San Francisco. There, they launched the collaborative bookmarking system Kippt as part of Y Combinator’s Summer 2012 batch. Lallo sees Kippt as a precursor to Linear in that it was a practical tool with a small but passionate user base. Kippt was acquired by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and both of them joined that company in 2014, Saarinen as head of design and Lallo as a software engineer. Artman moved to San Francisco by 2012, working at Groupon in engineering management.&nbsp;<br>In San Francisco, Saarinen moved up to principal designer at Airbnb, Artman went on to become a senior engineer at Uber and Lallo rose at Coinbase. But soon, each felt like builders working at a company built by others. “You get an itch after some time to do something a little bit more on your terms,” says Lallo. He’d taken a sabbatical after leaving Coinbase in 2018, and started nudging Saarinen and Artman about building the kind of tool they’d always wanted. It would be something that encouraged flow, something that didn’t just work, but that made doing work more pleasurable. Each man, Lallo says, had experienced the hassle of switching between various software management tools, all of which they felt were not as helpful or elegant as they could have been. It didn’t take much convincing, Lallo says. He worked on Linear full time, and Artman and Saarinen chipped away on nights and weekends. “I don’t think we ever questioned if there’s a need for it, or if we could pull it off,” Lallo says.</p>

<p>When they started Linear, Lallo says they decided to bootstrap. So they built out the first version for small and mid-size companies, figuring that the three of them, and maybe, eventually, a few hires, could reasonably create their ideal issue tracking system. To grow, they invited friends in the startup world to use it. One day, they Tweeted about working on an exciting new software design product, but there was no waitlist signup link. It was just an announcement. Sequoia’s Zhan didn’t follow any of the founders, but people she trusts in her Twitter network did, and she spotted their tweets of excitement about Linear. Zhan reached out, and Lallo says, laughing, “While we were like, ‘We’re not fundraising, so we’re not talking to investors,’ but when Sequoia calls, you take the meeting, at least to get to know them.” Zhan saw Linear’s potential: “You’d be hard-pressed to find a product with as much dissatisfaction as some of the incumbents in this space, and ironically, these entrenched incumbents have massive adoption and business scale. I knew there just had to be a better way.” Also worth noting, Jira’s maker Atlassian is worth a bit more than $31 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia is always looking for a business with a novel and compelling insight, Zhan says, and Linear had a powerful one: “The fundamental thing that Linear did differently was this idea of being highly opinionated,” she says. “They understood that, the truth is, most companies have no idea what the right software development process is,” Zhan says. “The subset who do would much prefer focusing on building their product than dedicating time to shaping this process—customizing Jira and having a dedicated team maintaining it.” Endless customization can be a painful and complex experience, she continues. “People want simplicity, and they want to know what is right, what is best. That’s where the opinionated nature of Linear comes into play.” She also says Linear’s focus on design makes it feel premium: “I think [Linear is] setting a new standard for the quality of developer tools. It’s almost a Veblen good for developers and high-functioning modern teams. It symbolizes a cultural belief in building quality products.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Often, software design management tools try to be everything to everyone through endless customization options. And, Saarinen says, sometimes customization led to moments of real momentum for him and his teams. But there were also countless times when his tools took him out of flow, because, he points out, most people are not that great at optimizing tool customization. So Linear chose to design a specific product for a specific person. The team focused on making the best tool it could for a software engineer, looking at one workflow at at time, asking, says Saarinen, “how can we make it reduce the friction as much as possible so that when they use the product, they don’t hit this annoying, frustrating thing, and kind of break that momentum in the team, or in their daily work.”</p>



<p>The solution was already part of the founders’ aesthetic preferences. One of the things people value about Scandinavian design is that, generally, objects don’t draw attention to themselves. They are plain, functional and offer the user something “honest,” in Saarinen’s assessment. Linear’s leap forward in software development is that it is designed to be honest in this way, to literally not draw attention to itself. Linear is designed to read as “professional” to engineers, says Saarinen, with a dark gray sans-serif font called <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> on a black background, and a gradient purple sphere for a logo. It’s based on the black coding environments many engineers prefer, minimizing battery drain and eye strain. It feels like a person looked at it and said, “This is it.” That person was Saarinen, who designed it. “When we started in 2019, I saw a lot of web companies having this kind of fun-type website where you have these colorful illustrations about people and things,” he says. “For me, work is serious. If I’m building a house, I don’t want my tools to be fun. I want them to be good. I want them to be professional.” Saarinen sees aesthetics as increasingly important. Competition for software adoption is so fierce, he says, that users are only interested in an app or program if it’s a pleasure to use. “I think for the past 15 years or so, we had kind of the playbook … like move fast and break things and don’t care about anything else, or don’t care about the quality,” Saarinen says. “I think that playbook maybe is getting played out.”</p>



<p>These aesthetics are the first way Linear is designed specifically for coders. The next way is through endless streamlining—removing friction, rethinking workflows, eliminating alerts, checking that every action is intuitive and not confusing, and ensuring maximum speed so there are never flow-killing lags. “You could think it’s a very minor thing, but I feel like it’s actually probably the most meaningful thing,” Saarinen says. “When people feel good about the work, and they feel good about making progress, or just they are allowed to make progress, then that progress happens, and, generally, people are happier, and, generally, the company, I think, will be more successful.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Linear’s founders don’t want to just serve software engineers, though. They want to re-center them. Today hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people might develop a piece of software. This has led to two things, Saarinen says: a focus on process over product, and removing engineers from positions of influence. “I think people get too focused on the different frameworks and processes,” he says, “and you start to forget, what are you actually doing?” Linear is designed to simplify the how, enabling teams to focus on the what. And its functionality encourages designers and engineers to use it for building and planning together. This is also one of Linear’s marketing tools. Saarinen perceives that the competition for talent is so intense that gifted people won’t work for companies with bad processes or tools; they’ll choose companies that use tools designed for them.</p>



<p>Linear’s point of view has resonated. Founded in January 2019, Linear was profitable by July 2021. A company that started as a minimal software issue tracker eventually did open that waitlist, and now has enterprise-level capabilities, empowering teams of various functions to interact as part of a cohesive development ecosystem. This is one way Zhan sees Linear growing—starting with a company’s engineering, product and software design teams and spreading beyond. (This is how Figma grew, starting with designers.) Saarinen, Lallo, and Artman are focused on Linear’s impact long-term. Saarinen and Artman both talk about Apple’s relentless, exacting focus on design as being almost peerless, and they would like, someday, for Linear to be described similarly. Saarinen even picked the dark gray font color inspired by Apple’s Mac Pro colorways. “That’s one of the reasons why we designed it so well,” says Artman. “I hope that it inspires people to build better software. But you know, if it doesn’t, we still give you time back. Like, the tool should get out of your way in the end, so that you can focus on whatever is important.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So while Linear is designed for software engineers, its real beneficiary is all of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is vital that blockchain, as with all new economic foundations, grows in tandem with standards. Zaisan has developed a systematic solution to enable <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">GDPR-compliant blockchain services</a> that adhere to these standards.</p>



<p>Blockchain was not the focus of the people that drafted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) framework. The technology was not widely available yet.</p>



<p>GDPR regulations are written with some sort of centralised control in mind. This is the opposite of how blockchain technology is supposed to work. The opportunities that arise because of this new technology, the potential drawbacks, and the way Zaisan deals with these drawbacks are detailed in this article.</p>



 Understanding Data Controllers 



<p>One can give many rights to a human, but without knowing against whom they can be revoked, these rights lack meaning.</p>



<p>Therefore, the GDPR regulations introduce a “data controller” role. This is a person towards whom the people may turn if they want to invoke their rights. A GDPR “data controller” is, as the name suggests, the person or entity which controls the data. It determines what data can be used, and how.</p>



<p>For example, if a company stores and uses data to communicate with its clients, that company “controls” such use, making them the data controller.</p>



<p>If a controller decides to hire third parties to help with the processing of data, these third parties are referred to as “data processors”. “Use”, “store” and many other actions regarding data are called “processing” in the GDPR.</p>



 How does this work with blockchain technology? 



<p>If a company uses blockchain to run software (decentralised application -dApps-), that company is the controller for the data which the dApp processes.</p>



<p>But how about a public blockchain? Is the blockchain the hired hand? The “data processor”?</p>



<p>There is no contract between a dApp and the “blockchain”. The blockchain is not a single entity, rather, it is software that runs in a decentralised way. Node operators are often anonymous, and the company just launches the dApp. So it is unclear. Yet, the blockchain is not a controller: it merely performs instructions it gets from the dApp.</p>



 What about data blockchain processes without dApps? 



<p>How about processes such as transferring tokens and storing transactions? The blockchain should be the data controller. But yet again, the blockchain is not an entity. In this event, are all the nodes controllers? But they don’t “control”. They just “mine” transactions.</p>



<p>How could they be controllers? Blockchain is designed in a decentralised way.</p>



<p>It is, therefore, safe to say, that it is impossible for a public, permissionless blockchain, to establish or even determine a data controller and processor. For this reason alone, such a blockchain can never be compliant with GDPR.</p>



 GDPR-compliant public blockchains 



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">A GDPR-compliant public blockchain</a> is possible, but it needs some form of centralisation and control. There has to be an entity where the people can turn to with their questions and demands. Additionally, this entity needs to ensure that sensitive personal data is not stored on-chain. This entity needs to have enough power to ensure GDPR compatibility of the blockchain,&nbsp; but not enough that it could tamper with the blockchain’s immutability, and threaten the very core of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>There are many blockchains that have central entities involved to some degree. Often, it is a foundation that decides on code upgrades or similar matters. It is possible to give that entity enough controlling powers to make it the controller – if the software and its concrete setup allow it.</p>



<p>Europechain by Zaisan, built on delegated proof of stake (DPoS) software, is an example of a setup that is compatible in this respect.</p>



<p>As with everywhere else, with Europechain the dApps are data controllers. They must conclude a processing agreement with Europechain, which will be the data processor. Before dApps are allowed to deploy on the Europechain public blockchain, they will have to prove that they will not store sensitive data on-chain.</p>



<p>Europechain concludes sub-processor agreements with all the nodes (the block producers). Without concluding a (sub)processor agreement, a party cannot run a dApp or become a node.</p>



<p>If there is no dApp involved in the transaction (for instance, in the event of token transfers on the base layer) Europechain is the controller. In that event, the nodes are not sub-processors but processors. The agreements are drafted such that they allow for that.</p>



<p>These agreements have dispute resolutions in them so that the powers of Europechain are in check and the nodes can be easily forced to comply with Europechain’s instructions.</p>



<p>This setup allows for adequate control to ensure the people are informed and are able to submit their requests to a competent and compliant entity. Furthermore, this allows for the contractual infrastructure required under the GDPR.</p>



<p>Given that the powers of Europechain have been tailored to the position of a data controller and given that they are kept in check by the dispute resolution system, there is no way Europechain’s position may endanger the blockchain core values.</p>



<p>Europechain’s setup proves it is possible to find the right balance. A balance that is necessary for blockchain to become a mainstream infrastructure.</p>



 Key takeaways 



 
 It is impossible for a public, permissionless blockchain, to establish or even determine a data controller and processor 



 With <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain</a>, Zaisan has developed a systematic solution to enable GDPR-compliant blockchain services that adhere to economic foundation standards 



 GDPR regulations introduce a “data controller” role, a person towards whom the people may turn if they want to invoke their rights. 



 A GDPR-compliant public blockchain is possible, but it needs some form of centralisation and control 



 In the Europechain environment, the dApps act as data controllers

<p>Thank you to all the candidates who ran for election. It says a lot about the strength and vibrancy of the Zcash community to have such a great slate of candidates. We hope to see some of you throwing your hat in the ring again in the next election, which will take place at the end of June. </p>



<p>This election sees the departure of Adi (aiyadt on the forums), who was elected to the committee a year ago but decided against seeking re-election in order to focus on the roadmap for Nighthawk Wallet and grow the Nighthawk team. Adi’s technical background made him a valuable member of the ZCG Committee. We want to thank him on behalf of the Foundation, and the broader Zcash community for his service. </p>

<p>I’m sitting on the sofa, my “office,” listening to a warm winter rain fall as the clock winds down on the year 2022. It’s quiet. My better half is out with friends, though I got my New Year’s kiss before he left. I spent much of the day in my flannel PJs making a batch of chicken noodle soup with the root veggies that survived our week away. Over the holiday we escaped the biting cold that gripped the east coast and headed to southeastern Utah.</p>
<p>Jason introduced me to the region’s many wonders last spring after our field work in Salt Lake City and at the Mormon Transhumanist Association’s annual conference on blockchain. The massive, towering rock faces were an antidote then and now – both to the machinations of zealous, esoteric logicians and to the wounds not-yet-healed among family and loved ones. The calendar pages keep flipping by, but the angst of 2020 still holds sway in our family, and many others I’m guessing. Many have blithely moved on, not realizing there are other shoes to drop – Web3, human augmentation, collective consciousness (including non-human agents), swarm intelligence, and automated AI portfolios placing bets on where each of us (and our digital twins) will fit (or not) into the new normal.</p>
<p>My young adult child remains estranged from me. I’ve been cancelled with no foreseeable path to redemption, restoration, wholeness. The latest I’ve heard is that I’m supposed to think about what I have done wrong in “choosing” this path over them. The only offer is one of conditional love, conditioned on me becoming someone else. I cannot live a lie. I hold out hope that one day we may forge a new path built on mutual respect, knowing deep connections of care can never be severed between mother and child. Until then, I wait, though not always gracefully. I’ve never been a patient person; perhaps this is part of the learning I need to do.</p>
<p>Before heading south to Moab, I stopped by the Cathedral of the Madeleine and lit a candle with a prayer for fortitude and healed relational ruptures. This is not the only loss I carry from this year. If anything, 2022 has been a season of falling away. As I came to understand how the cybernetic steering techniques were being deployed to shape narratives and in doing so continue the polarization that is so vital to accomplishing their post-human goals, I chose to leave social media. I still have this blog and my channel but learning to “be” outside digital information ebbs and flows is unsettling – especially when in the real world doesn’t know what to do with you either. I continue to be grateful for my ever-tighter circle of friends who continue to take my calls and buoy my spirits even as they face imposing challenges of their own.</p>
<p>Instead of moping around a quiet house at the holidays – this is the first year we haven’t put up a tree since we moved here in 1998 – I lobbied for a sojourn to a land of red rocks, ancient cedars, cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and uranium. We were in Natural Bridges National Monument on Christmas day and had the place almost to ourselves. The opportunity to stand on the edge, not too close, of the canyons cut from Cedar Mesa’s Permian sandstone was a gift, helping re-situate my soul within the grand dance of the cosmos. It was a blessing to drink in the immensity of nature’s creation, god’s hand transforming giant boulders to smaller and smaller stones until they became sand once again. Depressions in the stone gradually collect soil knitted together through complex relationships among fungi, lichen, algae, and the cyano-bacteria that gave us our atmosphere.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Across acres of slickrock we saw living terrariums in various stages of development: smears of dark lichen at the bottom of a puddle; decades-old soil crusts, tiny, fractal kingdoms echoing in miniature their butte, fin, and escarpment counterparts; and circular gardens where cacti and Mormon tea cozied up to extravagantly shaggy, twisted Utah cedars. These beauties took centuries to manifest and mature, a timeframe that is almost incomprehensible to us in an age where our attentions are yanked from one direction to another on an hourly basis. Once again, I lay on the rocks soaking up the sun, nibbling Honeycrisp apples and a Spanish cheese, sinking into the blue skies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Terrariums, and the potholes that hold them are circular, a point that was hit home on our trip to the Needles division of Canyonlands. It had rained the night before, showing off rounded patterns to great effect with the ripples of drops from intermittent showers enhancing the circles within circles within circles – life renewed in the desert. Circles on petroglyphs, in the architecture of kivas, the shape juniper berries, and water smoothed pebbles, each embodying the energetic force that flows through living systems. That was my gift this Christmas, to experience the interconnectedness, knowing that the machine logic’s attempts to steal the circle for a cybernetic feedback loop is bound to fail.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After exploring the cliff dwellings at Hovenweep I picked up Harold Courlander’s “The Fourth World of the Hopis.” I’ve already read most of the stories that tell how the Hopi came into this world and the nature of their migrations over many generations. The first chapter describes their move from a Third World that had become overrun by evil from powakas, or sorcerers. After bird messengers were sent to explore the Fourth World and ask permission for re-settlement, the good Hopi who were following the old ways climbed, with assistance from Grandmother Spider, through the sipapuni into a new world where the mockingbird named the clans and gave each a special kind of corn to grow that shaped their destiny.</p>
<p>It turns out that one sorceress managed to climb up the stalk. The Bahanas, the white tribe, agreed to take her because they felt her knowledge would be valuable. The rest of the tribes were wary of this, but there was a prophecy that one day an unknown person would come from the east and bring harmony among the Hopi. A member of the Fire Clan carved a stone tablet with figures, broke it in two pieces and gave one half to the Bahanas as they left, saying that when that person arrived, they should present their half of the slab to prove their good intentions.</p>
<p>I have concerns that as we move forward with “regenerative finance” and ESG (environmental, social, governance) portfolios, and outcomes-based “social impact” deals tied to addressing past injustice and trauma inflicted on the original people that pretenders to this prophecy will come west with promises of blockchain “sovereignty” for tribes and pandering pretensions to incorporate indigenous customs and “sacred economics” into emerging systems of stakeholder capitalism. Years of identity politics and performative (but often shallow and insincere) reconciliation attempts have primed the pump.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/news/the-rockefeller-foundation-announces-ten-grants-at-cop27-to-scale-indigenous-and-regenerative-agriculture-practices-globally/#:~:text=SHARM%20EL%2DSHEIKH%20%7C%20November%209,agriculture%20practices%20around%20the%20world."></a></p>
<p>For decades indigenous people of the world sought justice from the United Nations when the entities governing their original lands were wreaking havoc. Over the past two or three decades the UN has increasingly paid lip service to tribal groups, knowing all the while that the cybernetic enclosures governed from space would be coming online shortly, and that they could afford to give legal rights to nature. Blockchain smart contracts with drone surveillance and digital penalties would be a perfect way to dispossess people under the pretense of protection.</p>
<p>During our college search we ended up touring Dickinson College. Dickinson is located in Carlisle, PA, and just outside the town is the home of the US Army War College on the grounds of Carlisle Indian School, the model for the residential school program in the United States and Canada. It is there that Captain Richard Pratt declared the need to kill the Indian to save the man. As it was many of children who were sent to these schools and in fact helped build them died. They never made it home, though some remains are gradually being identified and returned. The hundreds of white gravestones that line North Street are a reminder of this grim past.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I took my family to see the campus and pay our respects to the spirits of the children and their families. You can only access the site after going through a background check across the road. That done, we drove across the street and as we pulled over to park, I noticed a display sign flashing notices for upcoming events, including a program on George Armstrong Custer. The focus of today’s army is on insurgent, asymmetrical warfare. The lessons of the frontier are still very much on the forefront of military planners on the eve of the roll out of this new digital empire. It is my opinion that the greatest threat to implementation of blockchain, smart-contract, tech-no-logic governance is Indigenous practice, connection to the sacred energy flow of the universe. That is something that cannot be factored into their physics equations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I sense a full court press is about to be launched to convince Indigenous peoples, not just of North America but of the world, to accept offers of digital currency and digital governance. I think a pitch will be made to bridge the Eisenstein-inspired Celo “sacred economics,” the tokenized “commons,” with a more collectivist and “regenerative” worldview. This is the “Game B” that is being promoted by Jim Rutt, the Santa Fe Institute, and members of the intellectual dark web. The foundations have been laid with Hanne Strong, founder of Crestone and wife of oil baron / sustainability promoter Maurice Strong, and the Hopi prophecy.</p>

<p>I did a search for “indigenous” “circles” and “cybernetics” and up came a July 2021 paper presented at IEEE, “<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Circle-of-All-Nations-Digital-Global-Village-%E2%80%93-into-Thumbadoo-Taylor/e5c78a40b16fc06bdc293ed578f3b16e1b974195">Circle of All Nations Digital Global Village – William Commanda’s Indigenous Cybernetic Navigation into the Age of Information Technology</a>.” <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/aboriginal-leader-followed-a-path-of-enlightenment-and-vision/article590284/">William Commanda</a>, Algonquin elder (1913-2011) and keeper of sacred wampum belts, embraced social media to promote “A Circle of All Nations” in partnership with the UN. He was portrayed as a master crafter of canoes, which he linked to cybernetics, and a pioneer in <a href="https://www.ijahss.net/assets/files/1597173635.pdf">cyber-cartography</a>. A battle is being set up between Grandmother Spider and a non-living system that aims to tangle us in a web not of silk, but of data and logic circuits. Commanda, whose Algonquin name is Ojshigkwanang (morning star) seems to have had a prominent role carved out for himself, paving the way for a new form of capitalism that would help build the digital empire by financializing and parasitizing nature and traditional cultural practice and social relations. That is what the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Circle-of-All-Nations-Commanda-.pdf">digital global eco-village paradigm</a> actually is.</p>
<p><a href="https://atlas.icaci.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_icc_thumbadoo_integrating_cybercartography_ppt_low.pdf"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://atlas.icaci.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_icc_thumbadoo_integrating_cybercartography_ppt_low.pdf"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://atlas.icaci.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_icc_thumbadoo_integrating_cybercartography_ppt_low.pdf"></a></p>
<p>In many of the Hopi stories, Grandmother Spider sits on the ear of the protagonist, a person who had treated her with respect and honored sacred practices. She offers guidance through perilous journeys. They move forward together in relationship. In today’s tech-no-logic world we have handed over our sacred guidance system to slick machines created by defense interests. Like the Hopi left behind in the trek to the Fourth World, we risk forgetting who we are, what life means, becoming entranced by dead devices that have no soul, no imagination, no artistry.</p>
<p>Be in nature. Look for her circles. See interrelated living communities not as ecological niches to be measured, counted, and sampled for unique genetic re-mixing and investing potential, but as a gracious symphony, delicate and expansive. One memorable parts of this trip was seeing again a spectacular orange-red lichen upon a boulder at the top of the trail through Hovenweep Canyon. I saw it in March and again last week.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s probably as old as I am and aging better, too! It was a good reminder to reset our expectations of time. Dial it back towards the geological setting. Maybe then the loss of connection to a child for a year won’t feel so sharp. I know eventually the edges will soften, just like that Permian Sandstone wearing down to create soil for new life and maybe one day become a stone again.</p>
<p>Happy New Year folks. Let’s enjoy the show!</p>

<p>Blockchains are immutable record keepers, storing information about every transaction ever recorded. However, this attribute comes at a cost: as more and more transactions occur, so does the size of the record expands. In turn, the hardware requirements for running a node increase which ultimately affects decentralization. Another aspect frequently criticized is how transactions are being processed by legacy blockchains in terms of speed. For both of these aspects there is a cryptographic solution that addresses scalability: zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs). These allow one entity (prover) to prove to another entity (verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any additional information about the process or data involved. When applied to blockchains, ZKPs improve scalability and privacy by certifying that state transitions occurred, without the need to relay the underlying information.</p><p>In Part 1 of this 2-part episode, we were joined by Anna Rose, host of Zero Knowledge Podcast and founder of ZK Summit, ZK Validator and ZK Hack, and Kobi Gurkan, Head of Research at Geometry, to discuss the state of the ZK ecosystem and how this promising technology is evolving.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Anna’s background &amp; her involvement in the ZK ecosystem  Kobi’s background in cryptography  Trusted setups, a brief history: Plumo &amp; Aztec  ZK Hack(athon)  The State of the ZK ecosystem  How the ZK landscape evolved: from SNARKs to STARKs  Trade-offs: compatibility, security, performance  Aztec &amp; Noir DSL  The need for performance benchmarks  ZK L1s: Zcash, Mina, Aleo  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/zeroknowledgefm">Zero Knowledge Podcast on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zeroknowledgefm">Zero Knowledge Podcast on YouTube</a>  <a href="https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/plonk-arithmetiization-air">The paper Kobi mentioned (by Ariel Gabizon)</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/AnnaRRose">Anna Rose on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/kobigurk">Kobi Gurkan on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

 From token launch to a truly global mixnet — Nym in&nbsp;2022 <p>A wrap up of Nym achievements in&nbsp;2022…</p><p>Nym was founded to enable digital privacy and security for humanity. This year, the Nym mixnet went live to fix a fundamental flaw in the design of the internet: the fact that traffic flows are entirely exposed, revealing everyone’s patterns of communication, putting people, systems and societies at risk. This is all about to&nbsp;change…</p><p>In 2023, we are looking forward to reaching our next major milestones, including: high speed mixnet, censorship resistant gateways, major integrations, privacy preserving paid usage via zk-nyms and new&nbsp;PEApps!</p><p>Before leaving 2022 behind, we would like to take a brief glance back on an eventful year for Nym. Here are a few highlights of what has been achieved over the past 12 months through the tireless work and support of our community, backers, partners and&nbsp;team:</p>  Over 1M registrations (a Coinlist record!) for the Nym token&nbsp;sale!  Nym <a href="https://youtu.be/lnOkbRzYVGA">launch with Edward Snowden</a> in&nbsp;Paris.

     2022 was an exciting year for the Horizen ecosystem. Several major milestones were reached, including the launch of our tokenization platform, <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint,</a> the release of our new ecosystem wallet, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt</a>, and the successful turnout of our first ecosystem summit, <a href="https://zencon.events/">Zencon0</a>.&nbsp; 
<p>It’s an exciting time for the Horizen ecosystem as we push into 2023 with our first public EVM and many exciting announcements and partnerships to go with that, but first, let’s dive into what happened in 2022!</p>
 2022 Q4 Highlights 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ZBF_2022-review_BY-THE-NUMBER.jpg"></a></p>
 Community Growth 
<p>The community grew a lot this year. During Q4, our Twitter following grew by 130%. YouTube subscribers grew by 17.39% ! LinkedIn saw a big boost in follower growth with a jump of over 350%, and Reddit subscriber growth increased by 112.5%. </p>
<p><br>These new members helped us test our new products like <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>, and more! Which helped educate upgrades to the products and future ideas for new products in the Horizen ecosystem. We are excited to see the community continue to grow in 2023!</p>
 Horizen on the Web 
<p></p>
<p>2022 has been an exciting year for the teams supporting the Horizen websites as our online representation grows and matures. Through Q4 in particular, we saw a major increase in organic traffic to <a href="https://www.horizen.io/blockchain-academy/">Horizen Academy,</a> our educational hub covering topics of blockchain and web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>15 articles were published in Q4 to Horizen Academy. Additionally, we saw an increase of 84% in weekly organic visitors and a overall increase of 15% in total users! This growth is amazing to see as adoption through education is a major goal of our project.&nbsp;</p>
 2022 Highlights 
 Our Technology 
<p>In 2022, we launched <a href="https://tokenmint.global/">TokenMint to mainnet.</a> Tokenmint is a quick and easy token launch platform where anyone can create and mint their own fungible and nonfungible tokens with custom tokenomics. No developer skills are needed! The launch of TokenMint also included launching of the following tools:</p>
 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet</a>, our Google Chrome extension web wallet, which just recently updated to include a <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io">built-in test token faucet</a> in the wallet! 
 <a href="https://app.tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a>, a web app that provides a seamless and no-code process to launch fungible or non-fungible tokens. 
 TokenMint <a href="https://explorer.tokenmint.global/">Block Explorer</a>, which displays and tracks all transactions on TokenMint.&nbsp; 
 
<p>We look forward to new integrations and partnerships, scoping and creating a mobile app, sidechain-to-sidechain interoperability, migrating to an account-based model, and more!</p>
<p>Another major focus has been the development of our first EVM sidechain that will allow developers to utilize existing Ethereum tooling to create a wealth of dapps on Horizen. The upcoming launch of the Horizen EVM will open the Horizen ecosystem up to a wider community of developers and web3 users. </p>
<p> Horizen’s EVM sidechain is coming to public testnet soon in 2023! The Horizen EVM sidechain is currently running on an internal testnet, this is a major milestone of the EVM project we accomplished in 2022.&nbsp; The team has been working with 3rd party partners and testers to perform security audits and feature improvements.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We are also working on an EVM documentation library that will provide users everything needed to deploy dapps on Horizen! Our aim is&nbsp;to make our EVM as developer-friendly as possible, so builders can easily bring their projects over to Horizen to build a more open and inclusive blockchain ecosystem that will benefit all participants.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To learn more about the Horizen EVM sidechain, check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/DRIm1f9-t6Y">EVM demo video</a>. In this video, Victor and Alberto share some insights into the latest accomplishments with a demo of our EVM pre-Alpha from Oleksandr showing ZEN on MetaMask and some of the basic functionality of the EVM chain.</p>
 Horizen Node Network&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>2022 was a tough year for the blockchain industry. We saw a decline in the total number of the Horizen nodes, however, the our node network continued remaining one of the largest and providing us a robust and secure infrastructure.&nbsp; Learn more about <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/why-blockchain-users-are-setting-up-horizen-nodes/">why blockchain users are setting up Horizen nodes</a>.</p>
 2022 Partnerships 
<p></p>
<p>In 2022, we welcomed thirteen new integrations, of which three were multicoin exchanges, four new centralized exchanges, the first AMM model exchange support for ZEN, one new wallet, one new PoS provider, two new fiat onramps and expanded our integrations with five existing partners.</p>
<p>In connection with our TokenMint platform, our partner <a href="https://pipeflare.io">PipeFlare</a> (now Layer3 Labs) launched <a href="https://pipeflare.io/game/punkz-hero">Punkz Hero</a>, an exciting play-to-earn Super Mario-type game, even with a custom Zenny character!&nbsp;</p>
 Horizen Community Initiatives&nbsp; 
 Horizen Ambassador Program 
<p>In 2022, we welcomed several new ambassadors to our <a href="https://www.horizen.io/ambassadors/#become-zenvangelist">Ambassador Program</a> and look forward to seeing even more new ambassadors in 2023! We are incredibly grateful for all of the hard work our ambassadors and Zenvangelists put in each day to help grow the Horizen ecosystem, help fellow users and work on making the project thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for some exciting new initiatives in 2023 centered around developer growth in the Horizen ecosystem! More information will be released around this in the New Year.&nbsp;</p>
 Events 
 ZenCon0 
<p><a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon0</a> was our first-ever ecosystem summit, which brought together some of the greatest minds in crypto to envision our future!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Celebrating the growth and accomplishments of our project and ecosystem with partners and supporters was a dream come true for us. Hosted by our sister company Horizen Labs, we welcomed partners, advisors, and community members that joined us at our first ecosystem summit to celebrate our achievements and share ideas for growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two-day conference was filled with spotlights, panels, and break-out sessions ranging from <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">Metaverse on the Horizen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/zXhR5u3RLhs">Web3 &amp; Sports</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wGaZRj5VOCg">The Power of Community</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG stories</a>, and more!</p>
<p><a href="http://zencon.events"></a></p>
<p>On the tech side of things, we heard incredible updates from the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams’ – <a href="https://youtu.be/8dgQ8Vr5FWs">an overview of TokenMint and its current status</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">where the team is on the Horizen EVM sidechain, DeFi on Horizen</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JvY8o8N4_2Q">what’s next for Zendoo</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ZenCon0 also brought the global team together in one place to brainstorm, connect, and innovate. The Horizen Labs and Horizen teams from different divisions gave presentations on their expertise areas, which allowed members of other teams to gain exposure and knowledge in areas they might not previously have. Ranging from hands-on demos and product overviews to improving blockchain communications.</p>

 Consensus 2022 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was in Austin, Texas, for Consensus 2022, where we had a fantastic time! We had a booth set up where we were able to give live demos of TokenMint; many attendees stopped by and created their own tokens in only 5 minutes, learning how the token generator works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Horizen Co-Founder and Team Lead Rob Viglione presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3cGfULIwRg&amp;t=3s">“From Cypherpunk to Solving the Blockchain Trilemma Through zkSNARKS”</a> at Consensus to a packed audience while also conducting a fireside chat on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2JjEdrpM9g&amp;t=1s">“How Zero-Knowledge Proofs Change the Narrative Around Privacy.”</a></p>
<p>Horizen, along with Horizen Labs, hosted a side event with our partner, Halborn Security at Consensus, where guests enjoyed food, drink, and networking! We saw many longtime community members at the event, and it was a good chance for much of the team to network and catch up with each other during the busy event week.</p>
 Paris Blockchain Week 
<p></p>
<p>The Horizen team was at Paris Blockchain Week April 12-14! Our booth was packed during all three days of the event. We discussed our upcoming EVM-compatible sidechain and NFTs, and learned about many exciting new projects in the space. Liat also spoke on several panels about NFTs and blockchain technology. </p>
 NFT NYC 2022 
<p></p>
<p>This year, Zain Cheng, Horizen’s VP of Engineering, presented on the future of NFTs during this major event in NYC. Zain’s panel discussion was one of our favorite talks during the event and covered his opinions on what the future of NFTs could look like.&nbsp;</p>

 What to Look Forward to in 2023 
<p>Our EVM sidechain project is estimated to go to public testnets in early 2023! The team is working on extensive documentation for the EVM project, creating a more efficient experience for developers to build on Horizen using our EVM. Our EVM is a functioning sidechain, compatible with Ethereum tools and able to execute all Ethereum-compatible smart contracts. It is what we are looking forward to the most, and we hope users are excited to give it a try!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also looking forward to launching our monthly podcast, Beyond the Horizen, which is coming in January 2023! This will be more in-depth conversations with project partners, community members, team members, and more and is an evolution of our Weekly Insider series, be sure to check it out once it launches! More information coming soon on our social media channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, coming early in 2023 is an upgrade to the <a href="https://academy.horizen.io">Horizen Academy</a>. As we continue to publish expertly written educational content on blockchain technology, we’re making some upgrades to the design, structure, and functionality of the Academy. This is a really exciting development as we continue to play our part in educating the world and the community on all things blockchain, crypto, and web3.</p>

This helps direct traffic through the mixnet and allows us to stress-test it to see how much load it can handle and where we can optimise. The proxy site then sends you back a task that is only visible to people using the mixnet, so that you can prove that you have actually used NymConnect and are eligible for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Nym community and making the new internet a free and dignified place for us&nbsp;all.</p><p>#PrivacyLovesCompany!</p><p>Join our <a href="http://discord.gg/nym">Discord</a> community if you have any questions!</p><p>Read more: <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/test-and-win/">https://shipyard.nymtech.net/test-and-win/</a></p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that is used to access and operate the Nym mixnet.

At the moment this feature is turned off by default, but available for use by the application developers. We will need to wait for all the network-requesters to upgrade to this new release first, before multi-SURB anonymization can become the default setting for the SOCKS proxy&nbsp;clients.</p><p>The release also includes some additional work for distributed key generation in the Coconut signing authority nodes.</p><p>You can check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#v114-2022-12-20">changelog</a> for a complete list of fixes and&nbsp;changes.</p><p>What’s new in NymConnect?</p><p>In addition to bug fixes, performance improvements and better error handling, this release contains the new opt-in Test &amp; Earn program that anyone can join to stress test the network and earn NYM tokens.

 Meet our new hire — Jan Zibelnik, Product&nbsp;Manager <p>#18 — This is the sixteenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to welcome our latest team member, Jan Zibelnik! Jan is a talented Product Manager with previous experience in the wallet space. In his last position, he developed a product team from the ground up, and now, he’s bringing his advanced skillset to BlockWallet.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m the Product Manager here at BlockWallet. That means I’m responsible for identifying customer needs and business objectives. In addition to that, I also need to figure out what products and features will help us fulfill those needs and objectives of our users, and articulate them for everyone in the company to understand.</p><p>My day-to-day includes competitor research, user interviews, formulating requirements, and aligning business and development efforts.</p> How long have you worked as a product&nbsp;manager? <p>I started working in product in 2018 at my previous company, GateHub. I transitioned from wallet support into product management and we basically had to set up the new department from scratch. After we got the ball rolling, we managed to deliver some neat products to the market. This included a decentralized trading app and an on-chain crypto insurance solution, which from what I know, is the first of its kind and has not been replicated yet.</p> Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I previously worked at GateHub, which is an XRPL gateway and wallet. We offered users a custodial wallet with some unique features like web monetization and a non-custodial XRPL wallet for all kinds of on-chain interactions. In parallel, I was also a judge in the XRPL Grants program, where developers can receive grants for building solutions that leverage the XRPL blcokchain.</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I first heard about crypto in 2016. I created my first account and bought my first crypto in September or October that same year. It was a very calm time for about a year, so I had time to learn and realize what it could hold for our future. I’m really glad I’m able to say that I survived some highs and lows during this&nbsp;period.</p><p>In late 2017, I switched from my previous career as a football coach to a full-time job in&nbsp;crypto.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>I learned of BlockWallet when I received a call from Felipe, the Cheif Vibe Officer here at BlockWallet. I was on the lookout for a new challenge after 4+ years at GateHub, and was keen to switch companies to start learning new stuff — joining BlockWallet and transitioning to an EVM + self-custodial wallet was very intriguing to me. On top of that, when I learned about how BlockWallet wanted to position itself in the market, I was convinced.</p><p>I’m sure that in the long run, products that care about their users will prosper. A lot of the time it’s harder to be ethical and caring, especially if the competition is not, but my personal and professional tendency is to think about the user first, making this relationship a natural&nbsp;match.</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Because even if you have nothing to hide, you never know who is&nbsp;looking.</p><p>That’s the short answer. The long one though, is a bit more complicated.</p><p>The internet does not have a built-in monetization system. The result of this oversight at the very beginning is ads and data mining which online businesses need to do in order to stay afloat. In the years of Web2, data mining has become so sophisticated and widespread that only the most skilled users are able to remain fully anonymous. Most of us are just leaving bits and pieces of our info and behavior scattered all over the internet. The result is, that with a bit of effort, your sensitive info can be tracked and exploited, even if you take great care — but who really has time to think about&nbsp;that?</p><p>This is why privacy is so critical to help break our digital footprint. Our phone and laptop, our browser, our wallet, our paid services…they should work for us, not the other way around. They should help use preserve our&nbsp;privacy.</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>5 years ago, we had ICOs and CryptoKitties. We had our share of scams, but I feel it was a more innocent place back&nbsp;then.</p><p>In 5 years, we’ll probably see an evolution of everything we know now. DAOs are probably going to become more sophisticated, trustworthy, and effective. NFTs are going to break into the mainstream, but they will evolve into more than overpriced JPEGs. Think tickets to events, proofs of ownership, proofs of participation — stuff we already know, but better. Regulations are going to come into force and evolve too, which should make the space somewhat safer and more reliable.</p><p>We are going to have new players that will want to disrupt traditional CEXes where Celsius and FTX failed. So I expect to see new (decentralized and centralized) players in stocks, futures, derivatives, indices&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Finally, we can probably expect the next bull run to be fuelled by some hot new tech (gaming, metaverse, something else?), more shills, more FOMO, and more everything.</p><p>My approach: stay level-headed, and stay safe&nbsp;;)</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m thrilled to be a part of BlockWallet. I’ve met the team and already settled in nicely. I love the work we are doing, and I’m loving all the feedback from the community. I’m excited about the stuff we have brewing in the background and can’t wait to share it with everyone.</p> About BlockWallet <p>Welcome to Web3’s smoothest self-custodial wallet, where you can swap and bridge crypto right on the spot. Use BlockWallet with all your favorite blockchain apps and feel what it’s like to use a product built with users in mind.

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from Civic, DeFi Land, Degen Ape Academy, EDGE, Froggy Friends, Hubble, Kamino, Kwenta, Orca, Push Protocol, and Slingshot.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Since launching the Brave Wallet in 2021, we’ve been hard at work collaborating with developers across the Web3 ecosystem to integrate Brave Wallet support into the most used DApps on Solana, Ethereum, and EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to end the year with 85 partners that have integrated the Brave Wallet, including 11 new ones this month, as well as hundreds more DApps and wallet development kits that are now compatible with Brave Wallet. To learn more about the program and Brave’s partners, read our past announcements: <a>June</a>, <a>July</a>, <a>August</a>, <a>September</a>, <a>October</a>, and <a>November</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the partners that joined in December:</p>

 Civic 
<p><a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic</a> provides identity management tools for Web3 across chains for both consumers and DApps. For consumers, <a href="https://civic.me/">Civic.me</a> offers Dynamic Web3 profiles where you can display NFTs, manage your identity, and use on-chain messaging. For DApps, Civic Pass is an integrated permissioning tool that gives users access to their services.</p>
<p>“We’ve always seen eye-to-eye with Brave when it comes to putting the privacy of our users first. That’s why we’re delighted to offer support for Brave users on Civic.me, where they can access the most advanced, privacy-focused digital identity tools on the market,” said JP Bedoya, Chief Product Officer at Civic.</p>

 DeFi Land

     Similar to how Web 2.0 relies on data centers to provide the backbone for applications, blockchain technology needs nodes to keep the network humming along. Nodes verify transactions and secure the network, making them a critical part of any blockchain infrastructure. 
<p><a href="https://www.horizen.io/">Horizen</a> is a public blockchain with more nodes than any other blockchain. In this article, we’ll examine why blockchain users are setting up <a href="https://horizen.io/zennodes">Horizen nodes</a>.</p>
 Why Should You Set Up A Node? 
<p>Setting up a blockchain node is easier than ever, and there are also good reasons to do so. Let’s discuss some of the benefits of running a Horizen node.</p>
<p>Contributing to integrity and decentralization of a blockchain network</p>
<p>A nexus of nodes is essentially the infrastructure of a decentralized blockchain network. The node network plays an important role in defending the blockchain from unwanted changes. This can be especially important during times of hard fork contention. As a node operator, you have a say in how the network progresses, such as authenticating transactions and executing decision-making protocols.</p>
<p>Making the network more scalable and faster</p>
<p>Another key benefit of running a node is that it helps to propagate transactions throughout the network. By running a node, you’re helping to ensure that transactions are processed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Getting rewarded by contributing to the network</p>
<p>Beyond contributing to the security and resilience of a blockchain network, running a cryptocurrency node also comes with the potential to generate passive income.</p>
<p>Staking Rewards is a website that provides real-time information on the rewards being generated by nodes on various blockchains. For example, at the time of writing, a <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/horizen/">ZEN Securenode</a> has a 7.77% annualized reward rate (APR), while Ethereum 2.0 has an APR of 4.8%.</p>
<p>The amount of reward that a node earns can vary depending on network conditions and other factors. For example, Foundry Staking <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/foundry-announces-digital-assets-staking-business-and-range-of-services-for-institutions-301420872.html">recently announced</a> the launch of its institutional-grade staking service. Through the Foundry Staking portal, institutions can stake a variety of different cryptocurrencies and receive rewards in near-real-time, including from ZEN.</p>
 How to Set Up A Horizen Node 
<p>It’s very easy to set up a Horizen node. For hassle free hosting option, we recommend checking out some of our <a href="https://horizen.io/node-hosting">node hosting guide </a>to get started.&nbsp; You will not need any developer skills to run nodes through hosting services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to self host Horizen Nodes, check out the Secure and Super Node <a href="https://horizenofficial.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ZEN/pages/136872141/Secure+and+Super+Nodes">instructions. </a>Self-hosting your own node allows you to keep control of your transactions and maintain your privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running a node is an important way to contribute to the health and security of a blockchain network. It’s also a great way to generate passive income.

<p>Authors: Sofía Celi, cryptography researcher at Brave; Alex Davidson, former cryptography researcher at Brave; and Gonçalo Pestana, former cryptography researcher at Brave.</p>
<p>One of the interesting problems in computer science with regard to security and privacy is how to retrieve items from a database, without revealing anything about the query to the untrusted server(s) where this database lives. Today, we’re going to be talking about some very recent scientific work we have done at Brave to make this a genuine possibility for a variety of applications.</p>
<p>The TL;DR is that we have built a new Private Information Retrieval (PIR) scheme called FrodoPIR, that we hope will make PIR easier and cheaper to deploy for a variety of use-cases and applications, such as Safe Browsing, checking passwords over breached databases, certificate revocation checks, streaming, and more. We have an <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/frodo-pir">open-source implementation</a> that you can use now, as well as <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981">a paper</a> that explains the scheme. The paper has been accepted into the first issue of <a href="https://petsymposium.org/cfp23.php">PoPETS 2023</a>!&nbsp; We’re calling the scheme FrodoPIR because the client can perform hidden queries to the server, just as Frodo remained hidden from Sauron.</p>

 Private Database Access Overview 
<p>Why is the issue of privacy important when retrieving items from a database? Let’s say, for example, that you want to use your favorite streaming platform to watch videos of dogs. But, actually, you’re a little bit embarrassed of revealing — to the platform — how many dog videos you watch (you shouldn’t be, but that’s the world we live in). Moreover, you would love to avoid anyone from being able to exploit that data so they can show you invasive targeted advertising campaigns, for example. What would be great is if you could receive this content, without the (untrusted) provider being able to tell what it is you are streaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Private_information_retrieval">Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes</a> are a set of cryptographic protocols that have been proposed as a solution to this exact problem. As with most cryptography, the first schemes arrived in the 1990’s, but it hasn’t been until the last six or seven years that candidate schemes have been designed that may approach having high enough performance to work in modern-day use-cases. However, the landscape remains quite complicated: many schemes are tailored to very specific use-cases to achieve low bandwidth or server runtimes, or they may require complex server-side deployments (e.g. using at least two non-colluding servers) to fulfill PIR queries.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we created FrodoPIR! This new PIR scheme we are announcing is intensely configurable, efficient across a wide swath of applications, easy to understand and implement, requires only a single untrusted server to deploy, and comes with concrete privacy and security guarantees against both classical and quantum adversaries (because we use lattices, as we will see).</p>

 PIR: The General Idea 
<p>Broadly speaking, the way that most single-server PIR schemes work is by using a cryptographic tool known as additively homomorphic encryption (AHE). Such encryption schemes allow someone with two ciphertexts that encrypt X and Y to compute a ciphertext that encrypts X+Y, without knowledge of the secret key. Such schemes have been around since RSA, but one commonly-used example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem">Paillier encryption</a> scheme.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 1: an AHE system</p>
<p>But how do we build a PIR protocol from such a thing? As seen in Figure 1, the answer is remarkably simple:</p>
 
 The server organizes its database into a set of M rows, each containing a single element. In other words, the database is now a vector. 
 Any client that wants to learn the ith element, encrypts M ciphertexts, where the ith ciphertext encrypts 1, and the rest of them encrypt 0. 
 The client sends their ciphertexts to the server; due to the nature of the encryption, the server cannot tell what is encrypted. 
 The server performs a scalar multiplication of each entry db_entry_1,…,db_entry_M of its database vector with the corresponding ciphertext in each, adds them all together into a single ciphertext and returns this back to the client. Note that scalar multiplications are possible by adding each ciphertext to itself according to the size of the scalar. 
 Now, after the client decrypts each ciphertext, it will simply learn db_entry_i, since: 0db_entry_1,…,1db_entry_i,…,0*db_entry_M = db_entry_i. 
 
<p>Essentially, over the past number of years, it has been shown that constructing PIR can be done quite efficiently using this simple method (and some optimizations). This is achieved by using&nbsp; AHE schemes based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">cryptographic lattices</a>, in particular based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">fully homomorphic encryption</a> (FHE) schemes, with security derived from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_learning_with_errors">ring learning with errors</a> (RLWE) assumption.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about these a bit more shortly. Some things to note before we do:</p>
 
 It’s possible to construct PIR with multiple servers with higher efficiency, but under the assumption that the servers do not collude. Such assumptions are known to be quite strong in real-world settings, and it is preferred to avoid them, if possible. 
 The server are assumed to be honest-but-curious, i.e. they execute the protocol honestly, but attempt to learn more from the client query alone. A malicious server can obviously choose to not run the PIR protocol properly, and clients will get bad answers. 
 The server database is assumed to be public. If the database should be treated as sensitive (i.e. clients should not be able to learn anything other than their query), then PIR is not really the correct tool to use (though, there are some symmetric PIR constructions that give insight into this). 
 

 Limitations to existing approaches 
<p>At Brave, we became interested in using PIR for having clients retrieve certain things from Brave, without the server knowing. Unfortunately, despite experimenting with various existing systems, we were never able to build something that didn’t involve huge costs, or large amounts of implementation complexity. This led us to start thinking about how we could try and build a PIR scheme that fit these requirements a little better and to create a new approach: FrodoPIR. Let’s see now what are the limitations of existing approaches.</p>
<p>A common issue even with fairly recent PIR schemes is that they are expensive in terms of either bandwidth, or in the amount of time taken to process each client query. In order to drive down the costs, FHE-based PIR schemes can move large proportions of the expensive online computation and communication (which is, for example, the sending of the query) to an offline phase (a “preparation” phase that can be later reused to make online queries). These kinds of schemes are called offline-online or stateful, as opposed to online-only or stateless.</p>
<p>However, a key difficulty that has gone unsolved is that either the computation or the communication costs induced during the offline phase scale linearly in the number of clients that will make queries, or the client has to download the entire server database (which defeats the purpose). This means that the offline phase has to be performed between each client and the server, which translates, in principle, to a lot of expensive computation that the server has to do. If you’re using commercial hardware to run your server, these costs are likely to run up huge financial costs.</p>

 Announcing FrodoPIR! 



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Just as the state of Sauron (its ring) moved to Frodo, we can move the mu and A to the client. The client then can then perform hidden queries to the server, just as Frodo remains hidden from Sauron.</p>
<p>We are excited to present FrodoPIR, a stateful PIR scheme that is built directly upon the learning with errors (LWE) problem. We get rid of the ring lattice structures (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frodo_Baggins">Frodo needs to do</a>: a reference first made in the naming of the <a href="https://frodokem.org/">FrodoKEM proposal</a>, and that we now borrow ourselves) to bring a flexible and practically efficient PIR scheme for a variety of use-cases. The core of the FrodoPIR scheme is an offline phase that requires no client-dependent computation, and incurs only a relatively small download compared to the database size (e.g. 170x smaller). This makes it suitable for many large, real-world deployments, where lowering financial costs for server-side operators is of paramount importance. FrodoPIR is also significantly simpler than previous schemes, making no use of FHE techniques and requiring only modular arithmetic. Read the whole paper describing it <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FrodoPIR is a scheme that relies on the <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/papers/qcrypto.pdf">decisional LWE problem</a>: each client query is a noisy vector that appears uniformly random to the server. As stated, it has both offline and online phases:</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 2: Diagram of the flow of FrodoPIR</p>
 
 In the offline phase, the server interprets the database as a matrix, applies a compression function to said matrix and makes the results available as global public parameters (mu and M). This compression function shrinks the size of the database. 
 In the offline phase, the client downloads the public parameters (mu and M), and computes ‘c’ sets of preprocessed query parameters. 
 In the online phase, the client uses a single set of preprocessed query parameters to produce an “encrypted” query vector, which is sent to the server. 
 The server responds to the query by multiplying the vector with its database matrix. 
 The client returns the result by “decrypting” the response using its preprocessed query parameters. 
 
<p>What this means is that in the offline phase, the server and client prepare anything that can be previously prepared for online queries; and, in the online phase, the client sends encrypted queries to the server. The latter returns a positive or negative value depending if the query is found in the database or not. The server never learns which value you are querying for, and yet it returns the correct answer (if it was included in the database or not).</p>
<p>FrodoPIR is a powerful primitive as it makes PIR schemes practical for real-world usage where not only communicational and computational costs are important but also financial ones. PIRs, in general, are powerful: they can be applied to <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a>, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">checking passwords over breached databases</a> (or any type of credentials), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01661">Certificate Transparency (CT) checks, certificate revocation checks</a>, or for streaming. Having a cheap and efficient scheme will help improve the privacy of the whole Internet not only for big actors, but also for anyone providing such service.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there are other PIR schemes beyond FrodoPIR, but the latter outperforms them all, as seen in Figure 3 below. The figure shows a comparison of per-client computational, communication, and financial costs for the server when running FrodoPIR, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3485381">Stateful OnionPIR (SOnionPIR)</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243821">PSIR</a>, assuming that each client makes c = 500 queries.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Figure 3: Comparison of FrodoPIR with other PIR schemes</p>
<p>So, what is next, and how can Brave users expect to see FrodoPIR implemented? At Brave, we care about deploying privacy-preserving schemes that make the Internet private and safe. One of our next efforts is to have a credential checker: any credential entered through the Brave browser (like, for example, passwords) can be checked against known breached databases. This can provide a safe mechanism to signal users to, for example, change their passwords. But such checking (the queries launched against the breached database) should be private. And, on this, FrodoPIR shines as a mechanism to provide privacy in a financially cheap and efficient fast way.</p>
<p>To read more about our FrodoPIR scheme, you can find details <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/981">here</a>. The paper has been accepted to the Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS), Vol. 2023, Issue 1, and will also appear <a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/2023/paperlist.php">here</a>.</p>
