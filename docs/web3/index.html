    <p>TestZEN or tZEN is a testnet version of ZEN to be used for testing various products and services on Horizen, such as deploying a testnet sidechain, launching a token or NFT on TokenMint testnet, etc. tZEN is free and has unlimited supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can visit the Horizen tZEN faucet ( <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io/">https://faucet.horizen.io/</a> ) to get tZEN sent to either Sphere wallet or Cobalt wallet. You will receive 42 tZEN each time and there is no limit to how many times you can claim tZEN. The tZEN faucet is currently on MVP stage. New release coming soon with improved user experience and interface.</p>
 Mainchain Faucet – Send tZEN to Sphere Wallet 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Sphere Address in order to receive TestZEN to Sphere Testnet Wallet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Sidechain Faucet – Send tZEN to Cobalt Wallet&nbsp; 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Cobalt Address to receive TestZEN direct to Cobalt!</p>
<p>You will also need the sidechain ID of the sidechain network that you will use the tZEN in. The sidechain ID can be found by clicking on Cobalt, clicking the hexagonal shape in the upper right corner and it will be displayed on the bottom. We are using TokenMint testnet as an example here:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you click on GET TZEN, you will see a “Transaction successfully created! Your funds will arrive shortly.” You can track the transaction on the sidechain block explorer and activity history in Cobalt.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You will receive a fixed amount of 42 tZEN each transaction. </p>

 PHASE 1&nbsp;Update  Game of&nbsp;Chains✨ <p>Dear Cosmonauts,<br>Phase 1 of Game of Chains is officially COMPLETE!</p><p>Read on for an update on how it&nbsp;went:</p><p>Game of Chains will be running for the rest of the month of November. In our first week of running the public incentivized testnet, we experienced some delays with launching consumer chains, however those bugs have been fixed! Validators, read on for more information on when to expect those governance proposals during Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p> HIGHLIGHTS 🎉 <p>We started Game of Chains on November 7th by launching two “dummy” consumer chains — Apollo and Sputnik. While we had over 150+ validators sign up, we currently have about 90 validators in the active set. You can check out the group of validators <a href="https://provider-explorer.goc.earthball.xyz/validators">here</a>.</p><p>We’ve also launched a public <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> that anyone can follow to see which validators are in contention for WINNING Game of Chains! This <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> is a running tally and we will try to update it on a regular basis as tasks are submitted and evidence is confirmed. You can check out how the judges will be evaluating validator participation <a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022">here</a>.</p> Bugs, bugs, bugs!&nbsp;🐜🐜🐜 <p>During the testnet a bug was discovered in Gaia (Cosmos Hub) with ICS v0.2.0. The result of the bug was that multiple consumer chains were unable to start. This bug was fixed, and validators were able to successfully upgrade the network to the version of ICS v0.2.1 on Friday November 11 (morning EST), following which validators successfully launched two consumer&nbsp;chains!</p><p>Additionally, relayer operators found that validator set updates were not being propagated. This was investigated by Hermes and Interchain Security teams (thank you to the Informal Systems team!) and a patch for Hermes is now available</p> Memes, memes, memes!&nbsp;😂 <p>We have testnet awards for the best memes generated by the community and we’ve already seen some great memes by Stakecito and Jabbey in Discord and on Twitter! Stakecito contemplates what <a href="https://twitter.com/stakecito/status/1590029735421444097">sabotage</a> might look like in Game of Chains and Chainapsis asks us to let that <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_ck89/status/1590634392141332481?s=46&amp;t=PmmoBj2Wb4A2zDs8RB5JnQ">sink&nbsp;in</a>!</p> Public Goods&nbsp;💗 <p>Thank you to all the validators that are supporting this testnet through block explorers, RPC end points and more. Some highlights of the public goods that we’ve seen so far&nbsp;include:</p>  Polkachu offering a variety of community <a href="https://polkachu.com/testnets/cosmos">tools and&nbsp;services</a>  PingPub added the ConsumerAdditionProposal to their dashboard and also offered RPC endpoints including <a href="https://provider-rpc.ztake.org/">this</a> one for the provider chain (Cosmos&nbsp;Hub)!  Thank you to Chainapsis for supporting Game of Chains through the <a href="https://testnet.keplr.app/chains/goc---provider">Keplr</a>&nbsp;wallet!   Auditing 🔐 <p>CrowdControl, Virtual Hive, and CryptoCrew have been investigating an issue where validator set updates seem to be inconsistent between provider and consumer chains. Plus, CryptoCrew published their script for auditing the validator set changes between consumer and provider sets (check it out&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/clemensgg/579983404afd4e906a4419fe4e81d100">here</a>).</p> Next Steps&nbsp;👇👇👇 <p>Over the next week, we will continue running Game of Chains, this time with consumer chains that are planning to launch in production once Interchain Security goes live! This includes the Generic Asset Issuance Chain (or GAH for short). This chain will host USDC when deployed, and hopefully other blue-chip assets in the future. We will also be running Duality, a novel DEX/AMM coming to Cosmos. You can read more about them&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dualityxyz/status/1590333430104932352">here</a>.</p><p>Following these proposals, validators will run Stride and Neutron — two additional consumer chains coming to&nbsp;Cosmos!</p><p>Last, but not least, thank you to the entire validators for your incredible support throughout Game of Chains. Interchain Security would not be what it is without the dedication of the Cosmos validator community. Cheers to you and stay tuned for updates on the next phase of Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager. <br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-1-update-game-of-chains-85a40bc27572">PHASE 1 Update — Game of Chains✨</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This is obvious on the individual level – how you order goods, the way you chat with friends, and the news you consume… all from a handheld computer. It’s also becoming more obvious at the company level. The pandemic shook the world into remote work and many companies have decided that maybe work can be done in ways they never imagined. But what about the state – whatever that means? Could the network rival the state?&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode we’ll explore what a nation state even is and how it may be challenged by a new Leviathan: the network. We also cover the difference between a nation and a state, how constants become variables, the cloud continent, digital power, your identity stack, calibrating risk, polycentric law, cloud regulations, building fast with atoms, founding vs inheriting, the powerful vs the powerless, and just about everything in between.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Balaji’s Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">https://twitter.com/balajis</a></p><p>Balaji’s website: <a href="https://balajis.com/">https://balajis.com/</a></p><p>The Network State: <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">https://thenetworkstate.com/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

Off-ramping crypto usually requires users to transfer on-chain assets from their wallet into a centralized exchange (or first complete swaps on a decentralized exchange), where they can sell their crypto for fiat cash, then finally transfer funds to their bank account. The process can be costly and time consuming, as users often have to pay fees for each transaction they make with their crypto on-chain. If they have to swap their tokens multiple times, the process can become even more costly by triggering multiple taxable events.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The feature image is taken from a 2017 report, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/impact-bonds-in-mexico-overview.pdf">Impact Bonds in Mexico: Opportunities and Challenges</a>, sponsored by <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/33171-Brookings_Institution">Brookings Institution</a>, incubator for the <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/390905-Center_for_Universal_Education">Center for Universal Education</a>, and <a href="https://www.ethos.org.mx/">Ethos</a>, a sustainability think tank based in Mexico City that advances policy innovation.</p>
<p>For awhile now I’ve been encouraging those who follow my work to try out the lens I’ve fashioned and use it to look with compassion around their own communities. Recently, I talked with a few people about writing letters that might illustrate how the research I’ve undertaken relates to developments in their hometowns. The understanding was that these letters could be shared with the wider community as a series of “Letters from Around the Labyrinth.” A secondary goal was to try and practice compassionate examination of these systems of domination without getting entangled with them and allowing these energetic forces to steer our consciousness. My hope is that in developing this skill we can aspire to think clearly, as John Trudell long exhorted, dispel some of the anxiety, and set intentions for healing along the way.</p>
<p>This first letter is from Maria in Mexico. Education is United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4. The children of Mexico and the rest of Latin America are being directly targeted for “human capital improvements” via ed-tech solutions that will groom them to build and defend cybernetic Metaverse “life.” The solutions offered will generate profits for social entrepreneurs while containing and directing the life prospects of millions within the sprawling chains of distributed ledger technology. All of this will of course be framed as economic liberation through skill badge crypto gaming. Poverty continues to be a huge issue in her country. Mexico has been a testbed for conditional cash transfer policies since the 1990s, a fact that deserves attention and wider discussion. If you haven’t read my research on that, you can do so <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/01/19/conditional-cash-transfers-and-cybernetic-futures/">here</a>. It’s important context as is the clip of Jeremey Corbyn speaking of early childhood education finance in Southern Mexico. What Maria and her fellow citizens are facing is structural economic dysfunction engineered from within and without through decades of strategically weaponized debt compounded by ongoing social unrest. In her letter and supporting documents we see how the United Nations is grooming middle school children to take on the Sisyphean task of remedying the harm wrought by inhuman global hedge funds. It’s not right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you Maria for your sharing your view from where you are on behalf of the children.</p>
<p>“Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. what was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spice they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it…all their ferocity was turned outwards against the enemies of the state against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children.” George Orwell, 1984</p>
 
<p>Dear Alison,</p>
<p>How are you? I’m attaching the information about the called “cuadernillo” or “textbook” for children of 6th grade of primary school, textbook created by the Mexican Government together with the UN and with the help, as they used to, of NGOs. In the document I include too my opinion, as I consider the language and the instructions are a manipulation, besides that the children of 10-12 years old (6th grade) are kids, not adults and do not have the age to sign letters, to commit, to have the judgement and criteria to decide many things that are mentioned in the cuadernillo.</p>
<p>The aim of the “cuadernillo”, is to teach the children about the Agenda 2030, each of the 17 SDGs, and each one include a practical exercise “forcing” the kids to make a commitment together with their families to “help” reaching the goals in their communities of each SDG. It goes beyond the families, as its mentioned in the attached document I translated into English as the “cuadernillo” document is only in Spanish. This with the help of the teachers of all schools, as in the document it says they were trained to teach properly the Agenda 2030 and SDGs. Other important thing to notice is that coincidentally they printed the textbook / cuadernillo in Mexico in 2020, exactly when the pandemic started. Thus, it was planned in 2019 like many other projects planned exactly before 2020, in 2019 to be ready for the pandemic. It was for the scholar year 2020-2021, and it says too that it was for free distribution, not for sale.</p>
<p>In my opinion, after you’ll see the attachment, it’s more than clear, in my opinion, that this is a complete indoctrination for the children, but more than only about the Agenda 2030. It’s about involving the family, spreading the word, involving and checking that their community is behaving according to the SDGs, with this textbook and exercises, the kids will have clear that if you don’t commit with the Agenda 2030 and if they see other people doing something different vs the SDGs, they have the right to be vigilant, to accuse, to take evidence and inform the authorities. THEY’RE CREATING “AGENTS”, THAT´S THE NAME THEY GIVE THE KIDS, AGENTS. They’re creating spies or kind of Communist / totalitarian monsters to spy their neighbour instead of really helping them by heart.</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind attention. Attached the document and there includes the sources of all the documents.</p>
<p>Greetings from Mexico.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>María</p>

  I spent a few days this week doing a close read of Julian Huxley’s 1946 “UNESCO Its Purpose and Philosophy.” It leans heavily on scientific eugenics, social efficiency, and charting individual characteristics as potential contributions to convergent consciousness, Teilhard De Chardin’s Noetic Christogenesis.

<p>I spent a few days this week doing a close read of Julian Huxley’s 1946 “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UNESCO_-its-purpose-and-its-philosophy-UNESCO-Digital-Library.pdf">UNESCO Its Purpose and Philosophy</a>.” It leans heavily on scientific eugenics, social efficiency, and charting individual characteristics as potential contributions to convergent consciousness, Teilhard De Chardin’s Noetic Christogenesis. I’m not sure about you, but I’m pretty skeptical of an “ascension” program that seemed to emerge from a Fabian / DARPA mash-up. I was trying to figure out how to talk about this without it being super dry. I read those sixty pages, so you don’t have to but the compiled highlights were still daunting.</p>
<p>Then, serendipitously, I received an email from Australia about the Capital Territory Health Directorate signing onto a deal with Epic Systems for a new patient record system. Epic, privately held since 1979 with a huge footprint in the digital health space, is headquartered in Verona, a suburb of Madison, Wisconsin. Upon seeing Madison, I had flashback to the days when I was researching widespread adoption of K12 educational technology and realized the timeline stretched back to Department of Defense distance learning in the mid 1990s. Advanced Distributed Learning, the project lead, has four outposts including a K12 education gaming office in Madison formerly led by social game mechanics specialists Constance Steinkuehler and her husband Kurt Squire. I ended up stopping at the Academic Advanced Distributed Learning Co-Lab on a trek I made out to South Dakota in the summer of 2020. In fact, it was one of my very first site visits; the first of many boring office park parking lots.</p>
<p>So, I decided to create a map that showcased how digital health records, prescribed wellness, and pay for success finance in “value-based” medicine would intersect with “sustainable” behavior management, eugenics, radio-isotopes, psychiatry, and gamified badging systems for AI-mediated gig work. Next to each section of the map I organized excerpts from the Huxley paper. I hope it illustrates the outrageous origins of current policies that are chipping away at our creativity and our humanity bit by soul-sucking bit.</p>
<p>Below is a link to the featured map for exploring. Click on any dot to open the source links. The three small dots on the left side (middle) of the page should open the slide-out panel if it’s not visible already. Have fun poking around. I also pulled out links to the Littlesis maps, old blog posts I referenced, and the video clips if you decide you want to revisit or share them.</p>

The most noticeable change will be that compounding will happen automatically and gas costs will be reduced due to a new, lighter data structure.</p><p>The contract upgrade and migration will happen early next week. There will be a platform release v1.1.0 immediately after (more details and release note on that soon). If you are running any of the Nym infrastructure (mix node, gateway, network requester, etc.) you will have to update your binaries so that they can keep working with the new contract.</p><p>NOTE: from this release, if you unbond your mixnode that means you are leaving the mixnet and you will lose all your delegations (permanently). You can join again with the same identity key, however, you will start with no delegations.</p><p>This blogpost gives a first overview of the reasons why a new contract is needed and the improvements you can expect from&nbsp;it.</p> Why a new contract? <p>There are three major reasons why the mixnet contract needs to be upgraded:</p>  The mixnet contract was storing too much contract state data. This meant that queries about rewards (from a wallet for example) required large amounts of gas, validators needed a custom configuration to support large queries, and eventually no one would be able to query for rewards because the whole thing would simply be too heavy. As a result, any query would always return 0 for rewards and rewards would not be visible until you unbonded (or undelegated). The new contract fixes&nbsp;this.  The mixnet directory data structure of the mixnet needed a clean up. The new directory structure will allow mix nodes to change their settings or even upgrade their nodes without the need to unbond. NOTE this also means that when mix nodes DO unbond, they leave the mixnet and therefore they will lose all their delegations. They can rejoin, but will have to attract new delegations.  Compounding was costing unnecessary gas fees. Whenever anyone compounded their rewards, this would cost gas. In the new version, compounding will happen automatically and without fees. Redeeming rewards will still incur&nbsp;fees.   What can I expect in the new contract? <p>The first thing to note is that there will be a new mainnet address for the contract, and the data structure will change. More details on this in the coming&nbsp;days.</p><p>For delegators:</p>  Compounding will be automatic — you no longer have to keep track of it or click on the compound button for compounding rewards.  <p>For mixnode operators:</p>  Mixnode operators will be able to set their operating costs.  Profit margin can be more granular.  Operators can update their configurations without unbonding. What this also means is that if you unbond your mixnode that means you are leaving the mixnet and you will lose all your delegations (permanently).  Change in saturation level to 730k per node, which means that more stake will be needed to reach full saturation.   Why is mixnode stake saturation changing? <p>The staking supply of NYM has increased due to quarterly vesting. Therefore there are more NYM tokens that can be staked, including all vested tokens and 10% of unvested tokens. Stake saturation depends on the available staking supply, the target level of staking, and the number of rewarded nodes. After the next vest the available staking supply will be around 350 million NYM. With 240 rewarded nodes and a target of 50% of available tokens staked this leads to a saturation stake of around 730k NYM (computed as 0.5*350m/240).</p><p>The contract update will also clean up legacy effects of a bug that was fixed a while back, which made some nodes appear to have more delegated stake than they actually had. As result of the update the displayed delegated stake will be correct for all nodes. As a result, some nodes may see slightly lower delegated amounts if they were previously displaying an incorrect delegation amount.</p><p>Stay tuned for further updates and the exact timing of the contract migration.</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Nym node setup help&nbsp;chat</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/contracts/mixnet/v2-changes.md">Change log</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-contract-upgrade-128c84f293fd">Nym mixnet contract upgrade</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today we began polling the Zcash Community Advisory Panel to obtain their advisory input regarding who should be appointed to the Zcash Foundation (ZF) board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September, <a href="https://zfnd.org/20220922-inviting-community-nominations-to-the-zf-board/">we invited the community to nominate candidates for a seat on the board</a>. Two candidates were nominated:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/prof-j-w-verret-jd-cpa-cff-for-the-zf-board/43038">Jay Verret</a>, and 



 <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/kurt-opsahl-for-zf-board/43187/2">Kurt Opsahl</a>. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Both possess a wealth of relevant experience and expertise, and we are very lucky to have such well-qualified candidates willing to serve on the ZF board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://youtu.be/6tVr5ym4IKE">Jay and Kurt took part in a Community Call</a> to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. I encourage you to watch the video to get to know the candidates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ZCAP poll will run until 09:00 UTC on November 21st. The results will be released shortly after the poll closes, and the ZF board will meet with the candidate who receives the most votes.&nbsp;</p>

 In September 2022, the first ZenCon, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event. If you follow Horizen news, you've heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem. After five years, […]

    <p>In September 2022, the first <a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon</a>, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/community-NA_V1700-Copie.jpg"></a><br>If you follow Horizen news, you’ve heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>After five years, it was time to celebrate Horizen’s accomplishments surrounded by those who were there to help lay the foundations of the project and all those who, along the way, came to bring their strength to take Horizen’s ecosystem even further.</p>
<p>At this level of expansion, it was essential to exchange thoughts. Horizen’s growth was made in the image of its decentralized blockchain. The team and community members are spread across all continents. To me, that’s what makes the project so strong. It’s a machine that never sleeps, designed with the help of a multitude of different cultures and interests. A successful scalability challenge!</p>
<p>Since its inception, the goal has evolved to reflect the community as it grows and changes.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: In essence, it provides privacy through zk-SNARKs, and for all, it’s bringing privacy to life. This is an important issue for everyone who goes online and is careful with their digital footprint.</p>
<p>Another facet of Horizen is decentralization. The project started its Secure Nodes and Super Nodes system in 2018, which has since been in the top 3 most extensive networks, surpassing Ethereum and Bitcoin combined: It is unbounded by design.</p>
<p>Since then, Horizen has become the zero-knowledge-enabled network of blockchains, thanks to its impressive team of cryptographers.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: A project that has brought together enough passion and talent to evolve continually.</p>
<p>This story was told at Zencon0, through panels, presentations, brainstorming sessions, and aperitivos. It was an absolute pleasure and hype machine to work together, or simply to gather with blockchain and technology experts and enthusiasts at the center of all discussions for three days in a row.</p>
<p>Among the guests, I would like to highlight four Zenvangelists who were present. Michael, Guan, Jonghung, Jongchan, and Psyrax are more than Zenvangelists; they are OGs. Without them, the Horizen community would be very different. It was truly fantastic to meet all of them.</p>
 Interviewing Horizen’s Zenvangelists 
 Michael 
<p>We’ll start with the one from Australia, Telegram, Korea, and/or Discord, our dear Michael. If you’ve interacted with the Horizen community, you’ve probably come across him. He is now a Zenvangelist that cannot be ignored!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG20220913215558-Copie.jpg"></a>Our dear Michael, who had the chance to pose with Rob Viglione
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience meeting the teams behind Horizen and Horizen Labs. Being able to see firsthand how the companies and teams operate from such a professional standpoint really gave me a lot of confidence in the future success of Horizen. I have walked away inspired and with a lot of ideas to build something great on Horizen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting everyone in real life! I felt like I knew so many people, even though we had only previously connected online. Being able to meet in person was really special.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will definitely be there!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1798-Copie.jpg"></a>Our marketing team and community brainstorming about the Horizen community
 Guan 
<p>Without Guan, the Horizen community in China would not be the same. It feels like Guan was there when Horizen was founded. So much so that he has become essential. It was great to meet him finally to talk about Horizen, and his cats face to face.</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the zencon0 is good because everyone in Horizen’s ecosystem can meet each other in person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite part was I visited the Horizen Labs’ workplace. I witnessed the huge team expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s an amazing event, and I will be there next year!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V2550.jpg"></a>The Horizen Labs office is superb! We enjoyed the rooftop and took this amazing picture.
 Psyrax 
<p>Psyrax also joined us. If you have needed support from Horizen, I am sure Psyrax assisted you. He is our node, mining – well – global Horizen expert. Psyrax also protects our Discord and Telegram communities by protecting them from scammers and bots!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed Zencon0. It was a really amazing experience to hear about what has been going on behind the scenes and listening to a great cross-section of society that can use the ecosystem. I really liked Sebastien Micke’s perspective and use case for NFTs and photographers retaining their digital rights to their productions.</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t say that I had a favorite moment, as the whole experience was great, but if I had to choose, I would say that networking across the conference with the new people that I met and being able to put faces to names I have only known through the computer.</p>
<p>Q: If we do Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>I will definitely be keen to attend next year. If the team announced dates and locations, I would book our flights in a heartbeat.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V0480.jpg"></a>Jonghun (Zenvangelist, left) and Jongchan Hong at Zencon0
 Jonghun 
<p>Last but not least is Jonghun, our Korean OG. He was a long-time community member and has done a fantastic job promoting Horizen in his country. Thanks to him, our Korean community is bustling and passionate about the project!</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was such an honor for me to be able to attend this gathering of people interested in Horizen from all over the world. Also, I was excited to be able to announce the start of Horizen Korea in Korea for the first time at Zencon0. It was very beneficial because it was a place where people from various fields could share their thoughts on blockchain and Horizen. It was an opportunity for me to broaden my insight personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked all the moments when I could see everyone in one space regardless of time zone. We communicated, but there were some delay issues due to the time zone, but the moment we communicated with everyone in one place was memorable. The discussion about Horizen Community is also very memorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
 Community Spotlights at ZenCon 
<p>The community was in the spotlight throughout the conference, with three slots dedicated to the community. We even had the honor of sharing a panel with Lou Kerner to talk about the Horizen community’s presence in Asia, thanks largely to Guan and Jonghun, whom we introduced earlier.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1618.jpg"></a>Lou Kerner, Lucy Wang, Guan Yin, and Jonghun and Jongchan Hong talking during the panel.
<p>Even our Marketing team OGs went on stage. Thank you, Lucy and Erica, for shining a light on this beautiful Horizen community.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1480.jpg"></a>As you see, we were delighted to share the news!
<p>To conclude, I would say that the Horizen community is terrific. Everything started in 2017 as a cryptocurrency. Five years later, Horizen is an entire blockchain ecosystem, soon to have an EVM-compatible sidechain. Meanwhile, these steps would have been for nothing if we hadn’t done them with the community. Together, we are building the future of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when someone would have looked perplexed if you’d asked about their digital identity. Many still would today, perhaps but in the tumultuous world of today, digital identity is one of the hottest trends in technology, particularly across decentralised ledgers, or blockchains.</p>



 The 7 benefits of using digital identities 



<p>In short, below are 7 benefits of using digital identities: <br><br>• Mobile-first solution<br>• Establishment of a framework of trust<br>• Smart city access<br>• Digital economy<br>• Financial and social inclusivity<br>• Enhanced portability<br>• Better understanding of the individual</p>



<p>Each of these benefits will be explained more in-depth below. But before we delve into the actual benefits of implementing and using digital identity frameworks in both the public and private domains, let’s first take a look at the definition of a digital identity.</p>



 What is a digital identity? 



<p>In essence, a digital identity is the accumulation of information on an entity held online&nbsp;by third parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you are interacting with a website or application you are always leaving information behind. Broadly speaking, all the data and information involved in someone’s digital identity can be divided into two categories: Digital attributes and digital activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital attributes include someone’s date of birth, official documentation (passports, driver license, etc.) serial numbers or other identifiers, a person’s medical records, banking details, etc. The second category -digital activities-, includes a person’s posts on social media, for example, purchase history, ‘Likes’ and comments, etc. The combination of these two categories constitutes someone’s digital identity.</p>



 The 7 benefits of using digital identities explained 



 Mobile-first solution 



<p>A primitive (but working) handheld mobile phone was unveiled by the now defunct American company Motorola back in 1973. It was a rather bulky and ungainly device that would take around 10 hours to fully charge. Nevertheless, the Motorola device heralded an inevitable shift towards mobile technology that continues today. (Current projections say that, by 2024, there will be around 17.7 billion mobile devices operating in the world.)</p>



<p>Society is going mobile, and as such, today’s society seeks more and more mobile-first solutions.</p>



<p>Digital identity enables this approach by using a digital wallet that enables users to take their credentials anywhere they go, and share them at any time, with whomever they want, and get authenticated by any entity, private or public, to easily access services.</p>



 Establishment of a framework of trust 



<p>Currently, identity networks and authentication methods are heavily fragmented. Every organisation, every agency, every institution has its own set of rules and guidelines that determine how people receive their credentials, and how they authenticate in their network. Because of this individualised disparity, a set of credentials accepted by one organisation might not necessarily be accepted by another. This issue is exacerbated when dealing with organisations from different countries. (Driving licenses and educational credentials perfectly illustrate this problem).</p>



<p>Establishing a trust framework between all participating organisations means that someone’s credentials can be instantly verified, regardless of geographical location or cross-border limitations.</p>



 Smart city access 



<p>Current urban enclaves, while modern and relatively safe, are far from smart. There still are many deficiencies and areas of improvement in terms of traffic and waste management, infrastructure, wireless access, etc. The Internet of Things (IoT) will enable several technological advancements that will improve these aspects, but it is a very different story for the individual.</p>



<p>As of today, 54% of the world’s population lives in cities, and the current projection is that this figure will reach 66% in about three decades. Because of this likely rise in urban dwellings, enhanced services and a positive and rewarding citizen experience are key factors for the success of smart cities. Citizens currently engage with urban’s infrastructures in different ways. Paying for parking or at the shop’s till with a smartphone, for example. Or using electronic tickets to speed up access to trains, buses, or other methods of transportation. But each of these services requires its own identification method. Together with an entire network and technical backend to manage access, permissions, and upkeep.</p>



<p>A truly smart city begins with digital identity to drive engagement and efficiency. Individuals need to engage with government, public and private bodies, and other agencies digitally and expeditiously, so the experience is seamless and positive. This will lead to further engagement.</p>



 Digital economy 



<p>Digital identity truly is at the heart of a paradigm shift in digital engagement. Too much friction in the interaction with governments and service providers holds people back from engaging further, which in turn leads to economic stagnation. In the world of today, people expect fast and immediate digital service, whether it’s from their internet provider or the WiFi service at the airport.</p>



<p>The digital economy is the background for the digital identity scene. Digital identification drives inclusive growth, particularly when considering that around 1.7 billion people worldwide are financially excluded. This is because of lack of provable identity. If all those people were to own digital identities, a great economic value would be unlocked.</p>



 Financial and social inclusivity 



<p>Banks and other financial institutions would not risk lending to those people who could not effectively prove who they are. If credit or finance is denied, the individual might not be able to access proper education, or housing, or services. Progressively, someone would be left further and further behind. They would be excluded.</p>



<p>The provision of identity is the gateway for both financial and social inclusivity. Digital identity enables frictionless interactions with public and private institutions, including banks, of course. By enabling someone to have equal chances to access financial devices, people become included in society or education.</p>



 Enhanced portability 



<p>Traditional means of identification (driver licenses, passports, ID cards, etc.) are portable in the sense that people can carry them around. But some of these forms of ID might not be officially recognised in different countries, or even in different states within the same country. Academic credentials have the same issue. And in both cases, the individual depends on third parties to amend, share, or verify some of these documents.</p>



<p>The concept of portability in the context of digital identity applies differently. A digital ID is portable because it can be migrated and used elsewhere without friction, and in a way that is completely up to the individual to make the choices and decisions regarding his personal data.</p>



 Better understanding of the individual 



<p>People are complex entities with changing needs, attitudes, desires, and interests. In today’s always-connected world, commercial enterprises spend a lot of money researching the market to better streamline their product lines and target the right customer segments and demographics.</p>



<p>A digital identity that maps more accurately to an individual’s real-life identity will enable companies to achieve more personalised promotion and more seamless omni-channel marketing.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>When you think about it, identity is in everything we do. From greeting friends or family, to getting a loan from the bank, or purchasing insurance. We take all this for granted. Yet for many millions of people, things aren’t as easy or straightforward when it comes to accessing finance or services. The lack of identity hampers thriving.</p>

<p>Blockchain-based applications are poised to change the way people all over the world interact with money and value. But before we see adoption by millions of users, blockchain infrastructure will need to evolve beyond current capabilities to process far more transactions per second at low cost, without sacrificing security gained through sufficient decentralization. The delicate balance between these competing priorities has become known as the blockchain trilemma. Different approaches to balancing these goals and delivering a blockchain experience ready for global adoption were discussed by an all-star panel in the Scaling for 1B Users and Solving the Blockchain Trilemma main stage session at Converge22.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2022 and&nbsp;beyond…</p><p>The Nym mainnet launch rolled out in Q4 last year, and 2022 has been a year of much progress: Nym now has an active community of mixnodes, gateways and validators operating a global privacy system. We have four more milestones to hit in 2022 before moving into next year where the aim is major partnerships and end-user adoption. Here is what is&nbsp;next…</p><p>Rounding off&nbsp;2022</p>  Launch zk-nyms for bandwidth credentials  <p>We are launching zk-nym, an anonymous credentials system, based on the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nyms-coconut-credentials-an-overview-4aa4e922cd51">Coconut protocol</a>, that ensures unlinkability and allows for decentralised issuance of credentials. The first practical use case of zk-nym is bandwidth credentials, enabling privacy preserving paid usage of the Nym mixnet. Decentralised issuance of zk-nyms will be available for other use cases for anyone building on the Nyx CosmWasm blockchain!</p><p>2. Launch NYX for blockchain governance and validator rewards</p><p>The Nyx blockchain on the <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos ecosystem</a> has been operating for months, powering the Nym privacy system. Launching the NYX token will ensure that validators who have been running the chain will finally get rewarded and will boost CosmWasm smart contract development on Nyx for all application developers.</p><p>3. Begin Web3 wallet integrations and privacy partnerships</p><p>We are in discussions with a number of major web3 wallets on Nym mixnet integrations. We expect to see the practical work on wallet integrations begin before the end of the year, safeguarding network layer privacy for a variety of crypto transactions.</p><p>4. Graduate our first cohort from Shipyard&nbsp;Academy!</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nym community is growing, maturing. More than 4000 applicants made it through to Shipyard Academy and are currently learning all about the Nym infrastructure, token economics and privacy. By the end of 2022, the Academy will graduate its first cohort who will be ready to educate and promote a future where privacy by design is the&nbsp;norm.</p><p>2023 — Nym mixnet for the&nbsp;people</p><p>Looking ahead, 2023 will be focused on end-users as we prepare for mainstream adoption. Given the increasing concerns surrounding privacy rights, there is growing awareness among ordinary people on the importance of privacy preserving technologies to protect their digital lives and well-being.</p><p>Our priorities will be to ensure that their needs are met and accessibility to our mixnet is as frictionless as possible&nbsp;through:</p>  Enabling users to determine their mixnet latency preferences and security&nbsp;needs  Determining optimised mixnet parameters per application type  Launching decentralised Nym VPN service with&nbsp;partners  Building censorship-resistant gateways  Enabling paid mixnet service using&nbsp;ZK-Nyms  Securing partnerships with major blockchains, driving mixnet&nbsp;usage  <p>Partnerships with major blockchains and applications are key to Nym’s strategy. Mass adoption at the scale of millions will succeed through the integration of the mixnet into apps and services that people are already using — within and beyond&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>2024 — privacy at institutional and enterprise scale</p><p>At the heart of our work, we firmly believe that privacy as default is fundamental to how our privacy rights can be respected. It should therefore be integrated into core societal institutions as they become increasingly digitised. This can only be achieved through institutional adoption and enterprise use-cases which will be our focus in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Enterprise and institutional use cases will be critical for privacy to be integrated at the infrastructure level, with key partners integration across fintech, medical and personal data sectors. These sectors have high exposure to privacy breaches that severely impact ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>In addition, a push for integration into browsers and operating systems with popular programs in our daily lives like Signal, Google and Brave is on the cards as a natural extension to the success in demand of Nym Connect&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Other important pillars of institutional adoption&nbsp;include:</p>  Standardise at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force&nbsp;(IETF)</a>  Secure hardware optimisation and network stack integration  <p>A future with privacy as&nbsp;default</p><p>The end game is to scale the Nym mixnet to millions of users as we enter an era where privacy tools are normal. As digitisation spreads, so too does the attack surface, undermining the privacy and security of people and organisations. There is a real and immediate need for privacy to be ensured by design. This is essential for a future where our basic infrastructures respect and secure the fundamental right to privacy — and Nym is here to make it a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Join our community to participate and keep up to&nbsp;date:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p><p>Essential links</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/token">Tokenomics FAQ</a></p><p><a href="https://coinlist.co/nym">Nym on&nbsp;CoinList</a></p><p>The Nym architecture</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech">Nym Github</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym Docs</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-67a8da65b8b2">Nym roadmap update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Paradoxically, while most blockchains consist of publicly available, open lists of records, it is extremely complicated to extract useful data from a blockchain.

<p>Paradoxically, while most blockchains consist of publicly available, open lists of records, it is extremely complicated to extract useful data from a blockchain. The blockchains most protocols are built on are optimized to be secure and tamper-proof but are sub-optimal (to say the least) for extracting intelligible information as the data is both difficult to access and difficult to&nbsp;decode.</p><p>Yet, as is true with traditional, database-backed applications, access and analysis of on-chain data is an essential part of any substantial application. Today developers are forced to build and operate complex infrastructure (running blockchain nodes, setting up a storage and querying system, ETL, etc.) and to develop a deep understanding of the inner workings of smart contracts in order to extract, process, analyze, and display historical on-chain&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://agnostic.engineering/">Agnostic </a>is tackling the issue of blockchain data accessibility by providing a platform to help developers access decoded data in real time. The team at Agnostic have developed an automated pipeline to index smart contract calls and events with no manual action needed to add new contracts and, hence, avoid re-indexing the whole chain. Written for developers, the team at Agnostic are building for the real use cases web3 builders are currently facing.</p><p>What’s even better than that? All of this happens in a PostgreSQL- and GraphQL-compatible engine so your existing developers can immediately be productive and your existing SQL-enabled tools will work out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Web3 is riddled with complexities for users, including incoming developers who want to build new applications. Having programmatic access to decoded data through familiar, industry-standard mechanisms will allow a new swath of developers to easily build apps, and as the number of developers continues to grow exponentially, the Web3 infrastructure and dev tooling market will naturally grow in both breadth and adoption. Rather than making every new Web3 developer essentially start from scratch, Agnostic brings a simple SaaS experience with an interface familiar to essentially every Web developer on the&nbsp;planet.</p>

<p>Many people consider space to be the next frontier and equally an infinite horizon to explore. But the reality is that not all “space” is the same and there are strategic zones that don’t only matter up there – but down here on Earth. Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) is one of those regions – a zone filled with satellites that support life on Earth, from agriculture to climate to navigation to defense. Unfortunately, these live satellites are not alone in our space highways. LEO is getting increasingly clogged with space debris; we’re polluting our skies just like we’re polluting our land.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with all three cofounders of Privateer – Steve Wozniak, Alex Fielding, and Dr. Moriba Jah, as they explore just how much junk is up there, how this challenge is expected to progress with time due to lower launch costs, and ultimately, what infrastructure is missing in this fragile ecosystem – from tracking to global treaties to a sharing economy of satellites.</p><p>By the end of the episode, listeners should be more equipped to understand how our infrastructure in space vastly impacts life on Earth, how the preservation of this ecosystem is crucial, and how Privateer is providing the map to better understand and fix the issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Privateer’s website: <a href="https://mission.privateer.com/">https://mission.privateer.com/</a></p><p>Privateer’s Wayfinder tool: <a href="https://mission.privateer.com/">https://mission.privateer.com/</a></p><p>Privateer on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivateerSpace">https://twitter.com/PrivateerSpace</a></p><p>Steve Wozniak on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz">https://twitter.com/stevewoz</a></p><p>Alex Fielding on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Alex__Fielding">https://twitter.com/Alex__Fielding</a></p><p>Dr. Moriba Jah on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/moribajah">https://twitter.com/moribajah</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

<p>TL;DR: Basic Attention Token announces its first Solana NFT collection, BAT x Adam Ape for Brave, expanding BAT utility in NFT marketplaces. Fans can discover the limited collection through Magic Eden’s NFT Launchpad, which brings them to a custom experience landing page powered by Cardinal, where they can connect via their Brave Wallets and buy the NFTs with SPL BAT or SOL.</p>
<p>Today, Basic Attention Token is announcing its inaugural Solana NFT collection, BAT x Adam Ape for Brave, <a>increasing support for BAT / NFT utility</a> within NFT marketplaces. The launch follows Brave’s <a>May 2022 integration</a> with the Solana blockchain to expand Web3 access. That same day, Brave unveiled its partnership with <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, Solana’s largest NFT-based Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BAT and Magic Eden have also joined forces with <a href="https://www.cardinal.so/">Cardinal Labs</a> to make BAT x Adam Ape one of the first collections on Solana to launch with the new <a href="https://cardinal-labs.notion.site/Cardinal-Creator-Standard-3963436c5f634ff99da2b0e32800fe54">Cardinal Creator Standard</a>, which enforces royalties at the protocol level on all secondary trading. The decision aligns with Brave’s long-standing mission of supporting digital creators and Magic Eden’s commitment to exploring new creator-supporting models, particularly as more marketplaces shift towards making creator royalties optional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fans will discover and access the BAT x Adam Ape collection through <a href="https://magiceden.io/launchpad/bat">Magic Eden’s NFT Launchpad</a>, which redirects them to a custom experience <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">landing page, powered by Cardinal Labs</a>. There, fans can connect via their Brave Wallet (or another Solana DApp wallet) and purchase the NFTs with <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana v2 Wormhole BAT (SPL BAT or “wBAT”)</a> or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana (SOL)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 BAT x ADAM APE FOR BRAVE&nbsp; 
<p>Basic Attention Token partnered with <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ape_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Adam Ape</a>, a renowned multidisciplinary artist in Web3 and the traditional graphic design and digital animation space, to launch its 2500-piece genesis collection: BAT x Adam Ape for Brave. Together, they created four PFP-style NFTs, modeled after Brave’s logo. Each of the four NFTs—respectively named The Curious, The Dabbler, The Degen, and The Sage—is dynamically animated with facial expressions and sound effects and represents one of four stages of immersion in Web3. Read more about the inspiration behind the NFT designs <a href="https://magiceden.io/launchpad/bat">here</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>The first three NFTs in the ordered set, Curious, Dabbler, and Degen, will mint randomly, meaning holders won’t know which piece they’ll receive until after they mint. Holders who collect all three may later have the option to burn the set to obtain the legendary-tier Sage, of which there will only ever be 300 in existence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently, there are no guarantees of additional utility for BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT holders. However, we’re looking forward to engaging with Adam Ape and the BAT Community to explore different utility possibilities for holders of each tier, including Sage holders, over time.&nbsp;</p>

 LAUNCH FAQ 

 Is there a Discord I can join for this project? 
<p>Yes, please join our <a href="http://discord.gg/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> community to stay up to date with the latest information on the launch.</p>

 What currencies can I use to buy the NFTs? 
<p>The NFTs will be available to purchase with <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana v2 Wormhole BAT (SPL BAT or “wBAT”)</a> or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana (SOL)</a>, and cost 3 SOL each or the BAT equivalent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 How do I get SPL BAT or “wBAT”? 
<p>There are several options for buying or bridging SPL BAT on Solana:&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can buy wBAT directly in the Brave Wallet with Ramp’s fiat-to-crypto onramp or swap an existing SOL balance for wBAT.&nbsp; 
 
<p>


    





    
    




    





    
    
</p>
 
 Use the Wormhole Bridge to bridge $BAT from Ethereum to Solana.&nbsp; 
 

 I already own BAT. How do I convert my BAT into SPL BAT? 
<p>You can bridge your BAT from Ethereum to Solana through Wormhole’s <a href="https://www.portalbridge.com/">Portal Bridge</a>.</p>

 Where can I buy SOL? 
<p>You can buy Solana (SOL) with fiat or crypto directly within the Brave Wallet via Ramp, or from any cryptocurrency exchange that lists Solana.&nbsp;</p>

 What Web3 wallet can I use to mint the NFTs? 
<p>You can use your Brave Wallet or another Solana DApp wallet, such as Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, etc.&nbsp;</p>

 Can I mint NFTs with the Brave Wallet in my Brave mobile app? 
<p>Brave on mobile does not yet offer support for Solana DApps. We recommend using the Brave Wallet in a desktop version of Brave to mint your NFTs.&nbsp;</p>

 I am registered for Bravelist. Does that mean I get priority minting? 
<p>Yes. If you’re on the Bravelist and have registered your Solana wallet address and Discord ID, then you get priority minting. The <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">Cardinal-powered minting DApp</a> will detect your Bravelisted wallet upon connection and permit you to mint within the first two hours of the sale.</p>

 How many mints does Bravelist get me? 
<p>Bravelist permits you to mint 1 NFT per registered wallet. You will need to return during the public mint to mint additional NFTs.</p>

 I am not registered for Bravelist but I want to take part in the sale. How do I participate? 
<p>Once priority minting ends after two hours, minting will open up to the general public. At that time, anyone using a Web3 DApp wallet could connect and purchase NFTs with SOL.&nbsp;</p>

 How do I view my NFTs in the Brave Wallet? 
<p>NFT gallery view in Brave Wallet is still in development. We recommend viewing your NFTs in the NFT marketplace UI (e.g., <a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a>) if purchased on the Brave Wallet.</p>

 I want to sell, trade, or transfer my NFTs. Where can I do this? 
<p>You can sell, transfer, or trade your NFT from within <a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a>’s marketplace user dashboard with your Brave Wallet or Solana DApp wallet connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also access Coral Cube directly from the <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">minting page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 I own a Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT. When can I burn them to get a Sage? 
<p>After the conclusion of the mint, we will publish a follow-up announcement detailing how to burn your Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT set to obtain a legendary-tier Sage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, there will only ever be 300 Sages in existence, so not everyone can get one. Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/batbrigade">Discord</a> and follow us to <a href="https://twitter.com/AttentionToken">Twitter</a> to get project updates first.</p>

 When will you reveal utility for each of the tiers? 
<p>There are no guarantees of additional utility for BAT x Adam Ape NFT holders at the time of the mint. However, we’re looking forward to engaging with Adam Ape and the BAT Community to explore different utility possibilities for holders of NFTs from each of the four tiers.</p>

 How does Cardinal’s royalty-enforcement mechanism work? 
<p>Cardinal’s Creator Standard solution involves (1) a token-manager protocol and (2) a corresponding marketplace integration UI.</p>
<p>Coral Cube (secondary NFT marketplace) has integrated Cardinal’s marketplace manager UI and supports trading for tokens that use the token-manager protocol, including BAT x Adam Ape NFTs.</p>
<p><a href="https://cardinal-labs.notion.site/Cardinal-Creator-Standard-3963436c5f634ff99da2b0e32800fe54#30ae25de15a2418193525817d1b41072">Here</a>, you can read more about Cardinal’s Creator Standard, including the technical implementation details.</p>

 Ready. Set. Secure! Game of Chains kicks&nbsp;off!  Cosmos Validators, Let’s&nbsp;Go! Are you&nbsp;ready?<p>Starting November 7 2022, over the next 2–4 weeks, 150+ validators will participate in Game of Chains — the latest public incentivized testnet in the history of the Cosmos&nbsp;Hub!</p><p>Game of Chains will help validators develop confidence around running Interchain Security — a highly anticipated feature coming to the Cosmos Hub in January 2023. Interchain Security will allow blockchains to leverage the high security of the Cosmos Hub (currently at a market capitalization of ~USD $4B). Because the security of a proof of stake network is closely tied to the value of the blockchain itself, a relatively strong market cap ensures reliable security for blockchains looking to maximize their security!</p><p>In the short term, and before permissionless deployment is available, consumer chains (those “consuming” security from the Cosmos Hub) will be required to go through governance to get their chain admitted by the validator set. This “governance gated” process will make it such that validators have ample time to vote, accept and ultimately run the node of the consumer&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Game of Chains will give validators a flavor of what to expect once the feature is live! Through the various GoC phases, validators are expected to build an understanding of ICS and help us discover interesting attack&nbsp;vectors.</p><p>The testnet infrastructure will&nbsp;include:</p>  Provider chain  Multiple consumer&nbsp;chains  IBC relayers  Support services  <p>Over the 3 phases of Game of Chains, validators will complete a series of predetermined tasks that prove their proficiency at running the ICS protocol. In each phase, points will be awarded to participants who complete certain tasks. Validators at the end of the testnet who have completed the most amount of tasks will be eligible for awards. Please see a detailed breakdown of the phases and tasks&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022">here</a>!</p><p>Last, but not least, please remember&nbsp;that:</p>  Only Cosmos Hub validators in the active set are eligible to earn rewards in the Game of Chains testnet&nbsp;program.  Validators operated by employees of Informal Systems, Hypha, and Interchain Foundation are eligible to participate, but ineligible for&nbsp;rewards.   Good luck validators! 🎉⚛️🎉  Ready. Set.

<p>Yesterday a new friend and I wandered around Philadelphia from Northern Liberties to Queen Village and then from Independence Mall to City Hall. We examined religion and social reform, considered valuation of mixed currencies during the 1840s, the meaning of the signatures behind the Declaration of Independence, and what it all means for an era where “life” may become an augmented subscription service. As Cesium ushers in an Open Metaverse pixelated empire, Wharton alumni set up speculative ventures in human capital futures. All of this is happening in my back yard. I suspect much of this is happening in your backyards, too. I invite you to look around your labyrinth and consider sharing a video here or writing a guest post. Once we can see where the walls are, we can begin to find our way out.</p>

<p>I excitedly read the lively responses to my previous post soliciting input around clips pulled from the Philoctetes Center’s 2007 panel discussion on the field of neuroeconomics. Thank you everyone and please keep them coming. The comments definitely opened up new, related avenues of inquiry; so if you haven’t popped over to have a look, please do <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/11/02/a-penny-for-your-thoughts-on-neuroeconomics-part-1/">here</a>. Cliff Gomes and I continue to explore the D-Cent map, which features moral economies, artificial intelligence, programmable community tokens, the commons, and yes – neuroeconomics. If you want to explore this “labyrinth” <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/9af366b0c2d7cc37ef1909f0819cd0f9#untitled-map?s=%23neuroecnomics-panel-2007">here’s the link</a>. It continues to evolve as I fold in new stories based on material I find. I really appreciate all you commenters who have pointed me in interesting directions.</p>
<p>Cliff and I posted an initial discussion on part of the map a few days ago. We began by revisiting our first “labyrinth talk” that centered the “outside-in” robot where AI learns us and nudges us towards “good behavior.” You can watch that installment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUaKst8AWpc">here</a>. Our second conversation focused on how the stories we listen to, get entangled with, and choose to inhabit affect our lives in significant ways. Once we have this awareness it becomes easier to notice how outside influences, including sophisticated mathematical models, are being used to try and shape our inner dialogue. We consider how the “outside-in” robot might work with digital education systems to condition young children to accept a manufactured “reality” suited to anti-life machines. What role will mental health professionals play in prescribing the “evidence-based” social adjustments that will be required to get people to acquiesce?</p>
<p></p>
<p>These are the remaining clips that I had pulled from the panel discussion. You can listen to the full talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_B0rvSxUqY&amp;t=0s">here</a> or my 45-minute highlight compilation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPGIp9gHvs">here</a>. Remember that Bernie Madoff was in the audience. This was pre-Ponzi scheme implosion. Again, I invite you to listen to a couple of these short (2-4 minute) excerpts. I picked comments that should elicit reflection / reaction.</p>
<p>Consider how vastly expanded data flows and supercomputing will be used to create extremely granular prediction models – adding rationality – for all sorts of purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What might a use case be for a “generalized neural theory of human behavior”?</p>
<p></p>
<p>What might a fitness landscape for post-humanism look like? Will there be agency if we land in a future where AI plays Moriarty to our Sherlock Holmes? What would it feel like to inhabit a world where all the important decisions we make are essentially reduced to a series of coin tosses? This clip is longer – 7 minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you imagine with DNA sequencing and managed group behavior what “cultural transmission” or contagion might look like in the future? Will DNA analysis be relevant for avatar life? Could it be used to “tune” the heterodyned transmissions we receive through our material bodies?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider the implications of the fact that the pioneering researcher in neuroeconomics holds E.O. Wilson, sociobiologist, as his hero.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Back in 2007 people were already positing the utility of behavioral data to inform financial markets. That’s Madoff in the black shirt on the left side of the image.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Others were pointing out that data could be used for totalitarian control.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our next talk Cliff and I hope to explore utility function, fitness landscapes, convergence, slime mold, space colonization, derivatives trading while continuing to consider how stories told to children influence how they navigate the world. That’s probably why we shouldn’t let the Reasoning Mind Genie be their learning companions, eh?</p>

 Tech and Product  Advanced Staking <p>Week after week, we’ve published updates on the state of Advanced Staking development and testing. Currently, we’re defining the remaining operational steps for its release, a topic we’ll touch on in <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1587534810460950530">our upcoming AMA.</a><br></p><p>Besides this, deployment scripts and readme are being reviewed. Minor reviews of the UI are also underway. We’ll soon publish a detailed guide about this milestone for our protocol!<br></p> Panther’s v1 release <p>This month, the development contributors have outlined and estimated resources for the remaining tasks involved in this release. This will help us better project and prepare for this milestone. A crucial ongoing step is finalizing all the zero-knowledge circuits needed, based on the possible user flows.<br></p><p>Work has also started on a project preliminarily called zTrade. This functionality will enable v1 users to swap assets within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools.<br></p><p>Our DeFi integration project is moving forwards as well. We have completed our DeFi Adaptor product definition, with its implementation to begin this month. A new Blockchain Architect will also join in early November to lead the cross-chain project.</p> Community  Panther Discussion Forum <p>On October 4th, we released Panther’s Official Discussion Forum, a space for all of our community to engage in the discussions that will decide Panther’s future.<br></p><p><a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/">Access it now</a> and play your part in steering our trajectory!<br></p>Progressive decentralization at work!<p>To facilitate community-led decision-making for the Panther ecosystem, independent moderators manage the Discussion Forum. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_YAuq0Xdt-MOpZWe1gOR-GdlCwtixhK6VBoZnQe6USF37nQ/viewform">Please fill out the application form</a> if you are up for the task.</p> Leading Privacy Alliance <p>The <a href="https://www.leadingprivacy.com/">Leading Privacy Alliance (LPA)</a> is an initiative that brings together Web3 firms and organizations with the common objective of increasing privacy in crypto and beyond. <br><br>"Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about the current state of privacy, implement solutions to these problems, and educate users and projects about the fundamental role of privacy in the technology we build and use.”<br></p><p>The initiative was <a href="https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/10/leading-privacy-alliance-launched-prior-devcon-in-bogota">launched</a> on October 9th, just before Devcon Bogota, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-the-leading-privacy-alliance/">where Panther became one of its very first members</a>. Adam Spiers, our Senior Architect, spoke on the stage during the inaugural event, outlining why Panther decided to join this movement.<br></p>“As a project that aims to enable trust and privacy in the DeFi space, it is a natural fit for Panther to join the LPA. We strongly believe that the sector's stakeholders need to form a coalition to defend the right to privacy.” Events  Devcon Bogotá <p>This October 11th-14th, contributors of Panther attended <a href="https://devcon.org/">DEVCON Bogotá</a>, in Colombia! DEVCON always involves attracts the very best in the industry, and there were lots of discussions about partnerships, protocol-building, and the future of Ethereum with other blockchain developers. <br></p><p>We also got the opportunity to chat with Panther backers and believers and distribute some Panther swag! <br></p>Our farewell picture. See you at the next event! World Ethical Data Forum <p>Panther also participated in and sponsored the <a href="https://worldethicaldataforum.org/">World Ethical Data Forum</a>. The WEDF is an event spanning multiple industries in tech, with discussions around the numerous outstanding issues surrounding the future of data.<br></p>Anish Mohammed, Co-Founder, was featured in the WEDF’s flyers.Co-Founder Oliver Gale gave a talk on the opportunities and risks in the DeFi space. Panther in the media <p>In his <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/10/21/the-web-is-moving-toward-a-new-paradigm-and-this-is-good-news-for-its-users/?utm_campaign=Social%20Member%20Articles&amp;utm_content=225508160&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-900461811576778752&amp;sh=51e373e3208f">first standalone article</a> for Forbes Business Council, Oliver Gale points out how the Web is changing towards a new open paradigm, the impact of these changes in users, and how businesses can adapt.<br></p><p>Oliver also authored <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/how-zero-knowledge-proofs-will-guarantee-compliance-for-defi-adoption/">a guest post for VentureBeat</a> on how zk-proofs will guarantee compliance for DeFi adoption. Oliver says,<br></p><p>“More than ever, protocols need to implement a rigorous approach to compliance. Regulators, on the other hand, must keep the focus on the appropriate actors in the Web3 space, as overreaching destroys the economic value otherwise available.”<br></p><p>For a change of pace, the Bloomberg Crypto podcast invited Oliver to talk about the crypto nomad lifestyle. Is it feasible to be a crypto nomad during a bear market?

Zcash Halo is one of the zero-knowledge proofs being benchmarked, and we wanted to take an opportunity to share why Halo is even better than these <a href="https://twitter.com/adrian_brink/status/1576925949995933700">initial benchmarks</a> indicate.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/14/zcashs-halo-breakthrough-is-a-big-deal-not-just-for-cryptocurrencies/">Halo</a>, if you’re not familiar, is a trustless, recursive zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) discovered by Sean Bowe at Electric Coin Co. and was implemented in Zcash earlier this year. It eliminates the trusted setup (that’s huge!) and allows greater scalability (also huge!).</p>



<p>Within the Anoma evaluation, a small task was posed for the proof: proving and verifying a 3×3 Sudoku puzzle solution. The results showed that Halo was very efficient. It generated proofs within this program in less than 1/10th of a second and verified proofs in around 3 milliseconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>But when compared to other attributes of Halo, this efficiency might not even be what devs find most important when building out a ZKP tool. Halo stands out for three additional reasons:</p>



  Trustlessness — no “trusted setup”  Recursive — more about that superpower below  Extremely well-engineered for security and performance  



<p>Let’s dive into what each of these mean:</p>



 Halo is Trustless 



<p>When Zcash launched in 2016, its zero-knowledge proofs required a setup phase to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>As our friend Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html">explains</a>, “A trusted setup ceremony is a procedure that is done once to generate a piece of data that must then be used every time some cryptographic protocol is run. Generating this data requires some secret information; the ‘trust’ comes from the fact that some person or some group of people has to generate these secrets, use them to generate the data, and then publish the data and forget the secrets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the setup phase, these secrets had to be destroyed to prevent counterfeiting of Zcash. (There’s a great <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Radiolab episode</a> about the first Zcash trusted setup ceremony.)</p>



<p>But Halo has no trusted setup. Halo eliminates the risk of ceremony compromise, increasing confidence in the soundness of the entire system.</p>



<p>Eliminating trusted setup also allows for greater protocol agility. New zero-knowledge protocols can be designed and deployed without requiring another run of the complex and dangerous trusted setup ceremony.</p>



<p>Most of the current generation of zero-knowledge projects rely on trusted setup, because trusted-setup ZKPs are super efficient, and because efficient-enough trustless ZKPs (like Halo) hadn’t been developed yet when those projects started a few years ago.</p>



<p>We’re betting that eventually most of the world will switch to trustless ZKPs and trusted setups will become a footnote of history.</p>



 Halo is Recursive 



<p>Halo is recursive. That’s a technical term, but what it basically means is that it is scalable — you can use Halo to prove facts about arbitrarily complex programs and arbitrarily big data sets.</p>



<p>Halo’s recursive attributes allow for more scalable ZKP applications, and it’s also general purpose. This means that you can use Halo for any and all ZKP applications.</p>



<p>Halo supporting recursion also means that independent, mutually distrusting parties can cooperate to prove facts about their whole combined data set without sharing their private data with each other and without being vulnerable to the other participants cheating. That is a really interesting and never-before-seen capability. We’re&nbsp; looking forward to seeing what people do with it!</p>



<p>Historical note: Halo was the first zero-knowledge proof system ever discovered that is both trustless and recursive.</p>



 Halo is Secure and Efficient 



<p>We engineered Halo for industry-leading security and performance. Unlike other next-generation zero-knowledge proof systems, Halo 2 comes with a <a href="https://zcash.github.io/halo2/design/protocol.html">proof of its security</a>. Writing a proof of security is a difficult and time-consuming process that most cryptographic engineers skip, but it gives greater assurance that the cryptography works as intended.</p>



<p>The flagship implementation of the Halo algorithm is maintained by the legendary cryptographic engineering team at The Electric Coin Co — the team whose pioneering work is the basis of more or less all zero-knowledge proof technology in use today.</p>



<p>Our Halo implementation has been audited by multiple independent experts, and it is <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash">live on Zcash mainnet</a>, protecting Zcash users and ZEC holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Halo 2 implementation (an improved <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1300850821223964672?lang=en">edition</a> of Halo) is open-sourced under Apache/MIT, and is free to use. This means anyone can use it for any purpose without requiring our — or anyone’s — permission.</p>

<p></p><p>The word anarchy stems from the Greek word “anarchos”, which means “without ruler.” For some, the term “anarchy” draws associations with lawless states of chaos from the past. However, the term in its contemporary sense is used to refer to a vision of society that is absent of unjust hierarchy and coercion. One of the key concepts within the contemporary anarchist vision is that people are, by nature, equal to one another, and should be free to live in ways that reflect this equality. Anarchists respect all individuals who develop skills and knowledge bases that have beneficial applications.</p><p>In the internet’s early days, it was structured more in accordance with anarchist ideals, offering users privacy and a less hierarchical experience. Today, the internet is dominated by government and Big Tech players that have eroded personal autonomy and transparency.</p><p>Everyone has a fundamental right to privacy. These days, pushing back against the tide of insidious data collection and online privacy infringements requires the deployment of anarchist-inspired notions of self-determination and privacy as freedom. Wrenching some sovereignty back from overreaching companies, organizations, and government agencies is feasible with the help of privacy-minded tools and strategies. Let’s take a closer look at how digital initiatives that promote greater freedom and autonomy are embracing anarchist principles.</p> What is Crypto-Anarchy? <p>The internet is at the root of how many people organize their lives. For this reason, most contemporary discussion of personal freedoms tends to be centered around the right to digital privacy.</p><p>The prefix “crypto” is often used negatively to refer to groups who have hidden motives or views. For instance, the term “crypto-fascist” refers to those with fascist views who hide their fascism in order to avoid stigma or consequences. On the other hand, the “crypto” prefix used in the term “crypto-anarchy” refers to strategies for cultivating autonomy that make use of cryptography tools.</p><p>As such, while crypto-anarchy is rooted in strategies that foster privacy and anonymity, these goals themselves are not obscured by crypto-anarchists. In fact, many crypto-anarchists are actively involved in promoting the importance and value of digital cryptography tools.</p><p>Historically, anarchism itself has been associated with left-wing thought, and anarchy’s aversion to hierarchical structures draws associations to communalism and libertarian socialism. However, crypto-anarchy today has links to anarcho-capitalism, too—a right-libertarian political philosophy centered around ownership of private property absent of centralized control.</p><p>Anarcho-capitalism calls for a voluntary society that individuals design themselves with the help of private agencies; in an ideal anarcho-capitalist society, individuals would voluntarily opt into contracts of participation designed to fulfill the will of the people.</p> Anarchy and Privacy <p>Anarchist thought is largely centered around skepticism towards coercion from intrusive governing forces. Personal privacy is widely regarded as an inalienable right. For instance, the<a href="https://unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/peace-human-rights-and-humanitarian-response/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmouZBhDSARIsALYcouoZ7jXgVP3CDqdgZjyPAWaKjedWEEMsEuuhZKkhkaWQYFjZyuBiwUgaAoEBEALw_wcB"> UN’s Declaration of Human Rights</a> states: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence.”</p><p>Freedom of thought, freedom of association, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination are all rooted in the individual’s right to create boundaries and to choose what to reveal and what to hide from others. Actions as simple and intuitive as putting on clothing or closing the bathroom door are rooted in our implicit understanding that there are aspects of ourselves we prefer not to share with others, for a number of reasons.</p><p>As individuals, we make countless decisions about our privacy every day. Insisting that our privacy is not violated without consent is an important way we protect ourselves from abuses of power. However, the ever-increasing role of technology in our lives has blurred our relationship to privacy. While we would naturally feel skeptical of anyone eavesdropping on our conversations, going through our mail, or searching our homes without a warrant, digital surveillance has created a<a href="https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-panopticon-what-is-the-panopticon-effect/#:~:text=The%20panopticon%20is%20a%20disciplinary,not%20they%20are%20being%20watched."> panopticon effect</a> in which it’s nearly impossible to tell who is collecting information about us, and for what purpose.</p><p>Crypto-anarchist tools offer users renewed awareness and control over what information they are sharing with external parties, which is an important step in eradicating privacy intrusions.</p> A History of Bitcoin’s Relationship to Anarchy <p>The principles that led to the development of Bitcoin are the result of a deep and sustained engagement with anarchist ideals. The original development of this technology can be traced to the Cyperpunks’ mailing list from the early 1990s—a virtual meeting place of early digital privacy enthusiasts.</p><p>The Cypherpunks are an example of a digital voluntary society. Many Cypherpunks communicated anonymously by way of aliases, and used cryptographic tools both as a matter of principle—believing in online anonymity as a path towards greater online freedom—and to seize the potential of the power of cryptography as a path towards decentralized and uncoerced economic transactions, for instance.</p> Challenges Facing Bitcoin’s Role as a Privacy Tool <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. All transactions are permanently recorded and stored on the blockchain without the need for regulatory forces or third-party verification. These are essential aspects of its potential as an empowering and privacy-minded digital currency. However, these characteristics also require additional tools and strategies to ensure its capacity to maximize privacy and personal freedom.</p><p>Many newcomers to Bitcoin see it as a short-term investment vehicle, primarily focused on fluctuations in the price of bitcoin rather than the revolutionary potential behind decentralized money. Novice users may leave their bitcoin exchanges, which essentially negates the freedom-related benefits of Bitcoin.</p><p>Most popular cryptocurrency exchanges are centralized (CEXs), meaning third parties have control and oversight over users’ funds. The well-known expression “not your keys, not your coins” refers to the fact that those who have access to bitcoin assets’ private keys (CEXs) ultimately have control over the assets.</p><p>When users put their private keys in the hands of others, this is an aspect of their privacy (and freedom) that they are giving away in exchange for convenience.</p><p>The pitfalls of CEXs go beyond the privacy-related issue of private key ownership, too.<a href="https://crystalblockchain.com/articles/the-10-biggest-crypto-exchange-hacks-in-history/"> Major crypto exchange hacks</a> have occurred in the past, resulting in users losing their bitcoin. Some bitcoin exchanges, including<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriga_Fintech_Solutions"> Quadriga</a>, have been outright scams, defrauding users of their money.</p><p>One of Bitcoin’s most integral features is how it offers users the ability to have custody of their own assets, without fear of outside interference. An understanding of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin and the history of its development is an important aspect of learning how to use it as a defensive privacy tool.</p> Defensive Tools to Establish Personal Privacy <p>Those with limited familiarity with Bitcoin often presume it to be an anonymous currency, but the opposite is true. Bitcoin operates under principles of transparency, which allow all transactions on the blockchain to be publicly viewed and verified.</p><p>Users’ public keys can be linked to past transactions, which can be linked to users’ personal identities through Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. KYC requires that merchants collect data about their customers. For instance, if you use Bitcoin to purchase an item from a website, that website may collect your address and other information, creating a link between that information and your Bitcoin address. Users’ IP addresses can also be linked to Bitcoin transactions, leading some users to enlist services that hide their IP addresses.</p> Anonymizing Strategies <p>New tools have been emerging that seek to improve Bitcoin’s privacy in order to give users more control over how personal data is shared.<a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/how-coinjoins-fix-bitcoin-privacy/"> Coinjoin</a> is one popular anonymizing strategy for Bitcoin. Coinjoin works by allowing users to temporarily join their funds together, acting as a kind of opaque wall between previous and future transactions.</p><p>Additionally, privacy experts tend to recommend privacy-minded internet browsers to make bitcoin-related activity less publicly viewable.<a href="https://www.torproject.org/"> Tor</a>’s browser is a well-established anonymizing tool. Its free browser gives users the ability to mask their web activity from outside parties using multi-layered encryption. When it comes to communicating about cryptocurrency transactions, experts recommend end-to-end encrypted messaging services like<a href="https://signal.org/en/"> Signal</a>.</p> Wasabi Wallet <p>Privacy-minded digital wallets are an effective way to maintain control over your bitcoin and to address the privacy concerns inherent to Bitcoin.<a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/"> Wasabi Wallet 2.0</a> is a privacy-focused bitcoin wallet that is user-friendly and offers a shortcut to the privacy-enhancing benefits of Bitcoin as a tool for crypto-anarchists.</p><p>Wasabi Wallet is a zero-knowledge tool, which means its developers collect no information about users. Making use of the Tor network, block filtering, and coinjoin technology, Wasabi Wallet 2.0 is trust free. It is also a non-custodial wallet, giving users control over their own private keys, offering the full self-determining potential of Bitcoin.</p> Wasabi Wallet as a Defensive Technology <p>Without access to the right tools, protecting oneself from insidious surveillance and data collection can feel overwhelming. Across the internet, privacy and security issues are widespread, and many web-based services are oppressively hierarchical, offering little to no independence and freedom for users.<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">According to one study</a> from the Pew Research Centre, four in five Americans feel they have little to no control over how their data is viewed and collected online, and around the same number believe the pitfalls of this digital surveillance outweigh any benefits. The same study shows that well over half of Americans are concerned about digital surveillance.</p><p>Those interested in preserving their privacy online have rightfully gravitated towards Bitcoin and the crypto sphere, which has a history rooted in strong-willed individualism in the face of intrusion from overbearing institutions. While some people associate the term “anarchy” with the avoidance of rules or consequences, the opposite is true—crypto-anarchist ideals are centered around transparency, equality, and fairness for all. Privacy is a key component of personal freedom, and tools like Wasabi Wallet help users defend their individual online property rights as part of a path toward a more liberated life.<br><br></p>

<p>Have you ever dreamed of opening your own hotel? Did you ever harbour aspirations to transform an old and dilapidated building into an alluring art-deco establishment where literary types gather to sip tea and compare notes about their latest masterpiece? Maybe you have, at some point in your life, imagined an opulent opening day, when the Grand Crypto Hotel welcomes its first set of guests through its revolving doors.</p>



<p>Back in the day, you would have to be a millionaire, or a real estate tycoon to be able to open such a hotel and partake in hotel ownership. But what if I explained that there is a way that you can own a part of that hotel without great wealth? Is your interest piqued yet? Sit down there beside the fire and listen while I tell you about tokenisation. It won’t take long, I promise.<br></p>



 A brief history of tokenisation<br> 



<p>In today’s technology-savvy world, we understand tokenisation as the process of turning sensitive data into non-sensitive data tokens. That then can be shared or traded without compromising the underlying information. Banks use tokens to transmit banking details to a payment processor, for example, to prevent data breaches.</p>



<p>But tokenisation itself is a concept as old as mankind itself. Clay tokens used to count, store, and communicate financial data are known to have been used circa 4,000 BC in regions today known as the Middle East. Early tokens were individual pieces made in different sizes to represent quantity. Later, the tokens would be etched with lines or dots to denote the quality of whatever they represented.</p>



<p>These early tokens were used for administrative purposes, in local economies. Much later, they led to the advent of writing. So from the very beginning, tokenisation has been used to convey information. Data.</p>



<p>This trend of representing data continues today, albeit in a more sophisticated fashion, more in accordance with modern technology.</p>



 Tokenising the hotel industry<br> 



<p>If you ask any hotelier what their main business goal is, you’re likely to hear that their focus is to increase occupancy rates, and maximise revenue per room, commonly known as RevPAR. Millions of hotel rooms worldwide lie unoccupied, i.e., they’re not producing revenue. And as the pandemic made evident, being able to fill your hotel is never certain. So, in light of this economic quandary, hotel managers have been forced to reinvent the business and find alternative ways to make their establishments profitable again. Tokenising their hotels is one of these new ventures.</p>



<p>But how does<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft/project-management/"> tokenising a hotel</a> actually work, and what benefits does it bring? Tokenisation opens up two interesting avenues: Fast access to monetary resources (capital, in other words), and tokenisation-as-as-service.<br></p>



 Releasing capital, fast<br> 



<p>Hotels range from small, family-run establishments, to larger, franchise-owned mega buildings. The plot of land where they stand might be worth millions, and when considering the furnishings, equipment, ornaments, furniture, etc., the value of a hotel site might run into the billions. The problem is if the hotel has no guests, all that value is locked unto itself. In fact, it costs a lot of money just to have the place open, in terms of staff, energy consumption, water, etc.</p>



<p>During COVID-19, millions of hotel rooms remained dormant for the better part of two years, with many hotels looking for different ways to unlock all this locked capital. In this situation, the hotel owner could just sell the property, but this would mean finding a buyer, which is easier said than done, particularly in times of uncertainty. And if the property is sold, the hotel would obviously be in the hands of somebody else. This might not be in the seller’s best interest.</p>



<p>Tokenisation would enable the hotel owner to sell part of the hotel, by digitising the hotel’s assets through blockchain technology. Once the digital version of the hotel is uploaded to the chain in the form of tokens, the owner can begin selling these assets to different buyers. People would effectively own part of a hotel. The blockchain would keep all the information transparent and secure. So, the hotelier can track which tokens are sold, to whom, and at what price.</p>



<p>In this scenario, tokenisation enables the fragmentation of the sale (rather than selling the entire hotel to one person). This means that every investor retains what is called fractional ownership. In other words, you no longer need to be an eccentric billionaire to own a hotel. Or part of it, anyway.<br></p>



 Tokenisation-as-a-service<br> 



<p>Tokenising a hotel opens up brand new possibilities for turning a profit via blockchain, including tokenisation-as-a-service.<br>The digitisation process creates a perfect replica of the hotel on the blockchain, a ‘digital twin’, if you will. Using smart contracts, several specialised platforms now enable this virtual representation of your establishment to manage daily tasks.</p>



<p>These include maintenance, supplies, etc. through third-party contractors, for example. This has an immediate and obvious benefit: cost reduction, by a great margin. The hotel manager (the human one) can delegate all these tasks to the digital twin, and focus on more pressing matters. Tokenisation-as-a-service saves a whole lot of money and frees up a great deal of time.</p>



<p></p>



 How to tokenise your hotel: NFTs or FTs? 



<p>In the hotel industry, these differences can be explained through the example of tokenising a hotel. Let’s say you want to tokenise ownership of the hotel with fungible tokens, you can, for example, create a 100.000 hotel tokens, and each token represents ownership of 1/100.000 of the hotel. Every hotel token is the same and can be easily traded as each token has the same value.</p>



<p>As described above, tokenisation (in blockchain) is essentially the process of representing a certain item with one or more tokens, and it can be done in two ways, namely through fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens. Fungible tokens are interchangeable, for example every euro is the same as every other euro. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are all unique and can have different values, such as different art pieces or different car parts, etc.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">But you can also tokenise ownership of a hotel with non-fungible tokens.</a> In this case you could tokenise the hotel rooms, the hotel restaurant, the hotel ground, etc. Each of these assets has a different value and people could then buy these individual assets rather than a fraction of the whole hotel. To make things even more interesting, you could then also tokenise high-value assets such as the ground of the hotel for example, using fungible tokens.</p>



<p>In this example both ways of tokenisation are used to fractionalise ownership, just in different ways. But they can coexist and work together.</p>



 Conclusion<br> 



<p>Whether it’s a relatively small family-owned hotel, or a location of a major hotel franchise, tokenising hotels, or hotel rooms, creates real investment opportunities for small to medium investors. And from the hotelier’s perspective, it’s a win-win situation.</p>

 Diardi Elections — Instructions <p>Hey guys, we hope you’re all doing&nbsp;well.</p><p>This article will go over how anyone can participate in the upcoming Diardi elections using the web application we created for&nbsp;it.</p><p>The application is available at <a href="https://election.scalaproject.io">https://election.scalaproject.io</a></p> Instructions  Create Account <p>You can create an account on the app just like you would on any other platform and log in with your credentials.</p><p>Click the “Register Now” button to fill in the information.</p><p>Note that you can use any name you want, but remember that this name will be displayed on the Elections dashboard, and everyone will be able to see&nbsp;it.</p><p>We recommend using your Discord username if you have one. For example, MasterMind#2808.</p> Dashboard <p>After the registration, you will be redirected to the Elections dashboard.</p> How does the election&nbsp;work? <p>Let’s introduce the mechanisms behind the Diardi elections.</p> vXLA <p>vXLA “voting tokens” are simply the same XLA coins you had in your wallet before the snapshot on October 31,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>You don’t have to do anything on your side to swap your XLA coins to vXLA. This has already been done on-chain at the snapshot&nbsp;time.</p><p>Those tokens are worth nothing and are only used to vote for applications on the election&nbsp;app.</p> Elections Process <p>The elections will end on November 18,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>During this period, you will be able to send your vXLA tokens to the election app to apply to become a Diardi node operator and also vote for the applications.</p><p>Obviously, you can vote for yourself!</p><p>Remember that 1 vote = 1&nbsp;vXLA.</p><p>After the election period is over, the candidates with the most votes will be elected to become node operators.</p> XLA Balance <p>Your current XLA coins always remain in your wallet. You can check by connecting to your favourite remote node or by syncing&nbsp;locally.</p><p>The vXLA voting tokens are only available when you are connected to the Diardi remote&nbsp;nodes.</p> Snapshot <p>After October 31st, you can send your coins back to any exchange if you&nbsp;want.</p> Number of node operators <p>Depending on the number of applications, we are looking for 32 or 64 Diardi node operators.</p><p>The Scala team will reserve some nodes for the core team members for testing and development purposes: 4 spots if 32 operators are elected and 8 spots if 64 are&nbsp;elected.</p> How to&nbsp;apply? <p>This section will explain how you can apply to become a Diardi node operator.</p> Requirements <p>Anyone can apply to become a node operator, but all candidates must be able to own and operate a server with a public IP&nbsp;address.</p><p>The server specifications would be similar to running a Scala node since the proof-of-algorithm is much faster than that of regular&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Thus, even a dual-core server will be plenty, but it will give you the upper hand if you have a faster server with a very stable/fast network. What’s given below will be recommended specifications for a Diardi&nbsp;node:</p>  8 cores  8 GB&nbsp;RAM  Minimum of 64 GB of&nbsp;storage  <p>Note: It is strongly suggested to use a VPS for better performance and stability!</p><p>If you believe you have all the requirements to become a node operator and you can commit to it, follow the steps&nbsp;below.</p> 1. Retrieve your Deposit&nbsp;Address <p>Once logged in, you can click on the “Copy Deposit Address” button in the Dashboard to copy your deposit&nbsp;address.</p><p>This is the address you will deposit your vXLA tokens&nbsp;to.</p> 2.

    <p>TokenMint is an easy-to-use platform for anyone to launch a token using custom tokenomics without having to know a single line of code. It streamlines and simplifies the tokenization process, making creating a fungible token and non-fungible token (NFT) easy and quick.</p>
<p>TokenMint’s NFT creation and minting feature is going live on mainnet soon but is available on <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">testnet</a> and is free for everyone to use! </p>
<p>The TokenMint platform is designed to provide a seamless, simple, and intuitive user experience. There are four components available to launch your NFT:</p>
 
 TokenMint Chain – a sidechain built on the Horizen network 
 <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">Token/NFT Generator </a>– a web app that allows a streamlined and easy process for anyone to create and mint a token with custom tokenomics. 
 <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet </a>– a web browser extension wallet that stores and manages tokens created on TokenMint 
 <a href="https://explorer-testnet.tokenmint.global/">TokenMint Block explorer</a> – a block explorer that tracks and displays all transactions on the TokenMint Chain.&nbsp; 
 
 Step-by-Step Guide for Creating an NFT on TokenMint 
<p>Before starting the process, please download and install the latest version of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cobalt/hekbjgfncacdinlajhgiakpaieajpfph">Cobalt wallet.</a></p>
<p>If you need additional TestZEN for this process, please reference our <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-get-testzen/">How to Get TestZEN tutorial</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 Step 1 
 
 <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-load-nft-data-into-an-ipfs-repository/">Load NFT Data Into An IPFS Repository</a> 
 Copy the CID from the metadata folder on Pinata and that will be used for the Base URI on the TokenMint NFT generator. 
 
<p></p>
 Step 2 – Use the TokenMint NFT Generator 
 
 Go to <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global/">https://testnet.tokenmint.global/</a> and click on “Launch App”.  
 Connect your Cobalt Wallet by clicking “Connect Wallet” on the top right corner 
 Click on the NFTs tab in the top menu, then on Create Collection 
 Fill in the Relevant Fields:&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Collection Name – which is the full name of your collection 
 Collection Symbol – 3 to 6 characters long, only including letters and numbers.&nbsp; 
 Base URI – The URI where the collection is stored (CID link from Metadata folder on Pinata) 
 Item Supply – The amount of NFTs in the collection 
 Unlimited Suppy – this can be toggled on or off 
 Collection creation fee – the fee for creating an NFT on TokenMint is 0.25 ZEN 
 Agree to the terms and conditions and hit confirm 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 
 Wait for the token collection to finish generating. This can take a few minutes. Progress can be monitored on the <a href="https://explorer-testnet.tokenmint.global/">Block Explorer</a> 
 
<p></p>
 &nbsp; 
 Step-by-Step Guide for Minting an NFT on TokenMint 
<p>Please ensure that the “TokenMint testnet” is chosen on your Cobalt Wallet.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Once your NFT is generated, mint your NFT to your Cobalt wallet (NFT Mint Fee of 0.25 ZEN) 
 
<p></p>
 
 Sign the transaction in your Cobalt Wallet 
 
<p></p>
 
 Wait for the UUID to be generated, once confirmed, the NFT will be minted to your Cobalt Wallet 
 
<p></p>
 
 Click the “NFTs” tab in your Cobalt Wallet and you should see your minted NFT with the following details:&nbsp; 
 
 
 
 
 Collection Name 
 Collection UUID 
 Token ID 
 IPFS Link (Where your image &amp; metadata are stored) 
 Attributes 
 Ability to Send and View on the Explorer

<p>A few weeks ago a person shared a link in a comment on one of my videos. It was a 2007 roundtable discussion on neuroeconomics hosted by the Philoctetes Center for the Multi-Disciplinary Study of the Imagination, formerly housed in the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. The organization, named after the <a href="https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/philoctetes.html">mythological wounded Argonaut and holder of Heracles’s bow</a>, failed after the collapse of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auSfaavHDXQ">Bernie Madoff’s</a> Ponzi scheme. Madoff had been a benefactor and was in the audience (to the left of the rear podium) at the event from which these clips were drawn.</p>
<p>Including the Q&amp;A period, the talk was around two hours long. Watch it in full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_B0rvSxUqY&amp;t=0s">here</a> or my 45-minute highlight reel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPGIp9gHvs">here</a>. I thought it contained so much provocative information, and clearly there were networked influencers in the room, that I spent a few days creating a series of clips that I could share with readers of my blog. I plan to make more of these short posts featuring digestible bits of information I find interesting and pertinent to my recent lines of inquiry – artificial intelligence, networked sensor systems, swarm or collective intelligence, tokenization of social relations, and cybernetic governance for evolutionary optimization towards some new phase of digital, photonic, simulated “life.”</p>
<p>Participants in the 2007 roundtable included:</p>
<p><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/albertobisin/">Alberto Bisin</a> – NYU professor of economics with a specialty in econometrics and behavioral economics</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globalcustodian.com/will-brown-leaves-jp-morgan-for-barclays-capital/">William Brown</a> – former chief economist at JP Morgan, later at Barclays Bank</p>
<p><a href="https://www.helixcenter.org/participants/edward-nersessian/">Edward Nersessian</a> – psychiatrist at Weill-Cornell Medical College and staff of New York Psychoanalytic Institute, co-founder of the <a href="http://philoctetes.org/about/">Philoctetes Center</a> and <a href="https://www.helixcenter.org/">The Helix Center</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_A._Phelps">Elizabeth Phelps</a> – Harvard professor of cognitive neuroscience with a research focus on emotion, cognition, and memory as well as social behavior and economic decision making</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Glimcher">Paul Glimcher</a> – lead developer of the field of neuroeconomics and founder of the NYU Institute for the Study of Decision Making, lead investigator in the Kavli-funded “Big Human Data Research Platform”</p>
<p>I’m going to post half the clips tonight and half tomorrow. Before you choose a few to watch (they’re just 2-4 minutes each), I invite you to review and think about this infographic I made depicting a range of activities associated with Vienna from cybernetics to crypto-currency; from logic to metaphysics; from music to psychoanalysis. Consider the wave forms of matter, sound, economic forecasts, and thought. Glimcher said he was seeking a “Generalized Neural Theory of Human Decision Making.” He didn’t know why they needed it, but increasingly it feels like it’s wanted as a gift for the humanoid robots.</p>
<p>If you want to click the links on the graphic <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YhH5y1I2L8lwEnLzs6jWNrH0u64_04PbksgIdcthPuo/edit?usp=sharing">try this</a>.</p>
<p>For insights into how I have been thinking about these topics you can listen to a one-hour chat I had with my friend Cliff about the prospect of living inside an “outside-in robot” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZpBvdnUbCU">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Listen and think about choice, prediction, and use of sensors and currency to shape behavior.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does it make you feel that JP Morgan wasn’t very effective at training people to act like a machine?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you imagine how economic modeling will become integrated into biology? Can you see how gamification and tokens fit into this scenario?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where he’s talking about “safety systems” for cars, can you see how this would be applied to people through their digital twin?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where they talk about potential applications for using oxytocin (related to dopamine) to instill trust in people, I think this has been accomplished through devices and social media feeds. We are self-engineering our minds through personal technology. They did it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Listen to what she’s saying and then consider the use “outside-in” robots to monitor and manage the emotions of kindergarten children. This is something Cliff and I talked about in our video.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Part two tomorrow. I really do want to hear your insights. These clips are each just 2-4 minutes long. so take a break from the bot noise and really think. Use your imagination!</p>

<p>With spring here in Australia, there’s no better sentiment for announcing the full decentralization of the Verida Testnet — a globally distributed project founded with Aussie roots. Our testnet name pays homage to the wattle, the <a href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/acacia/">Acacia</a> — the largest genus of vascular plants in Australia.</p><p>Over the last few months, the Verida team has been quietly preparing for an upgrade of the Verida Acacia testnet to provide a fully decentralized identity layer. In the early stages of the Verida network, it was much faster to create a centralized identity server. This allowed us to have a working network sooner rather than later. We’re entering the next phase of the network where we can provide a 100% decentralized network. Decentralizing identities is a critical step in that&nbsp;pathway.</p><p>Starting November 2022, we’ll progressively open the network to the public. This is a milestone step to seek valuable feedback and iterate, on our way to Mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p><p>The Verida Network comprises the underlying protocol, technology and documentation built by Verida. Developers can leverage the Verida SDKs to use and contribute to the code to improve the network. Service providers can deliver infrastructure to the network by running nodes that users can select to&nbsp;use.</p> 1. What do I need to&nbsp;do? <p>Developers will be required to update to the latest SDK. There are breaking changes as the protocol will now be looking up identities and data storage infrastructure from the blockchain. More details will be provided to developers closer to the testnet upgrade. Join our #acacia-testnet channel on Discord to stay up to date with the latest information.</p><p>End users will be required to update to the latest Verida Vault. This allows and empowers users to create new identities that are now decentralized. It’s a huge paradigm shift from the current Web2 model that collects troves of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Note: Due to the nature of this upgrade, the existing identities (DID’s) and data on the current Testnet will be reset. All data and identities will be lost unless you&nbsp;backup.</p> 2. What’s included in this Testnet&nbsp;upgrade? <p>We have a number of updates going live across the Verida network, Verida Vault and SDKs as part of the Acacia decentralized Testnet&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This will include the following high-level updates:</p>  Decentralized DID Registry: The current DID registry is currently stored on a centralized server and accessed by the protocol via an API. This DID registry will be moved to live on-chain, giving anyone the ability to register their own identity on the network. This upgrade also includes a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  Verida SDK: Updates to the Verida SDK to leverage the new blockchain based DID Registry.  Verida DbStore: Improvements to provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  Verida Vault: Updates to use the latest protocol SDK and to sponsor gas fees for verified mobile&nbsp;users.  Verida Connect: Enhancements to support the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.  <p>Our <a href="https://developers.verida.io/">Developer Portal</a> will be updated to reflect the changes as the Testnet becomes fully decentralized.</p> 3. What are the Acacia Testnet limitations? <p>With the public upgrade of the decentralized Acacia Testnet, it’s important for users and developers to keep in mind current constraints.</p>  The Acacia Testnet should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It’s great for getting your application ready for&nbsp;Mainnet.  Data stored and accounts created on Acacia will not be transferable to Mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum’s Testnets and&nbsp;Mainnet.  Verida is currently running the encrypted storage nodes for the Acacia Testnet. We will progressively open up the network to be operated by trusted node operators in the coming&nbsp;months.  The Acacia Testnet will continue to exist as a test network once the Verida Mainnet launches later this year. We’ll keep you updated on important dates.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We’ve done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but please remember, this is still a&nbsp;Testnet.  <p>Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/verida/support">opening a ticket on Github</a> or let us know in <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">Discord</a>, so we can fix them as soon as possible.</p> 4. How can I keep&nbsp;updated? <p>For any questions, issues or feedback relating to our Testnet launch, please join our community on <a href="https://discord.verida.io">Discord</a> and join the #acacia-testnet channel.</p><p>Stay up to date with our latest announcements, news, ideas and inspirations, join and engage on our community channels.

<p>Amman (Jordan), San Francisco (United States), November 1st, 2022 – A new hope for Human Rights in the Metaverse emerges as the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN-ESCWA) adopts Metaverse Safety Week, an annual global awareness campaign led by XR Safety Initiative (XRSI) that brings the world together to safeguard the Metaverse. XRSI’s Global Digital Policy Advisor, Kristina Podnar, made the announcement at the Arab SME Summit in the presence of global regulators and members of the Jordanian Royal Family.</p>



<p>UN-ESCWA is one of five regional commissions under the United Nations Economic and Social Council’s jurisdiction and promotes Western Asia’s economic and social development through regional and subregional cooperation and integration. XRSI is a San Francisco-based nonprofit Standard Development Organization (SDO) focused on helping build safe and inclusive emerging technology ecosystems.</p>



<p>Kristina Podnar, XRSI’s Global Digital Policy Advisor, noted that “the Metaverse is one of the most talked about modern technology concepts. As we look forward to activities that range from leisure and gaming to professional and commercial interactions, financial transactions, or even health interventions, we cannot shy away from the corresponding tough conversations around data protection and cybersecurity, ownership, misuse, interoperability, and portability. I am delighted that XRSI is facilitating conversations across sectors which will move all of us beyond talk and into action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the focus on bringing the world together and proactively addressing the Metaverse-related risk impacting humans and societies, XRSI celebrates the third annual awareness campaign between Dec 10th and Dec 15th. The Metaverse Safety Week is created and promoted by XRSI with these key focus agendas:</p>



  Encourage the Metaverse stakeholders, such as organizations, governments, academics, creators, and global citizens, to adopt the intervention for safety awareness by organizing conferences, meetups, and webinars, conducting internal employee awareness training, issuing transparency reports, digital asset distribution for promoting safety or making pledges related to safeguarding the Metaverse.  Help Governments, Big Tech, Academia, Think Tanks, Civic Organizations, and Communities worldwide understand how they can combine resources and play leadership roles to stay ahead of the challenges that the Metaverse brings along.  Create a better and safer Metaverse for all by spreading awareness and promoting policies, guidelines, safety frameworks, and research.  



<p>Kavya Pearlman, the XRSI CEO, notes that “Metaverse brings new economic opportunities and enables several profound innovations to life but also brings along safety, privacy, and ethical risks. Each year before the holidays, the world must come together to ensure that we engage with the Metaverse technologies with safety, security, and human rights at the forefront. By dedicating an entire week to various themes, XRSI intends to create a reflection point on the safety and trust aspects of Metaverse technologies.”</p>



 Metaverse Safety Week 2022 – December 10th-15th, 2022 



<p>The 2022 virtual event is a week-long event that commences on the 74th Human Rights Day, 10th December, at a unique virtual venue, with rich and immersive experiences crafted explicitly for the occasion. Metaverse Safety Week features a global agenda with sessions, social moments, panels, and live interviews this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Metaverse Safety Week focuses on building an open, inclusive, safe Metaverse by inviting the ecosystem stakeholders to connect, collaborate, and share their research, knowledge, and passion. Any organization can adopt the awareness campaign to create their own programming or support the XRSI-led campaign by submitting requests to speak, conduct a panel or create a parallel event altogether. The Metaverse Safety Week awareness campaign is a community-driven global movement for responsible innovation, better regulations, and more profound knowledge of the world we are immersing in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stake natively on Polkadot easier than ever and with as little as 1 DOT thanks to this new scalability feature for Polkadot’s staking system.</p><p>Nomination pools are a new feature for <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking">Polkadot’s staking system</a> that allows users to pool their DOT tokens together on-chain to nominate validators and receive rewards, significantly improving the system’s scalability. Now, anyone with as little as 1 DOT can receive rewards for staking natively on Polkadot.</p><p>Coupled with the recently launched <a href="http://staking.polkadot.network">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, the new user-friendly staking app that recently came out of beta, nomination pools lower the barrier to entry for participation in staking directly on the network and simplify the staking process. Now, users with less DOT and those looking for a more passive staking experience can stake directly on the network.</p><p>Crucially, these updates also reduce the incentive to stake through third-party services and intermediaries. By cutting out the middleman and staking natively (directly on the Relay Chain) DOT holders can help keep Polkadot secure and decentralized while receiving competitive rewards of up to 18%*.</p><p>Native, protocol-level nomination pools also represent a major innovation in the broader blockchain industry, where stakers with less tokens are often disadvantaged and staking pools typically necessitate relying on intermediary services.</p> The need for nomination pools <p>From the beginning, Polkadot’s Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) system was designed for maximum security, decentralization, energy efficiency, and fair representation, efficiently balancing the interests of smaller and larger DOT holders alike. It has always been a goal for Polkadot to provide inclusive access to staking participation and lower the barrier to entry as much as possible for nominators.</p><p>But following the launch of Polkadot’s Relay Chain in 2020, <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-and-kusama-staking-changes/">rapid scaling</a> of the network in 2021 and an increase in demand for staking participation put a strain on this innovative staking system. To ensure the network's security, a maximum number of 22,500 nominators was introduced and governance passed a series of motions that gradually increased <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/157">the minimum nomination amount to 160 DOT</a>. This limit was eventually <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/921">lowered back down to 10 DOT</a>, but the minimum amount needed to be part of the top 22,500 nominators and earn rewards is now dynamically determined and is still somewhere around 170 DOT at the time of writing.</p><p>To remedy the system’s scalability issues and remove the limitations introduced on participating as a nominator, several <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">improvements to Polkadot’s staking system</a> were developed <a href="https://polkadot.network/tag/staking-updates/">over the past year</a>. The most significant and exciting of these is the nomination pools feature, which launched first on Kusama and is now live on Polkadot.</p><p>Before nomination pools, the only way to participate in the nomination process and receive rewards natively was for users to directly nominate validators, using their stake of DOT tokens to select up to 16 trustworthy validators.</p><p>However, not only does direct nomination require users to have a significant stake in DOT tokens to participate, it also requires playing a more active role in researching, selecting, monitoring, and periodically reevaluating their choice of validators.</p><p>With nomination pools, the creator of a pool manages nominations on behalf of pool members, reducing the time and overhead necessary to participate in nomination. Of course, pool members should still conduct their own due diligence when determining which pool to join. In contrast to direct nomination, pools also do not require users to create both a stash and controller account, further reducing the complexity of native staking.</p><p>Alternatively, before nomination pools DOT holders could stake indirectly via third-party services and liquid staking providers, but at the expense of network decentralization and security. Indirect staking also meant that DOT holders had to give away their economic voting power to third parties, often handing over a percentage of their rewards in the process.</p><p>Beyond making native staking more accessible for those with less DOT, nomination pools also remove the theoretical limit on the number of users the system can handle, allowing it to continue to scale as demand for staking participation continues into the future.</p> How nomination pools work <p>With nomination pools, multiple DOT holders can pool their tokens together and act as a single nominator, collectively backing a set of validators chosen by the pool creator with their combined stake.</p><p>Rewards are automatically split pro-rata among the members of the pool, and nomination pools do not currently take a commission. This means that pool members can currently expect the same rate of rewards for their stake as they would if participating in the system as a direct nominator.</p><p>To ensure economic incentives are aligned and network security is maintained, slashes are also applied proportionally to pool members who are actively bonded.</p> Joining a nomination pool <p>The simplest way to participate in nomination pools is through the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, the network’s new, user-friendly web application for staking. More advanced users can also participate via <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>.</p><p>Joining a nomination pool through the Staking Dashboard is as easy as connecting your account, selecting a pool, and signing a transaction to contribute your DOT to the pool. For a complete walkthrough on how to join a pool through the Polkadot Staking Dashboard, see the <a href="https://youtu.be/gQ-ZucYgWZc">tutorial video walkthrough</a>.</p><p>Note that you can only participate in a pool with a transferable balance and the amount you participate with is transferred from your account to the nomination pool. Those who have already bonded funds can bond additional funds or re-stake rewards. Currently, you can only belong to one pool at a time. Because the member funds are transferred from your account to the pool's account, any funds you nominate to a pool will not appear in your balance.</p><p>Additionally, voting for governance with pooled funds is not currently possible. In order to unstake, or simply switch from one pool to another, you’ll need to wait the 28-day unbonding period on Polkadot.</p> The stakes are infinitely better on Polkadot <p>Polkadot's native nomination pools are an important and valuable addition to the network. As a result of this update, NPoS becomes more scalable and provides a more user-friendly and inclusive way to stake on Polkadot, opening up staking to many more DOT holders.</p><p>Pools also offer new opportunities for validators. With nomination pools deployed, the number of DOT entering the staking system is likely to increase, and validators will have an incentive to ensure the inflow of tokens is directed towards them.</p><p>Join or open a nomination pool today via the <a href="http://staking.polkadot.network">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, or via <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=light%3A%2F%2Fsubstrate-connect%2Fpolkadot#/staking/pools">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>.</p><p>Read more about staking on <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking/">the Polkadot website</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">visit the Polkadot Wiki</a> for a more technical deep-dive on nomination pools.

This is the mission of&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>Findora is using zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy platform that can solve these problems. By combining privacy and auditability, by prioritizing compliance and personal ownership of data, Findora prepares Web3 for real-world application and lays the foundation for a free and decentralized digital&nbsp;future.</p> ZK-DID <p>ZK-DID has the ability to restore ownership of personal data to&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, you could prove your credit score is above a certain number, or your GPA is above a certain level, without revealing the specific numbers or other data.

<p>Hello everyone. I’m popping in to let you know that Jason and I have decided to postpone our trip until March. We had good intentions, but sometimes life throws you curveballs. We’re both feeling a bit tender, not at the top of our game, and California demands we come fully engaged. We’ve been touched by all the support we received and have been in contact by email or mail with most donors. If you are reading this and haven’t heard from us already, please drop Jason a line at argusfest@gmail.com. We didn’t have contact information for everyone. Jason will be working to edit segments of our material over the next few months to create an introduction that he hopes will create space for more people to picture the challenge humanity faces as Web3 sensor network installation and the financialization of natural life proceed at a brisk pace. Some of the donations will support Jason’s work on that project, and the rest we’ll hold for the spring trip. We are more than happy to return donations to anyone who requests it. His van is now roadworthy after weeks of difficult labor, and that is a happy milestone achieved.</p>
<p>Since Jason will be focused on developing that video over the winter months, I will be working to develop some basic skills in the technical arena. I got a second monitor and am making progress; though I can certainly never match the quality of his editing. I have presented a few podcasts and walk throughs of my elaborate maps – the labyrinths. Today I tried out an hour-long format with my friend Cliff. We started with a peek into the origins of WGBH Boston and public television, talked about the stories we live inside, and then pivoted to a critical examination of new technologies of emotion-sensing software and cyber-physical networks that aspire to be “outside-in” robots. They intend for us to live inside these networked “robots.” Billionaires and proponents of Generalized Artificial Intelligence want us to adopt digital identities, transact through coded token “social” currencies, “perform” humanity, and help them manifest new forms of information-based “life.” No thank you.</p>

<p>I don’t think Google / Alphabet or Eric Schmidt appreciate these investigations. Below is a discussion Jason and I did last week deconstructing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2kOmSh4h84">SmartCon chat</a> Schmidt did recently with Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink.</p>
<p></p>

<p>I got another ding on my youtube channel last week, so I can’t upload or stream for now. I added today’s chat with Cliff to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCscUZcrVKlV6NnRpWADQzgw/videos">my back up channel</a> and invite you to subscribe to it and / or send me your email so I can add you to the notification list when I put up new content. I’ve also been working to upload videos to Archive.org where they can be viewed and downloaded. Look for “Alison McDowell” or “Wrench In The Gears.”</p>
<p>Someone made a suggestion that I begin to engage people via a regular Q&amp;A. I wasn’t sure, because I don’t get many viewers, but after talking with Jason and Cliff I decided maybe I could try and solicit questions in advance via a form and then select one or more to address in a given week. If I don’t get submissions, I can always read an old blog post for the podcast. See <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wrench-in-the-gears-podcast-downloadable-audio-of-select-talks/">this page</a> for downloadable audio-only content.</p>
<p>My hope would be to support people as they examine these systems in their own communities. “Looking at the Labyrinth” seems to be exactly what needs to be done if we are to get to the middle and walk out, don’t you think? If you have a question for me or an observation about what this looks like where you live, consider sending something my way. For now I’m thinking maybe Wednesday evenings around 8pm EST. Jason hasn’t had a chance to make the form yet. I just asked him today. In the meantime, these are the questions I plan to use. If you’re really excited about this idea, feel free to email a submission to me at timpsila@protonmail.com.</p>
 
 Tell me a little bit about yourself. I’d love to know generally where you’re located,&nbsp;what&nbsp; you care about, what your gifts are – that sort of thing. Just a few sentences is fine. 
 I’m interested to hear&nbsp;what interests you about my research / perspective. Where does it resonate with you? 
 
 Do you have an observation to share about how you see this “predator energy” showing where you live? 
 
 
 Do you have a question or comment about a recent presentation? 
 
 
 Please share your preferred contact information – phone and/or email. 
 
 If I use your inquiry in my weekly mailbag podcast, I’ll be sure to drop you a line in advance. I’m working on my Zoom skills, so if you’d be open to having a recorded chat be sure to let me know. 
 
 Thanks again to everyone who made contributions. I’ve come to trust my intuition, and my gut said wait. I’m excited that by spring we’ll have new material we can share with audiences in California to help them understand the lens we’re using on this unfolding drama.

<p>A short writeup for the Polkadot ecosystem on implementing the newly released nomination pools feature.</p> What? <p>Nomination pools are a new type of scaling solution that's being added to Polkadot staking. It mainly targets the stakers who do not have enough DOT to participate actively in the normal staking process, i.e. as a “nominator”. Learn more about pools at the following links:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">Nomination Pools and The Story of The Polkadot's NPoS</a>.  <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">Nomination Pools | Polkadot Wiki</a>.   How? <p>Pool members have a much simpler API compared to nominators: They join a pool, they can increase or decrease their stake in that pool, and they can claim their rewards whenever they want.</p><p>On the other hand, the process of creating and managing a pool is entirely new and we expect that to be the most work heavy part for our ecosystem, wanting to support pools. Nonetheless, you can focus on the “Pool member experience” at first, since most of those who want to manage a pool will be “power users” who can find their way in Polkadot JS Apps or other UIs with rough edges.</p><p>Here are some resources to help you with implementation:</p>  <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/index.html">pallet-nomination-pools documentation.</a>  <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/">https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io</a>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33/views/3">https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33/views/3</a>   Why? <p>Polkadot’s complicated taking system has been the subject of a lot of community feedback over the last year. A portion of these stakers have already migrated to other staking services. A number of them are nominating on Polkadot, but are not always earning rewards. Therefore, we expect a large number of end users to wish to move back to staking directly on the Relay Chain (as opposed to more centralized services) and pools are exactly the tool for that. This is a great opportunity for the entire ecosystem to help these users achieve this goal, while attracting more users.</p><p>We encourage all wallets in our ecosystem to identify nominators who are not earning rewards, and invite them to join nomination pools. See <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/issues/7902">this issue</a> as further information around this.</p> Common Mistakes / Notes <p>Here are a few mistakes that we realized over the last few months UI implementers should keep an eye on.</p> Pool Members   In general, whenever a pool member changes their total point, the chain will automatically claim all their pending rewards for them. This is not optional, and MUST happen for the reward calculation to remain correct (see the documentation of `<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.unbond">bond</a>` as an example). So, make sure you are warning your users about it. They might be surprised if they see that they bonded an extra 100 DOT, and now suddenly their 5.23 DOT in pending reward is gone. It is not gone, it has been paid out to you!  Joining a pool implies transferring funds to the pool account. So it might be (based on which wallet that you are using) that you no longer see the funds that are moved to the pool in your “free balance” section. Make sure the user is aware of this, and not surprised by seeing this. Also, the transfer that happens here is configured to to never accidentally destroy the sender account. So to join a pool, your sender account must remain alive with 1 DOT left in it. This means, with 1 DOT as existential deposit, and 1 DOT as minimum to join a pool, you need at least 2 DOT to join a pool. Consequently, if you are suggesting members to join a pool with “Maximum possible value”, you must subtract 1 DOT to remain in the sender account to not accidentally kill it.  Points and balance are not the same! Any pool member, at any point in time, can have points in either the bonded pool or any of the unbonding pools. The crucial fact is that in any of these pools, the ratio of point to balance is different and might not be 1. Each pool starts with a ratio of 1, but as time goes on, for reasons such as slashing, the ratio gets broken. Over time, 100 points in a bonded pool can be worth 90 DOT. Make sure you are either representing points as points (not as DOT), or even better, always display both: “You have x points in pool y which is worth z DOT”. See <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/6195ef41946017ec860d2d8ad58f9bc18b5797bf/frame/nomination-pools/src/lib.rs#L633">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/6195ef41946017ec860d2d8ad58f9bc18b5797bf/frame/nomination-pools/src/lib.rs#L624">here</a> for examples of how to calculate point to balance ratio of each pool (it is almost trivial ;))   Pool Management <p>The pool will be seen from the perspective of the rest of the system as a single nominator. Ergo, this nominator must always respect the `staking.minNominatorBond` limit. Similar to a normal nominator, who has to first `chill` before fully unbonding, the pool must also do the same. The pool’s bonded account will be fully unbonded only when the depositor wants to leave and dismantle the pool. All that said, the message is: the depositor can only leave the chain when they <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.chill">chill</a> the pool first.</p>

<p>In the future, thanks to a revolutionary set of technologies — built on the principles of fair access and decentralization — humanity will experience greater freedom and security than at any point in history. Each individual will enjoy self-sovereignty, and collaboration and creativity will be at an all-time high.</p>



<p>In 30 years, there will be fewer centralized gatekeepers to decide who can participate in society. There will be fewer king makers to determine who wins and who loses.</p>



<p>In this era — the Golden Age of freedom and self-expression — education and opportunity will be accessible to everyone, innovation will thrive, privacy will be normal and expected, and the people (and governments) of the world will agree that a vibrant society depends on respecting and upholding human dignity, security, and consent.</p>



<p>This is ECC’s vision for the future; and for our part, we will empower economic freedom for billions with a fair, open currency, accessible to every person on the Internet.</p>



 Zcash today 



<p>Today is Zcash’s birthday. Launched on Oct. 28, 2016, Zcash was the first project of any kind to successfully use zero-knowledge proofs. Earlier this year, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">implemented Halo</a> — a new and improved zero-knowledge proving system — to remove reliance on complex setup ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efficiencies built into this upgrade made possible — for the first time ever — private, trustless digital cash payments on mobile phones. Halo is now being tested in other projects for its privacy and scalability benefits; and in <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ethereum-zcash-filecoin-collab/">a partnership</a> with Protocol Labs, Filecoin Foundation, and Ethereum Foundation, ECC is collaborating with these teams to unlock recursion in Halo and explore how the technology might be used in the respective ecosystems. (Also, there’s <a href="https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/new-agreement-between-filecoin-foundation-and-electric-coin-co-63df066212b1">a multi-million-dollar pool</a> for developers and teams who are interested in adding utility for the Filecoin and Zcash chains.)</p>



<p>Next year, in 2023, ECC will release a fully-supported commercial mobile wallet in the iOS and Android app stores with the rationale that Zcash adoption will grow when (1) the user experience is excellent — easy and fast — and (2) users are given compelling features and capabilities that support a growing number of use cases. This is aligned with our North Star, a commitment to help build a world-class user experience for ZEC, the Zcash token.</p>



<p>In 2023, we’ll also make a formal recommendation to move Zcash from <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/should-zcash-switch-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/">proof of work to proof of stake</a>. This is ultimately a Zcash community decision, but we believe the benefits far outweigh the risks, and we are looking forward to the discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much more to be excited about, such as a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/long-term-sustainability-with-the-zcash-posterity-fund/">posterity fund proposal</a>, <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-proposal-for-shielded-assets-zsa-uda-for-defi-on-zcash/40520">ongoing third-party work</a> on Zcash shielded assets, a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra/">Rust-language Zcash node</a> being built by the Zcash Foundation, continuing decentralization and development funding with the recent formation and momentum of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> organization, and some impressive Zcash partnership announcements on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve only just begun.</p>



 ECC’s 30-year plan 



<p>Empowering billions of people around the world with economic freedom is a monumental task, and it will require many mission-aligned people and teams to commit to it. Starting with a 30-year goal in mind, ECC has worked backwards to conceive a path for our contribution toward achieving it. There are increasingly more strategies and contributions to Zcash from across the ecosystem, and we look forward to collaborating to realize our collective vision of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For obvious reasons, the roadmap is more detailed in the near future.</p>







 2052: Zcash for billions 



<p>In the year 2052, every person on the Internet will have the ability to obtain and use Zcash according to their own preferences. Economic freedom requires private digital cash that is equitable, available, permissionless, privacy protecting, and resilient; and we (not just ECC, but many Zcash community contributors) are laser-focused on building the absolute best solution. We’ve come a long way since 2016, but the technology will have to evolve, starting today, to scale to billions of users.</p>



<p>This, of course, is not the end goal. It’s a milestone. We envision Zcash as a critical component to economic freedom for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



 2032: Deliver a world-class UX for ZEC 



<p>Goal</p>



<p>ECC will have delivered a world-class user experience for ZEC (the Zcash token) — a fair and open currency within a framework that protects freedom, dignity, consent, and security.</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2032</p>



  Using ZEC across ECC and third-party applications is so easy users don’t have to think about it. It is at least as easy to use ZEC as it was to share photos and videos in 2022 world-class apps, such as Tik Tok or WhatsApp.  ZEC users: The number of actual human users — people who have purchased, sold, sent or received ZEC in the previous 24 months&nbsp; — is 1 billion across the globe.  Zcash is a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap.  Sentiment: Zcash users are likely to recommend Zcash to a friend or colleague. This is measured in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS). For Zcash, the NPS is ≥ 50 every year.  Decentralization: Because decentralization is important to user security, censorship-resistance, and project longevity, at least 10 long-term, viable organizations are now focused on Zcash.  



 2025: Proof of stake and interoperability 



<p>Three years from now, we will have delivered an ECC-built and -supported mobile wallet on top of an interoperable Zcash protocol that leverages a proof-of-stake consensus. Features in incremental wallet releases will be based on Zcash user feedback, industry feedback, and market research. The wallet will support core PoS and interop use cases.</p>



<p>Goal</p>



<p>Zcash will have transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. There will be strong support for Zcash interoperability and broad access to ZEC across DeFi and CeFi. At this point, we expect strong demand for Zcash/ZEC among the “early majority.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2025</p>



  ZEC users: The number of users has doubled from the previous 16-month period, and the ECC wallet is seeing 1 million monthly active users.  Zcash is a top-10 cryptocurrency by market cap.  Sentiment: The Zcash Net Promoter Score (NPS) is ≥ 50 every year.  Decentralization: At least five long-term, viable organizations are focused on Zcash.  



 Late 2023: UX foundations 



<p>By the close of 2023, the ECC mobile wallet will be available in the iOS and Android app stores&nbsp; with network-level privacy and instant sync — providing speed, convenience, and greater access. This is critical for a world-class UX for ZEC and lays the foundation for growing ZEC users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Goal</p>



<p>Deliver an open-source wallet that is available on Apple and Android stores and well supported by ECC; improve the ZEC UX including network privacy and instant sync; improve the Zcash tech stack (wallet, SDK, lightwalletd, protocol) sufficient to double users by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2023</p>



  Users: The number of users has doubled from the previous year.  Sentiment: The Zcash Net Promoter Score (NPS) has been ≥ 50 for the last 12 months.  Decentralization: At least four long-term, viable organizations are focused on Zcash.  



 The next four months: Establish new baseline 



<p>ECC’s No. 1 priority at the moment is updating the Zcash protocol and our wallet SDKs to help third-party providers fix wallet syncing issues. An increased on-chain transaction load has resulted in unacceptable sync times for many everyday users, and ecosystem partners are also affected. We are focused — across teams — on alleviating these issues as soon as possible, so Zcash users have an experience they expect and deserve. Our immediate objectives are centered on working with third-party wallets that are built on the ECC SDKs (Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable) to:</p>



  Ensure users can spend their funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet)  Ensure users can receive and spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in one hour  Implement updates which provide users clarity on syncing progress  Ensure none of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK  



<p>Other success criteria for this period</p>



  ECC teams agree on the definition or proxy for global ZEC user counts.  Research and engineering have defined and communicated a revised three-year roadmap inclusive of user growth objectives, proof of stake, and interoperability.  



 Prioritization and achieving objectives 



<p>To deliver on all this important work, ECC has laid out a process that mandates our leadership meets every four months to revisit strategy and roadmap, evaluating data for the current period and reviewing waypoints. Functional owners (for example Steven Smith in Engineering) will be responsible for functional roadmaps that are aligned with the strategic roadmap and for determining where they need cross-team support. Each success criteria will be owned by an assigned functional owner to track and determine how we (all of ECC) can align to best meet the objective.</p>



 Empowering economic freedom 



<p>“Zcash for billions” is a change-the-world vision. Maybe that’s cliché, but today, too many people are forced to use discriminatory, poorly managed, and insecure centralized entities to store and transfer money digitally. Too many people are forced to live within fiat systems that are managed by governments that don’t have their constituents’ best interests at heart. Most cryptocurrencies do not provide adequate privacy and security protections for most use cases, and they expose users to surveillance which can lead to exploitation, manipulation, and seizure.</p>



<p>Today, billions of people in the world do not have access to a fair and open currency or supporting financial services. We build and support Zcash to drive greater economic freedom and opportunity for everyone.</p>

<p>Academy will accelerate global education on privacy and action that can be taken to combat issues found on commonly-used communications tools.</p><p>Neuchâtel, Switzerland — Friday, 28 October 2022: Today, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, announced the launch of <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/academy">Shipyard Academy</a>, a privacy learning program for anyone who wants to play a role in transforming the internet from a massive vehicle of surveillance and control into a secure digital realm where privacy is the&nbsp;default.</p><p>Privacy is not baked into the core internet infrastructure and today, surveillance is the norm as individuals are subjected to unwanted targeting and manipulation. The purpose of Shipyard Academy is to accelerate the awareness and understanding of what individuals can do to preserve their privacy rights and take back control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Nym Chief Strategy Officer Jaya Brekke says, “Web3 was supposed to do things differently to the surveillance capitalism of Web2 by introducing new design principles and a different economics. But so many online communities in Web3 nevertheless use surveillance-prone platforms like Discord and Telegram. Shipyard Academy aims to reach people on those very community platforms and elsewhere and begin onboarding people to the world of privacy, Nym and our privacy allies across the&nbsp;stack.”</p><p>The six-week program will commence on 5 November 2022 and will cover topics including:</p>  How mass surveillance that happens at the network&nbsp;layer  How Nym solves this&nbsp;issue  The privacy problems with many of today’s most popular community apps  Full stack privacy awareness and why privacy is a core principle of&nbsp;Web3  <p>The program comprises three stages over six weeks, which are self-paced for learning. A learn-and-earn aspect will be set at the end of each stage through tasks and quizzes for participants to progress through to the next stage. A total prize pool of up to 100K NYM tokens will be distributed to top participants across three&nbsp;stages.</p><p>At the end of the program, participants will have the opportunity to apply to be a Nym ambassador, a “Nymja”, after being fully equipped to participate in and contribute to the Nym community and mission. Nymjas are champions of a future where privacy is the default. As a Nymja, successful participants will work closely with the Core team to develop Nym and the privacy agenda in their local contexts, earning a stake and partaking in the further decentralisation of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>The Academy is the first step for anyone new to Nym and the privacy space regardless of experience. Registrations to join are opened now until Friday, 4 November 17h00 CEST: <a href="https://bit.ly/nymsyform">https://bit.ly/nymsyform</a>.</p><p>- END&nbsp;-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.</p><p>Media Contact</p><p>Candice Teo, candice@nymtech.net</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-launches-shipyard-academy-to-onboard-privacy-and-offboard-surveillance-f7813afe5426">Press release: Nym launches Shipyard Academy to onboard privacy and offboard surveillance</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Tor Optimization for Better Coinjoins <p><br>It is, unfortunately, no surprise to anyone that the privacy network <a href="https://status.torproject.org/">Tor has been under Distributed Denial of Service attack</a> for the last few months, and as a result, has been suffering from severe latency and reliability issues in routing traffic. Many bitcoin projects, including Wasabi Wallet, depend on Tor as a mission-critical infrastructure to protect the privacy of their users. In light of the attack, this resulted in infrequent coinjoins for Wasabi Wallet users. As a countermeasure to address this reliability issue, the Wasabi client switched from connecting with the backend onion server to using Tor exit nodes and routing traffic to the clearnet domain of the coinjoin coordinator. All traffic is still anonymized to prevent the client from leaking its IP address to the coinjoin coordinator server and protect user privacy. After performing testing and scenario analysis, the Wasabi contributors realized it would vastly improve the reliability and frequency of coinjoin rounds, preventing inputs from being blocked by the coordinator. Inputs are usually blocked if they repeatedly fail to sign the coinjoin transaction, to protect against DDoS attacks on the coordinator itself. Users downloading the latest release should now expect much more reliable and frequent coinjoins, vastly improving their experience. As this doesn’t directly address the Tor hidden identity registry DDoS attack but routes around it, zkSNACKs is also extending its fundraising support to help the Tor team fund developers to work towards resolving this ongoing issue. &nbsp;</p><blockquote>Tor is a critically important project for privacy on bitcoin and the internet that millions of people rely upon on a daily basis. Wasabi Wallet is grateful that such a tool exists and will do as much as possible to support Tor by promoting it and helping with its fundraising. Tor reliability is directly impacting the user experience of Wasabi Wallet users, so we care about this issue a lot. ~ Max Hillebrand, Wasabi Contributor and CEO at zkSNACKs.</blockquote> A New Privacy Progress Feature <p><br>Privacy is often an abstract concept that is hard to relate to for most users. Making privacy more understandable by providing elegant visuals is taking one step closer to bringing privacy to millions of bitcoiners around the world.<br><br>On the home screen of the Wasabi desktop app, a privacy progress bar is now available, showing the size of each coin and their privacy levels within a colour scheme. Users now have a complete view of their wallet privacy with the existing wallet privacy score (that remains unchanged). The privacy bars can be expanded into a privacy ring viewed in a pop-up dialog, which provides additional information about each coin, its size and its privacy level. This gives optional insight into the wallet's status, allowing users to have a better understanding of how much privacy they’ve achieved at any given time.</p><blockquote>There is something satisfying with checklists and loading bars, especially when completed. It feels like progress is made and work gets done. While we believe privacy is a habit rather than a fixed goal, we hope that bringing privacy progress visuals will help more users take the leap and reclaim their privacy. ~ Max Hillebrand, Wasabi Contributor and CEO at zkSNACKs.</blockquote>

 Announcing Game of Chains — Open for Registration! ✨ Do you see the sun rising over Gaia in the background? ☀️<p>Dearest Cosmos Validators</p><p>The 3rd Public Incentivized Testnet in the history of Cosmos, following <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes">Game of Stakes</a> &amp; <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/goz">Game of Zones</a>, is open for <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">registration</a>! 🎉🎉🎉</p> Announcing — “Game of&nbsp;Chains”! <p>Game of Chains is an incentivized testnet program that will help validators develop confidence around <a href="https://informal.systems/2022/05/09/building-with-interchain-security/">Interchain Security</a> (ICS) and provide a public platform where this new technology can be thoroughly tested.</p><p>What is Interchain Security?</p><p>Interchain Security is a feature which will allow the Cosmos Hub to share security with other blockchains. On a technical level, this means that the Cosmos Hub validator set will gain the ability to validate other blockchains alongside the Cosmos Hub. These blockchains are called “consumer chains”, and will be secured by the Cosmos Hub’s billions of dollars of staked&nbsp;ATOMs.</p><p>In August, Informal Systems published<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v0.1"> v0.1 pre-release</a> of Interchain Security, which, at a high-level, is an implementation of the Interchain Security protocol that is set to go live in January 2023. This protocol implements: validator set change packets and confirmations; slashing packets; distribution packets; Cosmos-SDK modifications. You can check out the full specification<a href="https://www.notion.so/Interchain-Security-Testnet-cc65af3d57724c2bab52a04f3f3d3a7d"> here</a>.</p><p>For this testnet, we will work together to test out features of the protocol that validators will be running! Further, validators will have an opportunity to test “real world” consumer chain software that will be adopting Interchain Security in 2023! These projects include: <a href="https://linktr.ee/neutron.org">Neutron</a>, Duality and&nbsp;Stride!</p><p>20 000 ATOMs will go to Game of Chains&nbsp;winners!</p><p>Cosmos Hub validators will compete for rewards throughout this public testnet which is funded by the community pool via <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/77">Prop 77</a>! Thank you to the entire Cosmos community for supporting this initiative. ✨</p><p>Rewards will be distributed to winning validators based on a points system (more details to come!). These rewards will be allocated to validators that complete certain tasks, and submit an entry for Testnet&nbsp;awards.</p><p>👉Please note that only active Cosmos Hub validators are eligible for rewards! Further, if you win, your validator will be required to provide KYC information in order to receive ATOM&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>What are the next&nbsp;steps?</p><p>First, any interested validator needs tosign up to participate in Game of Chains! <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022</a></p><p>To start coordinating your participation in Game of Chains, you will be added to the Cosmos Network discord channel with the information provided in the registration form. Make sure you are in the discord <a href="https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork">here</a>. Channel: #game-of-chains</p><p>Game of Chains is scheduled to launch on November 7, 2022. The testnet will run for 2–4&nbsp;weeks!</p> Good luck Cosmos validators, and let’s make Interchain Security secure!&nbsp;💪  <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-game-of-chains-open-for-registration-d1818662de8e">Announcing Game of Chains — Open for Registration! ✨</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         Elena Nadolinski: Privacy for the People                <p>By Nicole Zakheim</p><p>Photography: CAYCE CLIFFFORD</p><p>Published October 27, 2022</p>            <p>Driven by a passion for computers and community, a cryptocurrency founder creates a solution for all.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>One night in 2017, Iron Fish founder Elena Nadolinski attended a birthday party at the Palo Alto home of Protocol Labs founder and CEO Juan Benet. Her then-boyfriend, now-husband and Figma co-founder, Dylan Field, had been roommates with Benet, and they were part of a close group of friends. The party was filled with talk about cryptocurrency generally, and Ethereum specifically. Benet’s company had started Filecoin, a cryptocurrency-operated file storage network, and he was about to roll out the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage and file referencing system that can operate on Ethereum.</p>



<p>Something about the conversation struck her as particularly urgent—all these “incredibly brilliant people, being all very excited about this piece of technology”—cryptocurrency, but it was still too complicated for most people to widely adopt it. It required hours of setup, some technical knowhow and access to powerful computers. To Nadolinski, who had had immigrated to America from Russia when she was 8, it seemed like two ideas in opposition: cryptocurrency promised to be a currency for the people, by the people, but it was still limited to those with the resources and ability to immerse themselves in technology to participate. What about the rest of the world? On the way home, Nadolinski sat shotgun, phone in hand, scrolling down an internet wormhole as Field drove across the dark city.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadolinski had been recognized as a teen by the White House as an up-and-coming computer science superstar, interned at Microsoft and had been recruited as an engineer by the buzzy startup Tilt, and then worked at Airbnb, but she admits that by the time of this party, she didn’t really get the technology that powers the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency. “It’s inaccessible for even a smart, technically savvy person,” she says. She Googled: “What is Ethereum?” and flicked through the results. When she remembers this moment now, she laughs at herself trying to get to the bottom of a set of wildly complex questions while driving home from a party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ethereum is this world computer, right? So, okay, that’s a really big phrase. What does that mean? Ethereum does distributed computations. Again, what is that? That seems confusing. And so the first kind of use case that I read about it was something to do with decentralized voting. How do you make voting more fair? And I thought, okay, that’s interesting, but that doesn’t seem like such a breakthrough. And so I kept kind of digging and digging and digging into it. And the first use case that actually made the most sense to me was non-fungible tokens.” She saw the non-fungible tokens, or NFTs—digital files whose proof of ownership can be stored on the blockchain, so a person can show they own the “original”—as a compelling use of the blockchain because they introduced scarcity to something that was previously considered endlessly replicable. Within several months, Nadolinski went from thinking about scarcity to charting a path to a more accessible cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>This is how Nadolinski, now 30, talks—moving from one massive idea to the next, toggling between tech lingo and business jargon in a rapid conversation style that makes concepts like “world computer” or “non-fungible token” easier to understand. After her Ethereum-Google in 2017, Nadolinski researched cryptocurrency ecosystems, reading white papers and speaking with founders, protocol developers and engineers. As a curious computer scientist, she was drawn to the complexity. But as a person, she was drawn to cryptocurrency’s close-knit community and its members’ enthusiasm for its possibilities. She started attending hackathons and meetups, asking questions, offering solutions, making friends and contributing in such a meaningful way that she started receiving invitations to present. Soon, she stepped away from her job at Airbnb to pursue cryptocurrency full-time.</p>



<p>Today, Nadolinski and her team are close to launching Iron Fish as a layer 1 blockchain to support a new cryptocurrency as well as a privacy layer for other existing cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are the least private way of transacting; the transparency of crypto transactions is the pillar of trustless verification. It means anyone could track an individual’s crypto transactions in real time using data-mining techniques. Since crypto digital wallets have unique addresses, their transactions can be traced by cross-referencing with personal data. And even while some cryptocurrencies are private, and others can be made private, the processes are cumbersome, confusing and still may be vulnerable to deanonymization. All transactions on Iron Fish are encrypted, protecting the user by hiding transaction information through a cryptographic technique called zero-knowledge proofs. Eventually, as Iron Fish becomes more mature and integrates with more existing blockchains, any cryptocurrency transaction can be made private in a compliant way. This means that, some day, users could have all the advantages of any cryptocurrency without the privacy issues that currently plague it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The name Iron Fish alludes to the protective power of cryptography. During World War II, the United States used codes to communicate with allies that were based on Native American languages, spoken by Native American enlisted men called Code Talkers. The code, never broken, was declassified in 1968. Nadolinski chose the word Iron Fish, meaning submarine—“besh-lo” in the code derived from the Diné (also known as Navajo)&nbsp; language—because the idea of a submarine was strong, protective and something secret, or in this case, private.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Issuing currency is a primary function of modern governments, which enact policies to keep it stable so a nation’s economy can function. Cryptocurrency can be a way to hedge against the inflation or deflation that comes with traditional currencies. “For people in the United States, it’s like, well, ‘I think maybe it’s nice in a moral, philosophical way for me to hedge my bet in terms of which currency I keep my wealth in,’” Nadolinski says, “but for other people in Venezuela, Turkey, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, all those countries are experiencing inflation … if they could have a way out …” Beyond that practical application, Nadolinski’s company is part of a rapidly growing cohort of encryption and privacy tools—messaging, browsers and VPNs—designed to protect users from the threat of data scraping, surveillance and hacking. “Freedom is synonymous in many ways with privacy,” Nadolinski says. “So even though Americans have forgotten how good they have it, there are so many arguments for them to still care about private cryptocurrencies.” Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire understood the promise of Iron Fish the moment he heard about it, and Sequoia invested in November 2021. With a deep technical background, Maguire had heard about the promise of blockchain technologies since at least 2007. So when he met Nadolinski more than a decade later, he was intrigued by her vision for realizing blockchains’ potential for usability and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maguire imagines a scenario where Iron Fish would be even more necessary—a hypothetical future in which cryptocurrencies are used for everyday transactions, in which it would be possible for scammers to see people’s anonymous-but-public transactions and trace them back to a wallet and know where that person is, what they’re doing, and even what they’re planning to do. “Imagine you’re buying an airline ticket to fly from L.A. to Europe,” Maguire says. “So someone can guess you’re going to be out of town for the next week and they can go rob your house.” Nadolinski also tells a story about speaking to a good friend who said they wanted a private cryptocurrency to spend at Burger King, because they didn’t want their health insurance provider to know about their diet habits and raise their rates. This is only partially hypothetical. At the moment, cryptocurrencies cannot be spent at Burger King, but can be spent at McDonald’s, and retailers like Amazon, Overstock, Microsoft and AT&amp;T, among others.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Nadolinski and her parents immigrated to America when she was in elementary school. They lived in several places but eventually settled in Virginia. She spoke little English and her parents held her back a year so she’d be in the same grade as another student who spoke Russian and English. This was a disaster; Nadolinski remembers her as a bully who intentionally mistranslated things. So Nadolinski pushed herself to learn English rapidly at school, and as she grew up, she found a cohort of “supersmart, badass” girlfriends who “all wanted to change the status quo.” Her parents worked as software engineers, and she’d page through their books at home. In high school, she took her school’s AP computer science class and taught herself everything else she’d need to know to become vice president of the computer science club and president of its robotics club. She loved her teammates, the kind of kids who liked to tinker and code, and who, she jokes self-awarely, “liked to stay after school for hours to make sure that the robot goes straight.” The robots went straight enough that the team earned a second-place finish at a global competition. She <a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/virginia_tech/article_aa071111-6125-55fd-9520-bd05d14d20b2.html">was honored</a> at the White House with the Aspirations in Computing Award from the National Center for Women in Information Technology, and the Central Intelligence Agency gave her an award, recognizing a program she designed to compress images. The irony doesn’t escape her today, pointing out that image compression is related to encryption, which the CIA knows something about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadolinski first heard about cryptocurrency in 2011. During a fundraising brainstorm for the robotics team, a teammate suggested they use the school’s computer lab to mine Bitcoin. The currency was still new, and worth between $1-$30 each. Nadolinski shut the idea down, saying, “That’s silly. It’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH5-rSxilxo">never going to work</a>.” And just as her opinion of cryptocurrency from 2011 has evolved, the rest of the world is catching up. Larry David starred in a 2022 Super Bowl commercial, playing a character who scoffs at the wheel, ridicules the light bulb and mocks the indoor toilet. The commercial was for FTX, a notably accessible cryptocurrency exchange. Today Nadolinski laughs, ruefully describing how if she’d been game for the idea, the team would, in all likelihood, be perpetually endowed. As of this writing Bitcoin trades at about $20,000, and has been as high as $68,000.</p>



<p>After graduating high school, Nadolinski studied computer science at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. During the school year, she interned at the cloud computing services company Rackspace for engineer Dave King, who is still a mentor and friend. For up to 10 hours a week, she tackled a backlog/wishlist of “tiny tickets,” but King remembers one of Nadolinski’s projects that was “not that tiny.” He says she handled the moment gracefully when managers suddenly realized that some code she’d been updating impacted several other pieces. “We thought it was scoped, and it was clearly not scoped,” he says with a chuckle. It launched Nadolinski into a nine month project, “She was in rooms seeing how implementation might happen and seeing how to make the decision,” King says. “I think Elena was quite fastidious in attention to detail … which is something that brought her success. She was good in collaborative situations, as the intern, understanding how people made things work and fixed things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>King says great engineers are distinguished by their ability to figure out ways to get around problems, something he saw in Nadolinski immediately. “Like, there are five little hurdles. Which ones are the ones we invest in to fix? And which ones do we just let go? Knowing how to manage your time, making choices for today and the future. Some people are like, ‘We have to fix everything all the time.’ And that is not as productive.” Nadolinski spent summers interning for Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, and after graduating in 2015, she took a full-time job there. Nadolinski realized she loved collaborative building but hated bureaucracy. After a year, she moved to San Francisco to immerse herself in the more collaborative startup world. She got a job working again for King, this time at the new crowdfunding company Tilt, but it was acquired by Airbnb about seven months after she started. “She was asking me about the user acquisition strategy,” says King, remembering Nadolinski as being particularly savvy about business even as she was working on the engineering side. “Tilt went international to grow our customer base, and signups were very high, but you can only go into so many new markets,” he continues. “And we had a conversation like, ‘Is this really going to work?’ And she didn’t get the answers she really wanted … and when we took the acquisition, I was like, ‘Oh, Elena figured this out six or seven months ago.’ She had a healthy skepticism about the information she was getting, and really getting into the details of things to understand what was going on.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now at Airbnb, several months after the Ethereum epiphany at the birthday party, she attended EthWaterloo, a 36-hour Ethereum hackathon in the Canadian computer science hub of Waterloo, Ontario, which attracted hundreds in October 2017. There, she worked on the problem of how to enable decentralized video streaming on the IPFS. She talks about how problem solving in one area unlocked insights in other areas: “And that got me to ask, ‘What is decentralized computing,’ and ‘How do you prove an honest computation?’” That thinking led her to zero-knowledge proofs, which use cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without exposing user data, which is now a big part of how Iron Fish works. But it was more than the thinking and problem solving that made EthWaterloo a turning point for Nadolinski. She tells a story about how at 3:30 a.m., Dan Finley, the man who wrote MetaMask, a cryptocurrency wallet for Ethereum, helped her debug her own MetaMask integration. “And that was a very special feeling. It was like, ‘Wow. This community is so welcoming and so encouraging and is so available to help.’ And so, from that hackathon in particular, it’s like, ‘Wow, I want to be part of this.’” She went on to attend and present at more hackathons, giving talks while live-coding non-fungible smart contracts onstage in about 30 minutes. She says she wanted to encourage more people to experiment with Ethereum, to see this emerging technology as approachable. And it started to work. Focused on being relentlessly pragmatic and approachable as opposed to theoretical, Nadolinski became an in-demand speaker and collaborator. When she gave a talk called “Demystifying Zero-Knowledge Proofs” in 2018 at Devcon IV in Prague, tracing the history of cryptography through to its involvement in cryptocurrency today, people reached out on Twitter and Telegram, thanking her for making such a complex topic so understandable and asking how they could start learning more themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that talk, she was invited to speak at EthBuenosAires in 2018, the first event of its kind in Latin America. At the same time, Airbnb wanted her to go to Barcelona for a user-research study, a rare, exciting opportunity. She was torn. She was constantly learning from her colleagues at Airbnb, and appreciated the company’s focus on aesthetics, but she’d already booked the trip to Argentina. “That was the turning point of, like, ‘Okay, I feel like I have two jobs, and I’m sucking at both of them, and I need to choose one,’” she remembers. “And I obviously chose crypto.”</p>



<p>“So, I was looking into NFTs already,” she continues. “I was looking into zero-knowledge proofs, and I worked backward. I said, ‘Okay, let’s just assume that in whatever time horizon, crypto payments are going to be ubiquitous, whatever that means. What do we need to get there?’” Privacy seemed like the obvious answer. She explains that today’s levels of transparency are unsafe for users, as in Maguire’s hypothetical plane ticket-buying scenario, but also unsafe for nations. “Everything that you do on any kind of most known blockchains is fully transparent to the world,” she says. “If you use Ethereum or Bitcoin today, your wallet information is available to anyone in the world to see what exchanges you use, what items you have, what protocols or smart contracts you’ve ever interacted with.”</p>



<p>By 2018, ZCash rolled out an open-source protocol called Sapling to try to solve for privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. All forms of currency, whether cash, credit or digital, face the challenge of making a transaction private enough so people feel free to use it in everyday life, while enabling regulators to ensure all transactions are legal. And this balance makes cryptocurrency innovation especially tricky. But this was Nadolinski’s passion, and, after raising funding in 2021 to start hiring a team, it would become her business model: users would move their cryptocurrencies to Iron Fish’s blockchain, which would cloak their assets by anonymizing and encrypting their data, and the miners who add to the blockchain would receive a fee paid in the Iron Fish token, $IRON. This incentivizes use of $IRON for everyone who wants to move their currency to the Iron Fish blockchain. The cryptocurrency community is still figuring out a balance between privacy and minimizing crime committed with cryptocurrency. A crypto wallet typically has a private key, which is analogous to a password, to allow the user to spend their funds, and a public key, to allow the user to request funds. Most privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, including Iron Fish, also support view keys, in addition to private and public keys, at the wallet level. Initially, only the creator of the wallet has access to that wallet’s private, public and view key. The holder of a view key can see all associated transactions with that wallet, even in a fully private system. This allows regulated entities, like exchanges, to be compliant and provide audits. Nadolinski says her team is also working on adding controls on how a cryptocurrency can move in and out of the Iron Fish layer, a kind of monitoring capacity on the bridges between blockchains to limit hackers from taking advantage of the Iron Fish privacy platform. Nadolinski explains, “Crypto can’t go forward without privacy. But the future is going to be privacy-with-compliance. That’s what we are working on at Iron Fish.”</p>



<p>Nadolinski is also working to make Iron Fish especially user-friendly. The Iron Fish core team has a mantra to make Iron Fish “the Apple of blockchains”—inuitive, easy to use and something that works right out of the box. “And it’s actually very difficult to make it work out of the box, because it’s really complicated tech, but we’re trying our best,” Nadolinski says with a self-aware laugh. To get there, she and her team consistently survey early users for feedback about the blockchain implementation and the wallet. And she’s been inspired by Airbnb’s use of design, she says, to make an otherwise unusual experience—“You go into someone else’s house and you sleep on their bed,” or using cryptocurrency—cool. She points to how several private currencies feature black websites, with code-style text or pirate motifs, aesthetics that speak to secrecy, but which are not universally appealing. Her site has inviting language and features bright colors and sea creatures rendered in a woodblock aesthetic. One fish wears sunglasses. But her biggest point of user-design pride is the installation process. Instead of a typical cryptocurrency setup, a multi-step ordeal that can take up to three hours, anyone can run an Iron Fish node using just one command line in the terminal.</p>

<p>In May, Nadolinski launched Iron Fish’s second incentivized testnet, a standard way to ensure a new blockchain is stable and bug-free, in which a working version of the blockchain is used by a limited cohort who spot problems in the code and try to stress-test the system. Phase two is wrapping and Phase 3 will launch in the first quarter of 2023, aiming for a mainnet launch in the third quarter. Participants earn $IRON tokens in exchange for certain kinds of participation. At its peak so far, the second testnet has hosted 11,000 concurrent nodes. Bitcoin, the most-used cryptocurrency, for comparison, typically hosts about 15,000 concurrent nodes. “I think that is a testament to how easy it is to run Iron Fish,” says Nadolinski.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This testnet is the last one before the team pushes the blockchain live. Stakes are high. This phase is so critical because, unlike traditional software that can be updated to fix bugs or add features, big changes can break the blockchains themselves. “These testing phases are very stressful because it’s like, if you miss one thing in mainnet, you’re really screwed,” says Maguire. While small updates can be rolled out without breaking the chain, to make a big update, a coordinated effort has to occur in the community of exchanges, miners and users to accept the change, a difficult proposition for a technology spread across a global community. Maguire observes that big code changes where the currency survived the disruption have only happened a handful of times, notably with Ethereum and Bitcoin. “These things were catastrophically painful conversations in these communities and took years to settle,” Maguire says. “So once you ship crypto code, it’s basically final.” And bad code can be a disaster. Estimates of how much cryptocurrencies hackers are stealing vary widely, but the numbers are notable. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze">Federal Trade Commission reports</a> that Americans lost $1 billion in 2021, but the FTC acknowledges that its reports represent a fraction of the likely total. The blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which doesn’t guarantee its data, estimates that <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html?">$14 billion worth of cryptocurrencies has been stolen because of weaknesses in code</a>.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Nadolinski says the Iron Fish testnet is now processing more zero-knowledge proof transactions than any other chain. But she is balancing development and optimization with the pressure to launch. Iron Fish’s value depends on getting people to want to use it, and testnets create the kind of buzz that leads to adoption. Maguire speaks to the pressure from the community: “They’re like, ‘We’re desperate. Get this thing out. We want to use Iron Fish in production.’” Nadolinski is sensitive to that sense of urgency. After all, she’s doing all this because of the cryptocurrency community, which she got introduced to through her husband, Field. “He is one of the most connected people I’ve ever met,” she says. When she was at Microsoft, Tilt started recruiting her, so she Googled its co-founders, James Beshara and Khaled Hussein. She spotted Beshara in the 2015 Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list for Consumer Tech. Also in that year’s cohort was Field, pictured with a tremendous grin, one that makes him stand out on the page, still searchable today. “And I scrolled past this face, and it was like, ‘Wow. This person’s my age, was an intern at Microsoft, started a company, raised $3 million.’ I was like, ‘Whoa. I thought I had to have years of experience to do this. And here’s a person who just did it.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, she accepted the job at Tilt, moved to San Francisco, broke up with her boyfriend and gave in to her friends’ prodding to join a dating app. One day, she chose OKCupid and started scrolling. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, where did I move?’ There was that phrase: the odds are good, but the goods are odd. Yeah. And I kept scrolling and scrolling and scrolling, and getting kind of depressed. Then I see a face, and I thought, ‘Whoa, I recognize that face.’”</p>



<p>She says she assumed Field was out of her league, but she wanted to start her own company and hoped he’d agree to meet to talk shop. He was the first and only person she messaged, asking him either to coffee or lunch, and dropping in a link to her LinkedIn profile. Field responded enthusiastically, but said that the LinkedIn link was a first for him on the dating site. Nadolinski laughs telling the story now: “I was privacy-conscious and my OKCupid account had almost no information. It had a picture, but you couldn’t tell it was me.” She’d posted only one image, a picture taken from far away. In it, she wears glasses, which she typically doesn’t. “It had my age and my height, because I thought that was important. I’m very short. And my Facebook wasn’t publicly accessible. So I wanted to show him that I’m a real person. The only way I thought of doing that was my LinkedIn profile. It was a very logical decision.”</p>



<p>He replied that lunches were hard, but he could do dinner. It’s not lost on Nadolinski that she had to design her own privacy-protecting solution for interacting authentically on a dating app. They’ve been together ever since. When Nadolinski talks about founding Iron Fish, she focuses on how the tech community, and the cryptocurrency community specifically, rewarded her curiosity and generosity with help and encouragement. Her appreciation for how that community has been uniquely accessible in spirit, even if not in technology, is what she’s built Iron Fish around. Now she’s poised to make the community she loves so much even larger, sharing it through greater accessibility—with most anyone with a computer, or two, and internet access. “A lot of people around the world are excited about blockchain. They’re excited to participate in a new layer 1 project,” Nadolinski says. And with her focus on pragmatic solutions and that user-friendliness, she’s excited to help them as a member of a community that has helped her so many times.&nbsp;</p>

This creates large honeypots of personal information in corporate data centres and creates a huge attack vector for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Despite these challenges, we’re at a sliding-door moment in history. New technologies for the safe storage and sharing of personal data now exist. This is important as data growth on the internet isn’t slowing down. <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/big-data-statistics/#gref">In 2020, every person generated 1.7 megabytes per second</a>. Yet US <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-customer-centric-approach-to-marketing-in-a-privacy-first-world">Mckinsey research</a> suggests only around 33% of people believe companies are using their personal data responsibly.</p><p>With data hacks and leaks on the increase, it raises questions about the fundamental design decisions for securing personal data. Can alternate models that put the user first really offer stronger protections for individuals? I believe&nbsp;so.</p><p>Web3 aims to protect personal information as digital property rights through users owning and controlling their data. By putting data back in the originator’s hands it means there are fewer large repositories of data controlled by companies that can be hacked and leaked. By not having to hold that personal data, companies can also reduce their risk exposure.</p> Notable hacks and broken&nbsp;trust <p>The frightening list of hacks of personal data is <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">long</a>. Here are some of the largest leaks in recent&nbsp;years:</p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">533,000,000 users from 106 countries</a> had their phone numbers, full names, locations, birthday and in some cases emails leaked. This data is from a vulnerability that was patched in 2019 but the data was released publicly in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Microsoft: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/01/22/microsoft-security-shocker-as-250-million-customer-records-exposed-online/?sh=79a44d374d1b">250,000,000 users</a> worth of customer service and support logs spanning 14 years were found to be accessible through unprotected servers with public access. Containing IP addresses, emails, geographic locations, confidential case notes and case&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/linkedin-breach/">700,000,000 users’</a> phone numbers, physical addresses, geolocation data and inferred salaries were stolen in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>In the first half of 2022, Flashpoint <a href="https://flashpoint.io/resources/report/state-of-data-breach-intelligence-2022-midyear/">reported 1,980 data breaches</a>, 60% the result of hacking. And these are only the reported breaches. Common data leaks reveal email addresses, names, addresses, credit card numbers, health and financial information.</p>Source: <a href="https://flashpoint.io/resources/report/state-of-data-breach-intelligence-2022-midyear/">Flashpoint</a> (2022)<p>These are public companies with vast resources that can hire the best and brightest minds in security. It’s commonplace to store passwords as hashes for security but the rest of your data is plain text. So, why is the rest of user personal data, like phone numbers and postal addresses, stored less securely?</p><p><a href="https://www.lepide.com/research/2020-state-of-data-security-report.pdf">Lepide found in their 2020</a> global survey that 57% of companies have two or more open data shares and 77% have over 5,000 ‘stale’ sensitive files. Businesses struggle to know where their data resides, why it has been collected, who has access to it and how it is actually being used. Additional copies of data increases a company’s attack exposure, creating more data sources that can be exploited by&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Why does personal user data have to exist in duplicate across different companies in centralised databases? Uploading your drivers licence to a company to be verified in exchange for services is an example of&nbsp;this.</p><p>We are “duplicating” our personal data for each of these companies. The duplication of these personal identifiers increases our individual risk if there’s a future leak. This is particularly a concern when we repeatedly see company failure to keep data safe, time and time again. These databases shouldn’t exist in the first place. Instead an individual should control their own data in their own database.</p><p>End-to-end encryption and personal data ownership and control can change&nbsp;this.</p><p>Individuals can own their personal information and share it “on demand” with companies who can verify, then delete, eliminating the huge systematic security risks created by current regulatory requirements.</p> No one cares about privacy until they need&nbsp;it <p>Before the internet, it was commonplace for people to print births, deaths and marriages in the paper. As old newspapers get digitised, it becomes possible for scammers to search for ‘your mothers maiden name’ and birthday. This is an example of an unintended consequence. It was impossible to predict the impact of printing a birth in the newspaper before the digital&nbsp;era.</p><p>Scientist, Carl Sagan, captured this sentiment:</p><p>“It was easy to predict mass car ownership but hard to predict Walmart.”</p><p>In much the same way, it’s impossible to predict the long-term consequences of troves of stolen personal data. It’s not a far stretch to imagine the worst-case scenarios as governments seek to streamline processes.</p><p>Take personal health data, for example. With a large enough pool of stolen health data, it would be possible to build risk assessment models with it. These models with their opaque algorithms are licensed by health insurers to deny cover to your childrens’ children because of risk factors in your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data security isn’t just an issue&nbsp;now.</p> Zero-party data management is a step&nbsp;forward <p>Many companies are shifting from legacy data collection methods through the use of third-party cookies and data acquisition with data brokers and assessing alternative options. This is being hastened by the <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/blog-list/2020/what-the-end-of-third-party-cookies-means-for-advertisers.html">phasing out of third-party cookies</a> which will affect brands and advertisers. Third-party cookies are now being blocked by default in web browsers. <a href="https://thecustomer.net/forrester-on-the-the-zero-party-data-revolution/">21% of users</a> in the US are searching with cookie-blocking add-ons to prevent cross-site tracking.</p><p>Users are waking up to being ‘the&nbsp;product’</p><p>This shift is prompting most companies to uplift their first-party data approaches. That is data collected directly from user in-app and website behaviours and not shared elsewhere. This data is still generally captured as a requirement for interacting with the&nbsp;company.</p><p>An approach that honours the user is adopting zero-party data strategies. Zero-party data is shared intentionally by a user with a company. Intentionally being the operative word. This could be their purchase preferences, likes or other personal data that they’re comfortable having the company recognise them by. This data can play a valuable role for companies in personalising its experience for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Zero-party data is the user consenting what they wish to share about themselves. It establishes a stronger trust relationship between the company and user, through transparency and data minimisation around value exchange. Zero-party data is higher quality data, compared to other forms of data, as it comes straight from the&nbsp;user.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.groupfio.com/getting-by-without-cookies-why-zero-party-data-is-the-future-for-digital-marketing/">FiO</a><p>Whilst zero-party data establishes principles for a stronger consent model for sharing personal information, that data still is typically stored with the company it’s shared&nbsp;with.</p><p>This brings us back to the problem and the solution — how data is stored. Web3 data models and personal data vaults truly give users privacy-preserving tools with strong consent workflows for how this information is shared and engaged&nbsp;with.</p> So, how do we achieve&nbsp;this? <p>If the top companies we interact with everyday are getting hacked, what does this mean for the rest of us? What’s the solution?</p><p>Shift data ownership and control to the user and encrypt&nbsp;it.</p><p>Encrypting personal data when it’s not in use makes it harder for hackers to get access to the human readable data. So the question then becomes, where should the encryption occur?</p><p>If the encryption happens on the server then the UX for the user is simple. The trade off is there’s no way for the user to know that it’s actually happening. It’s kind of like buying a car from a used car salesman who says: “Trust me, this is a great car. Just take my word for it. There’s no need for a vehicle inspection, it’s a total waste of money.” Would you just take them at their word? Or would you feel better if those claims could be verified? You’d need more than a stranger’s word.</p><p>If the encryption is done on the user’s device, the individual has control over their keys and can verify that their data is being encrypted. However, this means that the user is responsible for their key management. If they don’t take this seriously or fully understand it, they can get locked out of their accounts with no way to reset&nbsp;access.</p><p>End-to-end encryption enables private and secure data sharing for all. This is a key capability that should be built into data communications to ensure user privacy. Data is encrypted from sender to recipient, remains encrypted during transit and cannot be decrypted by anyone but the intended recipient. We’ve seen Zoom and Whatsapp recently implement this in their&nbsp;apps.</p><p>It’s possible for users to own their personal data, store it in a secured encrypted decentralised database network and consent to share it when seen appropriate.</p><p>This is a core primitive for Web3 that Verida has brought to market for user-controlled data storage solutions.</p> Secure data web3 storage for personal&nbsp;data <p>One of the challenges in today’s digital ecosystem is the lack of secure private data storage for user-owned personal data. This is one very critical component for data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>File storage networks in web3 are a growing sector. The top four protocols have a combined market cap of $2.4 billion (Filecoin, Arweave, Storj &amp; Sia) as of Oct 24th 2022. They remain unsuitable for the most sensitive personal information, which is generally structured in databases, as they are open public storage networks most suitable for blob storage like media, audio and video. By design they are not able to provide compliance required by regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, and&nbsp;CCPA.</p><p>There have been attempts to store encrypted data on these protocols, but the encrypted data still remains public. It’s susceptible to (and highly likely) that improvements in technology will be capable of breaking the encryption, making everyone’s private information public for the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>“Encrypted Data Vaults” are an emergent storage solution that help preserve data privacy and ensure trusted data access. They provide users with access to data storage they control with their own private keys, similarly to how users control private keys to access their crypto tokens. They can be managed by a user through a self-custody digital wallet and available in web browsers and on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p>Source: <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/concepts/data-storage">Verida Self-Sovereign Data Storage</a>&nbsp;(2021)<p>At Verida, we’ve implemented encrypted data vaults that store data on Verida<a href="https://github.com/verida/documentation/blob/feature/where-to-store-web3-data/docs/network/storage-node"> storage nodes</a>, which is open source software and can be self-hosted. The nodes provide end-to-end encrypted database storage. This means that the operator of the data node cannot read the data stored in the node they’re running. This data is synchronised in real-time with the Verida Vault for easy interaction with applications.</p><p>Access to the data on the storage nodes are protected with authentication and authorisation protocols that ensure access is tightly controlled, unlike existing public storage protocols. Users can move their data to different, private nodes, at any time. Data can be guaranteed to be stored in a particular country or region, to ensure compliance with “cross-border” data regulatory requirements common in most countries.</p><p>Users can choose what personal information they share with companies and revoke that access at any time. This brings forward a future web where users can safely control personal data, without duplication. It’s a&nbsp;win-win.</p> Managing personal data needs to be&nbsp;easy <p>MetaMask is one of the most popular crypto wallets. It had 545,000 monthly active users in July 2020, hit <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metamask-users-defi-ethereum-decentralized-finance-consensys-crypto-2021-8">over 10M by August 2021</a> and was <a href="https://decrypt.co/86263/ethereum-wallet-metamask-reports-21-million-users">21M by November 2021</a>. Usage of crypto wallets is growing, their ease of use is improving. A growing number of people are taking control of crypto assets and becoming familiar with this new technology. We see this same trend extending beyond crypto to personal data,&nbsp;too.</p><p>In the future users will have a digital wallet on their phone, only accessible to them. This digital wallet holds and protects their private encrypted data. The user can grant outside access on an “as needs” basis, for trusted service providers to deliver personalized offerings. This enables end-to-end encrypted zero-party data sharing between users and companies.</p><p>Once given access, third parties can validate data, provide a digitally signed verification certificate, then delete it. This verification certificate can be shared with companies so a user no longer has to provide the actual data to any company to access the&nbsp;service.</p>Verida Vault: Data and Credentials<p>All personal data is portable and doesn’t have to be duplicated. Our digital wallets will become the home interface for our data, that is owned and managed by the user. This is what Verida is building with the <a href="https://www.verida.io/vault">Verida Vault</a> mobile application.</p> Building a safer future for personal&nbsp;data <p>Web3 brings a fundamental change to the ownership and control of user data. Sensitive personal data doesn’t have to stay concentrated in closed platforms and duplicated across different company databases where it’s at risk of security breaches.</p><p>User-owned data can be shared cryptographically with companies and applications when needed. New open data markets and associated business models can also form based around user consent and zero-party data.</p>Digital wallets are key to personal data&nbsp;control<p>Challenges with implementing these new web3 data models do exist. The problem of personal data duplication across corporate databases is partly driven by regulatory requirements to store and retain data. But regulation and data architectures are shifting. We are seeing innovation occurring <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/finnish-consortium-pilot-eidas-compliant-self-sovereign-identity-network-409161/">particularly in Europe</a> that are user-centric initiatives giving control of data back to&nbsp;users.</p><p>The unbundling of data ownership from applications in Web3 shifts personal data control from companies to individuals. This ultimately can reduce data security risks for companies, as they don’t need to store the data themselves.</p><p>Verida is building open source technologies that makes implementing data encryption and personal data storage solutions easier. The Verida open source libraries have a package for managing the user’s keys. Verida simplifies the process for developers to implement good encryption practices. Verida has built the Verida Vault to handle the key management for users in the Verida&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Verida is working closely with partners for ecosystem growth, health, and success.

<p>Ron Conway, a well-known American venture capitalist, once said ‘I think for technology and innovation we have to ignore politics.’</p>



<p>Technology is a clear driver for ingenuity and innovation. Politics, on the other hand, is where intrigue, personal agendas, and the pursuit of power by any means necessary conflate to create a turbulent sea of neverending strife. When the two cross over, results are not always good.</p>



<p>Technology has often been implicated in political scandals. In 1971, a Xerox machine became ground zero for the Pentagon Papers affair that would have grave repercussions for the Nixon Administration. (The scandal would, indirectly, contribute to Nixon’s resignation following Watergate.) In Russia, political technology is a euphemism for election rigging. And the 2016 US election was marred by allegations of foreign interference through social media platforms.</p>



<p>Besides, technological devices have also had a positive influence on politics. Data analytics enables political strategists to obtain more accurate information about voter behaviour. Through this, they can mount more effective political campaigns, for example.</p>



<p>Into the political stage now jump non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. This article explores the potential applications of digital tokens in the political ecosphere, focusing on fundraising and exclusive NFT-led events.</p>



 Fundraising in the age of blockchain 



<p>Fundraising is a vital tool for any political party intending to become a serious contender in any democratic election. But the political spectrum is, few would deny, a murky pond teeming with shady operatives. Such often resort to morally questionable tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponents. And running deep beneath this darkened surface is a layer of political donors and lobbyists who stake absurd amounts of wealth to push their agenda forward. The so-called dark money is the engine that moves the levers of power. Transparency and accountability are anathemas to all this.</p>



<p>The solution to this issue is complex. Often, those involved in such fundraising schemes have little desire for any solution to be found. Preserving the status quo -and the cash flow- tends to override any moral concerns.</p>



<p>In August 2021, NFTs found their way into the political arena when Scott Jensen, a Republican gubernatorial candidate for Minnesota, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/candidate-for-minnesota-governor-releases-campaign-nfts/">issued a series of NFTs to support its campaign</a>.</p>



<p>Jensen released two NFTS, with a run of 25,000 each, and a price tag of $5 per NFT. The proceedings would support his campaign for Governor. By purchasing these items, the buyer would also get access to extra perks, such as meeting Jensen in person.</p>



<p>Democrats are not far behind in the NFT race. Early in October, a group of fundraisers for the Democratic party launched a series of politically-themed NFTs through Front Row, an NFT marketplace. The NFTs themselves were digital representations of people from the Texas Democratic Party. Specifically, the group of more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who had fled the State of Texas in an attempt to block a vote restriction bill put forward by the Republican party. Each NFT was priced at $250. The buyer would be considered a ‘donor’ to the party, with the actual platform -Front Row- taking a fee.</p>



<p>Both in Jensen and the Texas examples, there would be a price limitation of $5,800 to conform to existing campaign financing laws. (Political action committees -PACs- and party committees are not subject to the same guidelines, and that’s where ‘dark money’ reigns supreme.)</p>



<p>The use of NFTs turns these partisan fundraising efforts into interesting experiments. While limited in scope, they certainly offer a glimpse into what might become part of future political campaigns, both in the United States and elsewhere.</p>



 NFT-only political events, and beyond 



<p>Grassroots movements are essential to foment democratic principles in the community. These organisations promote participation, engagement, and inclusiveness, and help drive voter turnout. Members meet regularly in church halls, conference rooms in hotels, and even in pubs, to discuss current matters, etc.</p>



<p>A proposed use case for NFT in the political ambit is the celebration of ‘NFT-only’ conferences and other events. These could only be attended by members of any chapter of local or national grassroots groups who hold a scannable NFT. The tokens could unlock perks for the holder, such as meeting a particular speaker (such as the Jenssen NFTs), digital goodies, merchandise, etc. At the time of writing, there is no known political event adhering to this NFT-led initiative. Hence the 2022 VeeCon event will only be open to those who own a VeeFriend NFT.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In the grand scheme of things, NFTs remain a relatively nascent technology. They have only become a thing in 2021, in the wake of the now infamous Beeple NFT sale. Throughout this year, we have seen NFTs enter the popular lexicon and more and more mainstream commercial ventures dipping their toes into this fascinating Pandora’s Box. In 2022, American retail giant Macy’s auctioned off a range of NFTs based on its iconic Thanksgiving Day parade balloons. Comic book publisher Marvel has released several rounds of comic book-themed NFTs. This alone represents a constellation of possibilities.</p>



<p>NFTs for the political stage remain in a ‘try-before-you-buy’ phase, so to speak. But even though the road ahead remains somewhat hazy, the foundations for a larger NFT sphere of influence have been laid in politics and elsewhere.</p>

         Partnering with Evy: Product Protection You Can Trust            <p>Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team are making product insurance plans effortless—for merchants and customers alike.</p>  <p>By Stephanie Zhan and George Robson</p><p>Published October 25, 2022</p>       



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>You replace your old cell phone with the latest and greatest model—and it falls on the floor and cracks. Or you buy a beautiful new couch—and spill red wine all over it. We’ve all experienced the frustration of seeing a purchase turn into a headache. The more you spent, the more anxiety-inducing those moments can be—even if the seller is down the street, and certainly if they’re half a world away. If you did spring for insurance to replace that dropped phone or wine-stained sofa, it might take hours to dig through old emails for your policy information and navigate the claims process, only to learn the fine print says you aren’t covered.</p>



<p>And in Europe, you likely don’t have a policy at all. Today, only a fourth of top online sellers offer product protection, and offline retailers have plans that could be vastly improved. Consumers are left on their own, and sellers forgo valuable opportunities to increase their sales and customer loyalty.</p>



<p>But now, Evy co-founders Simon Kemoun, Shana Azria and Tanguy Le Stradic are changing all that. Built from the ground up, their platform offers a simple set of APIs merchants can integrate to offer product insurance, allowing them to price customizable protection plans by category and deliver tailored coverage at lower deductibles. What’s more, Evy can handle the claims—often instantly. Sellers get a turnkey solution that helps their business grow, while customers get transparent policies, stress-free customer service and best of all, peace of mind.</p>



<p>When our friends at La Famiglia introduced us to Simon, Shana and Tanguy last year, Evy was just the three of them, and no product. But they did have complementary backgrounds (Simon previously founded a consumer social app and is a former McKinsey consultant; Shana was a senior engineer at Apple; Tanguy hails from rising-star French neobank Qonto) that combined to give them outsider insight on this space, and they had conviction in their technology-first approach. We were proud to lead their seed round earlier this year.</p>



<p>Fast-forward nine months later, and Evy has now grown into a talented and hard-working team of 10 and counting, offers insurance plans across multiple product categories with partnerships rolling out in phones, other electronic appliances, furniture, and more, and is already expanding beyond their roots in France into several other European countries. This week, as we celebrate their new pan-European partnership with e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.manomano.co.uk/">ManoMano</a>, we are as excited as ever about what the future holds for Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team—and ultimately, for shoppers everywhere. With each expansion into a new product insurance category, Evy is taking another step toward a world where we can all get what we need, worry-free.</p>



<p>Evy is hiring now! If you’re interested in joining the team, please <a href="https://getevy.notion.site/Careers-at-Evy-239e76fd976e4b87960b6b4a45777473">reach out</a>.</p>

<p>Written by Anirudha Bose</p>
<p>Signing DApp transactions for EVM chains is a security nightmare. It’s very common for users to blindly approve a signature request while being completely oblivious to what the transaction is going to do behind the scenes. This is commonly referred to as “blind signing” in the world of cryptocurrency (not to be confused with blind signatures in cryptography).</p>
<p>Blind signing is unfortunately a very common attack vector in crypto, where an attacker tricks the user into signing a transaction that drains their wallet (since there’s no way for the user to distinguish between a legitimate and a malicious transaction). Earlier this year, in a phishing attack on OpenSea users, an attacker stole hundreds of NFTs by simply tricking victims into signing a transaction to sell all their NFTs for 0 ETH. This story is far too common for the crypto ecosystem to ignore.</p>
<p>With Brave browser release 1.45, we are excited to debut a smarter signing experience on Brave Swap for all EVM transactions. With our latest updates to Brave Wallet, our signing experience is getting a redesign that aims to take the stress out of approving transactions. On any trading platform that’s powered by the 0x API (including Brave Wallet internal swaps), you’ll see clear and straightforward descriptions of how the transaction will impact your token balances.</p>

 The perils of DeFi 
<p>Using DeFi apps today is a lot like going to a shop and asking the shopkeeper to take whatever cash they need from your wallet for the purchase. The contracts you interact with already have an approval to spend part or all of your token balances, using the <code>approve()</code> method of the ERC20 interface. Consider the following transaction approval popup on Metamask, which is a Uniswap trade for USDC-ETH on the Optimism network:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Approving this transaction requires a leap of faith, since none of the original swap parameters like maker and taker assets, quote amounts, etc. are visible on the approval screen. You’re essentially signing complete gibberish. It’s not just poor user experience; it’s&nbsp; unsafe. This info can be spoofed to execute almost anything without your awareness.</p>

 What the hex? 
<p>Transactions are to smart contracts what HTTP requests are to web services. DApps use a data segment in EVM transactions, known as calldata, to indicate which function to invoke in a smart contract and with what parameters. The calldata however is just a sequence of bytes that’s not human readable. You can view the calldata segment of a transaction on Etherscan under the “Input Data” section, as in the following example:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Anatomy of EVM calldata 
<p>The calldata is a read-only, byte-addressable space where the data parameter of a transaction or call is held. This calldata is encoded by wallets and Web3 clients following the Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI). Let’s look at a simple contract with a method to add two <code>uint256</code> numbers, and see how you’d construct the calldata to execute this method:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>The first four bytes of the calldata, known as function selector, specify the function to be called. Method arguments are packed in chunks of 32 bytes, with types smaller than 32 bytes zero padded if necessary. Fixed-size types like <code>uint256</code>, <code>address</code>, etc. are represented within the available 32 bytes. However, dynamic types like bytes and arrays follow head-tail encoding. In this scheme, the data is packaged at the tail-end of the transaction’s calldata. The arguments are references in the calldata to where the content is.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the calldata example above based on the encoding rules to have a better understanding:</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>We can now update our example contract logic with heavily-commented inline assembly (albeit a bit contrived), to demonstrate how EVM parses the calldata behind the scenes:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Parsing complex calldata 
<p>Here’s a more realistic example of how to parse the calldata of the 0x contract function <code>sellTokenForTokenToUniswapV3</code>, involving dynamic types. Recall that dynamic types use the head-tail encoding scheme, unlike fixed-size types. Our example is a swap trade from COW to USDC, using the following path for the order: COW -&gt; WETH -&gt; USDC.</p>
<p>The function we’re trying to invoke is:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Here’s the same calldata, but broken down and grouped to indicate how we can parse it to extract meaningful insights about the swap trade.</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>Note that parsing the calldata is not enough—we also needed to figure out the information embedded in the <code>encodedPath</code> argument, which is a Uniswap V3 order path. Thanks to our newfound ability to make sense of the entire calldata segment, we can now infer that the raw hex represented the swap trade 1421.74 COW -&gt; 1000 USDC.</p>

 The end product 
<p>Technical improvements can only be appreciated if an impact is felt by users. So the final piece of the puzzle was to design a UX that gives users all the necessary details to confidently approve a swap, while keeping it generic enough that it can be extended to a vast majority of DEX transactions in the future. After brainstorming with our product designers, here’s what the end product looks like:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>A few highlights of this design:</p>
 
 It displays all the security-critical information about the swap, such as sender account, maker and taker assets along with network information, quote amounts, and exchange rate. 
 It works both for swaps from Brave Wallet as well as third-party DApps integrating the 0x API, on all EVM-compatible networks. 
 The UX could easily be extended to support cross-chain bridge transactions, where the networks for maker and taker assets would be different. 
 The origin of the transaction (i.e. eTLD+1 and the site favicon) are displayed to prevent phishing attacks. 
 

 Conclusion 
<p>We implemented an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/12797">ABI decoder</a> in brave-core for EVM chains to bring safety and transparency to the transaction approval process. This allowed us to reveal insights about what a seemingly opaque transaction is supposed to do, and build a dedicated UX around it to make the signing process more user-friendly.</p>
<p>In the 1.45 release of the Brave browser, we are bringing this capability to 0x swaps on Brave Wallet, and will soon extend it to Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap, and Sushiswap, which should cover more than 70% of all DEX volume on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Building a secure and transparent signing experience in Brave Wallet remains a strong focus for us on the Wallet team. We intend to expand on this work to bring similar UX improvements beyond swaps, such as interacting with lending, cross-chain bridges, and staking DApps.</p>

 Introduction <p>After the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">Merge</a>’s success, the Ethereum network transitioned from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model into a Proof of Stake (PoS) one, making it a less energy-intensive blockchain. However, amid the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/17/3-must-know-benefits-of-the-ethereum-merge/">numerous positives</a> that the merge appears to have yielded, a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/21/ethereum-merge-threat-lido-finance-proof-of-stake-dominant-defi-platform/">threat of centralization</a> is beginning to rear its ugly head. Thankfully, the Distributed Validator technology can address most of the problems that are associated to this danger.<br></p><p>The task of validating the blockchain has fallen to staking clients instead of miners. Under PoS, the job of a validator is to confirm or propose to add a new block to the blockchain. If the validator's attestation or proposal is timely and accurate, they receive a small reward in ETH. <br></p><p>In theory, anyone can set up a validator node, stake the required amount of ETH, and participate in the network. Yet, several intending validators are instead going through <a href="https://v1.stake.fish/en/ethereum/services/">staking services</a>, with all their <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">risks</a>. But why?<br></p><p>In this article, we’ll look at the current issues (spoiler: centralization) for validators and stakers on Ethereum PoS and how those problems can be solved with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).</p> Issues with the Ethereum PoS model<br> <p>There is a range of risks for validators and stakers alike when it comes to the Ethereum PoS model. Let’s have a look at each of these issues.</p> Centralization <p>When it comes to retail users, especially those holding small amounts of ETH (Ethereum PoS requires 32 ETH to run a validator), it becomes a complicated procedure for them to set up a validator or maintain it. Hence, it’s very likely that these network participants are inclined towards staking their ETH via staking services. <br></p><p>Since most crypto users hold their funds on custodial platforms such as centralized exchanges, they’re likely to also use a custodial staking service to stake their ETH. Even though custodial staking services promise ease of use and convenience, there are several risks associated with using them, the chief of which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-11/biggest-ether-staking-service-has-a-centralization-problem">centralization</a>. A central authority is not exactly good news in a global monetary network, and the idea of handing over your keys to an operator who is not immune to slashing penalties, errors, hacks, or even censorship can be devastating for the whole ecosystem. <br></p>The total value of ETH staked by some of the most important actors and platforms suggests a growing centralization problem. (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/centralization-risks-and-flaws-of-ethereum-merge">Source</a>) Single points of failure <p>When a user runs a solo validator, the custody of a validator's private keys is a crucial matter. If a validator losses access to their private keys, they could lose access to their funds. This represents a difficult user experience and constitutes a single-point-of-failure risk. The Ethereum PoS protocol doesn’t make it easier either, as its rules prohibit redundancies of any kind. Thus, a validator can only sign messages or remain online via a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">single machine</a>. <br></p>The process of becoming a validator on Ethereum PoS. (<a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">Source</a>)<p>If an attacker breaks into a validator’s machine and gains access to the private key, their activities can cause the affected validator to suffer a slashing of their stake. When a stake is slashed, a portion of the validator’s locked funds is deducted by the protocol. Ultimately, this leads to a loss of funds, revealing the massive vulnerabilities of a single point of failure.</p> Validator liveness check <p>Suppose a validator client fails to sign messages for any reason, ranging from breaks in the network connection or cloud failures to software crashes or hardware issues. In that case, they suffer penalties due to inactivity. They will lose a portion of their staked balances. <br></p><p>Penalties due to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/solutions/double-signing-protection">double-signing</a> can also arise, especially if a validator suddenly goes offline while signing a message. Thus, validator clients risk deposit slashing if they sign multiple instances with the same key, sign the same message twice, or go offline when others are offline. This favors professional validators and discourages the average user with the resources to become one from being a validator, therefore leading to a few validators retaining most of the power.</p> Private key custody <p>There’s a well-known saying in the crypto ecosystem, “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t have custody of your private keys, you’re always at the mercy a of custodial service for the safety of your funds. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/">Staking services</a> offer a way out for participants who do not want to face the risks of dealing with a solo validator setup and maintenance directly, but there's a catch. Stakers using these services have to hand over their private keys to the service in a setting that requires them to trust the staking service operator fully. They must trust the operator for the security of their staking private key.<br></p><p>With staking services, key ownership can be a tricky topic. A sense of security comes with having control over your private keys as a solo validator. Using a staking service will require you to give up that sense of security, trusting someone else to do it for you. For systems where anything can go wrong and malicious actors lurk under the guise of honesty, it is not advisable to trust someone else with the custody of your keys.</p> Forking penalties <p>Under the PoS regime, validator clients connect to Beacon nodes. In the unlikely event that a Beacon node to which a validator is connected <a href="https://www.bsc.news/post/ethereum-bug-leads-to-node-failure-and-a-subsequent-fork-in-the-network">develops a fault</a>, a fork will be created. If the validator client is affected by this anomaly, it will follow the forked chain and appear offline to the main PoS protocol, resulting in penalties.<br></p><p>—-------------------------------<br></p><p>Centralization is sufficient to defeat the purpose of a permissionless and transparent blockchain, but the threats to security and loss of deposits due to penalties are enough to discourage anyone from participating. These issues have created the need for the development of Distributed Validator Technology. Let’s understand what is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) and how it aims to solve the issues mentioned above.</p> What is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)? <p>Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a decentralized open-source protocol that allows the duties of a validator to be distributed among multiple nodes, as opposed to a single machine, leveraging threshold cryptography. DVT provides a decentralized staking layer on Ethereum, allowing anyone to create and share a validator over multiple <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/fault-tolerance">fault-tolerant </a>machines such that, if any one node is offline or faulty, the validator can continue to perform its duties. The fault-tolerance of a system simply refers to the system’s ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.<br></p><p>In essence, DVT adds an additional layer of fault-tolerance for Ethereum validators removing the possibility of redundancies such as a single point of failure, centralization issues, etc.<br></p>A graphical overview of Distributed Validator Technology (earlier known as SSV). (<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/eth2-secret-shared-validators-85824df8cbc0">Source</a>)<p>Distributed Validator Technology is a blend of distributed key generation, multi-party computation, Shamir's secret sharing, and Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms that permit validator duties to be split across several nodes without violating the staking rules of Ethereum. We’ll understand these algorithms and what role they play in DVT in the below sections.<br></p><p>In case you’re interested, here’s a video explainer of DVT by Aditya Asgankar from the Ethereum Foundation:</p><p>Distributed Validator Technology not only shares a single validator's duties across several machines but also “distributes” its private keys. Remember, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-competitors-advantages-and-disadvantages/">Ethereum</a> requires a validator to create or sign messages with its private keys on a single computer. By distributing shares of the private key among multiple nodes and utilizing a distributed key generation scheme, DVT eliminates the single point of failure, as we will see below.<br></p><p>DVT emerged as an idea proposed by the Ethereum Foundation in 2019 in preparation for Ethereum's transition to PoS. Ethereum validators operate with an Active-Passive setup in which backup nodes remain offline. When the active node goes offline, downtimes occur before the backup node can come online, as there are no automatic switches. With DVT, validators can now enjoy an <a href="https://kemptechnologies.com/white-papers/unfog-confusion-active-passive-activeactive-load-balancing">Active-Active arrangement</a>, operating like a multi-signature setup and eliminating single points of failure.</p> How does Distributed Validator Technology work? <p>As mentioned, Distributed Validator Technology combines distributed key generation, Shamir's secret sharing, multi-party computation, and Istanbul's Byzantine Fault Tolerance. You can look at DVT as a multi-signature scheme, but instead of confirming <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transactions</a>, it is used to perform consensus-required validator duties on the blockchain.<br></p>A working overview of steps involved in the DVT consensus mechanism. (<a href="https://rattibha.com/thread/1530589456872271872">Source</a>) The Distributed Validator Technology pillar: Distributed key generation <p>The first and one of the core components of DVT is a <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-distributed-key-generation-is-866adc79620">distributed key generation</a> (DKG) scheme. DKGs involve multiple parties contributing to calculating and sharing a private key such that no single group member has full control over the secret key. The private key is encrypted and split among all participants.<br></p><p>Usually, these nodes qualify as non-<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusting</a>, meaning their operators do not need to know one another, creating sufficient room for fault tolerance. DKG makes way for the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold signing</a> scheme.</p> Shamir's secret sharing and threshold signing <p>Next, <a href="https://medium.com/@keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">Shamir's secret sharing</a> allows the private key to be split such that each participating validator client holds only a piece of the puzzle, and no individual share is sufficient to sign messages. Instead of requiring every participant to be available to reform the secret or sign messages, Shamir's secret sharing employs a threshold, usually predefined, giving room for the validator client to remain online even if there is a faulty or malicious member.<br></p><p>For an example, say we have four operators contributing to a DVT setup, and the threshold for signing messages is 3 out of 4. If one computer goes offline or is not trustworthy, three nodes remain active and can sign messages. With the private key split among four nodes, there is no single point of failure.<br></p><p>Note that Ethereum PoS uses <a href="https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/signatures/">BLS signatures</a>, which allow for aggregation, meaning that it recognizes multiple signatures with the same key and can combine these transactions into one. So, when all participants sign a transaction, the BLS signature system combines all signatures without requiring a complete reconstruction of the private key.</p> Multi-party computation <p>Secure <a href="https://web3wednesdays.xyz/multi-party-computation/">multi-party computation</a> plays a critical role in Distributed Validator Technology. Through MPC, contributing operators can use their secret shares in signing messages and performing computation without reconstructing the secret on any single device. With MPC, the threat of centralizing the private key during computation is eliminated, and the decentralized nature of the distributed validator setup remains intact.</p> Consensus <p>The final piece in the puzzle is a consensus algorithm among Beacon nodes that can achieve fault tolerance through threshold signing schemes. Consensus is achieved among the Beacon nodes to which ETH validators are connected. Beacon nodes are responsible for assigning duties to validator clients.<br></p><p>Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold cryptography</a>, a private key is encrypted and split amongst Beacon operator nodes. A threshold number (3 out of 4, 5 out of 7, etc.) is required for any commands to be issued to a validator client. This way, no single Beacon node operator would have unfettered power over a validator.<br></p><p>To reach a consensus over a block in a DVT setup, the <a href="https://media.consensys.net/scaling-consensus-for-enterprise-explaining-the-ibft-algorithm-ba86182ea668">Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> algorithm singles out one Beacon node in the DVT setup as the leader who will propose the block and share it with fellow Beacon nodes. If more than 66% of the Beacon nodes agree that the block is valid, it is added to the blockchain.<br></p><p>If the leader goes offline or is compromised in a DVT setting, the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm will reassign the role to another DVT Beacon node within twelve seconds.</p> Use cases of Distributed Validator Technology <p>Since its proposal in 2019, DVT has been successfully developed by two leading actors: <a href="https://ssv.network/tech/">Secret Shared Validator Technology</a> and the <a href="https://obol.tech/">Obol Network</a>. While these are direct projects spun out with DVT as their core, here are the major possible applications of Distributed Validator Technology:</p> The use of Distributed Validator Technology on Decentralized staking pools <p>Most staking pools today are custodial and have single points of failure, relying on a single validator node with a single key., Added to the threat of a single point of failure is the challenge of experiencing slashing and penalties across the board.<br></p><p>Using a <a href="https://docs.obol.tech/docs/dv/validator-creation">distributed validator setup</a>, staking pools can switch to a decentralized model, reduce penalties and slashing by ensuring minimal downtimes and diversify their current offerings.</p> Staking infrastructure providers <p>To understand how staking infrastructure providers can leverage DVT to offer more robust services, we first need to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.jscape.com/blog/active-active-vs-active-passive-high-availability-cluster">Active-Active and Active-Passive</a> configurations.<br></p><p>When it comes to cloud infrastructure, there are essentially two options on how to configure connections – Active-Active &amp; Active-Passive. In an Active-Active configuration, traffic is load-shared between interfaces based on flow. If one connection becomes unavailable, then all traffic is routed through the other connection. In an Active-Passive configuration, one connection handles traffic, while the other is on standby.<br></p><p>Companies that provide infrastructure to meet individual or institutional staking need solutions towards redundancies of cloud providers with Active-Passive configurations. With DVT setups, infrastructure providers can enable Active-Active cluster redundancies and encourage dynamism in deployments and configurations.</p> Solo validator setups <p>Solo validators that were previously discouraged by high barriers of entry and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/64-of-staked-eth-controlled-by-five-entities-nansen">risks</a> associated with <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">ETH staking</a> can now participate using a DVT configuration. <br></p><p>With a distributed validator setup, in-house validators can distribute their signing power across multiple nodes in an Active-Active cluster redundancy arrangement. Thus, they minimize the risk of failure and penalties due to downtime, double-signing, etc.</p> In summary, Distributed Validator Technology can be a game-changer <p>Distributed Validator Technology addresses the many challenges of ETH staking and lowers the entry barrier for the average person while encouraging true <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a> on Ethereum. With DVT, institutional or retail validators can meet the protocol’s requirements of safety or liveness, or even both, increase resilience, enjoy Active-Active redundancy configurations, and diversify their operations based on several factors.<br></p><p>As Ethereum now operates fully as a proof-of-stake blockchain, its validators will continue to lean towards more secure and practical configurations for their operations. DVT presents an opportunity for staking on Ethereum to become more decentralized and profitable, even for retail participants. Currently, Obol Network is leading the charge in building an ecosystem for trust-minimized staking that enables people to create, test, run &amp; coordinate distributed validators. Hopefully, in the coming months, we’ll see more development in this direction. <br><br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

     Q3 was an amazing quarter full of growth and exciting new milestones, including the first-ever Horizen ecosystem summit and the first meme coin on TokenMint!&nbsp; 
<p>We are amazed to see the amount of growth we have experienced in a single quarter. We launched several new products and upgrades, grew the team, welcomed a new meme coin to the ecosystem using our new products and more! We are excited to continue meeting new milestones with our growing community.&nbsp;</p>
 Q3 Highlights 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_numbers-2.jpg"></a></p>
 Product and Engineering&nbsp; 
<p>The engineering and product teams focused on releasing upgrades to existing products like TokenMint and Cobalt this quarter to enable a wider variety of use cases on the Horizen ecosystem. This included Cobalt upgrades and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">documentation on how to use</a> it in preparation for additional functionality like NFTs on Tokenmint!</p>
 TokenMint 
<p>TokenMint Mainnet Launch</p>
<p>Our no-code tokenization platform, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-is-live-on-mainnet/">TokenMint</a>, was launched on mainnet in Q3! The platform provides a streamlined process for anybody to launch their own token easily and quickly without having a technical background. An introduction of TokenMint with a user guide was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-create-and-launch-a-cryptocurrency-token-with-tokenmint">featured on Cointelegraph</a>. The leading technology media Venture Beat also featured a story on TokenMint where the author covered the importance of tokenization and the value of platforms such as TokenMint in the effort of making blockchain technology more accessible for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punkz Token Launch&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has already been used to launch the first meme token on the Horizen ecosystem called Punkz Token! The token also has it’s own game called <a href="https://pipeflare.io/all-games">Punkz Hero</a>, launched with our partner PipeFlare! Be sure to check it out and get Punkz for playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has started to add additional features to TokenMint as well. This includes NFTs! While the functionality is currently available on testnet. The team is working towards the mainnet launch, which is coming soon! This will enable people to create their own NFTs utilizing TokenMint and store them on our Cobalt browser wallet. This was an important step for our project because it is one of the many functionalities requested by our community. We were excited to deliver a product many members wanted to see! If you want to try launching your own NFT on TokenMint, head to the home page now, select the NFT tab and check out the guide on loading<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-load-nft-data-into-an-ipfs-repository/"> NFT data to IPFS.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NFT-zencon0_D1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the new NFT functionality on TokenMint’s testnet we launched the first NFT series in time for ZenCon0! The series, called <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zero-gravity-coming-to-tokenmint-an-exclusive-nft-for-zencon0/">Zero Gravity</a>, was issued to all event attendees as a special surprise for those who joined us.</p>
<p>The NFT functionality was also added to <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-ver-1-4-0/">Cobalt wallet version 1.4.0</a>! This version also added ZEN transactions between Cobalt wallet addresses to further extend the usability of our web wallet for our users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the engineering team has been making great progress on the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/blockchain-academy/technology/advanced/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/">EVM</a> sidechain. The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/why-evm-compatibility-matters/">EVM sidechain will open our ecosystem</a> up to existing blockchain developers and projects because Ethereum has the largest and most diverse public blockchain ecosystem. This means that EVM compatibility is one of the key ingredients for blockchains like ours to build a successful ecosystem. The team is currently working on the circuit to ensure that our EVM is as secure as possible and is expecting a launch date in early Q1 2023!</p>
<p>There are many benefits to EVM compatibility including existing Ethereum-based defi infrastructure. There are well-established Ethereum smart contracts for an wide range of blockchain-based products, such as automated market makers, decentralized exchanges, peer-to-peer lending protocols, stablecoins, and more. All of which the team is working on or working with new and existing partners to bring to the ecosystem soon!</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/download-the-mandatory-zen-3-2-0-software-upgrade-today/">ZEN 3.2.0</a>! This mandatory upgrade is the first step to&nbsp; preparing our exchange partners, mining pool operators, and full node users for upcoming ecosystem expansion and included upgrades like:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Upgrading integration test suite to Python 3 
 Updates to build system, compatibility with newer versions of Linux 
 Fix IsInitialBlockDownload false positive error message 
 
<p>The final date to upgrade without disruption is approximately October 21st! So be sure to upgrade soon if you haven’t already!</p>
 Community Growth&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_community.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The community has continued to grow steadily this quarter with the largest growth being seen on LinkedIn. Its exciting to see all of our new community members coming together to share their thoughts on what the ecosystem should look like and actively engaging with the team to provide feedback. We look forward to learning more about our newest community members as we continue to expand what Horizen is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This growth has continued to be seen across not only our community, but the web traffic for Horizen as well. We saw a 13% increase in <a href="https://heap.horizen.io/">HEAP</a> organic impressions, which suggests that a portion of our new community is developer-centric. Another exciting growth number we saw was the Horizen Academy content topic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_webtraffic.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Our marketing team is in the process of launching a new Horizen Academy! The academy will include content that expands existing articles and educational resources about upcoming products and ecosystem expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are new articles already on the academy including:&nbsp;</p>

							<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce that we have recently tagged our first release candidate of Zebra (<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.0">zebra 1.0.0-rc.0</a>), the alternative Zcash node implementation written in Rust. This is the first time that there has been an alternative zcash node implementation running on mainnet and that we are excited to see some Zebra nodes now appearing on the <a href="https://blockchair.com/zcash/nodes">Blockchair node explorer</a>!</p><p>We are very happy to share that Zebra also supports the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra#configuring-json-rpc-for-lightwalletd">lightwalletd backend JSON-RPCs</a>, can be used as a lightwalletd backend and is <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-powered-lightwalletd-with-zecwallet-lite/42868">currently an optional backend for ZecwalletLite</a>!</p><p>With this release we have solved the last few outstanding bugs and issues that could have affected the security, performance and stability of the Zcash network and are confident that long-lived Zebra nodes can be run on mainnet. As such, we are looking forward to Zebra experiencing more “production use”, and we will be shortly be engaging security auditors to conduct an audit of the Zebra code to ensure that users can be confident in its security and stability.&nbsp;</p><p>This release of Zebra can be used to join the Zcash peer-to-peer network, which helps to keep Zcash working by validating and broadcasting transactions, and maintaining the Zcash blockchain state in a distributed manner. Zebra’s network stack is interoperable with zcashd, and Zebra implements all the features required to reach Zcash network consensus. Zebra validates all of the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf">Zcash consensus rules</a>.</p><p>So please spin up some instances and let us know what you think!</p>

<blockquote>TL;DR: Introducing a new framework for Sismo governance: Sismo Contributor ZK badge holders get voting power according to their contribution. First use case: the community will curate which badges can be deployed on the main curated environment.</blockquote><p>Sismo has now been live for a few months and the list of <a href="https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/what-are-zk-badges">ZK Badges</a> on the <a href="https://playground.sismo.io/">playground</a> has started to grow since the release of our <a href="https://factory.sismo.io/">Factory</a> — where non developers can create ZK Badges for their users in 5&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>The <a href="http://playground.sismo.io">playground</a> is a permissionless environment where anyone can create their own ZK Badges. Only the best Badges from the playground environment make it to the main <a href="http://app.sismo.io">Sismo curated environment</a>.</p><p>Today we are opening the curation process to the Sismo community through an open governance system, based on contributions.</p><p>We will of course dog-food our own protocol and ZK Badges to track contributions&nbsp;:)</p> Community-based Badge&nbsp;Curation <p>The Sismo <a href="https://playground.sismo.io/">Playground</a> environment is an open sandbox for anyone to create, test and imagine new ways to benefit from Sismo’s protocol privacy-preserving attestation system. This openness means that a lot of different types of badges are created and that some of the highest quality ones are drowned in a mass of other badges that could be deemed low-quality or less aligned with Sismo’s&nbsp;vision.</p><p>On the other side, the Sismo <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Curated</a> environment core value is to provide a more curated experience for users and applications looking for carefully selected ZK Badges that they can trust. The objective is for the Sismo community to progressively take charge of vetting which ZK Badge will be able to be migrated to the Curated environment from the Playground environment.</p>ZK Badges in Sismo’s Curated environment<p>To help in this endeavour, a set of <a href="https://www.notion.so/Badge-Curation-Guidelines-a62b5d7205734b44b41c603bf1516f4c">Badge Curation Guidelines</a> have been proposed to the community to support them in their decision process. It has the aim to ensure that the Sismo Curated environment only hosts ZK Badges that have been proven to hold a sufficient level of quality, transparency, fairness, and alignment to Sismo’s manifesto.</p> The need for a new governance model  Straightforward token voting is&nbsp;flawed <p>The issues with solely coin-driven governance are&nbsp;known:</p>  It empowers token holders and their interests more than the other type of stakeholders in a project community.  It is susceptible to governance attacks through vote buying or borrowing.  It gives oversized power to wealthy participants compared to small holders and these “whales” can often have conflicting interests in other&nbsp;projects   Lack of private&nbsp;voting <p>The lack of privacy in the current voting system opens the way to bribing or intimidation attacks against specific actors and can prevent some stakeholders from expressing their honest opinions.</p> Exploring the potential of Proof of Contribution <p>An additional metric that should be taken into account in governance systems is the amount of value each voter brought to the system. It seems natural to give more power in the governance to those who contributed the most to the underlying project.</p> Proof of Contribution  Verifying the fact that an account corresponds to a person that has used a protocol, passed some educational training, funded an initiative, contributed to building a system, or performed some useful work in the project ecosystem. Useful participation rewarded with improved governance power is less dystopian than a social credit system because you have a say in the criteria&nbsp;used. Sismo ZK Badges as membership &amp; weighted voting credentials <p>Sismo ZK Badges provide a valuable set of attributes for contribution-based governance models:</p>  They are tokenized attestations of history/activity/reputation packaged as a standard ERC-1155 NFT a.k.a Soulbound Tokens&nbsp;(SBTs)  They preserve the privacy of their owners. They can be minted on a new address that is not linked to the addresses that fulfilled the requirements to get the badge.&nbsp;(<a href="https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/what-are-zk-badges">more</a>)  (Soon) They will allow users to aggregate their reputation by gathering their badges on a single or several pseudonymized address(es) in the&nbsp;future.  They are non-transferable.  <p>This last property allows ZK badges to be less concentrated (no sale/transfer to the rich) and to remain owned by active participants. The non-transferability of badges also limits trustless vote-buying in the sense that any vote-buying will require the seller to hand over his private&nbsp;keys.</p> A new framework for Sismo Governance <p>Check out the new governance process at <a href="https://governance.sismo.io">https://governance.sismo.io</a></p> “Sismo Contributor” badge as core voting power denominator <p>The core voting power denominator is represented by the <a href="https://app.sismo.io/sismo-contributor">“Sismo Contributor” ZK badge</a> (on Polygon mainnet).</p><p>The “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge can be minted by different types of contributors from the Sismo community (check <a href="https://sismo.notion.site/Governance-Overview-5224949448d64bdb81f3d70b3b4cc5f0">Governance Overview</a> for details) and is comprised of 3 levels assigned according to the significance of the minter contribution:</p><p>Level 1 contributors (Users): 1 voting point per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Level 2 contributors (Community Members): 50 voting points per the&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Level 3 contributors (Builders): 500 voting points per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Anyone having minted at least one badge on <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Sismo Curated App</a> (not the playground) is at least eligible for Level 1. Community member can easily get to Level 2 by attending a Sismo event or minting a “Proof of Humanity” ZK Badge, and to Level 3 by contributing actively to Sismo’s ecosystem initiatives or open source development.</p><p>The voting power assignment to the “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge, the badge group generation rules, and the level allocation are all susceptible to being modified through governance in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This badge will attest that its minter has already interacted at least once with Sismo protocol, community, or ecosystem and will act as a first basic Sybil resistance lever.</p> Conclusion <p>The early stages of Sismo Governance are a perfect time to experiment with alternative governance models that could prove themselves to be valuable. Because it uses Sismo protocol at its heart, this experiment can be reused as a template and improved on by other communities, incentivizing more usage of Sismo ZK&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Get involved:</p>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sismo">Discord</a>  <p>Read about our current governance process:</p>  <a href="http://governance.sismo.io">governance.sismo.io</a>   Reference   Moving beyond coin voting governance -<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html">https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html</a>

 Verida Q3 2022 Quarterly Update Verida Q3 2022&nbsp;Update<p>The past few months have again been busy for the Verida team and our protocol development. Work has continued on the development of the Verida Vault with the Android release now available, NEAR integration complete and Wallet Connect support implemented. The Verida Acacia testnet which will shortly become fully decentralized too. Despite a volatile market environment, our community remains engaged and new partners continue to join the network as we work to provide user owned data identity solutions for&nbsp;all.</p> Engineering  Verida Vault <p>Web3 apps need to offer the standard of UX that people are used to today. Verida has worked with Excited, a product design agency based in the Ukraine since 2019 for the design of the Verida website and Verida Vault mobile application. Last month, we were thrilled to announce that the Verida Vault was awarded the coveted <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-vault-designers-win-prestigious-red-dot-award-48deb4336813">Red Dot Award</a> for its interface design.</p>The Verida&nbsp;Vault<p>The Verida Vault mobile app acts as both a “data wallet” and “crypto wallet” for end users. It provides private key management and a user-friendly interface with the Verida network and supported blockchains.</p><p>We shipped the Android release of the Verida Vault in August and it is now available in<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault"> Android Play Store</a>. This broadens Vault availability beyond iOS which can be found in the<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632"> Apple AppStore</a>. Both are in developer preview. APIs are stable except where noted in our<a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/intro"> documentation</a>.</p><p>We welcome developers to come build user-centric, decentralized apps with the vast capabilities of the Verida Vault, including identity, user data, messaging, profiles, Single-Sign-On (SSO), rewards, tokens, and transactions. Learn more about the Vault in our release article&nbsp;<a href="https://news.verida.io/the-verida-vault-is-now-available-in-developer-preview-on-ios-and-android-70d0acdce3dc">here</a>.</p> Product <p>NEAR is now supported in the Verida Vault (testnet only). This includes the ability to store your NEAR tokens, send and receive and make crypto transactions.</p><p>WalletConnect is now supported on Ethereum (Wallet Connect v1), Algorand (Wallet Connect v1) and NEAR (Wallet Connect v2) via the <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect SDK</a>. dApps supporting WalletConnect can pass the connection details while connecting with Verida, providing their users with a unified Connect experience, i.e. a single QR-code to scan to connect both Verida and Wallet&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>The Verida Vault crypto wallet import feature has now been extended to provide more flexibility for users. In addition to importing an existing Verida multichain wallet, users can now import accounts for individual blockchains (e.g. Ethereum).</p> Protocol <p>A key focus for the engineering team has been working towards the Acacia Testnet protocol release that will be rolling out from November 2022&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Smart contract development:</p>  We have open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts">protocol smart contracts</a> currently under development.  Significant engineering effort has gone towards our <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a> that will be launched shortly on Testnet. This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry">ethr-did-registry</a> with extensions that support “per application” based service endpoints, a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  The <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-Name-Registry">Verida Name Registry</a> has been developed, tested and is ready for deployment. This enables Verida accounts to have human friendly names as aliases for their&nbsp;DID’s.  Work has commenced on development work for our future token reward&nbsp;systems.  <p>Verida SDK development:</p>  A major refactor of the Verida SDK has been completed that integrates with the new, <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a>.  Enhancements to the Verida DbStore provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect</a> upgrades adding support for the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.

<p>We’re excited to announce that we’ve expanded support for Brave Translate—our tool to translate websites privately and securely—and that we’ve added 93 languages, going from 15 supported languages to 108! New languages include Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic—<a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/8963107404813-How-do-I-use-Brave-Translate-">check out the full list</a>. Brave Translate is currently available for desktop and Android (v1.45), with iOS support coming in a future update.</p>
<p>Chromium’s native translation service caches user translation requests, passing that data along to Google’s API. Brave Translate, however, is privacy-preserving and enables users to privately translate websites in over 100 languages, without exposing browsing activity. Brave uses a self-hosted server and the Lingvanex translation engine to power translations, which means no caching, and no feeding your translation requests to privacy-threatening models.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our blog posts regarding releases <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a>, the Zcash network is processing a significantly increased number of shielded transactions. The network remains stable and secure, transactions are being processed normally, and we are making additional performance improvements in 5.3.0 to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the <code>zcashd</code> node.</p>



<p>ECC’s No. 1 priority at the moment is updating the Zcash protocol and our wallet SDKs to help third-party providers fix wallet syncing issues. An increased on-chain transaction load has resulted in unacceptable sync times for many everyday users, and ecosystem partners are also affected. We are focused — across teams — on alleviating these issues as soon as possible, so Zcash users have an experience they expect and deserve. Our immediate objectives are centered on working with third-party wallets that are built on the ECC SDKs (Edge, Nighthawk and Unstoppable) as well as continuing to make improvements to node performance and memory usage.</p>



 Wallet Performance Improvements 



<p><code>zcashd 5.2.0</code> improved the performance of wallet scanning with multithreaded batched trial decryption of Sapling outputs. However, for some nodes this resulted in growing memory usage that would eventually cause an OOM abort. We have identified the cause of the growth, and made significant improvements to reduce the memory usage of the batch scanner. In addition, the batch scanner now has a memory limit of 100 MiB.</p>



<p><code>zcashd</code> now reports the following new metrics when <code>-prometheusport</code> is set:</p>



  (counter) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.outputs.scanned</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.size.transactions</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.usage.bytes</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.synced.block.height</code>  



 RPC Interface 



  The <code>finalorchardroot</code> field in the <code>getblock</code> result and the <code>orchard.commitments.finalRoot</code> field in the <code>z_gettreestate</code> result have been changed to match the byte ordering used for the <code>orchard.anchor</code> field in the <code>getrawtransaction</code> result. These previously produced different hash values from the orchard.anchor field due to having been byte-flipped in their internal representation in <code>zcashd</code>.  



<p>The binaries for the 5.3.0 release will be available on our download site shortly and the <a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/">Zcash Schedule page</a> has been updated to reflect this release.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the latest round of partners that joined Brave’s Wallet Partner program this month. Since its June debut, the Wallet Partner program has onboarded 62 DApps, and promoted their use among Brave Wallet users through Brave Ads and other Brave-owned properties. In addition to our program partners, dozens more DApps are following suit by integrating Brave Wallet outside the program, helping to organically spread the word about Brave’s built-in secure multi-chain wallet.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet Partners, check out past announcements:</p>
 
 <a>June</a> 
 <a>July</a> 
 <a>August</a> 
 <a>September</a> 
 
<p>This month’s newest additions feature:</p>

 ACryptoS 
<p><a href="https://medium.com/acryptos">ACryptoS</a> is a multi-chain yield optimizer whose core offering is auto-compounding Single-Token Vaults, which use unique strategies to increase DeFi yield without the risk of impermanent loss. The vaults first launched on BNB Chain, but are now deployed across Avalanche, Fantom, Gnosis, Cronos, and more. Their mission is to build a better, safer DeFi world where their users can sleep soundly while their deposits earn yield.</p>

 BadgerDAO 
<p><a href="https://badger.com/">Badger</a> is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate the growth of Bitcoin in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) across multiple blockchains. It is an ecosystem where projects and people from all across DeFi can collaborate and build together. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives, while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties.</p>

 Compound 
<p>The <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol is a decentralized and autonomous interest rate protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The core use cases are borrowing assets and earning interest. Compound is one of the first DeFi protocols on Ethereum and currently holds ~$2.3 billion worth of liquidity in smart contracts. Compound III, its newest deployment, enables users to supply a supported collateral asset like WBTC and borrow USDC against it, in addition to earning interest if they supply USDC. Governance of the protocol is decentralized such that COMP token holders can propose or vote on code upgrades. Discord, Twitter, and the comp.xyz forums are where the community publicly discusses protocol development.</p>

 Cronos ID 
<p><a href="https://cronosid.xyz/">Cronos ID</a> is the identity and communication layer on top of  <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos. The Cronos ID Domain Service enables users to associate a unique human-readable “.cro” domain with their crypto wallet address. In the coming weeks, the Cronos ID Notification Service and the Cronos ID Messaging Service will enable peer-to-peer and DApp-to-consumer communication using only wallet addresses. Cronos ID is incubated by  <a href="https://cronoslabs.org/">Cronos Labs</a>, the ecosystem accelerator of Cronos Chain.</p>

 DappRadar

<p>We’re proud to announce that Panther has joined the <a href="https://www.leadingprivacy.com/">Leading Privacy Alliance</a>, an initiative aspiring to be a DAO unifying leading Web3 companies around the shared goal of improving privacy in crypto and beyond. The Leading Privacy Alliance was launched on October 9th, leading to Devcon Bogota, and Panther is among the first companies to join this initiative.<br></p><p>The LPA has been established to address the issue currently facing everyone involved in the Web3 space –how to make working privacy-first an industry standard. The alliance seeks to educate end-users and clients on the importance of the right to privacy, not because there might be something to hide, but for privacy is essential to freedom.<br></p><p>The alliance was founded by <a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Blockwallet</a>, <a href="https://dusk.network/">Dusk Network</a>, and <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPR</a>. Panther is, alongside Omnia, the first company to join. Panther’s Senior Architect Adam Spiers gave a talk during the launch event, explaining the reasons for Panther to join this movement.</p><blockquote><p>Making <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/private?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#private</a> scalable blockchain protocol for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Web3</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeFi</a> applications is how <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ZKPanther</a> contributes to an holistic and interoperable approach of privacy, shares <a href="https://twitter.com/adamspiers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adamspiers</a>. <a href="https://t.co/oarcKILrWJ">pic.twitter.com/oarcKILrWJ</a></p>— Leading Privacy (@LeadingPrivacy) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeadingPrivacy/status/1579246326625488896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>As a project that aims to enable trust and privacy in the DeFi space, it is a natural fit for Panther to join the Leading Privacy Alliance. We strongly believe that the sector's stakeholders need to form a coalition to defend the right to privacy.<br></p><p>Web3 deeply needs to be a borderless platform where members can unite, create a shared voice representing the entire industry, and exchange experiences and ideas.<br></p><p>We’re looking forward to playing our part in advocating for privacy and seeking clarity on privacy regulations.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 How Online Privacy Concerns Today is Rooted in the Internet’s Early Days<br> <p>Bitcoin is at the forefront of future-thinking approaches to payments, investing and a range of other applications that extend far beyond its role as a digital currency. While Bitcoin represents the future of digital currency, its prioritization of censorship resistance has links back to the cypherpunk movement, which first emerged in the 1980s and became prevalent in the 1990s as internet adoption began to pick up steam. <br></p><p>Tracing contemporary privacy concerns back to early online privacy activists can be an enlightening way to develop a sense of where Bitcoin may be headed in the future. Some of the top figures who advocate for online privacy, including Timothy May, have links to the original cypherpunk movement. Assange penned the 2012 book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cypherpunks-Freedom-Internet-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869085">Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet</a>, which bolstered mainstream awareness of the cypherpunk movement. <br></p><p>Cypherpunks tend to believe in the power of cryptography and other online privacy strategies centered around combating widespread digital surveillance. For decades, cypherpunks have been designing strategies and platforms to preserve online privacy for those who recognize its importance. Let’s dive into the history of the cypherpunk movement and how its adherents and principles are having a continued impact on the Bitcoin landscape.</p> Who Were the Original Cypherpunks? <p>In the early nineties, a group of computer scientists, programmers, and cryptographers assembled with mathematician Eric Hughes in order to discuss what they saw as the looming threat of increased surveillance facilitated by the burgeoning internet infrastructure. These early internet activists shared a libertarian sensibility—believing that the state should hold only minimal involvement in citizens’ private lives. The cypherpunk movement grew out of monthly meetings between this group and its name was a play on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> genre of science fiction coined by Jude Milhon, which itself drew influence from early hacker culture. <br></p><p>The group created the first anonymous remailer, &nbsp;the cypherpunk mailing list, in which they developed visionary ideas about online privacy. Tim May—who previously worked at Intel—was a founding member and prolific contributor to the cypherpunks electronic mailing list. He also put forth the idea of tools enabling anonymous browsing of the web as well as the idea of anonymous online marketplaces and anonymous whistleblowing systems—all of which are ideas that have seen a number of applications in the years since. The cypherpunks communicated in a brash, jargon-laden style, and their mailing list grew into a core hub of the discussion and development of online privacy strategies. The mailing list became defunct in the early 2000s, but by then the movement was fully up and running and had developed anonymous ways of communicating and sharing resources online.</p> Is the Cypherpunk Movement Active Today? <p>In his work “<a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</a>” Eric Hughes wrote “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” Frequently, politicians and those who run large social media companies assert that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy">privacy can no longer be expected online</a>, and that only those who have something to hide should be worried about being watched. As Glenn Greenwald pointed out in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en">an influential TedTalk about online privacy in 2014</a>, we make countless choices every day about what we choose to reveal and obscure from others in our lives and we should protect our right to be able to do so online.<br></p><p>Many online privacy-minded applications and initiatives were either created by people with links to the original cypherpunk movement, or were directly inspired by its philosophies. As mentioned, Julian Assange was an active member of the cypherpunk mailing list and his WikiLeaks organization was directly inspired by the cypherpunk focus on the need for anonymous whistleblowing resources. Other influential people associated with the cypherpunk ideologies include Jacob Appelbaum, who was not involved with creating the cypherpunk mailing list but was later a core member of the team that developed the open-source anonymous communication platform, Tor; Adam Back, who created Hashcash (a proof-of-work algorithm) and Blockstream (a company providing products and services built around Bitcoin), and Bram Cohen, who created BitTorrent. <br></p><p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper using concepts that drew directly from the work of Adam Back, with whom Nakamoto had been in contact. In Bitcoin’s whitepaper, Nakamoto referenced the revolutionary concept of a currency in which transactions are publicly viewable while utilizing private keys to sign unique transactions. Bitcoin was a leap forward in the development of the kind of cryptocurrency first posited by the cypherpunk movement.</p> Recent Cypherpunk Developments <p>Much of the appeal of Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies is centered around the values championed by the cypherpunk movement. Decentralized, anonymous currency rooted in cryptography offers resistance to unnecessary (and ultimately corrupt) government interference. Ideally, cryptocurrencies place privacy and transacting power back into the hands of individuals who are able to control what information they share. <br></p><p>Alongside the continued growth and development of Bitcoin—which maintains its cypherpunk-influenced integrity—there has also been a movement towards cryptocurrencies that have moved away from decentralized models. In the interest of mainstream growth and adoption, they stray from the individual privacy efforts that are central to the cypherpunk vision. Converting centralized (fiat) currency into Bitcoin often requires the use of centralized exchanges and the regulations these entail, which typically degrade users’ privacy. Many new Bitcoin users utilize centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, which collect extensive personal information and have policies that threaten transaction privacy. <br><br>Bitcoin is central to the development of a forward-thinking movement towards individuals holding the keys to their own Bitcoin. However, there are aspects inherent to Bitcoin that have <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/why-we-work-on-bitcoin-privacy/">privacy concerns that innovators are taking steps to combat</a>. The fact that every Bitcoin transaction and address balance is viewable to anyone on the blockchain is key to the decentralized authentication of Bitcoin transactions, as it avoids the need for middlemen. When each transaction’s details can be viewed, it ensures nobody breaks the rules.<br><br>While Bitcoin addresses are not directly linked to users’ identities, they certainly can be. Once one active address’ identity is revealed, the privacy of each party that has engaged in transactions with the compromised address can be threatened. Additionally, “know your customer” requirements from online merchants, which verify users’ identities over time as a security function, can disturb users’ privacy when ostensibly anonymous transactions are connected to these transactions.</p> Coinjoin as a Contemporary Cypherpunk Innovation <p>An important concept when it comes to Bitcoin’s ability to provide an anonymous and private payment method is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-is-the-bridge-to-bitcoin-fungibility/">fungibility</a>. Fungibility refers to the ability of an asset to be exchanged freely for the same denomination of the same asset. For instance, an unmarked $20 bill’s value does not depend on the bill’s provenance. On the other hand, non-fungible stores of value include artworks, which are unique and where previous ownership is factored into an item’s worth. <br><br>Bitcoin is designed to be a fully fungible currency, but this can be threatened when certain coins can be linked through their transaction history to an unscrupulous user or exchange. One technique associated with restoring fungibility for Bitcoin users is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/how-coinjoins-fix-bitcoin-privacy/">Coinjoin</a>. Coinjoin is an obfuscation strategy that severs the tie between previous transactions by joining coins together, which effectively anonymizes them. <br><br>CoinJoin activity itself can be viewed on the blockchain and there is still a limit to the success of this obfuscation strategy. Some users may feel that coins that have undergone this process are undesirable. For this reason, the widespread adoption of Coinjoin may be necessary in order to create a situation <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/methods-for-the-destigmatization-of-coinjoin/">where obfuscation is destigmatized</a> and seen as a privacy-retaining tool, rather than as a sign of suspicious activity.<br><br>The growing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is an example of destigmatization of this nature, as the link between Bitcoin and anonymous online marketplaces like Silk Road (wherein users paid in bitcoin for goods and services that were illegal in certain jurisdictions) became less of a focus.</p> Wasabi Wallet as a Tool for Cypherpunks <p>One groundbreaking tool that goes a long way towards making Bitcoin adhere to the privacy standards that the original cypherpunks strove for is <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a>—a privacy-focused, non-custodial Bitcoin wallet. Wasabi Wallet uses Coinjoin obfuscation and integrates <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> as a strategy to prevent network deanonymization attacks. <br><br>One challenge faced by Bitcoin wallet developers is how to ensure the privacy of users while also making wallets user-friendly and accessible to those without extensive technical knowledge. The original cypherpunk movement was composed of developers, programmers, mathematicians, and cryptographers. The movement’s motto — “cypherpunks write code” — refers both to the programming skills of the community and the focus on encryption. These days, widespread adoption among those without specialized knowledge is the goal of many developers of Bitcoin-related tools. <br><br>Wasabi Wallet is a desktop wallet, which tends to allow for more robust software than mobile offerings. It prevents third party access to users’ wallet information, increased fungibility provided by Coinjoin technology, and offers the privacy benefits of the Tor onion network.<br><br>The recently-launched <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi2-0-released/">Wasabi Wallet 2.0</a> provides a revamped interface. Wasabi Wallet lets users choose between three coinjoin strategies, depending on whether their main priority is maximizing privacy, maximizing speed or minimizing costs. Users can easily view their wallet’s privatization progress and can also implement Discreet Mode, which further hides sensitive information. <br><br>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to naturally attract those who value online privacy and who see the benefits of being in control of how information is collected and distributed. Wasabi makes it easy to send and receive Bitcoin with more privacy than other services suited to average bitcoin users. Coinjoin and other anonymization strategies implemented by Wasabi are paving the way towards a landscape in which it’s possible for all Bitcoin users to be cypherpunks, even without specialized knowledge. <br><br><br></p>

<p>Regardless of the industry or vertical, organisations have a huge amount of compliance obligations that must be followed to avoid penalties or closures and ensure continuity of service. How are these compliance obligations managed, and is there any room for improvement?</p>



 Traditional compliance management 



<p>Traditionally, observations and measurements have been captured using manual, paper-based forms. These forms have proven to be difficult and complex to use, and often suffer from inaccuracies as a result of these inherent problems.</p>



<p>Data collection and management with paper forms can be an inaccurate and labour-intensive process. Data is often key punched twice and then reviewed for missed, out-of-range, or erroneous responses — an inefficient validation process that can be time-consuming and inaccurate.</p>



<p>Handheld Computers, A Feasible Alternative to Paper Forms for Field Data Collection, University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Luckily, these paper-based forms quickly got replaced by their digital counterparts as soon as these alternatives became available. This move to digital forms solved many of the problems paper-based forms suffered from and proved to be much easier to use. Better data entry, less use of paper, and a reduced cost are only some of their features.</p>



<p>While digital forms revolutionised the process of being compliant, they did not come without a cost. The recorded data has to be stored and shared with the relevant regulatory bodies for review and sign-off, which sounds simple in theory but has shown to be rather difficult in practice. Records can be erased, servers can become corrupted, data formats change and data loss can become a huge issue for businesses. Organisations are now beginning to harness new and emerging technologies to solve these issues and ensure transparency and compliance.</p>



 Enabling compliance using blockchain technology 



<p>Blockchain technology has been deemed to be critical for the future of data storage by some, and for good reason. It introduces features like immutability, security, and decentralisation, allowing organisations to verify events, timestamp actions, and ensure real-time compliance.</p>



<p>Blockchain is starting to gain adoption and momentum, as new high-powered protocols have emerged. Some of these protocols no longer have transaction fees and are capable of handling much more transactions per second than previous protocols, to support enterprise-grade applications. The potential of blockchain technology seems boundless, but organisations need to be practical in selecting a chain that meets both their compliance and regulatory obligations.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain by Zaisan</a> is a perfect fit for businesses that have security, compliance, and performance on their requirements list. Europechain delivers trust by allowing organisations to harness the power and scalability of robust blockchain technology while complying with EU legislation &amp; regulation.</p>



 Process Timestamping 



<p>A process timestamping tool like <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">FACT by Zaisan</a> manages business processes, captures proof of compliance, and tracks procedures. FACT delivers a versatile toolbox for the recording of events from a wide range of predefined smart form templates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flexible template builder enables the configuration of all types of checklists, including compliance checklists. These checklists are cryptographically hashed and time stamped on Europechain to increase security, visibility, and transparency. In addition, roles and activities can be assigned to enable task distribution and increase management awareness of task completion.</p>



<p>FACT is a multi-industry application with an intuitive user interface, allowing for fast and efficient onboarding. Furthermore, FACT has flexible team settings to facilitate the segregation of tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are just some of the use cases for FACT.</p>



  Real-estate technical inspections  Food safety and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) compliance  Equipment maintenance-checks  Asset tracking  Road-safety management programs  Lean-six-sigma routines  Supplier/contractor-performance management  Safety management  



<p>FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees, with the added benefit of having all events timestamped and added to Zaisan to ensure transparency and completion of time-sensitive tasks. The feature-rich system also allows for visibility through notifications and the reporting dashboard, which can aid in providing insight into team performance and task delivery.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  FACT is a highly flexible, blockchain-based, mobile tool to manage business processes, capture proof of compliance, and track procedures  FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees  FACT offers multiple uses cases, including -but not limited to- HACCP compliance, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">compliance management</a>, asset tracking, safety management, and many others  Europechain is a perfect fit for businesses whose priorities are security, compliance, and performance

Their discussion is not just a journey through time (long cycles of computing, web2 to web3) and place (LA, SF, NYC), but into "the age of wonders". Are we at the end of (computing) history, or the beginning?</p><p>For more on the latest in web3 trends, be sure to subscribe to our podcast “<a>web3 with a16z</a>” (which is hosted by Sonal Choksi, the longtime former showrunner of this show) wherever you listen to your pods.</p>

 Scala Project — Diardi Elections <p>We know that you’ve all been patiently waiting for news from us regarding Diardi V8 (the next iteration of our network implementation) and the future of our project, and we’ve got something exciting for&nbsp;you!</p><p>As most of you know, we have planned to implement a staked election system for the Diardi Operators since its inception.</p><p>Now, after months of development effort, we present to you the Diardi Election Application as well as the process of how we will let everyone stake their XLA to try and get a spot on the Diardi operators list.</p> What are the Diardi Operators? <p>So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, the Diardi operators are the ones who will produce blocks on the same chain (every 4th block) using a known address. Contrary to the pure Nakamoto consensus, this brings up the issue of decentralization. That’s where the catch lies: at the moment, if you look at the network, it’s being dominated by 2 or sometimes even just one&nbsp;pool.</p><p>This in itself is not that bad, as all (most) pool operators have been very open and cooperative with us. But the problem doesn’t end there. What if, by sheer chance, this one very large pool were to be attacked? Doesn’t that mean our entire network is now at the mercy of this one lonely server? To combat this, we thought to decentralize this issue by letting a group of members outside of the mining community publish blocks as checkpoint blocks.</p><p>A lot of 51%-attacks revolve around a pool mining a large number of blocks in private and releasing their largest chain to the public network, thereby rendering an entire set of blocks useless. This is very hard to do with Diardi in place, as the malicious pool operator (or the hacker of this malicious pool) must not only have a massive amount of compute power but also have colluded with many Diardi operators as well to conduct an&nbsp;attack.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>It’s pretty simple, actually. To ensure that the Diardi operators applicants are also worthy Diardi operators, we will have staked elections.</p><blockquote>Staked elections involve a user putting up a certain amount of XLA that he holds to showcase that he has the most monetary stake in the chain and thus more than anyone else to lose if the chain may be attacked.</blockquote>A screenshot showcasing the election application<p>We will take a snapshot of the Scala chain with all the user balances on October 31st, 2022. Users will get access to a special remote node that they can connect to with their seeds to send their vXLA (since this is now a forked chain) to our voting application; once the election period of 2 weeks is over, we will select the first Diardi operators (32 or 64) depending on the number of candidates.</p><p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Please remember that balances sitting on exchanges will NOT be counted as your coins, and you will not be able to send that to the election application. So please move your coins to your own wallet before the snapshot date and move them back to the exchange after, if you’d like to, once the snapshot has concluded.</p> Compensation <p>The Diardi operators who get elected will be allowed to run Diardi nodes, providing them with 25% of all produced&nbsp;blocks.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are curious to know more about how Diardi works, check our Wiki: <a href="https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi">https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi</a></p><p>As usual, let us know on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">Discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">Telegram</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/scala-project-diardi-elections-c5467832c4df">Scala Project — Diardi Elections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 💡Validator Spotlight — Octeka&nbsp;💡  Validator Spotlights showcase the amazing people working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain.  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>Hello, my name is Patrick, I’m from Quebec/Canada, and I run the Octeka validator on&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>I’ve been in the gaming industry for almost 20 years, working on a lot of well-known titles for companies like 2K and Ubisoft. I’ve worked in various roles, but my main ones were Build Master and Engine/Tools Programmer.</p><p>Also, I have some great experience in cloud computing and building cloud architecture from the bare metal. I do have a full server rack at home running OpenStack with Kubernetes, compiling code, running builds, and yes, also validating.</p><p>I’m very passionate about all technology-related stuff, and cryptocurrencies are one of my main interests.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>In the early days of ETH, a friend of mine was pushing blockchain mining, so I decided to build myself a mining rig and try my hand at&nbsp;it.</p><p>Even though Web3 has grown a lot, I still believe we are in its early days, still exploring/pushing its potential. So, I wanted to be part of the next big thing, and I think this is&nbsp;it.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>I’ve been playing around with Solidity to interact with smart contracts and went to the bottom of it by creating some&nbsp;.net and golang tools that helped me learn most of it. I might use that knowledge to build an app or a game, not sure which&nbsp;yet!</p><p>I’m also currently running a validator on both Findora and Harmony using multiple nodes at different locations to make sure to have good uptime, with metrics and alerts set up in case of emergencies.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? Why should delegators stake with&nbsp;you? <p>Like most of my fellow validators, we are here to provide a solid, reliable validating service to anyone who would like to stake with&nbsp;us.</p><p>We have servers located in Canada, the United States, and also in Europe for redundancy and reliability.</p><p>Also, we keep a close look at our servers metrics, to make sure we always have the proper hardware and that everything is running smoothly. We use an alerting system to make sure we respond as quickly as possible to any problem that could&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Right now, we don’t have any commission fees, but when it happens, it will never go higher than 5%, and the gains will be used to stake on other validators.</p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>Like some of us, we learned about Findora from the Harmony.ONE community, and we liked the key idea of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Also, things seem to be moving for the chain, and it seems to have more and more communications every week, so we believe that bringing our validating experience to this chain is a great next step for&nbsp;us.</p> 6) Where can our community go to learn more about you or contact you? Do you have a validator dashboard link? <p>We are currently building our website, but we are always reachable through Twitter or Telegram (@octeka_one).

 <br> <p>In his work “<a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</a>” Eric Hughes wrote, “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” The weight of this comment may not be immediately obvious but is increasingly relevant in our day-to-day lives.<br><br>The importance of online privacy is relevant to everyone—not just users who are looking to avoid the scrutiny of authorities for reasons related to questionable activities. Even users who are comfortable with having their every move online tracked should be aware that large data breaches regularly occur at major companies and governments. These events expose users’ personal data to hackers, which can be exploited in various ways.</p> Everyone on the Internet Should Understand Online Privacy. But do they even care?<br> <p>As a journalist and online privacy advocate, Glenn Greenwald pointed out in a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en">widely-circulated </a>2014 TED talk that the Internet was, at one time, thought of as a new frontier for democratization and liberation. According to Greenwald, the internet could now be considered a "zone for mass surveillance". <br><br>Greenwald claims that some feel there’s no harm in mass online surveillance because it only threatens those who are engaging in illegal activities. This line of thinking includes the idea that only those who have something to hide should be concerned about their privacy. It frames the notion that some people wouldn’t want to share every aspect of their lives with the government as defensive behavior. In 2010, Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, claimed that privacy should not even be expected online as it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy">no longer a social norm</a>. This is a dangerous belief, which unfortunately seems widely accepted in mainstream narratives despite its negative effects on individual liberties. Why should one care about privacy? Is one truly free to speak without it?<br><br><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/373338/global-opinion-concern-online-privacy/">According to one study published in 2022</a>, more than half of internet users are concerned about their online privacy. Let’s take a look at some key concepts and terms relevant to online privacy and steps users can take to better control and protect their data.</p> Important Concepts Linked to Online Privacy <p>Common concerns that relate to online privacy may include the preservation of sensitive personal and financial data and users having a say in who they are advertised to.</p> Personal Data <p>Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you. It can include your name, address, social insurance number, birthday and can also extend to your entire financial, educational, employment and medical history. Information including online identifiers and browsing history can also be considered personal information. One qualifier that defines personal data is that it is <a href="https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/the-gdpr-what-exactly-is-personal-data">clearly about one particular person</a>. <br></p><p>Personal data is considered valuable by advertisers and regulatory bodies alike, and the collection and sharing of users’ personal data is an important aspect of how many companies and apps are configured. Personal data is collected by websites, social media platforms, employers and more. This data is stored on web servers across the world, often changing hands in ways that are unknown by the users themselves. The selling of data is often part of the fine print and terms of service when using apps and websites, and is defined under things like GDPR or CCPA.Such regulations are often thought of as privacy friendly, but really only state that you have to consent to the sale of your personal data.</p> Online Encryption <p>One step that users can take to make themselves less vulnerable online and to put their privacy more into their own hands, is by focusing on apps and software that offer encryption. Encryption refers to the scrambling of the data stored and shared online, aiming to allow only trusted entities to interact with personal data. <br>Encryption ensures that only those with the relevant access keys are able to view the related content. It allows users to have more, but not ultimate, security over the information they share. Using a secret passphrase known only to the sender and receiver to unlock information is an excellent way to improve your security.<br><br>End-to-end encryption refers to encryption wherein only a user and their intended recipient are communicating without the ability of even the communication service to view or collect users’ data. While some messaging services are said to offer end-to-end encryption, some online security advocates challenge these claims as the services may provide “backdoor” access to government bodies. Oftentimes, the justification for this is to collect data necessary for fighting crime.</p> Threats to Online Privacy <p>When it comes to ways of protecting personal data, there are steps that individuals can take to decrease the risk of security breaches and minimize the amount of information readily available to unwanted external parties. Tools from ethical, security-minded companies can help users store and share data with more control, making use of the latest web security technology.<br><br>While taking steps at the individual level can enhance users’ online privacy, there are policies at the institutional level that can make it difficult to avoid the collection and sharing of personal data. In these cases, simply learning about policies and programs that involve your personal data is a way of being more aware of circumstances when your data could be collected, and of knowing how it could be used.</p> Mass Surveillance <p>Signing up for any new online account or app often involves agreeing to a range of terms and conditions wherein users permit organizations to collect agreed-upon information in exchange for the use of the application. Whether it’s on computers or phones and whether or not users are aware of what information is being collected, government bodies and private organizations alike are able to create detailed profiles of people based on data they willingly provide to websites. Often, users don’t even read the terms and conditions when signing up for a new service. <br><br>Controlling the amount your private data is collected may be increasingly relevant as smart cities that adopt surveillance technologies become more prevalent. Mindful online conduct may include making a list of each of the accounts and online services you subscribe to and determining whether the information you knowingly provide to each of these entities is worth the benefits of each service.</p> Online Privacy Regulations <p>Data breaches affecting companies as large as Facebook have sparked conversations as to the degree of involvement government policies should have regarding the collection and use of personal data. While government regulation is often necessary to lay the foundation for public market participation, the excess of such is also a risk factor that commonly limits progress.<br><br>As whistleblower disclosures have shown, government bodies themselves may also collect and use data in ways that average internet users could not have anticipated or foreseen. In the United States, for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">all phone and internet data has been monitored by Federal law enforcement since the ‘90s</a>. This data is unfathomably vast, so agencies including the NSA and the FBI create systems that analyze this data for use by intelligence and local law enforcement agencies.<br></p> Software Vulnerabilities and Secure Protocols <p>There are a number of security risks associated with typical internet usage. Free, public Wi-Fi is becoming increasingly available—which is a boon for those who work on the go and those with limited data plans—but these free, public Wi-Fi networks can be easy targets for those seeking access to users’ personal data for nefarious purposes. <br><br>Adversaries can access unsecured devices on public networks, which can provide unfettered access to important personal information including credit card data, passwords and personal documents. When users’ privacy settings allow for file-sharing across a network, it’s an opportunity for hackers to implant malware on users’ devices, further compromising their online privacy.<br><br>There are steps diligent users can take to make themselves less vulnerable when using unsecured networks. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> (virtual private network) creates a private network on top of an existing public network, improving security. VPNs also often include encryption, making stolen data less useful to hackers. <br><br>HTTPS is a protocol that helps to protect data by preventing access from parties aside from the primary user and the server they’re accessing, using encryption and a series of communication exchanges referred to as a “handshake.” Other security-minded steps include turning off sharing on devices on public networks and keeping Wi-Ffi off, aside from when it’s being used as devices are known to transmit some data even to networks users aren’t connected to.</p> Online Privacy and Bitcoin <p>Bitcoin is seen by many as being a new frontier for digital privacy. Its potential for decentralization means that users have more ability to control their own data and to have more agency in controlling decisions that relate to their privacy. <br><br>However, Bitcoin transactions are, by design, not confidential. Transactions on the block chain are secure, but their details are publicly viewable. When bitcoin is obtained in a way that is linked in some way to a user’s identity, and when information about transactions is shared, its pseudonymity in future transactions is easily negated. For example, if a user makes an online purchase using bitcoin, but does so through a regulated exchange which requires the completion of KYC processes, then pseudonymity can easily be compromised.<br><br>There are inherent issues associated with many bitcoin exchanges and users may be left with a sense of uncertainty with regards to how their personal data is being used. Developers may be able to collect sensitive personal information and the exchanges themselves are vulnerable to hacks, as seen in the Mt. Gox debacle and many since.</p> Wasabi 2.0 <p>Initiatives like <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a>—which offer anonymous communication using the Tor network, coin mixing and non-custodial personal control over private keys—can go a long way towards putting users in control of their bitcoin and retaining their privacy online. <br><br>The anonymization strategy employed by Wasabi Wallet and other Bitcoin privacy solutions is called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coinjoin.asp">coinjoin</a>. Coinjoins are a collaborative bitcoin transaction. Users send their bitcoins to themselves with other users at the same time to reclaim their privacy. When the transaction occurs, everyone’s bitcoins are mixed with one another to make it much harder, if not impossible, to trace their transaction history.<br><br>As technology continues to grow into nearly every aspect of our lives, privacy as a resource is growing more scarce. We recommend the use of privacy tools, like Wasabi Wallet, to maintain your right to privacy. Consider taking control of your personal information to defend yourself from the intended (and unintended) repercussions of our increasingly digitised society.</p>
