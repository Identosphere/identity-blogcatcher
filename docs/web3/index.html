<p>I’ve been spending much of my time in recent months working to better understand the strategies being employed around swarm intelligence and complex adaptive systems. The goal is to catalyze emergent behavior through digital social engineering. I’m dropping in quickly this morning in to re-share two long talks I did about Twitter. At this point any researcher or influencer who centers Dorsey or Musk is, intentionally or not, obscuring the deep institutional structures from which the field of social physics emerged. IMO people would be better served by looking into the work of Sandy Pentland and John Clippinger on the Open Mustard Seed project and “self-sovereign” digital identity. If you want to avoid being managed, stop chasing the behaviorist pellets the feed is dropping you. You’re already tagged in the simulation.</p>
<p>Feature image from Pentland’s 2014 presentation at Google <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMBl0ttu-Ow">here</a>.</p>

<p>TBH I believe the Neuralink hype is a distraction. While I’m not convinced those in power will ultimately be able to manipulate the mind or create group minds, this conversation between <a href="https://research.protocol.ai/authors/juan-benet/">Juan Benet</a> of Protocol Labs and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/amarbles/www/index.html">Adam Marblestone</a>, a former MIT research scientist and protege of George Church, on non-surgical Brain-Computer Interfaces is probably a more likely scenario. This discussion outlines their thinking on how that research will proceed and how to fund it.</p>

<p>Brands are navigating the new Web3 world, and its opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and engaging consumers in entirely new ways. In this season of <a>The Brave Marketer Podcast</a>, we’re discussing Web3 marketing and how to market in the metaverse.</p>
<p>The first episode of season 6 features an interview from Avery Akkineni, President of <a href="https://vayner3.com/">Vayner3</a>, a Web3 consultancy launched alongside serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. Avery covers a wide range of pressing topics such as:</p>
 
 The difference between stunt campaigns and always-on marketing in the metaverse, and what it will take to succeed in Web3 channels. 
 Web 2.5, and why it’s going to be a game changer in 2023. 
 The best partnerships and activations that have happened in the metaverse so far. 
 
<p>Topics in this new 10-episode season include crypto marketing, privacy, cookieless advertising, the blockchain, and more. You’ll hear from marketers from some of the biggest brands and agencies including MintDropz, PlayEmber, Dentsu, and Skiff.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>In this new season, we’ll tackle the tough questions facing marketers today such as:</p>
 
 How do you advertise in the metaverse? 
 Is the timing right to jump in, or is it better to wait? 
 What should marketers ask when evaluating a metaverse strategy? 
 
<p>Listen to the trailer for Season 6 here:</p>

<p>The Brave Marketer podcast is hosted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnydvorin/">Donny Dvorin</a>, VP, Head of Sales at Brave Software—the makers of the privacy-respecting Web browser with a built-in ads platform that rewards users for their attention with the Basic Attention Token.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today I head up to Tempe, AZ where I plan to spend a few days exploring the campus of Arizona State University, the playground of Michael Crow, founding board chair of In-Q-Tel. The school is a center of technological education and life gaming chock full of researchers tasked with delving into bioengineering, complexity theory, big-data “sustainability,” and new forms of participatory governance. Read the latter as kubernetes / cybernetics where we end up tokenized agents, components trapped in a global ant computer. I’m hoping to stop at the University of Arizona’s historic mathematical models display and the Tucson Presidio before hitting I-10, a testbed for driverless truck platoons. Is this what it feels like to live under a blanket of math?</p>
<p>Views of the saguaro cacti standing tall against the blue skies and the burnished golden hills are a balm for the soul. No, the game isn’t over.</p>
<p>Before I pack, I wanted to share a seven-minute clip I pulled from the November 29 meeting of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in which board member Hillary Ronen poignantly and firmly opposed giving official authorization to the police department to use bomb carrying robots to kill humans with government approval. After several hours of pointed debate the authorization eventually passed with eight in favor and three opposed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason I took the time to watch all 2.5 hours of the testimony last night is that earlier in the day I’d been researching Arizona policy around autonomous vehicle testing, and I came across recent legislation for a new form of vehicle they’ve called “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Neighborhood-Ocupantless-Electric-Vehicles-Arizona.png">Neighborhood Occupantless Electric Vehicle</a>” that is not intended for humans either as drivers or passengers. The vehicles are supposed to operate at 45 miles per hour or less on regular city streets. Folks, they may call these vehicles, but they are in fact mobile robots.</p>
<p></p>
<p>How will they be used? Well, Jason and I encountered “cute” miniature versions on the campus of the University of Arizona delivering GrubHub purchases to students in dorms. Unlike Kiwibots, which are remotely piloted for paltry wages by South American workers, the Cartken use AI to “learn” their surroundings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I started to build out my relationship map for Tucson, the importance of its legacy in defense research became very clear. First, of course, were the Apache wars, but in 1951 Howard Hughes brought a missile factory to the city. I’m actually treating myself to a tour of a Titan Missile Silo next week for my birthday. Now that they’ve weaponized space and set up next-gen nuclear for the human+ isotope nano-transducer global brain project, that silo has been decommissioned and turned into a National Historic Site.</p>
<p><a href="https://tucson.com/1951-hughes-aircraft-comes-to-town/article_539f8cca-4205-11e5-a218-cf62caadf8ea.html"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://titanmissilemuseum.org/"></a></p>
<p>After Hughes’s death, Hughes Aircraft’s assets eventually transferred to Raytheon. Raytheon and Lockheed’s offices remain tucked in against the airport on Valencia St on the south side of town. These days emerging defense-tech revolves around autonomous and remote-operated weapons coordinated through teaming – man and machine. Recently Lockheed ran an operation with their autonomous helicopter working in coordination with a Squad Mission Support System, a robust driverless platform developed by the US Army’s tank R&amp;D unit in Michigan. It doesn’t require a lot of imagination to see where this is all headed. Hollywood’s been making movies about it for the past thirty years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3QYBvxzE8HLv8UqB9"></a></p>
<p>That is exactly like what was described during the discussion in the San Francisco Board of Supervisors’ chambers.</p>
<p>Hillary Ronen was correct in saying we are opening a Pandora’s box. For the sake of “safety” and “convenience” we are bringing remote killing to our own back yards. The US war machine’s drone strikes have come home to roost. The fact that in that room the vast majority of supposed liberals were emphatic in their embrace of advanced weaponry shows how flimsy their facade of social care is. I guess we can thank them for making it so very clear for us.</p>
<p>The first response to my clip was an inane comment deriding Ronen, the woman who took a brave stand against the rising robot tide. The tone and what was said made it very clear the person hadn’t actually watched the clip. Perhaps drugged by the feed, they felt a need to score political points by pulling out a hammer and pounding on the person on the screen because – well you know – San Francisco… Guys, this is making me so tired. Tired to the point that I don’t want to do this anymore. Stop and be responsible for your own thinking and engagement. Many have handed their sensibilities over to the “alt” media machine. It’s running you on auto-pilot. It’s toxic. I deleted the comment. That person won’t be on my channel any more. Do better.</p>
<p>In order to stand on the right side of history, we must be informed and we must bear witness to what is unfolding. The entire session can be viewed below.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology is relatively young. Bitcoin leveraged decentralised ledger technology back in 2008, and in the early years, only a few people were aware of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, many other projects have adopted this technology, with varying degrees of success. Often, projects don’t go past a proof of concept, and even if they do, the outcome might not be what the project’s proposers intended. It is safe to say that blockchain, as a technology, has not reached maturity.</p>



<p>There are multiple reasons why a blockchain project might fail, or yield a low return on investment (ROI). These reasons include, but are not limited to:</p>



  Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  Steep learning curve  Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations  Lack of vision  Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem  Use of the wrong technology  



<p>This article explores the circumstances that often lead to blockchain projects having a low ROI, and how this can be overcome.</p>







 1. Attempting to apply blockchain to everything  



<p>Decentralised ledger technology does have the capacity to disrupt a fair amount of industries, and in fact, it has already done so, and will likely continue along this path of disruption and innovation for years to come.</p>



<p>But the problem lies in that blockchain, while extremely versatile, is not the right solution for everything. Fledgling entrepreneurs often use it as a buzzword and believe that blockchain will suit their projects, no matter what. Making this assumption without a proper assessment and due research is unwise, to say the least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adopting blockchain technology is a decision not to be taken lightly, and so entrepreneurs, or any business considering the implementation of a decentralised ledger, should look inward and look for the answer to these questions:</p>



<p>Is the legacy system no longer fit for purpose? Has it become too antiquated or expensive to maintain or update? Does the company have a way to obtain reliable data that can be fed into the blockchain?</p>



<p>Even if the answers to these important questions suggest that blockchain technology might be a suitable solution, the implementation of a blockchain network is not for the short term. Businesses must carefully consider the long-term implications, in terms of scalability (will the system be able to scale and accommodate higher numbers of transactions), complexity (does the company have the expertise to implement and maintain the technology), and ongoing costs (more nodes, bandwidth, etc.).</p>



 2. Steep learning curve  



<p>Blockchain technology does require a certain level of expertise. A blockchain is not an off-the-shelf product. Often, they require practical knowledge and expertise in certain programming languages that are specific to a blockchain (Solidity for Ethereum is a prime example of this). While there are millions of software developers out there, only a limited amount have the right skills in blockchain code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to this, the implementation of a decentralised ledger requires expertise in cryptography, smart contract programming, and very importantly, a functioning governance system. The combination of all these factors means that creating and maintaining a thriving blockchain ecosystem does require a steep learning curve.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Compliance pitfalls, including data regulations 



<p>Regulatory compliance can be defined as the acceptance, understanding, and commitment to follow all state, federal, and international laws and regulations that might be applicable and relevant to a company’s operation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Blockchain compliance</a> is therefore a hugely important issue for any business. Adhering and complying with local legal frameworks and regulations helps protect the company’s resources, uphold its brand reputation, and ensure that the company can remain in operation across different markets.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has often found itself at odds with compliance guidelines, particularly in relation to privacy and data sharing, governance, and storage. The implementation of a solid governance framework is essential to the survival of a blockchain project.</p>



 4. Lack of vision  



<p>Entrepreneurs who decide to start a blockchain project just because it is fashionable or because they believe they can make a quick buck are probably doomed from the start. Blockchain is not a buzzword, nor is it a silver bullet that will magically make a product or project succeed. Establishing a thriving blockchain ecosystem is the result of a lot of work by a team of skilled professionals. Lacking a proper vision as to what the project or product should be, its real-world applicability, and the use case it fulfills is likely to lead to failure.</p>



 5. Focus on monetary profit, rather than addressing and solving a problem 



<p>Some entrepreneurs are out to make money, and though financial profit is of course necessary to stay in business, it should not be the primary objective. Projects that overemphasise the bottom line are not likely to be viable in the long term. A blockchain project must provide a real solution for a real problem, rather than manufacturing a non-existent problem to justify the use of a blockchain.</p>



 6. Use of the wrong technology 



<p>There are many blockchains out there: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger, Corda, etc. Often, projects simply use the first one that comes to mind, which is usually Ethereum. Then the realisation sinks in that the gas fees can become incredibly expensive, which means that a business case becomes unreachable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this case, it is often difficult and costly to switch to another blockchain that facilitates a project’s needs better. And while tools such as an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can make it easier to switch to another more suitable blockchain. Picking the right blockchain at the start, whether it’s a <a href="https://zaisan.io/private-public-blockchain/">public or private blockchain</a>, can save a lot of headaches.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Issues like lack of compliance or clear vision, technological challenges, or poor planning can lead to a low ROI, or scupper a blockchain project altogether. It is up to the project creators to take all these factors into account and ensure that the use of blockchain technology is both justified, and sustainable. Because after all, blockchain technology, while a very powerful and versatile tool, cannot function on its own. It requires technical expertise and the right leadership to become a success.</p>







 Key takeaways 



  Blockchain technology is not the answer to every single use case out there  Decentralised ledgers do have a steep learning curve, which might lead to low ROI  Using the wrong blockchain technology can have disastrous results  Legal departments must ensure that blockchain networks are compliant with data sharing and storage regulations  Blockchain projects require a clear vision of the objectives to accomplish  Monetary profit must be supported by the resolution of real-world problems  Projects must conduct careful research to ensure they choose the right blockchain technology for their use case

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  Starting today, Brave Search will feature privacy-preserving ads as part of a global beta program.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Starting today, Brave Search will feature privacy-preserving ads as part of a global beta program. Ads will give users the option to use our independent search engine with ads that don’t track them, or to sign up for ad-free paid search. As with other search engines, Brave Search ads are clearly labeled and are integrated into the search results page. However, Brave Search ads protect users’ data and anonymity, while supporting their access to independent and transparent search as a true alternative to Big Tech search engines.</p>
<p>Ads are a key part of search engines, helping to facilitate the free and open exchange of information on the Web, and to connect users to helpful products and services related to their search terms. Despite their usefulness, most search ads track users and violate their privacy. Brave Search ads are fundamentally different: They provide the same utility minus all the tracking and privacy invasions found in other search ads. They give users a chance to learn about new products and—soon—earn rewards for their attention to those ads.</p>
<p>Brave Search is built on a truly independent index of the Web (one of only a handful of search engines that can make that claim), and recently passed 20 million queries per day, growing faster than any search engine since Bing. Search ads allow Brave to maintain independence as it grows, and do so without giving in to Big Tech’s privacy invasions.</p>





    


    




 Privacy-first ads 
<p>By design, Brave Search ads are anonymous, clearly marked, and follow Brave’s commitment to putting users first, and to ethical and transparent advertising practices. Clicking on Brave Search ads is a fully private experience (unlike the ads on search engines like Google and Bing). Brave Search only uses your search query, country, and device type to show you ads, and does not keep any kind of profile of your searches.</p>

 Search Premium 
<p>For users that don’t want to see ads, Brave is also offering an ad-free experience: <a href="https://account.brave.com/?intent=checkout&amp;product=search">Search Premium</a>. For $3 per month, Brave Search Premium users can continue to enjoy a completely ad-free Search experience, and directly support Brave’s mission to make the Web a more private place with independent search.</p>

 Beta phase and Brave Rewards 
<p>During this beta phase, Brave Search users will see text-based ads in search results. However, during the beta period, Brave users who have opted-in to Brave Private Ads and are using the latest version of Brave will not see Search ads, since these new ad units are not yet eligible for BAT earnings. We’re actively working to integrate Brave Rewards with Brave Search, and hope to make Search ads eligible for BAT earnings in the coming months.</p>
<p>Brave believes in the importance of independent, private Web search, and in putting users in charge of their online experience. Not using Brave Search? Try it now at search.brave.com, or <a href="https://search.brave.com/default">set it as your browser’s default search engine</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to advertise with Brave Search ads, please reach out to <a href="mailto:sales@brave.com">sales@brave.com</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>tl;dr —&nbsp;Today Brave News introduced integrated RSS subscriptions, locally personalized suggestions, new sources and content channels powered by Brave Search, and other improvements. New supported regions include Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the UK.</p>
<p>Big Tech controls the news ecosystem through centralized, Web 2.0-style news aggregation. But this control is waning, particularly as distributed models gain popularity. In many ways, RSS feeds and RSS readers (though not new) are an early instance of Web3-style decentralization. Our hope is that Brave News will make it obvious that a decentralized news ecosystem is far better for users and publishers than what Big Tech offers today.</p>
<p>Brave offers the capabilities users want in a news experience (such as content discovery, feed subscriptions, and personalized suggestions) directly in the browser. There’s no need to rely on centralized servers because all these Brave News features take place solely on your device. This update sets the stage for giving users more control over their news feed and relationships with publishers.</p>
<p>Today’s browser release (desktop version 1.46) includes several Brave News improvements that bring us closer to this vision of a fully decentralized, privacy-preserving news ecosystem, including:</p>
 
 A Follow button in the browser for adding a site’s feed to Brave News 
 New content Channels powered by Brave Search 
 Personalized Suggestions made locally on your device 
 Improved Source Management

<p>Brave News can also use your browser history to personalize the content in your feed. But unlike other browser feeds (such as Google News), Brave’s content personalization happens exclusively in the browser, and none of your browsing data ever leaves your device.</p>
<p>Brave News ranks content you follow highest in your feed, and helps you discover new sources to Follow based on your browsing history and sources you already Follow. Brave identifies sources that are similar to each other and recommends suggestions privately in Settings, where you can choose to Follow and add them to your feed.</p>
<p>Note: Brave’s suggestions service is <a href="https://github.com/brave/source-suggestions">published as an open source project</a> if you want to learn more about how it works.</p>

 Channels and new settings options 
<p>Many users have requested more controls for customizing Brave News. Today’s update improves the way users Follow and Unfollow sources, and we’ve introduced “channels” which are topics or areas of coverage such as Crypto News, Music, and the new Gaming channel. If you’re already a Brave News user, any customizations you’ve made in the previous version of Brave News will automatically appear in the new version, and you’ll also find a much simpler interface for managing sources.</p>

 Brave News around the world 
<p>Brave News is also expanding internationally thanks to Brave Search. By querying Brave Search for the most popular content sources around the world and identifying publishers with public RSS feeds, Brave News now supports language- and region-specific content. In addition to coverage in Japan and the US, new regions now include English for Canada and the UK; Spanish for both Mexico and Spain; and Portuguese for users in Brazil. More languages and regions will be added over the coming months.</p>

 Coming soon: Easily add content to your Brave News Feed 
<p>As you browse publishers’ websites in the Brave browser, you’ll find a new, one-click Follow button. The button is located in the browser address bar and will appear any time you visit a site that provides an RSS feed. Click Follow, and content from that publisher will then appear in Brave News automatically, updating each time your browser fetches the feed.</p>
<p>Note: The new Follow button in the browser address bar will be released later this month. Today’s release is available for desktop users, and iOS will be updated with the new Brave News features in its upcoming 1.46 version. Android will be updated with the new Brave News features soon thereafter.</p>

 What’s next for Brave News 
<p>Many users have requested alternative views of their Brave News feed, such as a more traditional, inbox-style RSS news reader, which we plan to work on soon. We also plan to introduce an ad-free version of Brave News, mobile alerts, cross-platform sync, more import/export options, and some useful integrations with other Brave products and features.</p>
<p>To give Brave News a try and enjoy news and content directly from your browser, simply open a new tab in the Brave browser, and scroll to get started. If you’re not using Brave yet, you can download it now at <a>brave.com/download</a>.</p>

 Today, we’re excited to share the next phase in our journey: <a href="http://privy.io">Privy&nbsp;Auth</a>. <blockquote>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</blockquote><p><a href="http://privy.io">Privy</a> exists to help developers craft delightful products and keep users in control of their assets and data across apps. Since our launch, we’ve been hard at work helping amazing teams like those at <a href="https://www.station.express/">Station</a> and <a href="https://www.violet.co/">Violet</a> manage users’ off-chain data and build user-respecting products. Privy Auth is the next step in this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Our work has inexorably led us here. First, as a recurring request from our customers who already use Privy to secure user emails, social accounts, phone numbers, etc. Second, through a core product requirement: in order to enable users to control data permissions across apps, Privy must be able to authenticate users directly.</p><p>User journeys in Web3 have evolved from discrete, one-time events — like signing a transaction — to continuous interactions with users, involving both on- and off-chain data. For users, this means better products, but it also means developers have to handle much more complexity. This complexity starts at login: wallet connectors are clunky, onboarding flows are confusing to users, and the problem gets worse as the number of chains and wallets grows. To bring web3 mainstream, we have to reshape user onboarding.</p> Enter Privy&nbsp;Auth <p>Privy Auth is a simple library to easily onboard all your users to web3, regardless of whether they already have a wallet, across mobile and&nbsp;desktop.</p><p>We are building Privy Auth around 3 principles:</p>  Crypto for all — Web3 must be built for newcomers and experts alike. The best products will bridge the right UX from web2 and web3 to lower the barrier to entry. This means progressive user onboarding, gradually engaging users as they progress through your app, from first wallet connection to multi-wallet account creation.  User control — All products will involve on- and off-chain data. The best will rely on data portability from app to app to unlock new experiences.This means it must be easy for users to decide what they share with&nbsp;whom.  Self-custody — Self-custody is an essential part of web3. Popular apps will serve as bridges into self-custody, enabling people to take on more control over their assets and data if they so&nbsp;choose.  <p>Privy Auth is live with customers today as part of our early release. It integrates with your favorite libraries like ethers and wagmi; it’s easy to migrate from RainbowKit, Onboard.js or any other wallet connector or auth&nbsp;library.</p><p>Out of the box, Privy Auth gives&nbsp;you</p>  Simple onboarding for all users, with or without wallets, using email and social accounts.  Reliable wallet connectors, optimized for desktop and mobile so you can stop worrying about users getting lost on the way to your&nbsp;app.  A unified user abstraction so you can easily manage all users. Connected, authenticated, multi-wallet, we support all of your&nbsp;users.  <p>If you’re building in web3 and want to delight your users from the first interaction, <a href="https://50fzxaracbi.typeform.com/to/v5gtHb74">we’d love to talk</a>. With just a few lines of code, you can securely onboard all users, whether they have a wallet or not, and get back to focusing on your core&nbsp;product.</p><p>We have a lot more coming and we can’t wait to share more with you soon. Web3 gives us the opportunity to reinvent the data paradigms that have failed us over the last 30 years and give users back control over their data online. This starts at&nbsp;login().</p><p>Team Privy</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/announcing-privy-auth-4754be04c515">Announcing Privy Auth!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Press release: Nym Advisor, Andrés Arauz denounces FATF design guidance on CBDCs and leads urgent call for a more democratic process <p>International standardization body ISO/TC68 better positioned to lead on standards of CBDCs for the benefit of global&nbsp;society</p><p>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 30 November 2022 — Today, Nym advisor Andrés Arauz, former director of Ecuador’s central bank and 2021 presidential candidate, called for the design of CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) to be moved to a more open, democratic, and privacy-respecting standards process at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum&nbsp;(IGF).</p><p>Arauz stated his immediate intention to join the already existing <a href="https://committee.iso.org/home/tc68">International Standards Organisation TC68</a>/AG5 Working Group on central bank digital currencies where governments from the Global South are currently absent. Even cryptocurrency advocates can take an active role, as they can join through their national standard setting bodies as&nbsp;members.</p><p>This is in response to the increasing trend of countries declaring that privacy protection will not be included in the design of CBDCs as <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Virtual-Assets-FATF-Report-G20-So-Called-Stablecoins.pdf">recommended </a>by <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/about/">FATF</a> (Financial Action Task Force) under the guise of anti-money laundering. The FATF is completely opaque, dominated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/how-little-known-g7-task-force-unwittingly-helps-governments-target-critics-2021-08-05/">by geopolitics</a>, and is heavily influenced by the <a href="https://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/">Wolfsberg Group</a>, a club of the largest US and European&nbsp;banks.</p><p>In the interest of social good, guidance from a standards body that has the responsibility to include any nation state wanting to participate, will be less asymmetric to everyone who will be impacted by CBDCs. Deeper involvement in ISO/TC 68 will allow all relevant stakeholders, including both the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the newer generation of privacy-focussed Web3 experts, to set innovative technical standards for CBDCs and decentralized alternatives, providing financial freedom to those who need it while mitigating the risk of illegal activities.</p><p>“CBDCs will be legal tender and need democratic safeguards that guarantee the human right to privacy, their standards should not be defined by the FATF -an unaccountable, ineffective and opaque body-. Stakeholders from civil society and alternative finance should get involved to embed these human rights in the CBDC hardware and software standards,” Arauz&nbsp;said.</p><p>This was announced alongside Nym CEO Harry Halpin and Open Knowledge Foundation CEO Renata Avila at the <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022">United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF)</a> 2022 in Ethiopia, during <a href="https://intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-town-hall-99-the-data-of-money-blockchains-andor-surveillance">Town Hall #99 The Data of Money: Blockchains and/or Surveillance</a>.</p><p>Halpin added: “CBDCs could easily become tools of mass surveillance and control to repress political dissidents and entire nations. It’s imperative that the cryptocurrency industry get involved in this discussion over CBDC standards at the highest level, by teaming up with countries from the Global South that need to throw off the yoke of colonial banking systems to serve their own people rather than the imperialist overlords of the&nbsp;FATF.”</p><p>The IGF session focused on the current state of financial surveillance and new routes to privacy-preserving CDBCs and financial autonomy led by the global south. CBDC standards should allow both nation-states and non-nation state actors to interoperate and include privacy by design, which has been disingenuously dismissed under the guise of money laundering concerns even though privacy will be needed for national security purposes and to respect basic rights. Violations of an individual’s privacy rights through mass financial surveillance should be taken seriously and respected.</p><p>Watch the livestream: <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live">https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2022-live</a></p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralized platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance. More: <a href="https://nymtech.net">https://nymtech.net</a></p><p>About Andrés&nbsp;Arauz:</p><p>Arauz has been a prominent figure in leading the drive on technological and monetary disintermediation. Motivated to reduce the bureaucratic need for the central bank to hold and distribute large amounts of physical dollars, he was one of the first to experiment with CBDCs, piloting Dinero Electrónico as then-Director of Ecuador’s central bank. Arauz is a force driving the need for open standards for CBDCs and global payments. Contrary to most in government, he is a strong advocate for the benefits of free and open source software. As Minister of Knowledge and Human Talent, he transitioned the Ecuadorian ministry’s internal systems from closed software systems. Read his paper on The Data of Money: <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-data-of-money">https://www.tni.org/en/publication/the-data-of-money</a> and Ecuador’s CBDC: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666143821000107">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666143821000107</a></p><p>Media contact:</p><p>Candice Teo, candice@nymtech.net</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/press-release-nym-special-advisor-andr%C3%A9s-arauz-denounces-fatf-design-guidance-on-cbdcs-and-leads-1a7bd78deda9">Press release: Nym Advisor, Andrés Arauz denounces FATF design guidance on CBDCs and leads urgent…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dune Analytics is a platform aggregating blockchain data, making data easier to query and understand for the larger public. Over the past years, Dune has become the go-to tool for blockchain analytics, as well as the home of a community of dune wizards numbering in the thousands, with its fundraising at a 1 Billion valuation as a testament to the growth of the project over the past 4 years.</p><p>In today's episode, we are joined by the project's co-founder, Fredrik Haga. We discuss the products Dune Analytics offers, why it's hard to aggregate data that in principle is public, and how a community of data wizards was built in a grassroots effort. We also chatted about product focus and vision for the future, as well as useful lessons for bootstrapping a project on a shoestring budget.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The beginning of Dune  The challenges and difficulties in building a blockchain data product.  Technical improvements on Dune V2  Supporting for non-evm chains  Business models, userbases, and valuations  Interesting use cases on Dune  Community Building  The focus on product experience and next steps for the project  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://dune.com/community">Dune Analytics's website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/duneanalytics">Dune Analytics Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hagaetc">Fredrik Haga's twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Omni: Access all of Web3 in one easy-to-use wallet!

<p>NYM token is now integrated into BNB wallets by&nbsp;default</p><p>We are pleased to announce that Nym has made a bridge to the <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en">BNB Chain</a> thanks to <a href="https://celer.network">Celer</a>! The NYM utility token is now available as a BEP-20 token. What does this mean? It means that real $NYM can be used on BNB Chain, opening a pathway to privacy for the BNB ecosystem while keeping users SAFU from the many scams involving fake $NYM on BNB Chain. From now on, <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdd2612c292431aaa727fe24d1a8afbe4928bbc55">0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55</a> is the only valid NYM token address on BNB&nbsp;Chain!</p><p>Originally initiated by <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a> and now a community-driven, permissionless and decentralised ecosystem, BNB Chain is the world’s largest smart-contract blockchain in terms of transaction volume and daily active users as of October&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The NYM token is the utility token of the Nym mixnet — a powerful privacy system that protects network layer communications from traffic analysis, metadata and IP surveillance. By using the mixnet, your communications will be protected from apps and wallets that are gathering your IP addresses as well as observers watching the whole&nbsp;network.</p><p>Holders of NYM (ERC-20) tokens can use <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM">cBridge</a> to bridge their NYM tokens from Ethereum to the BNB chain and back. This means that native NYM (Cosmos) tokens are now accessible for the BNB ecosystem if two bridges are used (cbridge and GravityBridge), enabling people to bond and run mixnodes, delegate stake in the mixnet and contribute to operating the privacy&nbsp;system.</p><p>How does the bridge&nbsp;work?</p><p>cBridge uses a lock-and-mint model, creating a mapped version of the NYM token on the BNB&nbsp;Chain.</p><p>When a person transfers the token from Ethereum to BNB chain, the $NYM (ERC20) will be locked on Ethereum and an equal number of $NYM (BEP20) will be minted in a 1:1 pegged ratio and sent to you on the BNB Chain, maintaining stable supply across&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Conversely, when a person transfers from the BNB chain back to Ethereum, the $NYM (BEP20) will be burned on the BNB chain and an equal number of $NYM (ERC20) will be sent back to you on Ethereum.</p><p>You will have to pay a bridge fee which consists of a ‘base fee’ and ‘protocol fee’. The ‘base fee’ covers the gas fee on the destination chain, in the form of the $NYM in that chain’s format. The ‘protocol fee’ is paid as incentives to the cBridge LPs, validators and stakers, ranging from 0–0.5% of total transfer amount. Overall, the bridge is very cheap and&nbsp;fast!</p><p>How to use the&nbsp;bridge</p>  Go to <a href="https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM">https://cbridge.celer.network/1/56/NYM</a> and connect to Metamask Ethereum&nbsp;Mainnet  Choose NYM token from the token&nbsp;list  Input the amount of NYM tokens you wish to bridge to BNB&nbsp;Chain  <p>4. After inputting the amount of NYM tokens, you can see the exact fees that you will be charged underneath and the estimated time of&nbsp;arrival.</p><p>5. After the transaction has been submitted on chain, the top right will show if the transaction is pending or completed. You can also find the transaction details on etherscan or&nbsp;bsccan.</p><p>6. The switch from Ethereum Mainnet to BNB Chain on Metamask. If you have not already added BNB Chain, use the configuration information below: Mainnet (this is probably the one you are looking&nbsp;for)</p>  Network Name: BNB&nbsp;Chain  New RPC URL: <a href="https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/">https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/</a>  ChainID: 56  Symbol: BNB  Block Explorer URL: <a href="https://bscscan.com">https://bscscan.com</a>  <p>7. Import BEP20 version of NYM token in your Metamask wallet: 0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55, then you should be able to see the amount of NYM tokens appear your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>NOTE: <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdd2612c292431aaa727fe24d1a8afbe4928bbc55">0xDD2612c292431aaa727fE24d1a8AfBE4928Bbc55</a> is the only valid NYM token address on BNB Chain, beware of&nbsp;scams!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym. Join our community to participate and keep up to&nbsp;date:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p><p>Essential links</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/token">Tokenomics FAQ</a></p><p><a href="https://coinlist.co/nym">Nym on&nbsp;CoinList</a></p><p>The Nym architecture</p><p><a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">Nym network&nbsp;explorer</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech">Nym Github</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym Docs</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-utility-token-is-now-on-bnb-chain-9787677108ab">The NYM utility token is now on BNB Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Game of Chains&nbsp;✨</p> Dear Cosmonauts! <p>Phase 2 officially ended on November 25, 2022! We hit a number of important milestones we are so excited to share! Buckle&nbsp;up:</p> HIGHLIGHTS <p>Game of Chains validators launched three new consumer chains, giving them a feel for the governance process and the DevOps that will be required to launch real consumer chains in production. These 3 consumer chains&nbsp;include:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/gopher">Gopher</a> — This is a consumer chain built by Hypha to help test the Go relayer with Interchain Security.</p><p>Neutron — This consumer chain will run in production come Interchain Security launch! They’ve been building their permissionless smart contract development platform for the past few months. Check out their announcement on launching Game of Chains&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Neutron_org/status/1595090867949563904">here</a>!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022/hero">Hero</a> — This is the placeholder name for the Generic Asset Issuance Chain which is set to issue USDC come Interchain Security launch. Big shoutout to the StrangeLove team for developing Hero and putting in the work to get the Generic Asset Issuance chain to&nbsp;launch!</p><p>Throughout this process, validators voted on proposals, started up the consumer chains, set up relayers, and worked to ensure that their nodes were adequately configured to minimize downtime. Validators also ran through the motions of removing Apollo through a governance proposal, which was started in Phase&nbsp;1.</p> COMMUNITY <p>Validators and the broader Cosmos community have been actively participating in public discussions on Interchain Security including thoughts on ICS risks, validator operational overhead, auditing binaries, the role of testnets in ICS, and more! Check out this great Q&amp;A discussion hosted by Citizen Cosmos&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXMoF18bckU">here</a>.</p> PHASE 3 HAS&nbsp;STARTED <p>We are already in the beginning stages of Phase 3 where validators will continue to run consumer chains and go through the process of starting and stopping consumer chains. Hypha has redistributed voting power so that the testnet coordinators no longer have majority control of the network. This will force validators to play a more active role in governance and keep everyone on their toes to ensure that the testnet keeps&nbsp;running!</p><p>In this phase, we are asking validators to propose new chains and vote on them. Those following along can keep track of which chains have been proposed <a href="https://testnet.ping.pub/provider/gov">here</a>. We already have Duality about to be onboarded as their governance proposal went live late Friday&nbsp;evening!</p>Shoutout to Dan B from Strangelove for the meme!&nbsp;😁 SCORING <p>We are keeping score of where validators are in the leaderboard on <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022#scoreboard">interchainsecurity.dev</a>. Thank you to everyone who has submitted evidence of their task completion. If you haven’t please make sure to do so to be eligible for a prize! Please note that tallying takes time and we’re trying to update the leaderboard once a week so the leaderboard won’t always have a full picture of validators standing in Game of&nbsp;Chains.</p><p>MASSIVE thank you to everyone for participating in Phase 2. Looking forward to seeing the validators become more self-sufficient in Phase 3and all of the new chains that will be proposed!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager.<br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-2-update-f93b07bc162f">PHASE 2 Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This weekend my friend Dru hosted Jason and I as speakers for her Tucson Summit. The presentation I gave was recorded and should be up on my channel in the next week or so after Jason gets back to Denver and has time to knit it together. The format was eight ten-minute segments followed by a panel discussion with Q&amp;A. The focus was a bit unusual, even for me, and included readings from the 1929 book by X-Ray crystallographer JD Bernal, “T<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.171486/mode/2up">he World, The Flesh, and The Devil,”</a>&nbsp;with links to sociobiology, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjU86ryZN6g">ant computer simulations</a>, consciousness studies, and space exploration. All of these topics are highly relevant to Tucson, a city that leads in aerospace development with a history that extends into radio-astronomy, interplanetary colonization, and spiritualism.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vDibdG6wSzCp1wrJDoJ0xHVNAjR9NxYEvUL4J4jp4Lw/edit?usp=sharing">a link to my slide deck</a> in the mean time.</p>
<p>Southern Arizona, the site of one of the longest military engagements on US soil waged by <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chir/learn/historyculture/apache-wars-cochise.htm">Apache leaders Cochise and Geronimo</a>, is home to <a href="https://suncorridorinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016-Fort-Huachuca-Fact-Sheet-Brochure-WEB.pdf">Fort Huachuca</a>, a center of electronic warfare. It’s also a testbed for <a href="https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5d9f83b8b237fa6c07d5d69d/5df56d3ba58b6240c6ce54ae_Smart%2BCities%2Bfor%2Bthe%2BRest%2Bof%2BUs_Toothaker.pdf">smart city policies</a> and social impact finance programs (<a href="https://www.tucsonaz.gov/files/hcd/City_of_Tucson_and_Pima_County_FFY2015-2019_5-year_HUDConsolidated_Plan.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.strivetogether.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/053119_2019_C2C_AnnualReport_V9.pdf">here</a>). I’m sure a lot of what I put out flew over the heads of the audience, because most of us don’t yet have the language or mental structures to imagine what’s on the horizon – the smart contract logic layer of Web 3. These past few weeks I keep repeating – If we’re not spending half of our intellectual “free-time” learning about Web3, the consequences won’t be good. We won’t understand the story we’re inhabiting. We won’t be able to see where the walls of the labyrinth are.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure where to start, here are a couple of videos Jason and I made with Leo Saraceno that deconstruct the vision Juan Benet of Protocol Labs has for Web3 and the development of “innovative” finance mechanisms for “open source” “digital public goods.”</p>
<p>If you’d like to go back and re-watch the clips, you can click the circles on <a href="https://embed.kumu.io/bab707025b91966dbcc03b0e3db7daac#untitled-map">this interactive map</a>. the sidebar will open with the links to each.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Later today we’ll be exploring the city with planned stops at the labyrinth in Udall Park and an address associated with the early history of L5. You can read about the Tohono O’odom’s story of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27itoi">man in the maze</a>,” a motif incorporated into basketmaking practices a century ago. The newsletters from L5 dating to the mid 1970s are available on Wayback – very much an eye-full. Here’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403133837/http://nss.org/settlement/L5news/L5news1975.htm">that link</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Udall">Mo Udall</a>, an environmentalist and Arizona Congressman from 1977 to 1991, supported L5’s efforts. See screenshot below.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP). </p>



<p>Four of the current ZCG committee members’ terms expire at the end of December, so we are inviting nominations for an election to be held in December. </p>



 How to Stand for Election to ZCG 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">governance zcg-elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining their priorities and vision for Zcash. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly as replies to their respective posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on 12th December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning.” Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>During the week commencing 12th December, the Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community. </p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel</a> to select four candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2023.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The four candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2023. Committee members may stand for re-election at the end of their term.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should familiarize themselves with the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;Hudson Jameson’s decision to step down from the committee in <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/hudson-jameson-leaving-zcg/41941">June 2022</a>  triggered an election resulting in the appointment of Cody Burns, whose term will expire in June 2023. The other four committee members’ terms are expiring at the end of December 2022. </p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks. </p>



<p>From January, members will receive a stipend of $1,650 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).&nbsp;</p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>To avoid conflicts of interest, the following policy applies to the ZCG Committee: </p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the executive director or other officer of ZF. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to undergo the ZF’s KYC process, complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with ZF (to ensure that their status and relationship with ZF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members will be required to notify ZF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to this topic on the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>Brave’s native crypto wallet now features integrations from 1inch, Allbridge, AutoFarm, Based, Cardinal, Coral Cube, DARA, EYWA, Guild, Hyperspace, Matrica, Morpho, Tectonic, Plaid, and Quest3.</p>



    



    


    


    
    

<p>Brave continues to expand its Wallet Partner program with the addition of 15 new DApps in November. Since June, over 75 projects have integrated Brave Wallet in their Web3-enabled applications. While we encourage outreach and partnership with the growing ecosystem of DApp builders, developers looking to add Brave Wallet to their DApps independently can use our <a href="https://wallet-docs.brave.com/">Brave Wallet documentation</a> for DIY integration in just a few steps.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet partners, read our past announcements from <a>June</a>, <a>July</a>, <a>August</a>, <a>September</a>, and <a>October</a>. Here are the partners that joined in November:</p>

 1inch 
<p><a href="https://1inch.io/">The 1inch Network</a> is a collection of DeFi products made for safe, lucrative, and fast operations in DeFi. Their lead product is a DEX aggregator that finds the best rate on swaps across 300 liquidity sources on multiple blockchains. The 1inch DEX aggregator has reached more than 3.7 million unique wallets, and $254 billion in overall transaction volume to date. Alongside the aggregation protocol, the 1inch core contributors’ team keeps developing their own liquidity protocol, limit order protocol, and a multichain mobile wallet.</p>

<p>The two-day conference was filled with spotlights, panels, and break-out sessions ranging from <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">Metaverse on the Horizen</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/zXhR5u3RLhs">Web3 &amp; Sports</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/wGaZRj5VOCg">The Power of Community</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG stories</a>, and more!</p>

 Welcoming Our Friends 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23902"></a></p>
<p>We were thrilled to see many of our partners, team members, and long-time community members on stage at this event. Each panel and discussion was fantastic, but some of our favorite highlights included the <a href="https://youtu.be/3nnRnbst7A4">Zen OG panel with Horizen co-founder Rolf Versluis</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXhR5u3RLhs&amp;t=1s">the Web3 Sports fireside chat with Andrea Radrizzani of Leeds United</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/prLOm0JgLwY">the Horizen EVM marketplace presentation and demo with Sebastian Gronewald of Create3 Labs</a>. We were also able to capture footage of the event setup, which you can <a href="https://youtu.be/0jnOyIX-z1Y">check out on YouTube</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23903"></a></p>
 The BizTalks 
<p>We heard many interesting talks in the areas of finance and investing, such as “<a href="https://youtu.be/54NnrY2XmN8">Growing the Ecosystem Through Investments and Introducing HL Builders</a>,” <a href="https://youtu.be/lI_l-hRHzs8">“Cryptoeconomics trends”</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/j2XjwfOq8kU">Venture Now – The Investor Perspective</a>, and more! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23904"></a></p>
<p>The panel <a href="https://youtu.be/ZUlGgTdE7V0">“Metaverse Trends”</a> gave attendees an intriguing look into what trends thought leaders in the space are looking at currently and where they think they will head in the near future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23905"></a></p>
<p>The discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/dnJR_x9M7PA">“</a>Raising Funds – The Startup Perspective” gave us all an intriguing perspective on some of the early stages of creating a startup especially focused on web3 and blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
 The TechTalks 
<p>On the tech side of things, we heard incredible updates from the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams’ – <a href="https://youtu.be/8dgQ8Vr5FWs">an overview of TokenMint and its current status</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/LrzzAbcroPw">where the team is on the Horizen EVM sidechain, DeFi on Horizen</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/JvY8o8N4_2Q">what’s next for Zendoo</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We welcomed experts to share their knowledge on topics like <a href="https://youtu.be/rJ2NWf-KcpY">“Plonk and LookUp Arguments,”</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/kQ37ZJ_wtO0">“Private NFT Protocols,”</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/RX7dGq_GZuI">“zkVMs Under the Hood,”</a> to mention a few. These educational panel discussions and talks provided many with additional technical expertise and understanding. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23906"></a></p>
 The Team Sessions 
<p>ZenCon0 also brought the global team together in one place to brainstorm, connect, and innovate. The Horizen Labs and Horizen teams from different divisions gave presentations on their expertise areas, which allowed members of other teams to gain exposure and knowledge in areas they might not previously have. Ranging from hands-on demos and product overviews to improving blockchain communications.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23908"></a></p>
<p>Internal sessions like “Bridging the Divide: From Tech to Product,” a discussion on how products go from technical concepts to useable products and how we market them, enabled the team to learn more about process flow and improvements and get insights into how other teams work together to drive our future. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23909"></a></p>
<p>While sessions like <a href="https://youtu.be/2OiF6cxJu94">“Common Vulnerabilities in Solidity Smart Contracts”</a> enabled us all to learn more about the tech behind our upcoming releases and understand more about the engineering decisions behind the creation of things like our upcoming EVM sidechain. </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23910"></a></p>
 The Parties! 
<p>We kicked off ZenCon the night before the conference with a beautiful, welcoming party at the location of the event. This was an amazing opportunity for everyone to network and was where some of our team members met one another in person for the first time before kicking off the next two days!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23911"></a></p>
<p>The next side party was the CryptoMondays and Horizen Rooftop Aperativo at the Horizen Milan office, which was a great opportunity for further networking and enabled our team members outside of Milan to see the new office! This was an amazing event followed by a mystery dinner, where everyone was grouped randomly to enjoy dinner and network outside of our typical teams.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23912"></a></p>
<p>Finally, we ended this amazing experience and event with a fantastic closing party with great music, delicious food, and dancing! It was the perfect end to the best event we attended this year, and we cannot wait to welcome everyone again for the next ZenCon! </p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23913"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23915"></a></p>
 After ZenCon – Getting the Team Together 
<p>After the main event, the Horizen and Horizen Labs teams took on an exciting challenge – A Horizen hackathon focusing on dapps that could be created on our upcoming EVM! The winners would have a chance to help make their idea a reality in our ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This fun team-building exercise was a great way for everyone to get to know each other better. The teams all came up with great ideas that we could see being potential use cases on Horizen one day! You may even see one of them in the coming months!</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/?attachment_id=23917"></a></p>
<p>We also took a day to enable our teams to get to know each other better and get some well-deserved relaxation. We spent time hiking, exploring, and enjoying one another’s company. Afterward, the team split into groups to complete a fun scavenger hunt! Followed by an amazing final dinner together before we all traveled back home.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a fascinating field that has made tremendous development over the past few years. From GPT-3 to Dall-e and Stable Diffusion, the vastness of the scope of applications for AI and neural computing is becoming clearer than ever. At the base layer, there is a need for decentralized p2p AI compute platform that provides flexible access to the wider public. Gensyn sets out on the mission to provide just that by building a market place protocol for AI compute - ultra-low cost, hyperscale, permissionless.</p><p>In today’s episode we are joined by the project's co-founders Ben Fielding and Harry Grieve. We take a deep dive into the current landscape for AI and AI compute, the reasonings and trade-offs in building Gensyn, the protocol’s focus and edge cases, and how the protocol is utilizing the blockchain technology as both incentive layer and credibly neutral platform.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  The founders' background and reasonings for development on Blockchain  The current state of AI development and breakdown of AI concepts  The current landscape for AI modeling and compute  Gensyn's difference to other protocols, such as Golem  How Gensyn is adhering to the decentralized default, and making trade-offs in product building  Building Gensyn as a Layer-1 protocol  Deep dive into the Gensyn Protocol and edge cases  Other players in the protocol: solvers, verifiers, and whistle blowers  Building a blockchain  <p>Episode links: </p>  <a href="https://www.gensyn.ai/">Gensyn</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/gensynai">Gensyn on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/fenbielding">Ben Fielding on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/_grieve">Harry Grieve on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors: </p>  Tally Ho: Tally Ho is a new wallet for Web3 and DeFi that sees the wallet as a public good.

 Introducing the Nym SDK — powerful privacy served directly to your&nbsp;browser <p>Nym releases a new TypeScript SDK to create apps that can use the Nym mixnet and Coconut credentials quickly</p><p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nymproject/sdk/v/1.1.4">Nym SDK</a> allows you to send data over the Nym mixnet with ease from browser-based applications. It has recently been updated to version&nbsp;1.1.4.</p><p>This is the very first time that the full privacy powers of mixnets are available easily and directly from a browser&nbsp;window!</p><p>Any application that works from a browser or embeds a WebView can use this SDK to send data through the Nym mixnet to benefit from the network layer privacy protections it offers. This also includes client-side apps that use Electron, React Native, or Tauri frameworks (basically anything that can execute WebAssembly).</p><p>If you are a JavaScript or TypeScript developer and would like to give things a try and see how it works, have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk">GitHub repository for examples</a> on how to use the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>As an example, here is a basic <a href="https://chat-demo.nymtech.net">chat webapp</a>. Texts that are sent through the Nym mixnet and to the receiving party. Try running it between yourself and a friend or in two browsers! The <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/tree/develop/sdk/typescript/examples/react-webpack-with-theme-example">code can be found here</a> if you’d like to understand how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>We are currently working on reply SURBs, which will allow the recipient to reply to the sender without knowing their address. We are also working on a version that works with NodeJS and native workers, so you can use the mixnet from your Express webapps or from a&nbsp;CLI.</p><p>Experiment with the current version and watch NPM for upgrades.</p><p>We look forward to seeing what kind of apps people will build with this&nbsp;client!</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

<p>Maria also prepared a PDF with a set of images about the Maya Train project, but due to the number of links I decided to pull out the text so that it was more readable in the blog format. Her images can be viewed or downloaded <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Tren-Maya-Mexico.pdf">here</a> as a set, and I will place them at the end of this post, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE TRUTH OF THE “MAYA TRAIN” PROJECT AND UN AGENDA 2030</p>
<p>The Maya Train Project has been so controversial in Mexico, since years ago, as many people are against it due to the fact that the project will destroy the nature, many archeological sites like Mayas, Olmecs (before Mayas) and others since 7,000 B.C. It will violate the Indigenous populations’ human rights with the risk of disappearing those original etnias, their ancestral traditions, and knowledge, as always, by abusing or even killing them. </p>
<p>Besides those issues, the five states that cover the Ruta Maya are rich in natural resources that corporations are craving to exploit. The people fighting against the Ruta Maya, sadly are Mexicans that are unaware of the role of the United Nations (UN) in the project, even ignoring the existence of the Agenda 2030, as the mainstream media and the government suppress this information to to keep them ignorant. Besides, many Mexicans are totally mind controlled and interested only in money, football, celebrities, corruption, and superficialities. </p>
<p>I want to show you how deeply the UN is involved in this project. The Mexican government has almost zero power of decision making. They just obey the UN and the numerous documents and sub-projects, trainings, meetings, and many websites that have been prepared to reach their goals. The “tourism project appearance” is not the only or the main goal. We will see later, that the real intentions are to create efficient smart cities and smart supply chains that will produce products already decided by the UN for Mexico to export worldwide.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I see the Ruta Maya as a kind of a BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) designed to align the economy with the Great Reset, Agenda 2030/21, and all the implications that conveys for the populations. An important factor to consider is that Mexico doesn’t have strong railway lines as other countries do. For tourism there are basically none, just a very small one in Chihuaha state. For civilian transportation between cities there are no trains. People can only travel by bus, airplane, or car. For the transportation of industrial goods there are some lines that cross the country from south to north and from the main ports and are totally privatized. The owner of <a href="https://www.mhlnews.com/global-supply-chain/article/22047409/mexican-rail-merger-denied-again">FERROMEX</a> is the billionaire <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/german-larrea-mota-velasco/?sh=7c6e0ac62c01">Germán Larrea</a>.</p>
<p>“The Maya Train is a comprehensive project of land use planning, infrastructure, economic growth and sustainable tourism that seeks the social welfare of the inhabitants of the southeast of Mexico.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This quote is taken from an <a href="https://unhabitat.org/news/01-oct-2021/mexicos-southeast-region-to-benefit-from-un-habitat-urban-planning-and-design">August 2021 article</a> by UN-Habitat with the support of FONATUR and the UNESCO laying out twelve guidelines “to promote sustainable urban developments In the municipalities of Southeast Mexico, where the Maya Train stations will be built.”</p>
<p><a href="https://publicacionesonuhabitat.org/onuhabitatmexico/Lineamientos-de-disen%CC%83o-y-planificacio%CC%81n-urbana.pdf"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://publicacionesonuhabitat.org/onuhabitatmexico/Lineamientos-de-disen%CC%83o-y-planificacio%CC%81n-urbana.pdf"></a></p>
<p>The Guidelines for Urban Design and Planning will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the New Urban Agenda (NUA) in the Southeast Region of Mexico. </p>
<p><a href="https://publicacionesonuhabitat.org/onuhabitatmexico/Nueva-Agenda-Urbana-Ilustrada.pdf"></a></p>
<p>In this document we see a preliminary map of the Ruta Maya dated “until July, 2021,” which I took from the Guidelines document website last September 2022 when I made the complete report “Truth of the Ruta Maya” in Spanish. However, it’s very curious that if you download now (November, 2022) the same Guidelines document, they deleted page 2 where this map was located, meaning maybe changes in the route or in the extension of the project.</p>
<p><a href="https://publicacionesonuhabitat.org/onuhabitatmexico/Lineamientos-de-disen%CC%83o-y-planificacio%CC%81n-urbana.pdf"></a></p>
<p>Since 2019, the UN-Habitat has been providing technical assistance to FONATUR (the National Fund for Tourism Development). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.onuhabitat.org.mx/index.php/fonatur-y-onu-habitat-firman-acuerdo-de-colaboracion"></a></p>
<p>The agreement was signed by the UN-Habitat, FONATUR, Ministry of Treasury and Public Credit (SHCP) and by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (SRE) on May 21st, 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.onuhabitat.org.mx/index.php/fonatur-y-onu-habitat-firman-acuerdo-de-colaboracion"></a></p>
<p>The five states of the Ruta Maya are: Campeche, Yucatán, Chiapas, Quintana Roo and Tabasco. The most important Mexican ports for export &amp; import are conveniently located close to the Ruta Maya route: Salina Cruz Port (next to Chiapas) and Veracruz (next to Tabasco), Veracruz port being more important than Progreso port that is inside the route. Veracruz state plays an important role in the products decided by the UN to be produced for being exported worldwide. </p>
<p>The indigenous etnias original from the five states and still living there in danger of extinction are: Akateko, Ixil, Kaqchikel, Jakalteco, K’iche, Mam, Maya, Q’anjob’al, Q’eqchi, Chuj, Ch’ol, Awakateco, Lacandón, Mocho o qato’k, Teko, Tojolabal, Tseltal, Tzotzil, Zoque, Chontal de Tabasco, Ayapaneco, Nahua.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ruta Maya is included in this document called “Atlas Prospectivo Territorial-Industrial para la Atracción de Inversiones” or “PROSPECTIVE ATLAS TERRITORIAL- INDUSTRIAL ATLAS FOR INVESTMENT ATTRACTION” that was published and prepared in 2021 by the UN-Habitat, the ONUDI or UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization) together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico. </p>
<p>They “…jointly formulate a novel approach to attract foreign investment that lays its foundations.”</p>
<p><a href="https://publicacionesonuhabitat.org/onuhabitatmexico/Resumen-Atlas_ENG.pdf"></a></p>
<p>SOURCE OF THE “ATLAS” WEBSITE: <a href="https://onuhabitat.org.mx/index.php/atlas-prospectivo-territorial-industrial-de-mexico">https://onuhabitat.org.mx/index.php/atlas-prospectivo-territorial-industrial-de-mexico</a> </p>
<p>The excuse, as they mentioned in their website: “The socioeconomic effects of the pandemic have imposed big challenges to comply with the Agenda 2030.” It’s incredible and cruel that they’re more worried about fulfilling the goals of Agenda 2030 on time than in taking care of the people that has suffered, died, get disabled, that has lost jobs, properties, or even their savings to make richer the unethical doctors with the excuse of the pandemic. </p>
<p>We see real intention behind the tourism facade when reading “The Atlas,” which has identified five strategic industries where Mexico can strengthen their GVC (Global Value Chains) to generate a greater value (below) and by analyzing the GVCs. </p>
<p>It includes new geographical industrial configurations according to the needs required by the “pandemic”, by the T-MEC (Mex-USA-Can Treaty), and according to the principles and goals of the sustainable development agendas. That means new regions that are really new “smart cities clusters” that they called “corridors” in Spanish.</p>
<p>The “Atlas” project will work together hand in hand with the Geospatial Strategy for the United Nations to monitor and plan the spaces in the earth for Agenda 2030. Its role is to “strengthen geospatial mandates…and authoritative services to underpin all aspects of the work of the Organization” and “foster a global integrated, federated and multi-disciplinary geospatial services delivery across the United Nations system “Delivering as One.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.un.org/geospatial/about/whatwedo"></a></p>
<p>The products that the UN has decided that must be produced (cultivated) for worldwide export in the Ruta Maya region are vanilla and cacao.</p>
<p><a href="https://onuhabitat.org.mx/index.php/atlas-prospectivo-territorial-industrial-de-mexico"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://publicacionesonuhabitat.org/onuhabitatmexico/Resumen-Atlas_ENG.pdf"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://publicacionesonuhabitat.org/onuhabitatmexico/Resumen-Atlas_ENG.pdf"></a></p>
<p>The Ruta Maya is the train route that will underpin the supply chain of the economic “Corridor or Smart City cluster named “Coartzacoalcos-Villahermosa-Palenque” that is inside the “Ruta Maya” and conveniently connected to the main ports of the South of Mexico. Municipalities included in the “Corridor” where they’ll gather the vanilla and cacao production for processing and packing prior to export. The cacao and vanilla will be exported to the monopolies. They have even calculated the supply chain, the km, the travel times by air, land and train. </p>
<p>In conclusion, the United Nations is reorganizing the space, creating smart city clusters, assigning economic products and services to each country of the work, and opening areas to exploit natural resources. Who loses? They will kill the middle class or loot them to make them poor, forcing migrants and the poorest people to work in whatever the “masters” want as real slaves, more than before, with advanced technology. It’s more than clear that the United Nations supported by NGOs, universities, and corporations control all the countries.</p>

<p>Within the digital identity ecosystem, verifiable credentials (VCs) refers to an open standard for digital credentials that represent information that would normally be found in passports, driver’s licences, university titles, and other forms of accreditation.</p>



<p>In this post, we explain the mechanics underpinning VCs and some potential use cases.</p>



 In another time and another place, there were trustworthy knights. 



<p>Ivanhoe is one of Walter Scott’s best-known works. Deemed a historical romance novel, the story follows Wilfred of Ivanhoe, a Saxon knight, and his beloved, Lady Rowena. The thrust of the plot is Ivanhoe’s determination to marry Lady Rowena, with whom she grew up after Rowena was orphaned and became the ward of Wilfred’s father, Cedric, a powerful Saxon lord. The conflict arises when Cedric betroths Rowena to another, Athelstane, out of political interest.</p>



<p>Wilfred is portrayed as the epitome of chivalry. He’s heroic, honourable, and loyal. Rowena is equally depicted as chaste, virtuous, and loyal to her true feelings of love for Ivanhoe. Becoming a knight was a big deal in those days. Indeed, knighthood came to be considered a form of nobility, though in the lower scale. But the point is that knights were respectable, trustworthy individuals. So much so that, often, knights were assigned as elite personal guards for lords, who trusted knights implicitly. Over time, and as methods of warfare evolved, knights gradually became obsolete and eventually morphed into the honorary titles that survive to this day.</p>



<p>Let’s focus on the trust part, as this has bearing on our narrative. Knighthood could be earned by different means: prowess on the battlefield, for certain. Social status did have an influence. The peasantry had a scant chance of being knighted, for example. And there were economic factors at play, too. Armour, weapons, and knight-related paraphernalia were expensive, and beyond the reach of most. But perhaps the key factor for a lord (or someone from the royalty) to bestow knighthood unto somebody was trust. A knight-to-be had to prove himself worthy of trust by the lord. This implied honour, the upholding and protection of the weak, and respect. All these attributes had to be proven before the dubbing ceremony took place, where the lord would place the flat of a sword on the shoulders of the man kneeling before him, thus bestowing knighthood upon him. A foundation of trust was vital for the lord-knight relationship to work.</p>



 The triangle of trust 



<p>Fast forward a few centuries to the present day. Blockchain technology has enabled a new identity framework, centred around digital credentials. VCs are part of that framework.</p>



<p>VCs stand at the centre of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier. The triangle represents the following flow: the Issuer digitally signs a credential (or set of), and issues them to the Holder, which manages the credentials and, when required, presents them to the Verifier. In this context, the Issuer and the Holder trust each other. The Holder trusts the Verifier, and the Verifier trusts the Issuer. As we can see, VCs are anchored on implicit trust, much like the relationship between a knight and a lord was all those years ago. Furthermore, this identity model puts the individual (the knight, in our narrative) in control of their identity attributes.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: quick definition 



<p>We all carry a set of physical credentials in our wallets at all times. Driver licenses, government IDs, library cards, health insurance cards, a passport if we are abroad, and myriad others. These things are a) cumbersome, and b) antiquated. It is cumbersome because we have so many of them, all issued by different entities. And antiquated because, well, they come in physical form, which means they can be lost or damaged beyond usability. Both scenarios would require contacting the issuing entity’s help desk many times, and a lengthy wait until a replacement is issued.</p>



<p>Now imagine if, instead of having to carry all those documents on you at all times, all you had to do was show a QR code that contained all that information. If you needed to use any of your credentials, someone would just scan the QR code, and poof, voila. Done. This is the essence of VCs. A digital representation of credentials that enables the individual to selectively share their information, without having to actually show the actual data. VCs enable the third party to instantly verify that the information is true, without having to call or contact anyone else.</p>



<p>In short: VCs are tamper-proof credentials that can be instantly and cryptographically verified.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: properties and components 



<p>As specified in the W3 data model, VCs must fulfil three inherent properties. They must be:</p>



  Machine-verifiable  Secure and tamper-proof  Respectful of privacy  



<p>At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs</p>



<p>Metadata – This is information cryptographically signed by the Issuer. Metadata reflects the properties of the credential (who the issuer is, expiry date, and a public key, among many other pieces of information).<br>Claims – A statement about the Holder. Date of birth, for example.<br>Proofs – Information about the Holder that accomplishes four things:</p>



  Allows others to verify the source of the data (i.e., the issuer)  Proves that the data belongs to the Holder, and to that Holder alone  Guarantees that the data has not been tampered with  Checks that the data has not been revoked by the Issuer  



<p>All this information is contained within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file, which is an open specification format for transmitting data as a series of attributes and values, and also arrays. These JSON files can then be converted into a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is essentially a JSON file with a cryptographic signature added in. These signatures are kept secure by a pair of public and private keys.</p>



 Verifiable credentials: use cases 



<p>VCs can be applied to many different aspects of identity-related frameworks. For example:</p>



  Government-issued documents, including passports, driver licences, national ID cards, etc.  Travel visas  Healthcare certificates  Credit scoring information  Educational credentials (diplomas, university titles, and any other academic achievements)  Documentation required for opening bank accounts, and applying for <a href="https://zaisan.io/self-sovereign-identity-finance/">financial products</a> (loans, mortgages, etc.)  Credentials for opening a bank account or setting up payments  Verification of disability status  



<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list. Rather, it is a sample of some of the possible solutions that VCs can be part of.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>There are no knights in today’s world, at least not like the ones described in Ivanhoe, or so many other medieval-themed tales. But the image of the honourable and strait-laced Wilfred will do just fine for our analogy. Wilfred (and all those bestowed with a knighthood) embodied trust, truth, and honour. VCs play a very similar role, albeit several centuries later, and in a world that has moved away from the centralization of power that lords represented. You can think of VCs as the knights of a decentralised world, representing the system of trust, truth, and honour that every identity framework requires to function.</p>



 Key takeaways 



  VCs stand at the center of a triangle of trust, which features three vertices: Issuer, Holder, and Verifier  Current standards dictate that VCs must be machine-verifiable, secure and tamper-proof, and respectful of privacy  At a technical level, VCs have three basic components: metadata, claims, and proofs  VC information is usually presented in JSON format, which can be converted into a JWT. This adds a cryptographic signature to the credential

<p>I have a friend, Peninsolar, who’s been navigating a new life in Sweden after unexpected dislocation. Peninsolar is <a href="https://peninsolar.bandcamp.com/">an artist who works in sound and images</a>, an explorer and interpreter of big thoughts and intriguing places. He sent me images of early snows there, signaling the winter storytelling season. I felt transformed by the window he offered into his world. There was magic, and he was happy to allow me to share it with you. The delicate branches and ancient stones carry a spirit of play and the heft of time. Surprises await where light and optics unexpectedly shift our view of “reality” to make space for gratitude even in times of loss.</p>
<p>I have another friend, also an artist, who works in pen and ink. She’s incredibly adept at simplifying complex ideas, even my expansive ramblings on human capital finance! Sometimes Eve travels to Philadelphia, and today we were able to hug and nibble cheese and cucumber slices and cookies and talk about her planned follow-up to <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/08/24/eves-fabulous-social-impact-finance-zine-please-share/">that first amazing zine</a>. I left with a bag of shells she’d gathered from the coast of Florida on a beach above which rockets are sometimes launched (feature image). I will take these delicate, iridescent, spiral messages west with me to Tucson to set an intention at the Cochise Stronghold. Southern Arizona is a land of dark skies dominated by searching telescopes built on sacred lands that look and look and look without truly seeing.</p>
<p>If you are in the US and enjoying a long weekend, you may enjoy the conversation Cliff and I had examining the Sky Woman origin story and Julian Huxley’s imperative towards “progress” – as much as possible as fast as possible. If you feel you’re in a position to do so and wish to honor the lands upon which we live, you might consider sending some gratitude to my friend <a href="https://www.afri.ie/category/tag/chas-jewett/">Chas Jewett,</a> Cheyenne River water protector, @chas-jewett-1 on Venmo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To compliment the sparkling shells, crystalline greetings from Sweden. Thank you Peninsolar!</p>

<p>Primary Promise and the “Transformation” of Children’s Healthcare</p>
<p>By Julene Humes</p>
<p>As a mother, grandmother, and Waldorf teacher of young children, an article on <a href="https://www.ksl.com/">KSL.com</a> entitled “<a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50514702/3-ways-the-primary-promise-initiative-will-create-the-nations-model-health-system-for-children">3 ways the Primary Promise Initiative will create the nation’s model health system for children</a>” caught my attention. Intermountain Healthcare (IHC), the largest healthcare provider in the Intermountain West, is sponsoring this initiative and, as the title states, is boldly proclaiming their goal to “transform” children’s healthcare and set a standard for the nation to follow. Such an audacious claim raised some red flags for me.</p>
<p>Intermountain Healthcare as an institution is problematic at the outset. It enjoys a <a href="https://www.deseret.com/1995/3/15/19164385/ihc-gaining-a-monopoly-in-utah">monopoly</a> in this area with the consequent centralization, bureaucracy, and imbalanced <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/where-theres-a-hospital-monopoly-private-health-care-costs-more/">financial control</a> of health care in general. Moreover, the organization’s handling of the pandemic induces me to be suspicious of any new initiative they advance.2</p>
<p>IHC has three areas of focus for the initiative:</p>
<p>1. Primary Children’s Hospital [in Salt Lake City and soon to be in Lehi, Utah] will be strengthened with the additions of the advanced Grant Scott Bonham Fetal Center, an enlarged and enhanced Level 4 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, an expanded cancer treatment center, and heightened research activities in partnership with University of Utah Health.</p>
<p>2. Pediatric care excellence will be extended across the Intermountain West to bring expert care closer to home. This effort includes the construction of the Larry H. and Gail Miller Family Campus, which is a second 66-bed Primary Children’s Hospital in Lehi, Utah; and an expanded pediatric care network utilizing tele-health and digital health services.</p>
<p>3. Emerging children’s health needs will be innovatively addressed through expanded mental and behavioral health services delivered close to or at kids’ homes; teen-to-adult transition programs for children with chronic illnesses; and an expanded Healthy Kids program focused on helping children stay healthy and safe in their communities, including helping kids who have experienced traumatic events to avoid health complications later in life.</p>
<p>Having delved into Alison’s material, I know enough to be alarmed by the words highlighted above. IHC’s plans to “transform” children’s health care through tele-health and digital health service and innovative means of health care delivery hearkens to the global push to use technology to capture, chronicle, blockchain, control, and surveil human beings. <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/digital-health/#tab=tab_1">Referring to digital health technologies on the World Health Organization (WHO) website it says</a>, “The purpose of a global strategy on Digital Health is to promote healthy lives and wellbeing for everyone, everywhere, of all ages. To deliver its potential, national or regional Digital Health initiatives must be guided by a robust strategy that integrates financial, organizational, human and technological resources.” (Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>To reduce this to a more immediate and succinct context, at the recent B20 Summit 2022 in Bali, Health Minister of Indonesia <a href="https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/11/g20-panel-calls-global-digital-health-certificate-acknowledge-track-vaccination-status-video/">Budi Gunadi Sadikin boldly repeated</a> what is being proposed in many places, “Let’s have a digital health certificate acknowledged by WHO.” The B20 Summit resulted in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/16/g20-bali-leaders-declaration/">fifty-two part declaration</a> in which it states, “We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks.”</p>
<p>Or consider <a href="https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/digital-health-initiative">a statement made by the University of Utah research department</a>, which is partnering with Primary Promise in its efforts, “The Digital Health Initiative (DHI) aims to transform health and health care for patients, their families, and their health care teams by cultivating a thriving research community of digital healthcare pioneers. DHI leverages world renowned expertise from the <a href="https://games.utah.edu/research/about-the-gapp/">GApp Lab</a> and <a href="https://reimagineehr.utah.edu/">ReImagine EHR</a> in playful engagement, standardsbased electronic health record interoperability, and participatory design to catalyze research in engaging digital health innovations.”</p>
<p>The polished presentation of these ideas should not obscure the underlying reality that, to accomplish their aim, there must be significant monitoring and data collection, chronicling of behaviors, and intrusion into every aspect of life through AI, machine learning, sensor networks, biometrics, wearables, and implantables, all likely to be fueled by social impact markets. (Alison’s readers should be very familiar with her voluminous research and documentation in these areas. For review, see <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/10/31/looking-around-the-labyrinth-a-chat-with-cliff-about-the-outside-in-robot/">here</a>, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2022/08/24/eves-fabulous-social-impact-finance-zine-please-share/">here</a>, and <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/07/13/minding-our-health-the-nudge-part-two/">here</a>.) What better sector than the medical industry to implement these methods of control.</p>
<p>Digital health directly relates to the tele-health aspect of Primary Promise which also raises questions for me. It seems apparent that the lessening of actual, face to face interaction of caregiver and patient results in deteriorating quality of care. I understand the intent to give healthcare access to rural areas, but is tele-health the only way to make that happen? Again, is this normalizing a new, less effective, model of healthcare? Will people’s expectations change? Is it substituting technological solutions for the indispensable human touch?</p>
<p>Moreover, in promoting efforts to go into people’s homes and schools to monitor needs, behaviors, and trauma, will the net result be ever more delegating of heretofore family and community responsibilities to “professionals” and “experts” in a large, removed, centralized organization like IHC? They envision a large cohort of professionals actually visiting homes and schools, but given the exodus of healthcare workers out of the industry, it is more likely that IHC will be forced to rely on digital forms of interaction to monitor children with resulting loss of privacy. In addition, will parents rely less on the traditional, time-tested care passed down from generation to generation and more on these institutions and substandard care administered through remote devices? I understand that people are desperate for help and are caught in cycles of poverty and lack of education that need to be addressed, but, again, and I can’t state it enough, distancing that aid to large, bureaucratic centers will not, in the end, be the most effective. A Zoom call with one’s doctor many miles away for a child with a raging fever cannot replace in-person interaction.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that the people involved in this initiative care about children, and I’m aware of the physical and emotional crises children are in at the present time, yet I don’t think the leaders of this initiative quite realize the potential for abuse through the means they will use to implement these seemingly laudable goals. The leaders and donors to Primary Promise, with, I’m sure, the noblest of intentions, are a <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/foundation/primary-promise/leadership">who’s who in banking and finance</a>, big tech, multi-level marketing, and religion.</p>
<p>Chairs:</p>
<p>1. Crystal Maggelet, trustee on the board of IHC and CEO of FJ Management, a Utah private holding company in petroleum, healthcare, hospitality, and impact funds</p>
<p>2. Gail Miller, owner of the Larry H. Miller Group investing in healthcare and finance</p>
<p>3. Steve Lund, Executive Chairman of the Board and co-founder of NuSkin, a Utah-based multi-level marketing cosmetic company, and General Young Men’s President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 3</p>
<p>4. Spencer Zwick, co-founder and managing partner of Solamere Capital, former chairman of the Romney for President campaign, former Romney aid, and son of W. Craig Zwick, General Authority Seventy of the LDS Church and former CEO of Zwick Construction Company, a leading general contractor for massive construction projects of the Church.</p>
<p>Some of the donors and Primary Promise Campaign Members:</p>
<p>1. Andie and Todd Pedersen, founder of Vivint Smart Home</p>
<p>2. Julie and Greg Cook, founding executive of another Utah-based multi-level marketing company, doTERRA essential oils4</p>
<p>3. Ashley and Ryan Smith, owner of the Utah Jazz basketball franchise and co-founder of Qualtrics, a data gathering platform for companies to assess customer and employee satisfaction.</p>
<p>Some of the Board of Trustees for Intermountain Foundation overseeing Primary Promise:</p>
<p>1. Scott Anderson, Chair of Intermountain Foundation, President and CEO of Zions First National Bank</p>
<p>2. Spencer Eccles, former Chairman of Wells Fargo and Co., former CEO of First Security Corp., board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The University of Utah recently renamed the medical school The Spencer Fox Eccles School of Medicine.</p>
<p>3. A. Marc Harrison, MD, President and CEO of IHC I make an especial note of the following trustee: Bert R. Zimmerli, CFO of IHC, who oversees IHC insurance and health plans, oversees Intermountain Information Systems, Co-chair of <a href="https://amerinet.com/about/">Amerinet</a> Board, a networking, storage and security company, board member of <a href="https://soteradigitalhealth.com">Sotera Wireless</a>, a wearable medical monitoring device company and board member of Healthbox Global Partners, a venture capital company that came out of <a href="https://www.healthbox.com">Healthbox</a>, which says of itself, “Healthbox, a HIMSS Solution, enables healthcare organizations – providers, payers, market suppliers, and start ups – to develop, adopt and invest in the technologies that will drive innovation and digital transformation. . . .”</p>
<p>The readers can make of these connections what they will, but, in my opinion, there is a lot of potential for conflict of interest in addition to the headlong pursuit of high tech solutions to children’s health issues.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>IHC will be lending its formidable presence to normalize the detailed extraction of data from children and technological replacement of personalized care. I doubt the players in this endeavor see it that way. People promoting technological solutions to human problems see it only as a convenient way to organize complex information and enhance abilities. Who wouldn’t want these capabilities?</p>
<p>I say—slow down and consider the implications.</p>
<p>I want children to have access to needed health care, to have their traumatic events addressed, to have helpful mentoring; the problem is the overall trend of taking away those services from the communities themselves to be placed in the hands of distant “professionals” on remote devices who claim a monopoly of knowledge that dismisses the importance of warm, present human interaction and the collective wisdom of mothers and grandmothers through the ages. Scientific discovery has blessed humanity, but I fear the tide is turning so that people doubt their own abilities and outsource community services that once upon a time were naturally met at the hearth and home.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more alarming, this new delivery of care will condition children to accept around-the-clock monitoring, extraction of their data, and being tools of machine learning for feeding the AI, the very digitization of their humanity. They are being captured in a “healthbox,” removed from the natural world and alienated from their natural bodies.</p>
<p>In the last two and a half years, I’ve come to doubt that these large behemoths, whether it be IHC or the WHO, have the personal touch children need. Rather I think they have betrayed those they supposedly service. Their handling of the pandemic and reliance on technological solutions has greatly reduced my trust in the medical ethics of the principal players that are now enthusiastically claiming their ability to advance the standard of medical care for children. I recognize that IHC has dedicated, caring, unselfish people who have sacrificed themselves for others. If I get in an accident, I want the incredible care that only they can give; in the area of disease and mental health care, they are increasingly less trustworthy. I don’t want myself or my family to have no option but to submit to invasive monitoring and to be captured in digital systems to qualify for help.</p>
<p>1 – Intermountain Healthcare is changing its name to Intermountain Health in 2023.</p>
<p>2 – IHC mandated vaccines for employees with little to no recourse for exemption and were in lockstep with the national guidelines of Covid care that put people’s lives in jeopardy, i.e., denial of care until severely ill, the administration of the toxic and largely ineffective drug Remdesivir, unnecessary intubation, etc. They also praised and promoted the administration of the Covid vaccine for children.</p>
<p>3 – The LDS church is heavily invested in pharmaceuticals, medical companies, and digital 3 technologies. See <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2020/03/07/lds-church-discloses/">https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2020/03/07/lds-church-discloses/</a></p>
<p>4 – Perhaps incidental to this discussion, I personally distrust the multi-level marketing companies named here. To address the issues completely is beyond the scope of this post, but, with a little research, it is easy to find questionable ethics in the running of these companies. See <a href="https://gephardtdaily.com/local/ftc-warns-3-multi-level-marketers-in-utahabout-false-claims-their-products-treat-covid-19/">https://gephardtdaily.com/local/ftc-warns-3-multi-level-marketers-in-utahabout-false-claims-their-products-treat-covid-19/</a>, and <a href="https://%20www.naturalproductsinsider.com/litigation/judge-approves-nu-skin-lawsuit-settlement">https:// www.naturalproductsinsider.com/litigation/judge-approves-nu-skin-lawsuit-settlement</a></p>

 Nym Shipyard Academy — welcome to Stage&nbsp;2! <p>Congratulations to our Nymsters — the more than 600 graduates from Stage 1 of the Nym Shipyard Academy! Over the past two weeks, participants learned about the Nym privacy system and some of the main surveillance problems of digital infrastructures. Two quizzes tested their knowledge. Those who scored 60% or higher on at least one quiz during Stage 1 have graduated to Stage 2 — the Navigator stage. Those who scored 50% and more will receive Stage 1&nbsp;rewards.</p> Changes to Shipyard Academy&nbsp;Rewards <p>The total reward pool for the Nym Shipyard Academy was 100K NYM tokens, with a 15K prize pool for Stage 1. However, since we designed Shipyard Academy the market took a heavy hit, not to mention that probably quite a few participants of the Academy were personally affected by the FTX meltdown. We want to make sure to account for&nbsp;that.</p><p>For this reason, we decided to increase the overall prize pool to 115K NYM tokens, adding 5K to the prize pool of each stage. This means the prize pools of each stage&nbsp;are:</p>  Stage 1: 20K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;15K)  Stage 2: up to 40K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;35K)  Stage 3: up to 55K NYM tokens (from&nbsp;50K)   Stage 1&nbsp;rewards <p>When it comes to Stage 1, all pupils who achieved 50% or more on quiz 1 or quiz 2 get a share of the reward pool. The rewards scale with quiz performance, with top scorers receiving the highest&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Here is the Stage 1 leaderboard — check it to find out how you did and whether you graduated to become a&nbsp;Nymster!</p><p>Congratulations to all our participants! If you didn’t manage to graduate to Stage 2, but want to know about future opportunities? Sign up&nbsp;<a href="http://eepurl.com/gdor_f">here</a>.</p><p>To receive your NYM&nbsp;tokens:</p>  <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Download the Nym&nbsp;wallet</a>  Await further instructions…  <p>Did you know you can use your NYM tokens via the wallet to bond a mixnode and help run the Nym&nbsp;mixnet?</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRMZY6Ez1bA">Learn more.</a></p><p>Did you know that you can delegate your NYM tokens via the wallet to help secure the Nym mixnet and earn rewards for doing&nbsp;so?</p><p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/want-to-stake-in-nym-here-is-how-to-choose-a-mix-node-to-delegate-nym-to-c3b862add165">Learn more.</a></p> Stage 2: Navigator <p>By the end of stage 2 you know how to navigate the digital oceans in a safe manner and will have become a privacy advocate.</p><p>Now that you have learned the basics about Nym, network layer privacy and digital surveillance, it is time for you to help others navigate the digital oceans securely. The second stage of the Nym Shipyard Academy is all about sharing what you have learned so far and start to take action — by protecting your privacy as you use some of the most common apps in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>During this stage, you&nbsp;will:</p>  spread the word to others about privacy online and the problems of popular applications like Telegram and&nbsp;Discord;  learn to use <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect</a> to protect the network layer as you chat online and tell the world you are doing&nbsp;so;  deepen your knowledge about the Nym network and <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/choose-your-character-an-overview-of-nym-network-actors-19e6a9808540">the types of nodes</a> it consists&nbsp;of;  learn about the token economics and how incentives help to ensure the privacy and security of the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.  <p>As the stakes are getting higher, the quiz will be more difficult during Stage 2. You may want to look around on our Discord server for study groups, or create your own! Reach out to our Community Managers if you need info on study&nbsp;groups.</p> Stage 2&nbsp;rewards <p>When it comes to Stage 2, the final size of the prize pool is in your hands! You now understand what the Nym mixnet does, and the importance of using it to protect your privacy. It is time for you to start using it, and get others to use it&nbsp;too!</p><p>The initial prize pool of Stage to is 25K NYM tokens and today, NymConnect has 250 daily active users. If together we hit and maintain 800 daily active users throughout Stage 2, the reward pool will go up to 40K NYM tokens. Keep an eye on our Discord server where we will regularly report the current daily active users, along with the current size of the Stage 2 prize&nbsp;pool.</p> Kick-starting Stage&nbsp;2… <p>The first thing you need to do is download <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect</a> to protect your desktop Telegram chat messages. <a href="https://youtu.be/quj8H2qeOwY">Follow the instructions</a> for how to set your Telegram chat app to run via a SOCKS5 proxy and send your traffic through the Nym&nbsp;mixnet.</p><p>Now that you understand our tech and the problem it is solving, it’s time to spread the word. Over the next two weeks, you need to post a minimum of three posts on socials, memes, visuals or text about the privacy issues of popular apps or what is good about privacy and Nym. One of these posts needs to include a link to <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect</a>.</p><p>Our aspiring Nymjas, a hand-picked group of elite privacy enthusiasts should take note, as this task is especially important for them. We are also keeping a close eye on the Contributions channel on the Nym Discord server, where you can share your blog posts, translations, guides and other contributions.</p><p>Just like last week, there will be information drops across Nym socials that will give you the necessary information to pass the quiz which will take place at the end of Stage 2. There will be two lectures on Nym node types and Nym token economics. NOTE: Stage 2 will have only one quiz, and a submission form to show us your best social media&nbsp;post.</p><p>Make sure to keep an eye on our socials and attend the weekly lectures to max out on the Stage 2&nbsp;quiz!</p><p>Minimum passing requirements:</p>  download and use NymConnect  post 3 original tweets mentioning Nym or sharing our&nbsp;content  pass the Stage 2 quiz with at least 60% correct&nbsp;answers.  <p>Good luck!</p><p>The Nym Network is powered by the NYM Token, a utility token that can be used to access the network, run a mix-node, and NYM should only be used within the Nym mixnet. NYM is not a general purpose payment mechanism nor cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. For investment purposes, do not use NYM but instead look into Bitcoin or other investment vehicles.</p><p>The rewards of and participation in Shipyard Academy is only available to individuals who do not reside in locations that makes them ineligible to participate and/or receive prizes, including the United States, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia, the Crimea region of Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic and the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic. Nym may request that participants provide relevant information as necessary, and can only process payments once cleared by the Nym legal&nbsp;team.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-shipyard-academy-welcome-to-stage-2-d697802c2275">Nym Shipyard Academy — welcome to Stage 2!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>An update on the tokenomics of the Nym mixnet with a new vest underway.</p><p>A new vest is underway this month. Over the course of two years, NYM tokens vest on a quarterly basis, meaning backers, team and Option 2 token holders receive a batch of tokens (testnet participants now fully vested!) This incrementally increases the circulating supply of NYM, stake supply and saturation point, affecting the token economic dynamics as the privacy network and the NYM supply grow. This blogpost gives an overview of changes as a result of the new quarterly vest.</p><p>In short, the main token economic changes you might want to be aware of&nbsp;are:</p>  The circulating supply of NYMs is now around 304 million&nbsp;NYM.  Staking supply is approximately 349 million&nbsp;NYM.  Target level of staking across the entire network is 50%, and thus mix node rewards are maximized when 174 million NYM (50% of the staking supply) are&nbsp;staked.  Stake saturation point is now 726K NYM saturation per node. It is determined by target stake divided by the target number of mix nodes (that remains unchanged at K=240 rewarded nodes per epoch). Dividing 174 million of target staked amount by 240 nodes results in approximately 726K NYM saturation per&nbsp;node.  The ability to delegate unvested tokens is now capped at 10% to prevent whales from receiving the largest proportion of rewards by staking locked tokens, thus ensuring a better rewards and wider distribution among all the stakeholders that stake unlocked NYM&nbsp;tokens.  <p>Circulating supply of&nbsp;NYM</p><p>The circulating supply (let’s denote it by C) of NYM is defined as the amount of unlocked tokens that are available. Currently, the circulating supply is around 304 million&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>The circulating supply increases on a per-epoch (hourly) basis with the rewards distributed from the mixmining pool and quarterly with the vesting of locked tokens (let’s denote by V the amount of tokens that are still in a vesting contract). The quarterly vest is currently underway, unlocking an additional tranche of tokens, hence a more drastic change to&nbsp;supply.</p><p>As of end November 2022, taking into account rewards distributed so far and newly vested tokens, the circulating supply stands at about C=304 million NYM — with about V=451 million NYM still locked in vesting accounts and the remaining 245 million NYM locked in the mixmining pool.</p><p>Staking supply of&nbsp;NYM</p><p>The staking supply (let’s denote it by S) of NYM is defined as the amount of NYM that is available to stake in nodes in the Nym mixnet. Currently, the staking supply is about 349 million&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>The amount of NYM tokens available to stake on nodes in the Nym mixnet is slightly higher than the circulating supply as people are also able to delegate stake using a portion of their locked&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>More precisely, the staking supply includes all the circulating supply C and part of unlocked tokens V. Thus S = C+f*V, where f is the fraction of unvested tokens that can be staked. The parameter f is set to 10%, resulting in a staking supply S = 304m+0.1*451m =&nbsp;349m.</p><p>The staking supply S is an important parameter, as it affects the mix node saturation point, meaning the stake required for a mix node to achieve maximum&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Mix node stake saturation point</p><p>The node stake saturation point, which we denote by Nsat, is given by the stake supply, target level of staking and number of rewarded nodes. The current node saturation point is approximately 726K NYM (after adjusting for the fact we aim for 50% of the supply being&nbsp;staked).</p><p>The node saturation point, Nsat, is the amount of stake (reputation) that a mix node needs in order to maximize its rewards. If all of the staking supply is taken into consideration, then the mix node saturation point is given by the staking supply S divided by the number of rewarded nodes (denoted by K and currently set to K=240 nodes), ie, the equilibrium (maximum distributed rewards) is reached when the entire staking supply S is distributed equally among K&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>Note however that this assumes that 100% of the tokens in the staking supply must be staked for the network to distribute maximum rewards. Since aiming for 100% staking is unrealistic, we have introduced a parameter b (with values between zero and one) that determines the target level of staking. Thus, for example if b=0.5, then the network reaches maximum rewards (equilibrium) when 50% of the supply S is staked on K nodes. Taking all of this into account, the node saturation point is computed as Nsat = b*S/K = b*(C+f*V)/K.</p><p>The parameters C and V (circulating and locked tokens) are given by the token distribution and vesting contracts. The parameter K (number of rewarded nodes) is selected so that there is a sufficient number of nodes in the mixnet to route all the user&nbsp;packets.</p><p>The fraction f of unvested tokens that can be staked is set to 10% as a compromise, to enable participation with locked tokens while keeping high rewards for staked circulating tokens. The target level of staking b is set to 50% to account for a fraction of the token supply not being staked. This results in Nsat = 0.5*(304m+0.1*451m)/240 = 726K&nbsp;NYM.</p><p>Mixmining pool and per-epoch node&nbsp;rewards</p><p>The mixmining pool started out with 250 million NYM and it currently still contains about 245 million NYM, after having distributed about 5 million NYM in rewards to mix nodes over the last few months. The mixmining pool is configured to make 2% of its value per month available for rewards (currently 0.02*245m =&nbsp;4.9m).</p><p>The resulting mixmining rewards available per hourly epoch for the set of rewarded nodes are about 6.800 NYM per hour (4.9 million divided by 30*24 hours). Note that out of the 6.800 NYM rewards available for distribution in an epoch, not all is given out to nodes, e.g. due to low stake or underperformance. The unallocated rewards remain in the mixmining pool for future distribution.</p><p>Considering K=240 rewarded nodes, the maximum rewards received in an epoch by any given node are about 6.800/240 = 28 NYM/hour, which are reached when the node is fully saturated with stake, has perfect performance and a very high bond. In practice, a typical node that is close to saturated, has less-than-perfect performance and a minimal bond receives about 21 NYM/hour in&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Estimated APY</p><p>Estimated APY with the new node saturation stake is approximately 29%.</p><p>Considering 21 NYM/hour earned by a node, how does the node saturation point relate to the APY of tokens staked on the node? Simply put, the higher the saturation point, the lower the APY, because those 21 NYM are shared among all the tokens staked on the&nbsp;node.</p><p>Before the vest and corresponding increase in circulating supply, the node saturation was at Nsat=430K NYM, while now it has increased to Nsat=726K NYM. A saturated node receiving 21 NYM in an epoch provided 21/430.000 NYM rewards per staked token. With an increased Nsat=726K NYM, each staked token receives 21/726.000 NYM in&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The APY is an “annual” yield that takes compounding into account, and in the case of Nym compounding happens on an hourly basis (24 times per day and 365 days per year). Thus, if the rewards per token per epoch were 21/430.000, then the APY of that node was APY = (1+21/430.000)^(24*365) — 1 = 53%. With the increased saturation point, each staked token receives 21/726.000 in rewards, and the APY = (1+21/726.000)^(24*365) — 1 =&nbsp;29%.</p><p>Note that for simplicity we are considering that the node’s profit margin is zero. A higher profit margin increases rewards (and APY) for the node operator at the expense of decreasing rewards (and APY) for the node’s delegates. (The total mix node rewards stay constant regardless of profit margin, which only affects the operator / delegates split of rewards).</p><p>Whale defenses — cap on staking for unvested&nbsp;tokens</p><p>The parameter f determines the contribution of unvested tokens to the staking supply S = C+f*V. Bonding and delegating unvested tokens as stake is now capped at 10% in order to prevent whales from hoarding the majority of rewards and ensure a fair saturation point and rewards across the&nbsp;network.</p><p>On the upper bound, f=1 considers that all 755 million tokens (whether liquid or locked in a vesting contract) can be staked. This high value of f favors whales with a substantial amount of unvested stake, by making their locked tokens have the same staking power as unlocked tokens. Considering b=0.5 and f=1, this would lead to a saturation of Nsat=1.6million NYM per node! And a corresponding APY of only&nbsp;12%.</p><p>On the lower bound, f=0 considers that only the currently liquid 304 million NYM can be staked. This low value of f favors stakeholders that do not have any unvested tokens. Considering b=0.5 and f=0 leads to a saturation of Nsat=633K NYM per node and a corresponding APY of&nbsp;34%.</p><p>In order to allow stakeholders with unvested tokens to participate in staking while limiting their overall effect on the staking supply, we select f=0.1, i.e. 10% of unvested tokens can be staked. This 10% is applied equally to all accounts with unvested&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>This results in an overall staking supply S = 304m + 0.1*451m = 349m NYM which are then factored by b=0.5 to account for a 50% staking target, leading to a target staking supply of 174 million NYM. This results in node saturation Nsat = 726K NYM and APY of 29% when considering 21 NYM/hour in rewards for a typical near-saturated node.</p><p>We are always looking for new community members to run nodes and create privacy-enhanced applications on top of Nym.

Findora Postmortem Report<blockquote>This postmortem report is written for and provided to the community to provide transparency into a recent outage. This article will describe the event, its root cause, and its resolution while highlighting how improvements will be made in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the&nbsp;issue.</blockquote> Event Date <p>Tuesday, November 15,&nbsp;2022</p> Impact &amp;&nbsp;Duration   Mainnet consensus halted  Duration: 4.5&nbsp;Hours   Overview <p>The Discreet Labs DevOps team attempted to coordinate with a set of Findora community validators for a pilot upgrade on the Findora Mainnet network. During this attempt, the Mainnet network experienced an unexpected outage. Engineers identified the issue, immediately began troubleshooting efforts, and worked with the affected validators to revert the nodes to their previous version. More community validators joined the effort to restore their&nbsp;nodes.</p> What Occurred <p>At approximately 5 PM, Nov 15, 2022 (PST), the Findora Mainnet’s consensus stopped for 4.5 hours. The incident was triggered, not caused, by several transactions sent from a newer beta version of the Findora wallet after DevOps coordinated with a set of validators during a pilot upgrade with the v0.3.3X Mainnet&nbsp;update.</p><p>The event was detected proactively by the event monitoring system. Discreet Labs began troubleshooting efforts within 10 minutes of the notification.</p> Root Cause(s) <p>The v0.3.3X update includes a new transaction parameter in the transaction body. The transaction hash calculation logic of the node is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>Deserialization -&gt; Signature Verification -&gt; Transaction Execution -&gt; Serialization -&gt; Compute Transaction Hash</blockquote><p>Since the new parameter did not exist in previous versions, nodes running v0.3.27 ignored the parameter when calculating the transaction hash. In version 0.3.3X, however, this field is involved in the transaction hash calculation, thus causing the transaction hashes to be inconsistent.</p> Resolution <p>The new transaction parameter will be ignored for hash calculation in v0.3.3X but will retain its role in signature verification. This update to release v0.3.3X will ensure transaction hashes remain backward compatible with v0.3.2X&nbsp;nodes.</p> Moving Forward <p>The Discreet Labs team has documented several lessons learned and preventive measures to take moving forward. The items below reflect the methods teams will use collaboratively to minimize risk and optimize communication.</p> Additional Testing via Mainnet-Mock   Upgrades with impact potential will undergo additional rounds of testing on a transient network called “Mainnet-Mock”. This network will be an identical copy of Mainnet, including its data and validators, acting as a mirror of Findora’s production network.  Mainnet-Mock will be created and deconstructed as needed. As a mirror copy of Mainnet, testing against the Mainnet-Mock network will require the assistance and close communication of Findora community validators to reach &gt; 66.67% consensus.  Upgrades that carry potential impact will be validated on the Mainnet-Mock network before being classified as “Mainnet-Ready”.   Change Management Process Improvements <p>Changes that can impact production will go through an improved change management process. These process improvements will ensure that all the appropriate stakeholders are in-sync with the engineering change&nbsp;task.</p>  Discreet Labs will continue to ensure that partners and CEX contacts are notified of upcoming changes using the schedule above. Technical support will continue to be provided when&nbsp;needed.  The details of changes that can impact production will be communicated extensively with the community well in advance of the scheduled change date. Discreet Labs will share information two weeks before the change, one week prior, three days prior, one day prior, the day of the change, and the day&nbsp;after.  Change information will be shared across social media, pinned to the official Discord and Telegram channels and Reddit as announcement posts. Discreet Labs will communicate to the validator community on validator-specific channels across Discord and Telegram.  Mainnet-Mock testing will be conducted as part of the change management process. See above for information on Mainnet-Mock.  <p>Special thanks to the validator community who worked together in restoring their nodes in a collaborative manner, reflecting the positive values the Findora community fosters and embraces. Your decision to help decentralize and secure the Findora network is greatly&nbsp;valued.</p><p>We look forward to upgrading Mainnet to v0.3.3X together.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability.

<p>Secure multi-party computation is a well-known cryptographic technique designed to secure digital assets or protect information cryptographically. Today, several MPC theories and algorithms are leveraged in various sectors to safeguard information. Similarly, with the rise in popularity of blockchain-based financial solutions (<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">DeFi</a>), the interest in MPC has spiked, mainly due to the applications of MPC in safeguarding funds in crypto wallets.<br></p><p>In a nutshell, multi-party computation enables programmatic solutions to secure “secrets” by splitting them into multiple parts, such that no single participant know the underlying “truth”. Thanks to this, no single participant can reconstruct or leak secret information.<br></p><p>In this article, we will understand the concept of secure multi-party computation in detail, how it works, and its numerous applications.</p> What is multi-party computation (MPC)? <p>Multi-party computation is a cryptographic technique that allows multiple parties, each in possession of fragments of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-in-the-age-of-surveillance-a-pipedream-or-something-worth-fighting-for-341a67f1db76/">private data</a>, to participate in computing a specific result. This specific result is computed by combining their data without disclosing the nature or content of their inputs or any other secret information related to the process. <br></p><p>In simpler terms, multi-party computation brings together separate entities holding pieces of information that, when combined, can reveal a secret, sign a message, or approve a transaction. It’s also worth noting that MPC achieves this without revealing any details on the information in each individual's possession.<br></p><p>It’s worth noting that in MPC, the data split across multiple participants does not represent the secret if simply combined together. Instead, these pieces of information will serve as inputs to participate in the desired computation. Every valid MPC protocol must fulfill two specific requirements:<br></p>  Suppose participants reveal their secret information or discard the rules during the computation. In that case, the multi-party computation protocol will not allow dishonest participants to force the honest parties to disclose their confidential information or influence the outcome of the result.<br>  No one can deduce each party's secret information from the protocol's execution. This means that the result of the computation does not give its holders any hint of what the private information in the participants' possession is.<br>  <p>MPC as a concept is said to be born in 1980s when Chinese computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yao">Andrew Yao</a> first adopted two-party computation and introduced secure multi-party computation. Here's what the timeline of the evolution of MPC looks like:<br></p>  1982 – 1986: To solve the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem">Millionaire's Problem</a>, Andrew Yao introduced two-party computation and adapted it to any calculation involving two parties.<br>  1987: Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Avi Wigderson release the <a href="https://wiki.mpcalliance.org/gmw.html">Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson protocol</a>, adapting two-party computation to a multi-party format.<br>  The 1990s: More studies on multi-party computation resulted in several breakthroughs, one of which was enabling MPC on mobile (i.e. less powerful) devices.<br>  2008: The first practical application of MPC at scale occurred in a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/meeting-on-privacy-enhancing-cryptography/documents/toft.pdf">sealed-bid sugar beet auction</a> in Denmark.<br>  2015: Following an increase in hacks and thefts from crypto wallets, crypto wallet providers and custodians begin utilizing MPC for private key and digital asset security.  2019: The <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/pushing-mpc-wallet-signing-speeds-8x-with-mpc-cmp-9/">MPC-CMP</a> debuted as the first automatic, one-round key-refreshing multi-party computation algorithm.   How does multi-party computation work? <p>To understand how multi-party computation works, let’s consider one famous example.<br></p><p>Greg and Smith, two employees holding similar roles at a company, are having lunch. Then, they want to know whether they earn the same amount or if any of them is being paid less than what they deserve. Yet, they do not want to reveal their wages. How do they solve this dilemma without revealing their secrets to one another?<br></p><p>A simple way to solve their problem would be to disclose their income to a trusted mutual friend, who can tell them if they earn the same wage based on the information she has received. However, the goal of a multi-party computation protocol is to help them figure out who's worth the most among them without third-party involvement.<br></p><p>Using oblivious transfers, Greg and Smith can solve their dilemma quickly. The oblivious transfer method is a non-technical way to explain secure multi-party computation. In this scenario, Greg gets four locked suggestion boxes and marks each box with a particular amount that may represent the hourly pay for their roles. Box-1 is marked $40, Box-2 is marked $50, Box-3 is marked $60, and Box-4 is marked $70.<br></p><p>Let’s say Greg earns $50 hourly, so he takes only the key for Box 2. Smith makes $60 hourly and has to select the box that matches his hourly earnings. On four pieces of paper, he writes a 'NO' on three sheets and a 'YES' on the fourth. These scribblings will go into each box, and the one with a 'YES' goes into Box-3 since Smith earns $60 per hour, while other boxes get a NO.<br></p><p>When Greg unlocks Box-2, he finds a NO, indicating that Smith does not earn $50 per hour. Greg now has to tell Smith that they do not make the same hourly wage, though neither of them knows who earns more or less. Their secrets are safe, and they have exchanged information without revealing anything. Note that this analogy depends on honesty from both parties.<br></p><p>Secure multi-party computation splits essential information that can be used to compute a specific result among multiple parties in total secrecy. Each participant only knows the information in their possession, and throughout the computation, no part of the secrets are revealed.<br></p>Another example, similar to one mentioned above, to understand the concept on MPC. (<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/secure-multi-party-computation/">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p></p>Threshold signature scheme MPC diagram. (<a href="https://www.qredo.com/blog/what-is-multi-party-computation-mpc">Source</a>) Applications of multi-party computation <p>Over the years, multi-party computation has found several use cases and applications. The earliest <a href="https://partisia.com/better-market-solutions/mpc-goes-live/">large-scale application</a> was recorded in 2008 at a sealed-bid sugar beet auction in Denmark. Farmers' bids were private, with the protocol responsible for determining the highest bid. The farmer with the winning bid went on to pay the second-highest request on the bidding log. Sealed-bid auctions remain popular still. <br></p><p>There are several variations and modifications of multi-party computation schemes enabling further applications. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">Threshold signature schemes</a> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shamirs-secret-sharing-algorithm-cryptography/">Shamir's Secret Sharing</a> are two famous examples of cryptographic methods leveraging MPC. <br></p><p>Other significant applications of MPC include:</p> Data Analytics <p>Big firms that deal with confidential user data, like healthcare companies or financial institutions, can collect data securely from an anonymous pool of users, compute, analyze, and gain insights from the data using MPC. This way, users will not reveal their personal information, and these organizations can <a href="https://soda-project.eu/mpcenterprise/">analyze</a> the data for insights without uncovering it. <br></p><p>This same method can be applied to autonomous cars, shipping or truck fleets, and aircraft fleets, with recipients like car companies, city planners, and service providers benefitting from the insights without knowing any details on the information provided.</p> Genetic Testing <p>Secure multi-party computation can also be utilized in <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7545831">genetic testing</a>. Patients can access their genetic profiles privately and securely without revealing any confidential information on their metabolism rates, family traits, hereditary disease information, and other data thatthey would rather not share.</p> Threshold MultiSig in Blockchains <p>Threshold multi-signature schemes are a subfield of multi-party computation and can perform similar functions as a private key on the blockchain, including public address generation and transaction signing. <br></p><p>With MPC, the private keys of a crypto wallet can be split (<a href="https://silencelaboratories.com/silent-shard/">shards</a>) among several parties in such a way that for any function to be performed, a minimum number of people holding key shares have to be involved. <br></p><p>If some participants within the group become dishonest, they will not be able to have their way unless they reach the threshold for signing transactions. Usually, these participants do not know each other.</p> Digital Wallet Security <p>Multi-party computation protocols enhance private key security and, by extension, digital wallet security. Most cryptocurrency wallets use private keys, usually stored in a particular '<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted</a>' device. While this method primarily depends on the strength of the device's security measures, it also presents a single point of failure. <br></p><p>Using MPC, private keys are split up between multiple entities, making it more difficult for attackers to compromise the digital wallet since they have to attack multiple points simultaneously.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Multi-party computation has evolved over the years and remains a crucial breakthrough in the world of cryptography today. From sealed-bid auctions to crypto wallets, MPC protocols are being leveraged in various applications. <br></p><p>From a blockchain perspective, however, leveraging MPC for security of digital wallets is a critical, immediate application that multiple parties are invested on. As more and more wallet providers begin to adopt MPC protocols for wallet security, the era of seed phrases may be over. As of now, several <a href="https://zengo.com/mpc-wallet/">wallet providers</a> have already started opting MPC to offer better protection and an improved user experience.<br></p><p>In the coming year, hopefully, we'll have more real-life applications of multi-party computation touching our daily lives similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/public-key-authentication">public key authentication</a>.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>I’ve been gifted quite a few insights from James Carse’s “Finite and Infinite Games” over the past month. Thank you Paul for recommending it to me a few years back. In yesterday’s livestream I reflect on Carse’s ideas of “winning,” “invisibility” before a perceived audience, and the power of “touch” as a language in contrast to being moved through external forces like cybernetic nudging. I also dig into Vannevar Bush’s ideas for an external brain, stigmergic thought trails, Xanadu, and how indexed information (possibly from tokenized “Athenian-inspired” governance systems on blockchain) could be an armature for the emergent super-organism.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I’ll restate my open invitation to publish letters from readers open to “looking around the labyrinth” with the understanding that the goal is to learn to look in our backyards with compassion at the structures – no hammers. Do come play and in doing so reassure me that I haven’t strayed too far off into the woods. I’m gathering sticks and bits of natural frippery to make a charming hideaway. Some day it will be the setting for a fabulous gathering of like-minded souls. There will be many stories to tell around the fire.</p>
<p>Until then, here are parts of the D-Cent Map that I talk about in the video above. Each image is hyperlinked to the interactive version. Enjoy the “garden of forking paths” I’ve prepared, lol.</p>

<p>Since joining Privy earlier this year, I’ve been spending most of my time working with web3 developers to help improve their products’ UX, onboarding flows, and user data privacy. I’ve spoken with over 100 founders in the space working on gaming, NFTs, web3 social, defi, payments/accounting, and much more. In spite of all the recent market uncertainty, my optimism about our market burns hotter than ever. Here are some learnings from a very deep dive with&nbsp;Privy.</p><p>Winter is here. As we bundle up and prepare for another cycle of hunkered down building, the Privy team has been reflecting on what it’ll take for web3 to unlock the next phase of adoption beyond financial use cases. In the coming months, seeds will be planted that’ll grow into the next wave of consumer apps to shape our lives. These apps must prove to be useful and fun enough to pull both my 15-year-old cousin and my 85-year-old grandma into our market (whether they know it or&nbsp;not).</p><p>Our work helping developers build better web3 products and bridge the gap between on and off chain data has given us a sense of the features these apps will need to have to hit mainstream adoption. Without further ado, here are our ingredients for developers cooking up the web3 consumer apps of tomorrow:</p>  Progressive onboarding — meet users where they are: The next billion blockchain users don’t have self-custodial wallets yet. While self-custody is perhaps the single most important feature of a web3 product, apps need first-class ways for walletless users to onboard and get immediate value. The best apps will have ways for users to onboard via email or social identities, and seamlessly upgrade to self-custody when they’re ready or as the app demands it. As the old saying goes: you’ll attract more bees with email auth than with mnemonics.  Mobile-first — bringing blockchains to every pocket: If you’ve given up on a web3 app after trying to connect on mobile, you’re not alone. The broken mobile user flow of getting misdirected to the app store upon wallet connection runs rampant, and for good reason: building mobile-optimized experiences in web3 is hard. But mobile accounts for &gt;60% of internet traffic (growing fast!). The web3 apps of tomorrow will be natively mobile — props to apps like OpenSea, Zapper, and dYdX for leading the way&nbsp;here!  Friction where it matters — when to slow a user down: Not all blockchain transactions are created equal. While it might make sense to interrupt a user session to prompt a signature on a financial transaction, many on-chain events should occur without user interruptions, notably in web3 social and gaming. Should you sign something every time you follow a new account, make an in-game move, or like a post? Of course not. Lots of exciting development in areas like session-specific keys and account abstraction will pull UX forward on this front. The best apps will be judicious about when to prompt users (shout out to our friends at Farcaster for showing us an example of what great looks&nbsp;like!).  Asset portability — open is the way to win: Whether they realize it or not, consumers will choose to use blockchain apps because they allow users to seamlessly bring their assets in and take their assets out. While it can be a tempting value capture play for developers to lock assets into their apps’ walled gardens, this misses the point! Games that let users bring their own leveling reputation and that let users leave with assets they earn in gameplay stand to attract new potential audiences and deliver much richer first time experiences for those audiences off the bat. Financial assets, user data, and identity will travel with users across the internet, and developers who build for more than just using blockchain as a financial backdrop for their apps can unlock new user experiences that are only possible in&nbsp;web3.  <p>It’s always darkest before dawn. Winters are exactly the sort of distraction-free environments necessary to breed the innovations that pull our market forward each cycle: it’s no coincidence that Ethereum and Uniswap were launched in the depths of 2015 and 2018, respectively. As long as we cook up the next generation of web3 apps with the above in mind, this should be the last winter before mainstream consumer adoption is here to&nbsp;stay.</p><p>We’re lucky to be serving the builders working day-and-night to turn mainstream adoption into a reality, and we can’t wait to show you all what we’ve been up to these past few&nbsp;months.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.privy.io/how-crypto-goes-mainstream-from-here-d1371be33d5f">How Crypto Goes Mainstream from Here</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.privy.io">Privy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Brazil’s first national smart city initiative, <a href="https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/brazil-launches-new-smart-cities-program">Cidades Digitais</a>, began in 2012. It was replaced in 2019 by <a href="https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/geral/noticia/2019-07/brazil-launches-initiative-sustainable-smart-cities">Nacional de Estrategia para Cidades Inteligentes Sustentaveis</a>, advancing adoption of facial recognition infrastructure, connected agriculture, urban mobility, and electronic health records. The 2014 FIFA World Cup provided officials in Rio de Janeiro the excuse they needed to ramp up deployment of “smart” technologies. That effort that was expanded with the 2016 Olympic games.</p>
<p>As preparations were underway for Rio’s World Cup, the Rockefeller Foundation was launching its “100 Resilient Cities” program. Rockefeller officials selected UK-based global consultancy Arup to create <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/design-book-resilient-cities">a design book</a> for cities of the future. The firm consulted on several Olympic facilities in Rio, is <a href="https://www.arup.com/perspectives/publications">deeply embedded in UN SDG planning efforts</a>, as well as being collaborator with <a href="https://e-lib.iclei.org/publications/Resilient-Cities-Thriving-Cities_The-Evolution-of-Urban-Resilience.pdf">ICLEI</a>. That project resulted in a “<a href="https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/City-Resilience-Framework-2015.pdf">framework</a>” for cities where “inclusive’ and “integrated” data would be captured to inform response for future crises.</p>
<p>Arup <a href="https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/arup-opens-permanent-offices-in-brazil">established permanent offices in Rio and Sao Paulo</a> in 2012 knowing there would be a lot of work coming through the pipeline. One of Arup’s projects was a “child-centered resiliency” report for the favelas of Salvador, funded by the Bernard Van Leer Foundation, a philanthropy backing the <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/363501-Seminario_Internacional_De_Primeira_Infancia">creation of early childhood impact investing markets</a> in Brazil. It was one part of Salvador’s larger <a href="http://www.salvadorresiliente.salvador.ba.gov.br/salvador_resiliente_pdf_eng/#p=10">200+-page resiliency plan</a> that identified the following “pillars:” cultural identity (social engineering); healthy communities (bio-surveillance); inclusive economy (digital ID + fin-tech); innovative governance (data-driven public-private partnerships); and urban transformation (sustainable panopticon).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.salvadorresiliente.salvador.ba.gov.br/salvador_resiliente_pdf_eng/#p=1"></a></p>
<p>Once you understand that engineering poor communities is central to the social impact / AI machine learning enterprise, you can see why venture philanthropists are so interested in Brazil’s favelas.&nbsp; This moment has been a long time coming as NGOs with international ties, like Theresa Williamson’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_Communities">Catalytic Communities</a>, have harnessed grassroots organizing and groomed community leaders for their moment to shine as quality human capital on data dashboards set up by B-Lab’s social entrepreneurs and the University of Pennsylvania, the alma mater of both <a href="https://catcomm.org/theresa-williamson/">Dr. Williamson</a> and Judith Rodin. Williamson, originally from the UK, has been working in Rio de Janeiro for two decades, bringing her Ivy-League credentials and connections to implement a community solutions database, embed digital organizing, rebrand slums as culturally rich favelas (setting up future markets in creative capital), and install an Asset Based Community Development framework (a Northwestern University developed model that will prop up sustainable finance projections).</p>
<p>Capturing the arts and creative thought within the container of social impact finance is a priority for those in power, lest truly imaginative and revolutionary ideas take hold and break through the veneer of cybernetic control. Program officers have travelled the world proselytizing that the arts must be exploited to maximize their measurable economic contributions. A project financed by the British Council in 2017 laid out a <a href="https://www.britishcouncil.org.br/sites/default/files/brazilian_creative_economy_online_sem4_new-fg.pdf">framework for the creative economy in Brazil</a>. The emphasis is always on inclusiveness – to pull those on the margins, including youth and women, into the vortex of social entrepreneurship. Know what we know about the rise of digital economics, NFTs, and the imperative to design the Metaverse, it goes without saying that the impact investors will seek to digitize all forms of creative expression to make it profitable from an impact standpoint, and legible for machine learning. A 2021 paper “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2624-6511/4/4/67/htm">The Favela as a Place for Development of Smart Cities in Brazil: Local Needs and New Business Strategies</a>, “states the following:</p>
<p>“Seen by many in a simplistic way, summed up to be geographic spaces of drug circulation dominated by trafficking, Brazilian favelas have been consolidating themselves as storehouses of innovative minds, a creative territory with multiple and complex structures. These places today can produce a positive image with potential for market exploitation. Therefore, the objective was to draw a relationship between the creative economy, branding and favelas, considering the concept of smart cities that include products and services from the slums.”</p>
<p>In the above paragraph, favela residents are seen as resources to be exploited. The challenge for policy makers devising a robust policy structure that sounds equitable whereby these people’s lives can be remade as commodities that can be integrated into digital knowledge, learning, creative, and eco-tourist economic transactions. The built environment in which they live is a maze that makes their resources difficult to access. Thus, numerous mapping and demographic projects are underway by academic institutions working to make the social relations and geography of the favelas more readily understood by outsiders. In the country’s rich tradition of marronage, where enslaved people escaped their captors for distant outposts in jungles or swaps, the favelas had long been as Greenwald notes, beyond the reach or interest of the state.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2624-6511/4/4/67/htm"></a></p>
<p>That, however, is changing as drones, apps, geospatial mapping, and laser scanning, pushed under cover of digital equity and inclusion, have begun to chart the terrain of the favelas with granular detail. Residents’ existence is about to fundamentally change. They will be “included,” the question is included in what?</p>
<p>In the coming era of stakeholder capitalism and circular economies a person’s use of privatized welfare (inputs) will be evaluated against their economic productivity and good citizenship status (outputs) according to ever-changing rules of a game set by corporate governments. With pre-natal monitoring and blockchain electronic health records and birth certificates, it is possible this would start before birth. Add to that geo-spatial atlases augmented with socio-historical data such as that being collected for <a href="https://www.imaginerio.org/">imagineRio</a>, by Houston-based (and nano-bio-tech research hub) Rice University. The possibilities for factoring intergenerational trauma into predictive profiling for human capital bets are jaw dropping. Rice University has <a href="https://brazil.rice.edu/partner-highlights/">numerous partnerships</a>, including University of Sao Paulo and the army’s Institute of Military Engineering, cultivated through <a href="https://brazil.rice.edu/">Brasil@Rice</a> and the Houston embassy.</p>
<p>In the United States, and in <a href="https://aceawarescotland.com/conference/">Scotland</a> tapped to become the first ACEs-aware nation, there has been a huge push to screen for Adverse Childhood Experiences and score the results using a tool created by <a href="https://community.kp.org/stories/news/kp-invests-50-million-in-innovative-partnership-to-address-homelessness">Kaiser Permanente</a>, a health system that is now a leading voice on social impact investing. You can read my 2019 post about pay for success finance and ACEs scoring <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/02/05/ace-adverse-childhood-experience-scores-part-of-the-pay-for-success-plan/">here</a>. A quick search for “Adverse Childhood Experiences” + “Screening” + “Brazil” results in numerous research studies carried out in the past five years: <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346734863_Adverse_Childhood_Experiences_and_Child_Development_Outcomes_in_Ceara_Brazil_A_Population-based_Study">here</a>, <a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/qfR5fGYkSNt7G45wwYPGJSG/?lang=en">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260803234_Childhood_trauma_and_suicide_risk_in_a_sample_of_young_individuals_aged_14-35_years_in_southern_Brazil">here</a>. Trauma metrics in the scoring will be used to impose data-driven non-solutions on needy communities.</p>
<p>Scientists have linked childhood trauma to changes in one’s genetic profile. They have carried out <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6127768/">research</a> indicating epigenetic trauma carries across and accumulates over generations, which is significant for communities that have faced ongoing physical and economic violence. California’s Governor <a href="https://www.acesaware.org/blog/california-screens-more-than-500000-children-and-adults-for-adverse-childhood-experiences/">Gavin Newsom</a>, a lockdown fanatic who’s campaign was funded by Silicon Valley and the San Francisco <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-gavin-newsom-san-francisco-money/">Pritzker family</a> (JP Pritzker, Illinois governor sponsored creation of James Heckman’s early childhood investment equation), has been a heavy promoter of comprehensive ACEs screenings of anyone on Medicaid and for children. His appointment to <a href="https://burkefoundation.org/what-drives-us/adverse-childhood-experiences-aces/">Dr. Nadine Burke-Harris</a> to the position of Surgeon General of California signaled this would be a high-profile issue for his administration.</p>

<p>Will legacies of domination be mapped and factored into social impact deals that leverage their cumulative trauma for “pay for success” investor profit? &nbsp;Check out <a href="https://senseable.mit.edu/">MIT’s Senseable Lab</a> where <a href="https://worldarchitecture.org/article-links/evpem/mit-senseable-city-lab-reveals-favelas-4d-project-a-digital-map-analyzing-brazil-s-favelas.html">favelas are mapped in 4-D</a> with devices that capture <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428111109/https:/www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/28/1022742/rio-de-janeiro-digital-map-favelas-rocinha-brazil-cities/">300,000 datapoints a second</a>; <a href="https://www.imaginerio.org/en/about">Rice University’s historic atlas of social relations in Rio</a>; and disturbingly Google’s<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/project/rio-de-janeiro">Rio Beyond The Map</a> in partnership with <a href="https://samagame.com/blog/en/afrogames-announces-partnership-with-oi-in-esports-project-in-favela/">AfroReggae</a>.

<p>So when I see gaming interests teaming up with Google to map (twin? simulate?) favelas that are literally centerpieces of games like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Y6PLrOGTg">Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</a> (Ubisoft 2016), it feels like that future is already here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Y6PLrOGTg"></a></p>
 Smart Cities – Mixed Reality Gaming Environments 
<p>In the game that hedge funds want to play with our lives, smart cities have been set up as social impact game boards with embedded nudges and omnipresent surveillance. I should know; I live in a city of pawns. IBM launched a $50 million three-year project in 2010 to “build a smarter planet.” Twenty-four US cities received pro-bono corporate consulting services. Philadelphia was on-boarded in 2011 with a project that was somewhat surprising to me at the time. The “smarted” up infrastructure ended up being low-income youth placed on regional-workforce career pathways called <a href="http://www.smartercitieschallenge.org/applications/philadelphia-united-states-summary-2011.pdf">digital on-ramps</a>. It was the early stages of blockchain badges tied to human capital finance, which has since evolved into learning lockers like Greenlight Credentials based in Dallas that runs on IBM’s Hyperledger. Those “free” consultations were all about market-shaping.</p>
<p>IBM held a “Smarter Cities” global conference in Rio de Janeiro in 2011. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/article/rio.html">opening presentation</a> featured IBM’s <a href="https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/ioe-based-rio-operations-center">Rio Command Center</a> a centralized data hub built for risk analysis and coordination around natural disasters, security, traffic management, and municipal concerns. The <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/International-Case-Studies-of-Smart-Cities-Rio-de-Janeiro-Brazil.pdf">catalyst for its creation</a> was a devastating weather event in April of 2010 that resulted in flooding and mudslides. The story goes that because of the disaster, a decision was made to create an exemplary global surveillance hub – “The Watchful Eyes of the City.”</p>
<p>The unspoken plan was that the IBM model would be used to sell the concept to other cities through strategic media campaigns. Hundreds of visitors a month are brought through the facility, which is largely inaccessible to residents. After its work in Rio, the United Nations tapped IBM, along with AECOM Engineering, to design a <a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/news/ibm-and-aecom-join-un-campaign-make-cities-resilient">template for disaster resilience scorecard</a>. While ostensibly meant to better protect lives and economic activities in vulnerable urban areas, it’s hard to set aside the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/disaster-risk-financing-and-insurance-program">World Bank’s catastrophe bond</a> product line launched in 2010, the same year as the command center.</p>
<p>By 2015 the program grew to include 30 municipal agencies, 100 47-inch high-definition screens, 1,000 surveillance cameras, 15,000 sensors, a geo-portal system with 250 thematic layers, and LAB.RIO an e-citizen communications network of SMS messaging, social media apps, and digital civic participation. The emphasis on digital communications, noted in a <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/publications/english/document/International-Case-Studies-of-Smart-Cities-Rio-de-Janeiro-Brazil.pdf">2016 case study</a> sponsored by the InterAmerican Development Bank with support from the <a href="https://eng.krihs.re.kr/about/history.do">Korean Institute For Human Settlements</a> (note <a href="https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/seoul-pledges-33-1m-to-metaverse-project/">Korea and Seoul being early Metaverse pioneers</a>), caught my eye. Notable was the attention given to social media interactions, specifically Twitter and Twitter alerts (Jack Dorsey, the recreation center donor). It appears the hub was tasked with refining digital twin operations, maximizing sensor data (weather, traffic, etc.) and joining it with layers with signals intelligence drawn an array of electronic communications – OSINT.</p>
<p>Today’s Open-Source Intelligence encompasses vastly more signals gathered from sensors embedded in the environment that interface with Individual Communication Technology (ICT). Research into how to harness those signals and create systems of programmed behavioral nudging has been led by Alex “Sandy” Pentland, professor of <a href="https://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/pgasite/documents/webpage/pga_082159.pdf">social physics</a> and human dynamics at MIT Media Lab. Pentland is a leader in the digital identity space, collaborating on <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/interest/hardjono-pentland.html">blockchain development</a> with the World Wide Web Consortium.</p>
<p>The Rio Hub project also encompasses <a href="https://www.data.rio/">DATA.RIO</a>, the Bloomberg “what works” open municipal data protocol that needs to be put in place before the digital twinning can start. The collected metrics legitimize social impact investment deals under a deceptive banner of transparency and accountability. It’s useful to note that Bloomberg Philanthropies has been active in Brazil. Projects include: vision-zero planning for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/bloomberg-philanthropies-selects-ten-cities-five-countries-participate-new-phase-global-road-safety-initiative/">Sao Paulo and Fortaleza</a> and a national <a href="https://www.theiacp.org/projects/the-bloomberg-philanthropies-initiative-for-global-road-safety-bigrs">Road Safety Plan</a>; the 2014 Sao Paulo <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/bloomberg-philanthropies-sponsors-31st-sao-paulo-bienal-mobile-app/">Bienal</a> art event; a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/brazilian-cities-aligning-growth-with-sustainable-urban-development/">2015 greenhouse emissions report</a> prepared by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro; 2019 Mayor’s Challenge Award for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-06-15/bloomberg-philanthropies-2021-mayors-challenge-names-top-50-global-urban-innovations-emerging-from-pandemic-kpxirt61">mapping Rio’s favelas</a>; investments in <a href="https://assets.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/26/2017/05/May_2017_Annual_Report.pdf">obesity prevention</a>; and <a href="https://assets.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/26/2017/05/May_2017_Annual_Report.pdf">fishery management</a> in Fortaleza.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting in terms of timing given that it happened shortly before the pandemic was declared, is a <a href="https://crvsgateway.info/file/21436/5057">four-year project with Vital Strategies</a> to systematize and establish technologies including apps and AI databases to document causes of death throughout the country. According to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-eGxq2mMoEGwgSpNVL5j2sa6ToojZUZ-Zun8h2oBAR4/edit#gid=0">Jack Dorsey’s spreadsheet</a>, the foundation made a $20 million contribution to <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/369315-Vital_Strategies">Vital Strategies</a> in June of 2020 and handed over another $18 million in October of 2020 for digital tools to “fight the spread of Covid.”</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-eGxq2mMoEGwgSpNVL5j2sa6ToojZUZ-Zun8h2oBAR4/edit?usp=sharing"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://littlesis.org/person/374726-Jose_Luis_Castro">Jose Luis Castro</a>, executive director, has a background in public health research having done stints with the World Health Organization and the New York City Department of Mental Health and Hygiene. Through his work he has established close relationships with Michael Bloomberg and global aid organizations in the United State and the United Kingdom. The emphasis is on preventative care as a health INVESTMENT. Vital Strategies’ “<a href="https://www.vitalstrategies.org/author/jcastro/page/8/">Resolve to Save Lives</a>” was touted by the Center for High Impact Philanthropy at the University of Pennsylvania as a “best bet” for high-impact philanthropic investment.</p>
<p>In a “<a href="https://www.un.org/en/coronavirus/brazil%E2%80%99s-favelas-organize-fight-covid-19">stories from the field</a>” propaganda piece we see the United Nations Information Centres and HABITAT program enmeshing itself in the favelas, spreading their Covid containment narratives with murals, t-shirts, and slick messaging campaigns intended to look homespun and emphasize disingenuous values of “collective” care. A partner in this effort is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswaldo_Cruz_Foundation">Oswaldo Cruz Foundation</a> (FIOCRUZ), started in 1898 to create serums related to the bubonic plague and implement sanitation campaigns. Based in Rio, it now has over 7,500 employees and is one of the largest public health organizations in the world, hardly a disinterested party.</p>
<p>I’ve done extensive research into how preventative health care metrics for chronic illnesses like asthma, diabetes, and heart and lung disease (conditions often caused or exacerbated by environmental pollution, endemic violence, and economic stress) are being woven into a data-driven social impact market in the United States. Under the guise of tracking population health, Black and Brown communities are being targeted for intense data surveillance. Communities defined by trauma and dispossession, like the favelas, represent valuable data deposits. These deposits are the foundation on which the Impact Management Project will construct its “sustainable” empire of managed poverty. In the favelas, they’ve struck “social impact” digital gold presuming they get everyone on the blockchain, which is what the health passports are meant to accomplish. I was asked to write about this issue a year ago by Urban Global Health Alliance. Go <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2021/01/10/population-health-human-capital-bonds-and-black-america/">here</a> for more details.</p>
<p>One paragraph really stood out for me in the UN, “stories from the field” article:</p>
<p>“The Social Territories Program implemented by the Pereira Passos Institute in partnership with the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements, aims to reduce the risk posed to vulnerable families living in Rio’s ten largest slums. The project implemented by the municipality of Rio De Janeiro in partnership with UN-HABITAT, identifies people who are extremely vulnerable in the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro and directs them to public services or cash transfer programs. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the search for these people, previously made in person, is now conducted by telephone. More than 1,600 calls have been made to date.”</p>
<p>It aligns with a push for digital welfare systems. In the US this transition has been advanced by the Zuckerberg-backed <a href="https://littlesis.org/org/362742-Benefits_Data_Trust">Benefits Data Trust</a>. In Philadelphia the effort called <a href="https://bdtrust.org/benephilly-expands-to-city-health-centers-and-community-schools/">BenePhilly,</a> and operates in with community partners, including Project Home, a Catholic supportive housing organization that was the first non-profit in the city to adopt pay for success finance.</p>
 Green Finance, Digital Twins, and What Work’s Government 
<p>Peter Head, Executive Chairman of Arup, leads the Ecological Sequestration Trust. The organization, which calls itself a “resilience broker,” was a Rockefeller Foundation effort, put together during a series of meetings held at their Bellagio conference center starting in 2015; that’s the same place where the <a href="https://magazine.wharton.upenn.edu/digital/the-state-of-impact-investing/">Global Impact Investment Network</a> was formed in 2007. A new financial fiction, <a href="https://affirmativeim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AIM-US-Liquid-Impact-Fund-2019-Impact-Report.pdf">environmental green bonds</a>, is required to channel trillion of dollars of concentrated wealth previously poured in toxic real estate deals into projects aligned to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Head tees this all up with a convenient <a href="https://ecosequestrust.org/roadmap2030.pdf">roadmap</a> to drive us into a “New Urban Social Contract.” The preface of EST’s document was written by <a href="https://littlesis.org/person/76332-Jeffrey_D_Sachs">Jeff Sachs</a>, professor of economics home at Columbia University (home to technocracy) and special advisor to South Korean diplomat and former Secretary of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. Sachs presented at the Vatican’s “<a href="https://littlesis.org/relationships/1577902">Connectivity is a Human Right</a>” in 2017. You can’t have a digital democracy, or social impact investment markets, if your cyber citizens aren’t plugged in. They start the paper with the final goal, Goal 17 “Partnerships.” The climate / sustainability narrative is about remaking society into a fully cybernetic system to run gambling bets on everything from natural disasters, to prescribed behaviors, to health crises and all can be tweaked using <a href="https://thetechnetwork.io/why-digital-twins-emerge-as-the-ultimate-tool-for-resilient-cities/">digital twin simulations</a> to create desired outcomes good and bad. It’s a totally rigged game created by self-aggrandizing “partners.” To them, humans and the natural world are merely game pieces; and if those in power successfully paint their machinations green, it appears many people are ready to allow the game to continue.</p>
<p>The Ecological Sequestration Trust devised systems management software, <a href="https://ecosequestrust.org/about/how-resilience-io-can-build-value-into-city-regions-animated-short-film/">resilience.io</a>, that layers information about a region’s economics, government policies, resources, and development plans to evaluate social benefit on a variety of dashboards. Peter Head’s intent is to usher in a new “<a href="https://www.theplanner.co.uk/opinion/making-planning-an-agent-of-global-change">ecological age</a>” where gamified platforms could be used to track social relations in “circular economies.” Metrics will be used to construct cost off-sets needed before <a href="https://affirmativeim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AIM-US-Liquid-Impact-Fund-2019-Impact-Report.pdf">ESG</a> (Environmental Social Governance) investors can profit from offering band aid fixes for the environmental harm and poverty they had a hand in creating. Building from the initial carbon credit premise of assigning value in non-traditional ways, the door has been thrown open for the creation of Natural Asset Corporations, just starting to be traded on Wall Street. Analysts assign everything on the planet a price associated with its destruction, and thus by not destroying everything right away, those running the machine are able to continue to draw out value as they replace the natural with the synthetic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theplanner.co.uk/2017/10/04/making-planning-agent-global-change"></a></p>
<p>Six years later Rockefeller’s “100 Resilient Cities” morphed two complementary groups. <a href="https://resilientcitiesnetwork.org/partners">The Global Resilient Cities Network</a> and Resilient Cities Catalyst. The first a collective of 200 City Resilience Officers working with global financial interests active in the region such as <a href="https://bidlab.org/en">IDB Innovation Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.avina.net/en/contact/">Avina Fundacion</a>, <a href="https://www.caf.com/en/">CAF Development Bank of Latin America</a>. <a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/">EDB (Economic Development Board) Singapore</a> is a core funder, so it seems that is the planned cybernetic city model. Brazil currently has three cities participating in this network: Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, and Porto Alegre.</p>
<p>Resilient Cities Catalyst on the other hand is tasked with getting policies in place to channel global capital into data-driven “sustainable” social impact markets through lobbying, strategic convenings, and change-agent training. They focus on refining “<a href="https://www.rcc.city/our-progress">resiliency tools</a>” and lining up pilot public-private partnerships that will later be brought to scale through their “diverse” community of practitioners.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.rcc.city/board-of-directors">Judith Rodin</a>, former University of Pennsylvania President and Rockefeller Foundation head who led the creation of the <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2017/11/26/gambling-with-our-futures-big-data-global-finance-and-digital-life/">Global Impact Investment Network</a>, is board chair. The founding principal is <a href="https://www.rcc.city/michael-berkowitz">Michael Berkowitz</a>, coordinator of the initial effort. Prior to that, Berkowitz served as global head of Operational Risk Management for Deutsche Bank after serving as deputy commissioner of the Office of Emergency Response in New York City during Bloomberg’s administration.</p>
<p>So many climate and equity programs emerged after the UN SDGs were adopted in 2015, it’s impossible to keep track of them all. I do want to point out considerable overlap between the above two programs and <a href="https://www.c40.org/about-c40/">C40 cities</a>. In the latter, cities earn their membership by documenting emission reductions. The four participating cities in Brazil are: Salvador, Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Curitiba. What’s important to know about this effort is <a href="https://www.c40.org/funders-partners/">Bloomberg Philanthropies</a> is a lead funder, which means the “evidence-based” solutions that will be imposed are actually about <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2019/09/22/sustainability-for-financiers-what-climate-marchers-need-to-know-about-the-un-sustainable-development-goals/">harvesting impact data</a> so markets to hedge and trade off-sets can be devised– not just carbon off-sets, but offsets related to supposed “equitable futures,” really privatized social welfare. This is euphemistically described as “<a href="https://www.c40.org/what-we-do/influencing-the-global-agenda/financing-the-green-transition/">financing the green transition</a>.”</p>
<p>In addition to Bloomberg, another strategic partner is <a href="https://ciff.org/regions/global/">Children’s Investment Fund Foundation</a>. The organization’s website state’s CIFF’s activities in Brazil include renewables uptake, air quality measures, and preservation of the rainforest, but I’m sure early childhood and home visit programs cannot be far behind. “Child Health and Development,” UN SDG 3 and 4, and “Girl Capital,” UN SDG 5 are both listed as <a href="https://ciff.org/priorities/">priority areas</a>. We know they are targeting children with a goal of reducing their lives to quantifiable data commodities, ESG portfolio assets, pliable human capital to be molded as dutiful citizens of the Metaverse. You can read more about Bloomberg’s “what works” government approach in <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/06/24/a-100-million-secret-bipartisan-political-plan-to-privatize-the-public-sector/">a piece</a> I wrote in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>It is a testament to the mind control exerted by Extinction Rebellion that so many blindly follow “green” leaders not realizing that green is cash in the pockets of defense contractors, tech companies, and financiers profiting from “build back better” nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and spatial web ubiquitous computing that binds the fiction together. Covid provided us a front row seat for what tyranny by dashboard looks like. If they can convince people to live their lives in confined isolated spaces primarily through screens, the psychological warfare campaigns are more readily deployed. The data analysts working for the billionaires want us to believe in a surreality conjured up on digital interfaces more than we trust our own senses, our own instincts.</p>
<p>A global project requires global standards, which brings me to an important article written by Raul Diego of <a href="https://siliconicarus.org/">Silicon Icarus</a>, “<a href="https://siliconicarus.org/2021/10/20/a-permanent-state-of-exception-the-nists-critical-role-in-smart-city-development/">A Permanent State of Exception NIST’s Critical Role in Smart City Development</a>.” Raul highlights the National Institute of Science and Technology’s efforts to launch global pilots and refine open standards for cyber-physical systems, “harmonizing” proprietary devices so they can communicate with one another in a straightforward <a href="https://www.usascp.org/sites/default/files/Resources/organizations/Rhee%202016%20catalyzing%20IoT%20and%20SCs.pdf">plug-and-play manner</a>. In the minutes from a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/smartgrid/SGAC-Meeting-09-09-2014-Minutes.pdf">2014 virtual meeting of NIST administrators</a>, Chris Greer, head of cyber-physical systems, provided updates regarding planning for Grid 3.0 with the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel that had representation from Korea, the EU, and Brazil. Testbeds for cyber-physical systems were being set up as that time and they were preparing for the launch of the Global Cities Team Challenge. That program did not involve public funding, but rather it was an opportunity for companies to coordinate with NIST to bring their products to scale.</p>
<p>The cloud world has no borders, neither does capital flowing into disruptive technologies. To facilitate markets and bring the Metaverse online, digital infrastructure must be carefully orchestrated. Picture the transcontinental railroad’s construction forcing the <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/railroad-gauges-standardization">standardization of railroad gauges</a>. In 2017 the National Coordination Office for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development presented a federal strategic plan for “smart” communities for public comment. <a href="https://www.nitrd.gov/nitrdgroups/images/f/f2/RFC_Responses_SCC_StratPlan.pdf">A detailed response</a> was provided by IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers) regarding their efforts to transition governments around the world into smart infrastructures that center, Internet of Things sensors and AI data analytics. IEEE has affiliated cities in Brazil – Londrina and Natal, where they hosted their <a href="http://orbicite.com/en/building-together-smart-cities-first-ieee-smart-city-summer-school-in-natal-brazil/">first smart cities summer school</a> for a week in 2017. There is also a “<a href="https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/brazil-unveils-its-newest-smart-city-that-puts-people-first-4209">Smart City Natal</a>,” developed by <a href="https://www.planetsmartcity.com/">Planet Smart City</a>, based in London with Italian founders, whose brand promise is new construction planned communities built around affordable housing. They have <a href="https://www.planetsmartcity.com/projects/">multiple projects</a> in Brazil, India, and Italy. <a href="https://www.planetsmartcity.com/leadership/">Stefano Buono</a>, chair, is an investor and physicist who happened to make his fortune in a radiopharmaceutical company he sold to Novartis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/brazil-unveils-its-newest-smart-city-that-puts-people-first-4209"></a></p>
<p>Reading between the lines of IEEE’s comments, the technocratic foundations for social impact investing can be seen in this excerpt “…it is also valuable to map and bind civic issues and progress against these issues with general metrics and indicator systems. This will allow a clear understanding of how elected government is performing in and around “the classic way of working” while allowing digital efforts and requirements, with an initial goal of seeing how these can improve, enhance, or replace classic government methods.”</p>
<p>“…replace classic government methods” sounds a bit like MIT’s Media Lab’s, Cesar Hidalgo, idea that we <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40557688/this-plan-for-an-ai-based-direct-democracy-outsources-votes-to-a-predictive-algorithm">outsource voting rights to AI digital twins</a> to achieve radical direct democracy.</p>
<p>Underpinning what they term “real-time digital democracy” is <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1451.99/10355/">IEEE P1451-99</a>, IoT harmonization that bridges devices to different protocols pulsing our personal data through the Metaverse. If you read the description for P1451-99 it speaks of global authenticated identities, authorizations, life-cycle management, interoperable communication, IoT discovery, and use of meta-data to dynamically react to changing environments. It’s vital that we understand that on the Internet of Everything life is just another thing, whether a human life, or a tagged bird or tree, or soil tracked through quantum dots.</p>
<p><a href="https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1451.99/10355/"></a></p>
<p>With the steady hand of NIST on the wheel, there is considerable money to be made on “smart” infrastructure, the data it generates, and “pay for success” financial deals, fictions built on top of that data. In a sense, market logic compels us to break down our previous mode of living to “build back better,” since this process creates opportunities for capital flows that would not be possible if we simply repaired our existing infrastructure. Last year a piece in Bloomberg by Grand View Research estimated that five years from now the smart cities market, which encompasses transit, construction, energy, healthcare, security, water and assisted living, would be worth over <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-03-09/smart-cities-market-size-worth-463-9-billion-by-2027-cagr-24-7-grand-view-research-inc">$460 billion</a>. As with post-war reconstruction – destroy civilizations and those with capital can pick up assets on the cheap, holding them until the subsidized rebuild is firmly underway to flip and sell on the upside. Now “the war” is the climate narrative, the Covid narrative, and quiet weapons of frequency and particles existing beyond the average person’s ability to perceive or even entertain if truth be told.</p>
<p>Once we agree to run the world on dashboards, the algorithms will digitally twin the planet – that “smarter” planet IBM was after. Dassault recently created a twin for the <a href="https://www.hannovermesse.de/en/news/news-articles/dassault-systemes-builds-a-second-singapore">City-State of Singapore</a>, the ultimate technocracy. Such a massive program of world-wide digital surveillance would never fly if the technocrats carrying out R&amp;D and policy work acknowledged what it was, a permanent digital enclosure branded as a tokenized commons. Instead, for a decade the efforts of Global Cities Team Challenge participants have been spun as an ambitious program designed to improve lives, especially the lives of the poor and disenfranchised, by making us more “connected.” We are fast approaching an Internet of Everything age in which the natural energetics of an interconnected universe are being overtaken by a militarized web. The engagement we are in is about energy flows; and consciousness, too, but global players in the energy sector are driving a transition to decentralized power, which is anything but “just” or “green.”</p>

<p>NFT Community management tasks help to ensure the smooth running of the community and its future development in <a href="https://zaisan.io/web3-explained/">Web3</a>. It helps to keep track of community events and developments and to keep the community organised and cohesive to the project goal. Community management can help to resolve disputes and to show empathy to digital asset owners. Nevertheless, NFT holders are, in essence, shareholders of the project. NFT community management is becoming even more important as Web3 communities continue to grow, and remember, with a strong community, anything is possible.</p>



 Quick refresh: what is an NFT (community)? 



<p>The management of non-fungible tokens (NFT) communities is a critical but often overlooked aspect of developing and deploying these digital assets. NFTs are unique tokens on a blockchain that can represent ownership of digital or physical assets. In contrast to fungible tokens, which are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller units, NFTs are non-divisible. Due to their rarity or uniqueness, they are ideal to represent items like art, collectibles, and in-game items with monetary value.</p>



<p>NFT communities are flourishing online spaces where people with a shared interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can connect with one another. As the popularity of NFTs continues to grow, as do too the number of people flocking to these communities in search of information, advice, and support.</p>







 Why NFT community management is essential 



<p>With such a wide range of people with different levels of knowledge and expertise, NFT community management can be a challenge. It is important to strike a balance between providing content that is both informative and accessible to all, while also avoiding overwhelming newcomers with too much information.</p>



<p>While the technical aspects of creating and deploying NFTs are essential, it is equally important to have a well-managed community around the project. This is because NFTs are often bought and sold in online communities. The success of an NFT project depends on the strength of these communities. For example, an NFT gaming community needs players to support the game, therefore, enjoy playing the game<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> to transact in-game assets</a> with one another.</p>



<p>A good NFT community will have a variety of content that covers the basics of what NFTs are and how they work. Additionally, it includes more in-depth articles and discussions for those with a more advanced understanding. It is also essential to have a system in place for moderating content and managing users in order to keep the community respectful and welcoming to all. One way is by establishing rules and best practices written on communication channels, as well as creating a tutorial page for newcomers.</p>



<p>With the right mix of content and community management, NFT communities can be a valuable resource for anyone interested in this exciting technology. It can be a fun entry point to the Web3 world!</p>



 3 Tips to create a strong foundation for your NFT Community 



<p>There are a few things that project owners should keep in mind when managing their NFT communities.</p>



 1. Constantly remind people of your vision 



<p>Have a clear vision and to communicate constantly with your members. This way, you can keep everyone on the same page and working towards the same goals. Let’s take an example: using Web3 technology, an NFT online chess game allows users to interact with in-game assets and transact<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-games-tokenising-game-digital-assets/"> </a>them. It creates a <a href="https://zaisan.io/play-to-earn-business-models-games/">Play-to-Earn (P2E) model</a>. For instance, this NFT game has the vision to create a community in which chess players can enjoy playing the game while earning rewards in forms of digital assets, NFTs and cryptocurrency. It is therefore necessary for the weekly content plan to include benefits and positive facts about NFT online chess in order to create rapport and build high beliefs about the project as more players join.</p>



 2. Active moderation is key 



<p>The project ambassadors should be active in the community and should engage with community members on a regular basis. This is essentially getting more experienced people in the community to be a moderator. They should be the ones who are zealously advocating for the project. But as a project that just started, it is indispensable to have a community manager to push forward content and to be listening to the market needs.</p>



 3. Get people involved in decision-making 



<p>Finally, it is vital to have a community-centered approach to decision-making. This means that the community should be involved in decisions about the project, such as what features to add or what direction to take the project in. This will lead the project to a democratic system. The funds spent on NFTs are being directed to the project development from a shared decision-making perspective. In practice, this can be done by a voting system or members’ livestream meetings with the project owner.</p>

<p>Today I’d planned to meet with Thaddeus Squire, Chief Steward of the Social Impact Commons, but he only wanted to talk on Zoom. What does it mean when an advocate for “the commons” works remotely and opts not to meet face to face? I guess this is our “new normal” where civil society is fed to AI in bite-size chunks. I cancelled the meeting and gave a two-hour presentation instead about what I’d hoped to tell Mr. Squire in person.</p>
<p>Check out the video below for an explanation about how social prescribing has been set up to undergird social impact profit taking via public health data analytics. So many well-meaning people seem intent on facilitating the tokenization of every sacred aspect of life and in doing so are unthinkingly shoving us down a path those in power imagine will lead to the emergence of a complex super-organism birthed from our collective consciousness.</p>
<p>I prepared this slide presentation on social prescribing to share with a local non-profit last year, but – shocker – they weren’t really interested at the end of the day. Still, it’s important information, and hopefully I will be able to a walk through it one day soon. In the meantime if you want to check it out, it includes useful links that provide context for today’s talk.</p>

<p>Bonus! This is a video where I read-aloud (with some commentary) two posts from early 2019 on “collective impact” and the United Way’s ALICE (Assets Limited Income Constrained Employed) program in the context of the Shanzhai City’s Honk Kong Blockchain Time Bank initiative and Idaho Libertarian plans for privatized (tokenized) welfare.

This release updates the Komodo notaries to season 6 and you must update to reliably stay synchronized to the Verus mainnet (activation height of block 2,291,830).</p><p>v0.9.5 introduces 2 new APIs and CLI commands, signdata and verifysignature, that encompass all of the capabilities of previous signing and verification APIs and add new capabilities for advanced signatures and verification — a more powerful and flexible framework for NFTs and ID-bound legal rights and agreements.</p><p>In addition to digital signing of documents or information using an ID, the new APIs enable easily binding together multiple sources of content, documents, identities, and VDXF keys together into one verifiable signature and then being able to verify that signature, including all of its specific bindings.</p><p>🔗 <a href="https://verus.io/wallet/desktop">Download Verus Desktop&nbsp;v0.9.5</a></p> Verus PBaaS &amp; DeFi&nbsp;Updates <p>In anticipation of the Verus PBaaS mainnet upgrade — delivering no-programming needed blockchain and currency launches, MEV-free DeFi, non-custodial Ethereum bridging and so much more — community developers introduce a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>The protocol improvement makes the following adjustments:</p>  Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later&nbsp;blocks.  The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the&nbsp;case.  Import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.  <p>These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as&nbsp;well.</p> Bug Bounties&nbsp;💰 <p>While we don’t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended.</p><p>If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000&nbsp;VRSC.</p><p>🗒️ <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.5-2">See PBaaS-Testnet Release&nbsp;Notes</a></p><p>🛎️ <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Join Discord and report&nbsp;bounties</a></p> Introducing VerusID to Verus&nbsp;Mobile <p>This version of Verus Mobile takes a major leap forward, enabling support for VerusID, including sending and receiving funds and use of your VerusID as a password-free, secure and self-sovereign web or mobile app sign-in, made possible with the VerusID authentication protocol.</p><p>Verus Mobile v0.3.0–24 supports the version 1.0 of the VerusID authentication protocol, which prepares for the PBaaS upgrade and supports application provisioning of IDs, an important way applications can onboard users, give them a verified self-sovereign ID and funds address, enable sending and receiving payments, and make applications more secure by design with an easy, password-free sign-in.</p><p>In addition to its new support for VerusID and the Verus Authentication Protocol, this version of Verus Mobile continues to include Wyre as a fiat on-ramp and maintains support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and a variety of popular coins and&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>If you are an app developer who wants to benefit from and help pioneer a better, more user-centric, inherently commerce-enabled, verifiable application model for a true Internet of Value, this is the release that enables you!

<p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-competitors-advantages-and-disadvantages/">Ethereum</a> is at the forefront of the crypto charge, and Ethereum account abstraction might be a key aspect of bringing it to the masses. But what is it precisely, and what makes it necessary?</p><p>Many see the network as the future of blockchain finance, as it holds several advantages over Bitcoin. It is the first blockchain to support smart contracts and the largest (volume-wise) after<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/are-bitcoin-transactions-traceable-coin-security-privacy/"> Bitcoin</a>. </p><p>But as beautiful as the future of Ethereum and crypto may look, mass adoption remains a genuine concern. </p><p>While crypto enthusiasts may not need help creating and preserving the security of their self-custodial Ethereum wallets, the user experience for newly onboarded users could be better. This is especially true when setting up a <a href="https://appinventiv.com/blog/custodial-vs-non-custodial-wallets/">non-custodial wallet</a>. The process of generating and safely storing seed phrases remains quite complicated and, if a user loses access to her seed phrase, they might as well forget about whatever coins their wallets hold because the funds will be beyond their reach. Surely, onboarding a billion users under such circumstances will remain to be seen as challenging.</p><p>To improve the existing technology and lower the barriers of entry for new users, developers at the<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/"> Ethereum Foundation</a> began to propose the concept of Ethereum account abstraction. In this article, we'll look at what Ethereum account abstraction is, how it works, and most importantly, how it will benefit users.</p> How do Ethereum accounts work? <p>To use the Ethereum network, you must create an Ethereum account. A typical Ethereum account has a public address and a private key. You should not confuse Ethereum accounts for Ethereum wallets, as the latter is only an interface that helps you interact with tokens on the blockchain.</p><p>An Ethereum account consists of four key components: nonce, balance, codeHash, and storageRoot.</p>  The<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-series-understanding-nonce-3858194b39bf"> nonce</a> is a counter that tracks the number of transactions an account sends or contracts an account creates, depending on the account type.<br>  The balance is the amount of<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/wei"> wei</a> owned by an account. Wei is a denomination of ether, Ethereum's native currency.<br>  The codeHash of an Ethereum account is the code tied to that account on the<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"> Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>, a virtual computer built on the Ethereum blockchain. Since only contract accounts (explained below) are tied in code to the<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/"> EVM</a>, in accounts without code (also known as externally owned accounts or EOA), the codeHash is an empty string.<br>  The storageRoot of an Ethereum account is the hash that encodes the account's storage content. Also known as the storage hash, it is a<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-are-hash-functions-in-crypto-a-laymans-guide/"> 256-bit hash</a> of a Merkle Patricia trie's root node. A<a href="https://medium.com/@chiqing/merkle-patricia-trie-explained-ae3ac6a7e123"> Patricia Merkle Trie</a> is one of the key data structures for Ethereum’s storage layer and provides a cryptographically authenticated data structure that can be used to store all (key, value) bindings.  <p>Essentially, Ethereum accounts are of two types: externally owned accounts (EOA) and contract accounts (CA).</p><p>Let’s have a look at both types of accounts and what differentiates them. <br></p>Ethereum account types – EOA &amp; CA. (<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-are-ethereum-accounts/">Source</a>) Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) <p>A 'regular' Ethereum account with which you can initiate transactions, send, and receive ETH or any other Ethereum-based token (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc), and interact with smart contracts is an externally owned account (EOA). The average Ethereum user owns an EOA, and through wallets, the account interacts with the blockchain.</p><p><a href="https://docs.gnosis-safe.io/introduction/the-programmable-account/eoas-vs.-contract-accounts">Externally owned Ethereum accounts</a> cost nothing to create, as they incur no storage requirements. They are simple accounts unassociated with data storage or code. EOAs are the only Ethereum account type with private keys, and these private keys have control over transaction signing. Also, when two EOAs interact, they can only initiate ETH or token transfers. </p><p>In summary, an externally owned Ethereum account has a public address and a private key, can initiate transactions and interact with smart contracts, requires no storage, and is represented on the EVM with an empty code string.</p> Contract Accounts (CA) <p>Contract accounts are a tad different from EOAs, as a code written on the EVM controls their activities. They are also commonly known as smart contracts. This code, once written, cannot be altered and will define the nature of transactions the contract account can complete. CAs do not initiate transactions, unlike their EOA counterparts. Instead, they can only send transactions in response to a transaction received.</p><p>For example, if you send a token to a contract account to exchange said for ETH tokens, the CA receives your transaction and, through its code, sends the corresponding amount of ETH to your address. Apart from being able to transfer tokens, contract accounts can also create new contracts. </p><p>Since CAs are controlled by their code's logic, they do not have private keys. Also, contract accounts use network storage. As such, creating them comes at a<a href="https://medium.com/the-capital/how-much-does-it-cost-to-deploy-a-smart-contract-on-ethereum-11bcd64da1"> cost</a>. The nonce of a contract account counts the number of contracts every specific CA has created.</p> What is Ethereum account abstraction? <p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/data-abstraction">Data abstraction</a> in computer science translates to hiding information to increase efficiency. For example, a software developer can learn how to write a compiler or understand the mechanisms between the compiler, processors, or memory functions when building with high-level programming languages. Data abstraction keeps the 0s and 1s underneath, allowing developers to work directly with more friendly languages, saving time and allowing for more complex operations.</p><p>In the case of Ethereum, account abstraction seeks to eliminate the existence of two types of accounts by unifying them. Thus, a single contract account will be empowered to transact with tokens and create contracts, unifying both account types. Instead of being separate account types, both EOAs and CAs will fall under a single type.</p><p>With this change, transactions will move off the<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchains/"> blockchain</a> and onto the EVM, eliminating the distinction between accounts. Let’s look into what exactly motivates this idea, whether it is truly achievable, and what are its benefits.</p> Motivations for account abstraction <p>Earlier, we pointed out the problems with the existing technology of Ethereum accounts and how a lack of flexibility translates to a poor user experience. With the complexities involved in the current account model, the developers are severely limited in offering a better user experience.</p><p>The core motivation for account abstraction stems from the goal of reducing from two account types to only one account type i.e., contract type. A single account type for all the Ethereum accounts will enable developers to provide a seamless experience to users on a single account with the functionality to transact tokens as well as create new contracts. It will also make it easier for developers to create better protocols and services without the need to make distinctions between account types since transacting will be moved fully into the EVM and off of the blockchain protocol.</p><p>Another motivation for account abstraction is to offer a rich user experience such as <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-multisig-wallet">multi-signature</a> security, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">social recovery</a>, rate-limiting, creating allow/deny-list of addresses, and <a href="https://easyfinetwork.medium.com/meta-transactions-what-are-gasless-transactions-ee71b88d7fad">gasless meta-transactions</a>. Currently, only contract accounts (<a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/what-are-smart-contract-wallets-and-how-can-they-benefit-defi-users/">smart contract wallets</a>) are capable of offering these features, however, the UX offered by these accounts is hindered by relying on fluctuating gas prices. Additionally, since contract accounts cannot pay gas, the user needs an EOA to pay gas fees or leverage a relayer (usually centralized entities).</p><p>Account abstraction can offer the best of both worlds and drastically improve the user experience by taking steps toward a model where in the long term all accounts are contracts, contracts can pay for gas, and users are free to define their own security model.</p><p>To effect these numerous changes and pave the way for more implementations, better flexibility, and an upgrade in the Ethereum user experience, developers have created several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) on account abstraction, spearheaded by<a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1576199517434949634"> Vitalik Buterin</a>, co-founder of Ethereum.</p> Proposed EIPs for account abstraction <p>EIP stands for Ethereum Improvement Proposal, which are the core methods through which updates and decisions are made on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are several EIPs that were proposed to tackle the issues of account abstraction.</p> EIP-86 (Status: inactive) <p>EIP-86 can be said to be the first EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) aimed at account abstraction. After an initial proposal to prepare a security abstraction, the<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-86.md"> EIP-86</a> proposed implementing changes that would abstract out signature verification and the nonce scheme. These changes would allow users to create contract accounts that are not hard-coded to follow the traditional model but could be programmed to use any signature or nonce scheme in transaction processing.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">ECDSA</a> and the default nonce scheme were the only mechanisms providing account security in the traditional model. In the proposed model, all accounts would become contracts, contracts would be able to pay gas fees, and users could tweak the account security and implement their desired signature/nonce scheme.</p> EIP-2938 (Status: inactive) <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2938">EIP-2938</a> offers a restricted version of account abstraction. The proposal sought to allow smart contracts to function as EOAs, allowing them to initiate transactions and pay for gas. In EIP-2938, developers propose introducing a new type of transaction and two new<a href="https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes"> opcodes</a>, aiming to keep implementation simple and allow more complex features over time.</p><p>The account abstraction transaction type would contain three fields – nonce, target, and data – where data represents all parameters that the account abstraction contract must execute and the transaction must validate. In contrast, the target represents the smart contract with the logic to validate transactions.</p><p>EIP-2938 is a simple proposal. As such, it does not support several features of account abstraction like nonce abstractions and meta transactions and does not remove EOAs.</p> EIP-3074 (Status: in review stage) <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074">EIP-3074</a> takes another path, distinct from its predecessors attempted. Instead of converting smart contracts to EOAs, EIP-3074 tries to adapt EOAs, adding a few changes here and there to make them behave like smart contracts. </p><p>The proposal seeks to allow users to hand over control of their 'regular' accounts to a contract by signing a message with their account. With the signed message and two new opcodes, an invoker (the smart target contract) could initiate transactions in the EOAs instead.</p><p>EIP-3074 focuses on enabling transaction sponsoring and multicall execution and allowing users with EOA accounts to enjoy the benefits of account abstraction without creating new accounts or transferring their assets. The proposal could achieve flexibility, albeit it does not eliminate security concerns. Notably, users under EIP-3074 still have to back up their seed phrase.</p> EIP-4337 (Status: likely to be changed before activation) <p>The most recent proposal,<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337"> EIP-4337</a>, looks to improve smart contract wallets. In a drastic departure from the usual approach, EIP-4337 simplifies the creation and operation of smart contract wallets on Ethereum by sharing the load across the required on-chain and off-chain infrastructure.<br></p>Achieving account abstraction through EIP-4337. (<a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/account_abstraction_roadmap">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p>EIP-4337 eliminates the need for sending transactions, with users required to send a set of UserOperations instead. Bundlers then pack the UserOperations into a single transaction and send it to the EntryPoint contract, executing the transaction and compensating the bundlers duly. EIP-4337 eliminates the worry of subsidizing gas fees, but it fails to end the era of EOAs on Ethereum.</p> Use Cases <p>Ethereum account abstraction, when achieved, will drive several implementations and user experience changes and allow developers the freedom to build or operate accounts on their terms.</p><p>Account abstraction will also enable developers to use smart contract logic to determine not just the effects of transactions, but also the fee payment and validation logic. Hence it could allow several crucial security benefits such as multi-sig and smart recovery wallets, the ability to change keys without changing wallets, and quantum safety.</p><p>Here are some use cases which account abstraction will help bring to reality:</p>  Wallets: With account abstraction, users will be able to benefit from advanced security features such as multi-sig, and smart recovery as well as leverage the ability to change keys without changing wallets.  Sponsored transactions: Account abstraction will allow entities or their subsidiaries to transact in several ways, like paying fees on users' behalf and allowing users to pay gas fees in ERC-20 tokens, which will be converted and relayed to the blockchain as ETH.  Meta-transactions: With account abstraction, users can accept meta-transactions (gasless) and pay for gas without trusting a relayer.   So: Is Ethereum account abstraction the next massive change for the network? <p>While Ethereum account abstraction is not yet a reality, it has become a hot discussion topic since the success of the Merge. Over the years, Ethereum's developers have pushed back account abstraction, favoring urgent blockchain upgrades. </p><p>Now, it is only reasonable that Ethereum accounts become easier to use and understand and more welcoming to onboard the less tech-savvy.

<p>Today we release v1.1.0 of the Nym platform and wallet with new features and an upgraded version of NymConnect.</p><p>Earlier this week we wrote about the Nym mixnet smart contract getting a make-over.</p><p>Some of the improvements in the new contract&nbsp;are:</p>  lower gas&nbsp;fees  automated compounding for&nbsp;rewards  allowing operators to set their monthly operating cost of running&nbsp;node  allowing operators to adjust their node settings without unbonding  and speedier contract queries in&nbsp;general.  <p>The contract migration is now complete and it was a success! You can read about all the contract changes <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-contract-upgrade-128c84f293fd">here</a>. And now it is time to update all the binaries for Nym apps and services.</p><p>In this post we will go through the changes and new features in Nym&nbsp;v1.1.0.</p><p>NOTE: the unbond function has changed significantly. That means you should only unbond your mix node if you want to leave the mixnet permanently. When you unbond you will lose all your delegations. You can join the network again with the same identity key, but you will start fresh with no delegations.</p> <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym platform&nbsp;v1.1.0:</a> <p>The new contract upgrade means the contract address and directory has changed, so all Nym components and clients need to be upgraded to v1.1.0 in order to&nbsp;work.</p><p>To upgrade, you can <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">download</a> and install the pre-built binaries or build the binaries yourself for your preferred operating system by cloning the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym">Nym repo</a> and following instructions on the&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">docs</a>.</p><p>Please check the <a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#v110-2022-11-09">change log</a>, for a complete list of all fixes and improvements in this&nbsp;release.</p><p>NOTE: to upgrade your mixnode or update its settings (IP, version, etc), DO NOT unbond/rebond your node. Node settings can be adjusted without unbonding.</p><p>To upgrade your mix&nbsp;node:</p><p>- copy your existing keys for&nbsp;safety</p><p>- download and run the new&nbsp;binary</p><p>- stop and then restart your mix&nbsp;node</p><p>- update the config file with the new version&nbsp;1.1.0</p><p>- upgrade the wallet, go to the Node Settings and change the version number to&nbsp;1.1.0</p> <a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">Nym Wallet&nbsp;v1.1.0:</a> <p>The Nym wallet has also been updated — please make sure to install wallet v1.1.0 as the older versions will not work with the new contract. Download the latest version of the wallet&nbsp;<a href="https://nymtech.net/download/">here</a>.</p><p>Here are some of the new features and usability improvements:</p>  Operators can now change/update parameters of their node (IP, version, profit margin, etc) without the need to&nbsp;unbond  Users with delegations to nodes that have unbonded, will see those delegations grouped on top of the list and highlighted in red to undelegate stake&nbsp;from.  Guide to help new users delegate stake if they have not delegated to any mixnodes&nbsp;before.  New screen to view your bonded&nbsp;mixnode  New screen for Node Settings, including information about when the next epoch and interval will&nbsp;start  Operators can now set their monthly operating cost when bonding, and can update it in the Node&nbsp;Settings  Displaying pending&nbsp;unbonds  Displaying routing score and average score for&nbsp;gateways  Improved account creation&nbsp;dialogs  New Delegation screen, highlighting unbonded&nbsp;nodesNew bonded node&nbsp;screenNew Node Settings&nbsp;screen <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/nym-connect">NymConnect v1.1.0:</a> <p>NymConnect is an easy to use desktop application that allows you to privacy-enhance other apps by connecting them to the Nym mixnet and sending their data through it. If you have never used NymConnect before you can read more about it <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/configuring-nymconnect-with-telegram-9ca6425d95b6">here</a> and download the latest version of it&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/releases/tag/nym-connect-v1.1.0">here</a>.</p><p>In this version we have fixed a few bugs including an issue that would cause the client to shut down unexpectedly. The changes should increase reliability, including graceful disconnecting from services.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-platform-wallet-and-nymconnect-v1-1-0-f5cbda822d56">Nym Platform, Wallet and NymConnect v1.1.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    <p>TestZEN or tZEN is a testnet version of ZEN to be used for testing various products and services on Horizen, such as deploying a testnet sidechain, launching a token or NFT on TokenMint testnet, etc. tZEN is free and has unlimited supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can visit the Horizen tZEN faucet ( <a href="https://faucet.horizen.io/">https://faucet.horizen.io/</a> ) to get tZEN sent to either Sphere wallet or Cobalt wallet. You will receive 42 tZEN each time and there is no limit to how many times you can claim tZEN. The tZEN faucet is currently on MVP stage. New release coming soon with improved user experience and interface.</p>
 Mainchain Faucet – Send tZEN to Sphere Wallet 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Sphere Address in order to receive TestZEN to Sphere Testnet Wallet.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
 Sidechain Faucet – Send tZEN to Cobalt Wallet&nbsp; 
<p>This is where you enter your testnet Cobalt Address to receive TestZEN direct to Cobalt!</p>
<p>You will also need the sidechain ID of the sidechain network that you will use the tZEN in. The sidechain ID can be found by clicking on Cobalt, clicking the hexagonal shape in the upper right corner and it will be displayed on the bottom. We are using TokenMint testnet as an example here:&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you click on GET TZEN, you will see a “Transaction successfully created! Your funds will arrive shortly.” You can track the transaction on the sidechain block explorer and activity history in Cobalt.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You will receive a fixed amount of 42 tZEN each transaction. </p>

 PHASE 1&nbsp;Update  Game of&nbsp;Chains✨ <p>Dear Cosmonauts,<br>Phase 1 of Game of Chains is officially COMPLETE!</p><p>Read on for an update on how it&nbsp;went:</p><p>Game of Chains will be running for the rest of the month of November. In our first week of running the public incentivized testnet, we experienced some delays with launching consumer chains, however those bugs have been fixed! Validators, read on for more information on when to expect those governance proposals during Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p> HIGHLIGHTS 🎉 <p>We started Game of Chains on November 7th by launching two “dummy” consumer chains — Apollo and Sputnik. While we had over 150+ validators sign up, we currently have about 90 validators in the active set. You can check out the group of validators <a href="https://provider-explorer.goc.earthball.xyz/validators">here</a>.</p><p>We’ve also launched a public <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> that anyone can follow to see which validators are in contention for WINNING Game of Chains! This <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">leaderboard</a> is a running tally and we will try to update it on a regular basis as tasks are submitted and evidence is confirmed. You can check out how the judges will be evaluating validator participation <a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022">here</a>.</p> Bugs, bugs, bugs!&nbsp;🐜🐜🐜 <p>During the testnet a bug was discovered in Gaia (Cosmos Hub) with ICS v0.2.0. The result of the bug was that multiple consumer chains were unable to start. This bug was fixed, and validators were able to successfully upgrade the network to the version of ICS v0.2.1 on Friday November 11 (morning EST), following which validators successfully launched two consumer&nbsp;chains!</p><p>Additionally, relayer operators found that validator set updates were not being propagated. This was investigated by Hermes and Interchain Security teams (thank you to the Informal Systems team!) and a patch for Hermes is now available</p> Memes, memes, memes!&nbsp;😂 <p>We have testnet awards for the best memes generated by the community and we’ve already seen some great memes by Stakecito and Jabbey in Discord and on Twitter! Stakecito contemplates what <a href="https://twitter.com/stakecito/status/1590029735421444097">sabotage</a> might look like in Game of Chains and Chainapsis asks us to let that <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_ck89/status/1590634392141332481?s=46&amp;t=PmmoBj2Wb4A2zDs8RB5JnQ">sink&nbsp;in</a>!</p> Public Goods&nbsp;💗 <p>Thank you to all the validators that are supporting this testnet through block explorers, RPC end points and more. Some highlights of the public goods that we’ve seen so far&nbsp;include:</p>  Polkachu offering a variety of community <a href="https://polkachu.com/testnets/cosmos">tools and&nbsp;services</a>  PingPub added the ConsumerAdditionProposal to their dashboard and also offered RPC endpoints including <a href="https://provider-rpc.ztake.org/">this</a> one for the provider chain (Cosmos&nbsp;Hub)!  Thank you to Chainapsis for supporting Game of Chains through the <a href="https://testnet.keplr.app/chains/goc---provider">Keplr</a>&nbsp;wallet!   Auditing 🔐 <p>CrowdControl, Virtual Hive, and CryptoCrew have been investigating an issue where validator set updates seem to be inconsistent between provider and consumer chains. Plus, CryptoCrew published their script for auditing the validator set changes between consumer and provider sets (check it out&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/clemensgg/579983404afd4e906a4419fe4e81d100">here</a>).</p> Next Steps&nbsp;👇👇👇 <p>Over the next week, we will continue running Game of Chains, this time with consumer chains that are planning to launch in production once Interchain Security goes live! This includes the Generic Asset Issuance Chain (or GAH for short). This chain will host USDC when deployed, and hopefully other blue-chip assets in the future. We will also be running Duality, a novel DEX/AMM coming to Cosmos. You can read more about them&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dualityxyz/status/1590333430104932352">here</a>.</p><p>Following these proposals, validators will run Stride and Neutron — two additional consumer chains coming to&nbsp;Cosmos!</p><p>Last, but not least, thank you to the entire validators for your incredible support throughout Game of Chains. Interchain Security would not be what it is without the dedication of the Cosmos validator community. Cheers to you and stay tuned for updates on the next phase of Game of&nbsp;Chains!</p><p>About the Author:<br>Jelena Djuric works at <a href="https://informal.systems/about">Informal Systems</a> as product Marketing Manager. <br>Jelena is on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Gnomeskiiihttps://twitter.com/jelenaaa____">Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/phase-1-update-game-of-chains-85a40bc27572">PHASE 1 Update — Game of Chains✨</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This is obvious on the individual level – how you order goods, the way you chat with friends, and the news you consume… all from a handheld computer. It’s also becoming more obvious at the company level. The pandemic shook the world into remote work and many companies have decided that maybe work can be done in ways they never imagined. But what about the state – whatever that means? Could the network rival the state?&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode we’ll explore what a nation state even is and how it may be challenged by a new Leviathan: the network. We also cover the difference between a nation and a state, how constants become variables, the cloud continent, digital power, your identity stack, calibrating risk, polycentric law, cloud regulations, building fast with atoms, founding vs inheriting, the powerful vs the powerless, and just about everything in between.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Balaji’s Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">https://twitter.com/balajis</a></p><p>Balaji’s website: <a href="https://balajis.com/">https://balajis.com/</a></p><p>The Network State: <a href="https://thenetworkstate.com/">https://thenetworkstate.com/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

 Using cryptocurrency in the real world can be complicated today. Off-ramping crypto usually requires users to transfer on-chain assets from their wallet into a centralized exchange (or first complete swaps on a decentralized exchange), where they can sell their crypto for fiat cash, then finally transfer funds to their bank account.

Off-ramping crypto usually requires users to transfer on-chain assets from their wallet into a centralized exchange (or first complete swaps on a decentralized exchange), where they can sell their crypto for fiat cash, then finally transfer funds to their bank account. The process can be costly and time consuming, as users often have to pay fees for each transaction they make with their crypto on-chain. If they have to swap their tokens multiple times, the process can become even more costly by triggering multiple taxable events.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Nym mixnet smart contract is having a significant make-over. Most of this will not be very visible on the surface of things, but are essential improvements to the system in the long run. The most noticeable change will be that compounding will happen automatically and gas costs will be reduced due to a new, lighter data structure.</p><p>The contract upgrade and migration will happen early next week. There will be a platform release v1.1.0 immediately after (more details and release note on that soon). If you are running any of the Nym infrastructure (mix node, gateway, network requester, etc.) you will have to update your binaries so that they can keep working with the new contract.</p><p>NOTE: from this release, if you unbond your mixnode that means you are leaving the mixnet and you will lose all your delegations (permanently). You can join again with the same identity key, however, you will start with no delegations.</p><p>This blogpost gives a first overview of the reasons why a new contract is needed and the improvements you can expect from&nbsp;it.</p> Why a new contract? <p>There are three major reasons why the mixnet contract needs to be upgraded:</p>  The mixnet contract was storing too much contract state data. This meant that queries about rewards (from a wallet for example) required large amounts of gas, validators needed a custom configuration to support large queries, and eventually no one would be able to query for rewards because the whole thing would simply be too heavy. As a result, any query would always return 0 for rewards and rewards would not be visible until you unbonded (or undelegated). The new contract fixes&nbsp;this.  The mixnet directory data structure of the mixnet needed a clean up. The new directory structure will allow mix nodes to change their settings or even upgrade their nodes without the need to unbond. NOTE this also means that when mix nodes DO unbond, they leave the mixnet and therefore they will lose all their delegations. They can rejoin, but will have to attract new delegations.  Compounding was costing unnecessary gas fees. Whenever anyone compounded their rewards, this would cost gas. In the new version, compounding will happen automatically and without fees. Redeeming rewards will still incur&nbsp;fees.   What can I expect in the new contract? <p>The first thing to note is that there will be a new mainnet address for the contract, and the data structure will change. More details on this in the coming&nbsp;days.</p><p>For delegators:</p>  Compounding will be automatic — you no longer have to keep track of it or click on the compound button for compounding rewards.  <p>For mixnode operators:</p>  Mixnode operators will be able to set their operating costs.  Profit margin can be more granular.  Operators can update their configurations without unbonding. What this also means is that if you unbond your mixnode that means you are leaving the mixnet and you will lose all your delegations (permanently).  Change in saturation level to 730k per node, which means that more stake will be needed to reach full saturation.   Why is mixnode stake saturation changing? <p>The staking supply of NYM has increased due to quarterly vesting. Therefore there are more NYM tokens that can be staked, including all vested tokens and 10% of unvested tokens. Stake saturation depends on the available staking supply, the target level of staking, and the number of rewarded nodes. After the next vest the available staking supply will be around 350 million NYM. With 240 rewarded nodes and a target of 50% of available tokens staked this leads to a saturation stake of around 730k NYM (computed as 0.5*350m/240).</p><p>The contract update will also clean up legacy effects of a bug that was fixed a while back, which made some nodes appear to have more delegated stake than they actually had. As result of the update the displayed delegated stake will be correct for all nodes. As a result, some nodes may see slightly lower delegated amounts if they were previously displaying an incorrect delegation amount.</p><p>Stay tuned for further updates and the exact timing of the contract migration.</p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan_help_chat">Nym node setup help&nbsp;chat</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/blob/develop/contracts/mixnet/v2-changes.md">Change log</a></p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-mixnet-contract-upgrade-128c84f293fd">Nym mixnet contract upgrade</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 In September 2022, the first ZenCon, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event. If you follow Horizen news, you've heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem. After five years, […]

    <p>In September 2022, the first <a href="https://zencon.events/">ZenCon</a>, the conference dedicated to the Horizen ecosystem, took place. It was the first opportunity to gather the whole team and the community around the same event.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/community-NA_V1700-Copie.jpg"></a><br>If you follow Horizen news, you’ve heard about Zencon0, the first event organized by Horizen Labs for the Horizen ecosystem.</p>
<p>After five years, it was time to celebrate Horizen’s accomplishments surrounded by those who were there to help lay the foundations of the project and all those who, along the way, came to bring their strength to take Horizen’s ecosystem even further.</p>
<p>At this level of expansion, it was essential to exchange thoughts. Horizen’s growth was made in the image of its decentralized blockchain. The team and community members are spread across all continents. To me, that’s what makes the project so strong. It’s a machine that never sleeps, designed with the help of a multitude of different cultures and interests. A successful scalability challenge!</p>
<p>Since its inception, the goal has evolved to reflect the community as it grows and changes.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: In essence, it provides privacy through zk-SNARKs, and for all, it’s bringing privacy to life. This is an important issue for everyone who goes online and is careful with their digital footprint.</p>
<p>Another facet of Horizen is decentralization. The project started its Secure Nodes and Super Nodes system in 2018, which has since been in the top 3 most extensive networks, surpassing Ethereum and Bitcoin combined: It is unbounded by design.</p>
<p>Since then, Horizen has become the zero-knowledge-enabled network of blockchains, thanks to its impressive team of cryptographers.</p>
<p>That’s Horizen: A project that has brought together enough passion and talent to evolve continually.</p>
<p>This story was told at Zencon0, through panels, presentations, brainstorming sessions, and aperitivos. It was an absolute pleasure and hype machine to work together, or simply to gather with blockchain and technology experts and enthusiasts at the center of all discussions for three days in a row.</p>
<p>Among the guests, I would like to highlight four Zenvangelists who were present. Michael, Guan, Jonghung, Jongchan, and Psyrax are more than Zenvangelists; they are OGs. Without them, the Horizen community would be very different. It was truly fantastic to meet all of them.</p>
 Interviewing Horizen’s Zenvangelists 
 Michael 
<p>We’ll start with the one from Australia, Telegram, Korea, and/or Discord, our dear Michael. If you’ve interacted with the Horizen community, you’ve probably come across him. He is now a Zenvangelist that cannot be ignored!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG20220913215558-Copie.jpg"></a>Our dear Michael, who had the chance to pose with Rob Viglione
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience meeting the teams behind Horizen and Horizen Labs. Being able to see firsthand how the companies and teams operate from such a professional standpoint really gave me a lot of confidence in the future success of Horizen. I have walked away inspired and with a lot of ideas to build something great on Horizen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting everyone in real life! I felt like I knew so many people, even though we had only previously connected online. Being able to meet in person was really special.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will definitely be there!</p>

 Guan 
<p>Without Guan, the Horizen community in China would not be the same. It feels like Guan was there when Horizen was founded. So much so that he has become essential. It was great to meet him finally to talk about Horizen, and his cats face to face.</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the zencon0 is good because everyone in Horizen’s ecosystem can meet each other in person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite part was I visited the Horizen Labs’ workplace. I witnessed the huge team expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s an amazing event, and I will be there next year!</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V2550.jpg"></a>The Horizen Labs office is superb! We enjoyed the rooftop and took this amazing picture.
 Psyrax 
<p>Psyrax also joined us. If you have needed support from Horizen, I am sure Psyrax assisted you. He is our node, mining – well – global Horizen expert. Psyrax also protects our Discord and Telegram communities by protecting them from scammers and bots!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed Zencon0. It was a really amazing experience to hear about what has been going on behind the scenes and listening to a great cross-section of society that can use the ecosystem. I really liked Sebastien Micke’s perspective and use case for NFTs and photographers retaining their digital rights to their productions.</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can’t say that I had a favorite moment, as the whole experience was great, but if I had to choose, I would say that networking across the conference with the new people that I met and being able to put faces to names I have only known through the computer.</p>
<p>Q: If we do Zencon next year, will you be there?</p>
<p>I will definitely be keen to attend next year. If the team announced dates and locations, I would book our flights in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>Last but not least is Jonghun, our Korean OG. He was a long-time community member and has done a fantastic job promoting Horizen in his country. Thanks to him, our Korean community is bustling and passionate about the project!</p>
<p>Q: What did you think about Zencon0?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was such an honor for me to be able to attend this gathering of people interested in Horizen from all over the world. Also, I was excited to be able to announce the start of Horizen Korea in Korea for the first time at Zencon0. It was very beneficial because it was a place where people from various fields could share their thoughts on blockchain and Horizen. It was an opportunity for me to broaden my insight personally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: What was your favorite moment?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked all the moments when I could see everyone in one space regardless of time zone. We communicated, but there were some delay issues due to the time zone, but the moment we communicated with everyone in one place was memorable. The discussion about Horizen Community is also very memorable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: If we do a Zencon next year, will you be there?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
 Community Spotlights at ZenCon 
<p>The community was in the spotlight throughout the conference, with three slots dedicated to the community. We even had the honor of sharing a panel with Lou Kerner to talk about the Horizen community’s presence in Asia, thanks largely to Guan and Jonghun, whom we introduced earlier.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1618.jpg"></a>Lou Kerner, Lucy Wang, Guan Yin, and Jonghun and Jongchan Hong talking during the panel.
<p>Even our Marketing team OGs went on stage. Thank you, Lucy and Erica, for shining a light on this beautiful Horizen community.</p>
<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NA_V1480.jpg"></a>As you see, we were delighted to share the news!
<p>To conclude, I would say that the Horizen community is terrific. Everything started in 2017 as a cryptocurrency. Five years later, Horizen is an entire blockchain ecosystem, soon to have an EVM-compatible sidechain. Meanwhile, these steps would have been for nothing if we hadn’t done them with the community. Together, we are building the future of blockchain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was a time, not so long ago, when someone would have looked perplexed if you’d asked about their digital identity. Many still would today, perhaps but in the tumultuous world of today, digital identity is one of the hottest trends in technology, particularly across decentralised ledgers, or blockchains.</p>



 The 7 benefits of using digital identities 



<p>In short, below are 7 benefits of using digital identities: <br><br>• Mobile-first solution<br>• Establishment of a framework of trust<br>• Smart city access<br>• Digital economy<br>• Financial and social inclusivity<br>• Enhanced portability<br>• Better understanding of the individual</p>



<p>Each of these benefits will be explained more in-depth below. But before we delve into the actual benefits of implementing and using digital identity frameworks in both the public and private domains, let’s first take a look at the definition of a digital identity.</p>



 What is a digital identity? 



<p>In essence, a digital identity is the accumulation of information on an entity held online&nbsp;by third parties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you are interacting with a website or application you are always leaving information behind. Broadly speaking, all the data and information involved in someone’s digital identity can be divided into two categories: Digital attributes and digital activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital attributes include someone’s date of birth, official documentation (passports, driver license, etc.) serial numbers or other identifiers, a person’s medical records, banking details, etc. The second category -digital activities-, includes a person’s posts on social media, for example, purchase history, ‘Likes’ and comments, etc. The combination of these two categories constitutes someone’s digital identity.</p>



 The 7 benefits of using digital identities explained 



 Mobile-first solution 



<p>A primitive (but working) handheld mobile phone was unveiled by the now defunct American company Motorola back in 1973. It was a rather bulky and ungainly device that would take around 10 hours to fully charge. Nevertheless, the Motorola device heralded an inevitable shift towards mobile technology that continues today. (Current projections say that, by 2024, there will be around 17.7 billion mobile devices operating in the world.)</p>



<p>Society is going mobile, and as such, today’s society seeks more and more mobile-first solutions.</p>



<p>Digital identity enables this approach by using a digital wallet that enables users to take their credentials anywhere they go, and share them at any time, with whomever they want, and get authenticated by any entity, private or public, to easily access services.</p>



 Establishment of a framework of trust 



<p>Currently, identity networks and authentication methods are heavily fragmented. Every organisation, every agency, every institution has its own set of rules and guidelines that determine how people receive their credentials, and how they authenticate in their network. Because of this individualised disparity, a set of credentials accepted by one organisation might not necessarily be accepted by another. This issue is exacerbated when dealing with organisations from different countries. (Driving licenses and educational credentials perfectly illustrate this problem).</p>



<p>Establishing a trust framework between all participating organisations means that someone’s credentials can be instantly verified, regardless of geographical location or cross-border limitations.</p>



 Smart city access 



<p>Current urban enclaves, while modern and relatively safe, are far from smart. There still are many deficiencies and areas of improvement in terms of traffic and waste management, infrastructure, wireless access, etc. The Internet of Things (IoT) will enable several technological advancements that will improve these aspects, but it is a very different story for the individual.</p>



<p>As of today, 54% of the world’s population lives in cities, and the current projection is that this figure will reach 66% in about three decades. Because of this likely rise in urban dwellings, enhanced services and a positive and rewarding citizen experience are key factors for the success of smart cities. Citizens currently engage with urban’s infrastructures in different ways. Paying for parking or at the shop’s till with a smartphone, for example. Or using electronic tickets to speed up access to trains, buses, or other methods of transportation. But each of these services requires its own identification method. Together with an entire network and technical backend to manage access, permissions, and upkeep.</p>



<p>A truly smart city begins with digital identity to drive engagement and efficiency. Individuals need to engage with government, public and private bodies, and other agencies digitally and expeditiously, so the experience is seamless and positive. This will lead to further engagement.</p>



 Digital economy 



<p>Digital identity truly is at the heart of a paradigm shift in digital engagement. Too much friction in the interaction with governments and service providers holds people back from engaging further, which in turn leads to economic stagnation. In the world of today, people expect fast and immediate digital service, whether it’s from their internet provider or the WiFi service at the airport.</p>



<p>The digital economy is the background for the digital identity scene. Digital identification drives inclusive growth, particularly when considering that around 1.7 billion people worldwide are financially excluded. This is because of lack of provable identity. If all those people were to own digital identities, a great economic value would be unlocked.</p>



 Financial and social inclusivity 



<p>Banks and other financial institutions would not risk lending to those people who could not effectively prove who they are. If credit or finance is denied, the individual might not be able to access proper education, or housing, or services. Progressively, someone would be left further and further behind. They would be excluded.</p>



<p>The provision of identity is the gateway for both financial and social inclusivity. Digital identity enables frictionless interactions with public and private institutions, including banks, of course. By enabling someone to have equal chances to access financial devices, people become included in society or education.</p>



 Enhanced portability 



<p>Traditional means of identification (driver licenses, passports, ID cards, etc.) are portable in the sense that people can carry them around. But some of these forms of ID might not be officially recognised in different countries, or even in different states within the same country. Academic credentials have the same issue. And in both cases, the individual depends on third parties to amend, share, or verify some of these documents.</p>



<p>The concept of portability in the context of digital identity applies differently. A digital ID is portable because it can be migrated and used elsewhere without friction, and in a way that is completely up to the individual to make the choices and decisions regarding his personal data.</p>



 Better understanding of the individual 



<p>People are complex entities with changing needs, attitudes, desires, and interests. In today’s always-connected world, commercial enterprises spend a lot of money researching the market to better streamline their product lines and target the right customer segments and demographics.</p>



<p>A digital identity that maps more accurately to an individual’s real-life identity will enable companies to achieve more personalised promotion and more seamless omni-channel marketing.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>When you think about it, identity is in everything we do. From greeting friends or family, to getting a loan from the bank, or purchasing insurance. We take all this for granted. Yet for many millions of people, things aren’t as easy or straightforward when it comes to accessing finance or services. The lack of identity hampers thriving.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">digital identity solution</a> like Zaisan’s my.D empowers the individual and restores all that fairness and equality of opportunities that are beyond reach for so many people out there</p>

<p>Blockchain-based applications are poised to change the way people all over the world interact with money and value. But before we see adoption by millions of users, blockchain infrastructure will need to evolve beyond current capabilities to process far more transactions per second at low cost, without sacrificing security gained through sufficient decentralization. The delicate balance between these competing priorities has become known as the blockchain trilemma. Different approaches to balancing these goals and delivering a blockchain experience ready for global adoption were discussed by an all-star panel in the Scaling for 1B Users and Solving the Blockchain Trilemma main stage session at Converge22.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2022 and&nbsp;beyond…</p><p>The Nym mainnet launch rolled out in Q4 last year, and 2022 has been a year of much progress: Nym now has an active community of mixnodes, gateways and validators operating a global privacy system. We have four more milestones to hit in 2022 before moving into next year where the aim is major partnerships and end-user adoption. Here is what is&nbsp;next…</p><p>Rounding off&nbsp;2022</p>  Launch zk-nyms for bandwidth credentials  <p>We are launching zk-nym, an anonymous credentials system, based on the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nyms-coconut-credentials-an-overview-4aa4e922cd51">Coconut protocol</a>, that ensures unlinkability and allows for decentralised issuance of credentials. The first practical use case of zk-nym is bandwidth credentials, enabling privacy preserving paid usage of the Nym mixnet. Decentralised issuance of zk-nyms will be available for other use cases for anyone building on the Nyx CosmWasm blockchain!</p><p>2. Launch NYX for blockchain governance and validator rewards</p><p>The Nyx blockchain on the <a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos ecosystem</a> has been operating for months, powering the Nym privacy system. Launching the NYX token will ensure that validators who have been running the chain will finally get rewarded and will boost CosmWasm smart contract development on Nyx for all application developers.</p><p>3. Begin Web3 wallet integrations and privacy partnerships</p><p>We are in discussions with a number of major web3 wallets on Nym mixnet integrations. We expect to see the practical work on wallet integrations begin before the end of the year, safeguarding network layer privacy for a variety of crypto transactions.</p><p>4. Graduate our first cohort from Shipyard&nbsp;Academy!</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nym community is growing, maturing. More than 4000 applicants made it through to Shipyard Academy and are currently learning all about the Nym infrastructure, token economics and privacy. By the end of 2022, the Academy will graduate its first cohort who will be ready to educate and promote a future where privacy by design is the&nbsp;norm.</p><p>2023 — Nym mixnet for the&nbsp;people</p><p>Looking ahead, 2023 will be focused on end-users as we prepare for mainstream adoption. Given the increasing concerns surrounding privacy rights, there is growing awareness among ordinary people on the importance of privacy preserving technologies to protect their digital lives and well-being.</p><p>Our priorities will be to ensure that their needs are met and accessibility to our mixnet is as frictionless as possible&nbsp;through:</p>  Enabling users to determine their mixnet latency preferences and security&nbsp;needs  Determining optimised mixnet parameters per application type  Launching decentralised Nym VPN service with&nbsp;partners  Building censorship-resistant gateways  Enabling paid mixnet service using&nbsp;ZK-Nyms  Securing partnerships with major blockchains, driving mixnet&nbsp;usage  <p>Partnerships with major blockchains and applications are key to Nym’s strategy. Mass adoption at the scale of millions will succeed through the integration of the mixnet into apps and services that people are already using — within and beyond&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>2024 — privacy at institutional and enterprise scale</p><p>At the heart of our work, we firmly believe that privacy as default is fundamental to how our privacy rights can be respected. It should therefore be integrated into core societal institutions as they become increasingly digitised. This can only be achieved through institutional adoption and enterprise use-cases which will be our focus in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Enterprise and institutional use cases will be critical for privacy to be integrated at the infrastructure level, with key partners integration across fintech, medical and personal data sectors. These sectors have high exposure to privacy breaches that severely impact ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>In addition, a push for integration into browsers and operating systems with popular programs in our daily lives like Signal, Google and Brave is on the cards as a natural extension to the success in demand of Nym Connect&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Other important pillars of institutional adoption&nbsp;include:</p>  Standardise at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force&nbsp;(IETF)</a>  Secure hardware optimisation and network stack integration  <p>A future with privacy as&nbsp;default</p><p>The end game is to scale the Nym mixnet to millions of users as we enter an era where privacy tools are normal. As digitisation spreads, so too does the attack surface, undermining the privacy and security of people and organisations. There is a real and immediate need for privacy to be ensured by design. This is essential for a future where our basic infrastructures respect and secure the fundamental right to privacy — and Nym is here to make it a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Join our community to participate and keep up to&nbsp;date:</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/Nym">Discord</a></p><p><a href="http://nymproject/">Twitter</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">Telegram</a></p><p>Essential links</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/token">Tokenomics FAQ</a></p><p><a href="https://coinlist.co/nym">Nym on&nbsp;CoinList</a></p><p>The Nym architecture</p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/nym-whitepaper.pdf">Nym Whitepaper</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/nymtech">Nym Github</a></p><p><a href="https://nymtech.net/docs/stable/overview/">Nym Docs</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-roadmap-update-67a8da65b8b2">Nym roadmap update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Paradoxically, while most blockchains consist of publicly available, open lists of records, it is extremely complicated to extract useful data from a blockchain. The blockchains most protocols are built on are optimized to be secure and tamper-proof but are sub-optimal (to say the least) for extracting intelligible information as the data is both difficult to access and difficult to&nbsp;decode.

<p>Paradoxically, while most blockchains consist of publicly available, open lists of records, it is extremely complicated to extract useful data from a blockchain. The blockchains most protocols are built on are optimized to be secure and tamper-proof but are sub-optimal (to say the least) for extracting intelligible information as the data is both difficult to access and difficult to&nbsp;decode.</p><p>Yet, as is true with traditional, database-backed applications, access and analysis of on-chain data is an essential part of any substantial application. Today developers are forced to build and operate complex infrastructure (running blockchain nodes, setting up a storage and querying system, ETL, etc.) and to develop a deep understanding of the inner workings of smart contracts in order to extract, process, analyze, and display historical on-chain&nbsp;data.</p><p><a href="https://agnostic.engineering/">Agnostic </a>is tackling the issue of blockchain data accessibility by providing a platform to help developers access decoded data in real time. The team at Agnostic have developed an automated pipeline to index smart contract calls and events with no manual action needed to add new contracts and, hence, avoid re-indexing the whole chain. Written for developers, the team at Agnostic are building for the real use cases web3 builders are currently facing.</p><p>What’s even better than that? All of this happens in a PostgreSQL- and GraphQL-compatible engine so your existing developers can immediately be productive and your existing SQL-enabled tools will work out of the&nbsp;box.</p><p>Our Thesis</p><p>Web3 is riddled with complexities for users, including incoming developers who want to build new applications. Having programmatic access to decoded data through familiar, industry-standard mechanisms will allow a new swath of developers to easily build apps, and as the number of developers continues to grow exponentially, the Web3 infrastructure and dev tooling market will naturally grow in both breadth and adoption. Rather than making every new Web3 developer essentially start from scratch, Agnostic brings a simple SaaS experience with an interface familiar to essentially every Web developer on the&nbsp;planet.</p>

By the end of this episode, listeners should have a better understanding of the new tools at their fingertips (literally!), how AI can indeed enhance the creative process, and the second-order effects of these innovations, like how creators are paid.</p><p>Since we’re just at the beginning of the AI era, this is just the beginning of our coverage as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Gh1dyM6yxE">Karen’s TED Talk</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/karenxcheng/?hl=en">Karen’s Instagram account</a></p><p><a href="https://www.karenx.com/">Karen’s website</a></p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CfEpdJrLs49/?hl=en">Cosmo magazine cover</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1541438655327133697">tutorial</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1564626773001719813?s=20&amp;t=ZCnmH-nK03HzoNao_qGVCQ">DALL-E fashion show</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1565003860854185984?s=20&amp;t=ZCnmH-nK03HzoNao_qGVCQ">tutorial</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1565009319447314432">DALL-E outpainting announcement</a></p><p><a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/i-spent-15-in-dall-e-2-credits-creating-this-ai-image-and-heres-what-i-learned-52f352912025">I spent $15 in DALL·E 2 credits creating this AI image</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

<p>Many people consider space to be the next frontier and equally an infinite horizon to explore. But the reality is that not all “space” is the same and there are strategic zones that don’t only matter up there – but down here on Earth. Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) is one of those regions – a zone filled with satellites that support life on Earth, from agriculture to climate to navigation to defense. Unfortunately, these live satellites are not alone in our space highways. LEO is getting increasingly clogged with space debris; we’re polluting our skies just like we’re polluting our land.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, we have the pleasure of speaking with all three cofounders of Privateer – Steve Wozniak, Alex Fielding, and Dr. Moriba Jah, as they explore just how much junk is up there, how this challenge is expected to progress with time due to lower launch costs, and ultimately, what infrastructure is missing in this fragile ecosystem – from tracking to global treaties to a sharing economy of satellites.</p><p>By the end of the episode, listeners should be more equipped to understand how our infrastructure in space vastly impacts life on Earth, how the preservation of this ecosystem is crucial, and how Privateer is providing the map to better understand and fix the issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:&nbsp;</p><p>Privateer’s website: <a href="https://mission.privateer.com/">https://mission.privateer.com/</a></p><p>Privateer’s Wayfinder tool: <a href="https://mission.privateer.com/">https://mission.privateer.com/</a></p><p>Privateer on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivateerSpace">https://twitter.com/PrivateerSpace</a></p><p>Steve Wozniak on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz">https://twitter.com/stevewoz</a></p><p>Alex Fielding on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Alex__Fielding">https://twitter.com/Alex__Fielding</a></p><p>Dr. Moriba Jah on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/moribajah">https://twitter.com/moribajah</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Find us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find us on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.com/podcasts">https://a16z.com/podcasts</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund.

<p>TL;DR: Basic Attention Token announces its first Solana NFT collection, BAT x Adam Ape for Brave, expanding BAT utility in NFT marketplaces. Fans can discover the limited collection through Magic Eden’s NFT Launchpad, which brings them to a custom experience landing page powered by Cardinal, where they can connect via their Brave Wallets and buy the NFTs with SPL BAT or SOL.</p>
<p>Today, Basic Attention Token is announcing its inaugural Solana NFT collection, BAT x Adam Ape for Brave, <a>increasing support for BAT / NFT utility</a> within NFT marketplaces. The launch follows Brave’s <a>May 2022 integration</a> with the Solana blockchain to expand Web3 access. That same day, Brave unveiled its partnership with <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a>, Solana’s largest NFT-based Web3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BAT and Magic Eden have also joined forces with <a href="https://www.cardinal.so/">Cardinal Labs</a> to make BAT x Adam Ape one of the first collections on Solana to launch with the new <a href="https://cardinal-labs.notion.site/Cardinal-Creator-Standard-3963436c5f634ff99da2b0e32800fe54">Cardinal Creator Standard</a>, which enforces royalties at the protocol level on all secondary trading. The decision aligns with Brave’s long-standing mission of supporting digital creators and Magic Eden’s commitment to exploring new creator-supporting models, particularly as more marketplaces shift towards making creator royalties optional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fans will discover and access the BAT x Adam Ape collection through <a href="https://magiceden.io/launchpad/bat">Magic Eden’s NFT Launchpad</a>, which redirects them to a custom experience <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">landing page, powered by Cardinal Labs</a>. There, fans can connect via their Brave Wallet (or another Solana DApp wallet) and purchase the NFTs with <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana v2 Wormhole BAT (SPL BAT or “wBAT”)</a> or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana (SOL)</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 BAT x ADAM APE FOR BRAVE&nbsp; 
<p>Basic Attention Token partnered with <a href="https://twitter.com/adam_ape_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Adam Ape</a>, a renowned multidisciplinary artist in Web3 and the traditional graphic design and digital animation space, to launch its 2500-piece genesis collection: BAT x Adam Ape for Brave. Together, they created four PFP-style NFTs, modeled after Brave’s logo. Each of the four NFTs—respectively named The Curious, The Dabbler, The Degen, and The Sage—is dynamically animated with facial expressions and sound effects and represents one of four stages of immersion in Web3. Read more about the inspiration behind the NFT designs <a href="https://magiceden.io/launchpad/bat">here</a>.</p>

</p>
<p>The first three NFTs in the ordered set, Curious, Dabbler, and Degen, will mint randomly, meaning holders won’t know which piece they’ll receive until after they mint. Holders who collect all three may later have the option to burn the set to obtain the legendary-tier Sage, of which there will only ever be 300 in existence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently, there are no guarantees of additional utility for BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT holders. However, we’re looking forward to engaging with Adam Ape and the BAT Community to explore different utility possibilities for holders of each tier, including Sage holders, over time.&nbsp;</p>

 LAUNCH FAQ 

 Is there a Discord I can join for this project? 
<p>Yes, please join our <a href="http://discord.gg/batbrigade">BAT Brigade Discord</a> community to stay up to date with the latest information on the launch.</p>

 When does the NFT collection launch? 
<p>The BAT x Adam Ape for Brave NFT collection will officially launch on Thursday, November 10th, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

 Where can I buy the NFTs? 
<p>On November 10th, 2022, you can buy the NFTs through our <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">custom-branded experience page, powered by Cardinal Labs</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 What time does the mint start? 
<p>Sale start times by timezone:&nbsp;</p>
 
 9:00 a.m. PST (UTC -8) 
 12:00 p.m. EST (UTC -5) 
 5:00 p.m. GMT (UTC +0) 
 1:00 a.m. HKT (UTC +8)

 The Dabbler: 800 NFTs 
 The Degen: 300 NFTs 
 
<p>The 300 legendary-tier Sages are not included in the initial mint supply of 2500 NFTs. However, they will become available at a future date for holders of Curious+Dabbler+Degen sets who want to burn their set to obtain a Sage.</p>

 What currencies can I use to buy the NFTs? 
<p>The NFTs will be available to purchase with <a href="https://solscan.io/token/EPeUFDgHRxs9xxEPVaL6kfGQvCon7jmAWKVUHuux1Tpz">Solana v2 Wormhole BAT (SPL BAT or “wBAT”)</a> or <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/">Solana (SOL)</a>, and cost 3 SOL each or the BAT equivalent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 How do I get SPL BAT or “wBAT”? 
<p>There are several options for buying or bridging SPL BAT on Solana:&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can buy wBAT directly in the Brave Wallet with Ramp’s fiat-to-crypto onramp or swap an existing SOL balance for wBAT.&nbsp; 
 
<p>


    





    
    




    





    
    
</p>
 
 Use the Wormhole Bridge to bridge $BAT from Ethereum to Solana.&nbsp; 
 

 I already own BAT. How do I convert my BAT into SPL BAT? 
<p>You can bridge your BAT from Ethereum to Solana through Wormhole’s <a href="https://www.portalbridge.com/">Portal Bridge</a>.</p>

 Where can I buy SOL? 
<p>You can buy Solana (SOL) with fiat or crypto directly within the Brave Wallet via Ramp, or from any cryptocurrency exchange that lists Solana.&nbsp;</p>

 What Web3 wallet can I use to mint the NFTs? 
<p>You can use your Brave Wallet or another Solana DApp wallet, such as Phantom, Backpack, Solflare, etc.&nbsp;</p>

 Can I mint NFTs with the Brave Wallet in my Brave mobile app? 
<p>Brave on mobile does not yet offer support for Solana DApps. We recommend using the Brave Wallet in a desktop version of Brave to mint your NFTs.&nbsp;</p>

 I am registered for Bravelist. Does that mean I get priority minting? 
<p>Yes. If you’re on the Bravelist and have registered your Solana wallet address and Discord ID, then you get priority minting. The <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">Cardinal-powered minting DApp</a> will detect your Bravelisted wallet upon connection and permit you to mint within the first two hours of the sale.</p>

 How many mints does Bravelist get me? 
<p>Bravelist permits you to mint 1 NFT per registered wallet. You will need to return during the public mint to mint additional NFTs.</p>

 I am not registered for Bravelist but I want to take part in the sale. How do I participate? 
<p>Once priority minting ends after two hours, minting will open up to the general public. At that time, anyone using a Web3 DApp wallet could connect and purchase NFTs with SOL.&nbsp;</p>

 How do I view my NFTs in the Brave Wallet? 
<p>NFT gallery view in Brave Wallet is still in development. We recommend viewing your NFTs in the NFT marketplace UI (e.g., <a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a>) if purchased on the Brave Wallet.</p>

 I want to sell, trade, or transfer my NFTs. Where can I do this? 
<p>You can sell, transfer, or trade your NFT from within <a href="https://coralcube.io/">Coral Cube</a>’s marketplace user dashboard with your Brave Wallet or Solana DApp wallet connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also access Coral Cube directly from the <a href="https://mint.cardinal.so/bat">minting page</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 I own a Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT. When can I burn them to get a Sage? 
<p>After the conclusion of the mint, we will publish a follow-up announcement detailing how to burn your Curious, Dabbler, and Degen NFT set to obtain a legendary-tier Sage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember, there will only ever be 300 Sages in existence, so not everyone can get one. Join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/batbrigade">Discord</a> and follow us to <a href="https://twitter.com/AttentionToken">Twitter</a> to get project updates first.</p>

 When will you reveal utility for each of the tiers? 
<p>There are no guarantees of additional utility for BAT x Adam Ape NFT holders at the time of the mint. However, we’re looking forward to engaging with Adam Ape and the BAT Community to explore different utility possibilities for holders of NFTs from each of the four tiers.</p>

 How does Cardinal’s royalty-enforcement mechanism work? 
<p>Cardinal’s Creator Standard solution involves (1) a token-manager protocol and (2) a corresponding marketplace integration UI.</p>
<p>Coral Cube (secondary NFT marketplace) has integrated Cardinal’s marketplace manager UI and supports trading for tokens that use the token-manager protocol, including BAT x Adam Ape NFTs.</p>
<p><a href="https://cardinal-labs.notion.site/Cardinal-Creator-Standard-3963436c5f634ff99da2b0e32800fe54#30ae25de15a2418193525817d1b41072">Here</a>, you can read more about Cardinal’s Creator Standard, including the technical implementation details.</p>

 Ready. Set. Secure! Game of Chains kicks&nbsp;off!  Cosmos Validators, Let’s&nbsp;Go! Are you&nbsp;ready?<p>Starting November 7 2022, over the next 2–4 weeks, 150+ validators will participate in Game of Chains — the latest public incentivized testnet in the history of the Cosmos&nbsp;Hub!</p><p>Game of Chains will help validators develop confidence around running Interchain Security — a highly anticipated feature coming to the Cosmos Hub in January 2023. Interchain Security will allow blockchains to leverage the high security of the Cosmos Hub (currently at a market capitalization of ~USD $4B). Because the security of a proof of stake network is closely tied to the value of the blockchain itself, a relatively strong market cap ensures reliable security for blockchains looking to maximize their security!</p><p>In the short term, and before permissionless deployment is available, consumer chains (those “consuming” security from the Cosmos Hub) will be required to go through governance to get their chain admitted by the validator set. This “governance gated” process will make it such that validators have ample time to vote, accept and ultimately run the node of the consumer&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Game of Chains will give validators a flavor of what to expect once the feature is live! Through the various GoC phases, validators are expected to build an understanding of ICS and help us discover interesting attack&nbsp;vectors.</p><p>The testnet infrastructure will&nbsp;include:</p>  Provider chain  Multiple consumer&nbsp;chains  IBC relayers  Support services  <p>Over the 3 phases of Game of Chains, validators will complete a series of predetermined tasks that prove their proficiency at running the ICS protocol. In each phase, points will be awarded to participants who complete certain tasks. Validators at the end of the testnet who have completed the most amount of tasks will be eligible for awards. Please see a detailed breakdown of the phases and tasks&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyphacoop/ics-testnets/tree/main/game-of-chains-2022">here</a>!</p><p>Last, but not least, please remember&nbsp;that:</p>  Only Cosmos Hub validators in the active set are eligible to earn rewards in the Game of Chains testnet&nbsp;program.  Validators operated by employees of Informal Systems, Hypha, and Interchain Foundation are eligible to participate, but ineligible for&nbsp;rewards.   Good luck validators! 🎉⚛️🎉  Ready. Set.

How will this reshape crypto? Where do we find opportunities? Does this thesis even make sense?</p> <p>Further, Dan, Ryan, and David cover the case for why Uniswap is going to have its own chain, why Dan thinks there’s an inevitable economic incentive for large DeFi apps to start their own chains, the main objections to The AppChain Thesis, and so much more.</p> <p>------ 📣 Earnifi | Check For Your Unclaimed Airdrops, POAPs, &amp; NFTs <a href="https://bankless.cc/earnifi">https://bankless.cc/earnifi</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Across">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Brave">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>💠 NEXO | CRYPTO FINANCIAL HUB <a href="https://bankless.cc/Nexo">https://bankless.cc/Nexo</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | NANO HARDWARE WALLETS <a href="https://bankless.cc/Ledger">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚡️FUEL | THE MODULAR EXECUTION LAYER <a href="https://bankless.cc/Fuelpod">https://bankless.cc/Fuelpod</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Topics Covered</p> <p>0:00 Intro 6:45 Dan's Predictive Track Record 9:52 Roll-Apps 14:00 The App Chain Prediction 17:46 UNIChain 23:30 MEV 29:22 Summarizing the Costs 33:50 Who Gets the Money? 36:07 Are the Taxes Worth the Services? 43:48 Why DeFi Apps Haven't Launched App Chains Yet 48:40 Uniswap Nation State 55:33 Uniswap's App Chain Model Sovereignty 1:00:04 Uniswap's Control &amp; Ethereum's Alignment 1:03:38 Uniswap's Composability 1:08:56 What Does This Mean For L1s 1:16:50 Investing in the Apps? 1:20:57 Aggregation Theory 1:23:22 Censorship 1:27:21 Final Takes 1:29:37 Closing &amp; Disclaimers</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Dan Elitzer <a href="https://twitter.com/delitzer">https://twitter.com/delitzer</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>The inevitably of Unichain <a href="https://medium.com/nascent-xyz/the-inevitability-of-unichain-bc600c92c5c4"> https://medium.com/nascent-xyz/the-inevitability-of-unichain-bc600c92c5c4</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Aggregation Theory - Stratechery <a href="https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/">https://stratechery.com/aggregation-theory/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

 Tech and Product  Advanced Staking <p>Week after week, we’ve published updates on the state of Advanced Staking development and testing. Currently, we’re defining the remaining operational steps for its release, a topic we’ll touch on in <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther/status/1587534810460950530">our upcoming AMA.</a><br></p><p>Besides this, deployment scripts and readme are being reviewed. Minor reviews of the UI are also underway. We’ll soon publish a detailed guide about this milestone for our protocol!<br></p> Panther’s v1 release <p>This month, the development contributors have outlined and estimated resources for the remaining tasks involved in this release. This will help us better project and prepare for this milestone. A crucial ongoing step is finalizing all the zero-knowledge circuits needed, based on the possible user flows.<br></p><p>Work has also started on a project preliminarily called zTrade. This functionality will enable v1 users to swap assets within Multi-Asset Shielded Pools.<br></p><p>Our DeFi integration project is moving forwards as well. We have completed our DeFi Adaptor product definition, with its implementation to begin this month. A new Blockchain Architect will also join in early November to lead the cross-chain project.</p> Community  Panther Discussion Forum <p>On October 4th, we released Panther’s Official Discussion Forum, a space for all of our community to engage in the discussions that will decide Panther’s future.<br></p><p><a href="https://forum.pantherprotocol.io/">Access it now</a> and play your part in steering our trajectory!<br></p>Progressive decentralization at work!<p>To facilitate community-led decision-making for the Panther ecosystem, independent moderators manage the Discussion Forum. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_YAuq0Xdt-MOpZWe1gOR-GdlCwtixhK6VBoZnQe6USF37nQ/viewform">Please fill out the application form</a> if you are up for the task.</p> Leading Privacy Alliance <p>The <a href="https://www.leadingprivacy.com/">Leading Privacy Alliance (LPA)</a> is an initiative that brings together Web3 firms and organizations with the common objective of increasing privacy in crypto and beyond. <br><br>"Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about the current state of privacy, implement solutions to these problems, and educate users and projects about the fundamental role of privacy in the technology we build and use.”<br></p><p>The initiative was <a href="https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2022/10/leading-privacy-alliance-launched-prior-devcon-in-bogota">launched</a> on October 9th, just before Devcon Bogota, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-the-leading-privacy-alliance/">where Panther became one of its very first members</a>. Adam Spiers, our Senior Architect, spoke on the stage during the inaugural event, outlining why Panther decided to join this movement.<br></p>“As a project that aims to enable trust and privacy in the DeFi space, it is a natural fit for Panther to join the LPA. We strongly believe that the sector's stakeholders need to form a coalition to defend the right to privacy.” Events  Devcon Bogotá <p>This October 11th-14th, contributors of Panther attended <a href="https://devcon.org/">DEVCON Bogotá</a>, in Colombia! DEVCON always involves attracts the very best in the industry, and there were lots of discussions about partnerships, protocol-building, and the future of Ethereum with other blockchain developers. <br></p><p>We also got the opportunity to chat with Panther backers and believers and distribute some Panther swag! <br></p>Our farewell picture.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Recently the Anoma team posted benchmarks of zero-knowledge proofs. Zcash Halo is one of the zero-knowledge proofs being benchmarked, and we wanted to take an opportunity to share why Halo is even better than these <a href="https://twitter.com/adrian_brink/status/1576925949995933700">initial benchmarks</a> indicate.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/14/zcashs-halo-breakthrough-is-a-big-deal-not-just-for-cryptocurrencies/">Halo</a>, if you’re not familiar, is a trustless, recursive zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) discovered by Sean Bowe at Electric Coin Co. and was implemented in Zcash earlier this year. It eliminates the trusted setup (that’s huge!) and allows greater scalability (also huge!).</p>



<p>Within the Anoma evaluation, a small task was posed for the proof: proving and verifying a 3×3 Sudoku puzzle solution. The results showed that Halo was very efficient. It generated proofs within this program in less than 1/10th of a second and verified proofs in around 3 milliseconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>But when compared to other attributes of Halo, this efficiency might not even be what devs find most important when building out a ZKP tool. Halo stands out for three additional reasons:</p>



  Trustlessness — no “trusted setup”  Recursive — more about that superpower below  Extremely well-engineered for security and performance  



<p>Let’s dive into what each of these mean:</p>



 Halo is Trustless 



<p>When Zcash launched in 2016, its zero-knowledge proofs required a setup phase to produce public parameters that allowed users to construct and verify private transactions.</p>



<p>As our friend Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/03/14/trustedsetup.html">explains</a>, “A trusted setup ceremony is a procedure that is done once to generate a piece of data that must then be used every time some cryptographic protocol is run. Generating this data requires some secret information; the ‘trust’ comes from the fact that some person or some group of people has to generate these secrets, use them to generate the data, and then publish the data and forget the secrets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the setup phase, these secrets had to be destroyed to prevent counterfeiting of Zcash. (There’s a great <a href="https://radiolab.org/episodes/ceremony">Radiolab episode</a> about the first Zcash trusted setup ceremony.)</p>



<p>But Halo has no trusted setup. Halo eliminates the risk of ceremony compromise, increasing confidence in the soundness of the entire system.</p>



<p>Eliminating trusted setup also allows for greater protocol agility. New zero-knowledge protocols can be designed and deployed without requiring another run of the complex and dangerous trusted setup ceremony.</p>



<p>Most of the current generation of zero-knowledge projects rely on trusted setup, because trusted-setup ZKPs are super efficient, and because efficient-enough trustless ZKPs (like Halo) hadn’t been developed yet when those projects started a few years ago.</p>



<p>We’re betting that eventually most of the world will switch to trustless ZKPs and trusted setups will become a footnote of history.</p>



 Halo is Recursive 



<p>Halo is recursive. That’s a technical term, but what it basically means is that it is scalable — you can use Halo to prove facts about arbitrarily complex programs and arbitrarily big data sets.</p>



<p>Halo’s recursive attributes allow for more scalable ZKP applications, and it’s also general purpose. This means that you can use Halo for any and all ZKP applications.</p>



<p>Halo supporting recursion also means that independent, mutually distrusting parties can cooperate to prove facts about their whole combined data set without sharing their private data with each other and without being vulnerable to the other participants cheating. That is a really interesting and never-before-seen capability. We’re&nbsp; looking forward to seeing what people do with it!</p>



<p>Historical note: Halo was the first zero-knowledge proof system ever discovered that is both trustless and recursive.</p>



 Halo is Secure and Efficient 



<p>We engineered Halo for industry-leading security and performance. Unlike other next-generation zero-knowledge proof systems, Halo 2 comes with a <a href="https://zcash.github.io/halo2/design/protocol.html">proof of its security</a>. Writing a proof of security is a difficult and time-consuming process that most cryptographic engineers skip, but it gives greater assurance that the cryptography works as intended.</p>



<p>The flagship implementation of the Halo algorithm is maintained by the legendary cryptographic engineering team at The Electric Coin Co — the team whose pioneering work is the basis of more or less all zero-knowledge proof technology in use today.</p>



<p>Our Halo implementation has been audited by multiple independent experts, and it is <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash">live on Zcash mainnet</a>, protecting Zcash users and ZEC holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our Halo 2 implementation (an improved <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1300850821223964672?lang=en">edition</a> of Halo) is open-sourced under Apache/MIT, and is free to use. This means anyone can use it for any purpose without requiring our — or anyone’s — permission.</p>



<p>Here’s a list of the projects that are already using Halo:</p>

<p>Wormhole is a decentralized cross chain messaging protocol powering the transfer of value and information across high value chains. A network of Guardian nodes secure the protocol by observing and attesting to events and data on its connected chains. These attestations are gossiped around the open Wormhole peer-to-peer network, allowing anyone connected to the network to observe the flow of information. Portal is a bridging app built on top of Wormhole where users can seamlessly bridge tokens and NFTs across supported chains and easily enter the network’s ecosystem.</p><p>We were joined by Dev Bharel, Developer Relations for Wormhole.

<p></p><p>The word anarchy stems from the Greek word “anarchos”, which means “without ruler.” For some, the term “anarchy” draws associations with lawless states of chaos from the past. However, the term in its contemporary sense is used to refer to a vision of society that is absent of unjust hierarchy and coercion. One of the key concepts within the contemporary anarchist vision is that people are, by nature, equal to one another, and should be free to live in ways that reflect this equality. Anarchists respect all individuals who develop skills and knowledge bases that have beneficial applications.</p><p>In the internet’s early days, it was structured more in accordance with anarchist ideals, offering users privacy and a less hierarchical experience. Today, the internet is dominated by government and Big Tech players that have eroded personal autonomy and transparency.</p><p>Everyone has a fundamental right to privacy. These days, pushing back against the tide of insidious data collection and online privacy infringements requires the deployment of anarchist-inspired notions of self-determination and privacy as freedom. Wrenching some sovereignty back from overreaching companies, organizations, and government agencies is feasible with the help of privacy-minded tools and strategies. Let’s take a closer look at how digital initiatives that promote greater freedom and autonomy are embracing anarchist principles.</p> What is Crypto-Anarchy? <p>The internet is at the root of how many people organize their lives. For this reason, most contemporary discussion of personal freedoms tends to be centered around the right to digital privacy.</p><p>The prefix “crypto” is often used negatively to refer to groups who have hidden motives or views. For instance, the term “crypto-fascist” refers to those with fascist views who hide their fascism in order to avoid stigma or consequences. On the other hand, the “crypto” prefix used in the term “crypto-anarchy” refers to strategies for cultivating autonomy that make use of cryptography tools.</p><p>As such, while crypto-anarchy is rooted in strategies that foster privacy and anonymity, these goals themselves are not obscured by crypto-anarchists. In fact, many crypto-anarchists are actively involved in promoting the importance and value of digital cryptography tools.</p><p>Historically, anarchism itself has been associated with left-wing thought, and anarchy’s aversion to hierarchical structures draws associations to communalism and libertarian socialism. However, crypto-anarchy today has links to anarcho-capitalism, too—a right-libertarian political philosophy centered around ownership of private property absent of centralized control.</p><p>Anarcho-capitalism calls for a voluntary society that individuals design themselves with the help of private agencies; in an ideal anarcho-capitalist society, individuals would voluntarily opt into contracts of participation designed to fulfill the will of the people.</p> Anarchy and Privacy <p>Anarchist thought is largely centered around skepticism towards coercion from intrusive governing forces. Personal privacy is widely regarded as an inalienable right. For instance, the<a href="https://unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/peace-human-rights-and-humanitarian-response/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwmouZBhDSARIsALYcouoZ7jXgVP3CDqdgZjyPAWaKjedWEEMsEuuhZKkhkaWQYFjZyuBiwUgaAoEBEALw_wcB"> UN’s Declaration of Human Rights</a> states: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence.”</p><p>Freedom of thought, freedom of association, freedom of expression, and freedom from discrimination are all rooted in the individual’s right to create boundaries and to choose what to reveal and what to hide from others. Actions as simple and intuitive as putting on clothing or closing the bathroom door are rooted in our implicit understanding that there are aspects of ourselves we prefer not to share with others, for a number of reasons.</p><p>As individuals, we make countless decisions about our privacy every day. Insisting that our privacy is not violated without consent is an important way we protect ourselves from abuses of power. However, the ever-increasing role of technology in our lives has blurred our relationship to privacy. While we would naturally feel skeptical of anyone eavesdropping on our conversations, going through our mail, or searching our homes without a warrant, digital surveillance has created a<a href="https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-panopticon-what-is-the-panopticon-effect/#:~:text=The%20panopticon%20is%20a%20disciplinary,not%20they%20are%20being%20watched."> panopticon effect</a> in which it’s nearly impossible to tell who is collecting information about us, and for what purpose.</p><p>Crypto-anarchist tools offer users renewed awareness and control over what information they are sharing with external parties, which is an important step in eradicating privacy intrusions.</p> A History of Bitcoin’s Relationship to Anarchy <p>The principles that led to the development of Bitcoin are the result of a deep and sustained engagement with anarchist ideals. The original development of this technology can be traced to the Cyperpunks’ mailing list from the early 1990s—a virtual meeting place of early digital privacy enthusiasts.</p><p>The Cypherpunks are an example of a digital voluntary society. Many Cypherpunks communicated anonymously by way of aliases, and used cryptographic tools both as a matter of principle—believing in online anonymity as a path towards greater online freedom—and to seize the potential of the power of cryptography as a path towards decentralized and uncoerced economic transactions, for instance.</p> Challenges Facing Bitcoin’s Role as a Privacy Tool <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. All transactions are permanently recorded and stored on the blockchain without the need for regulatory forces or third-party verification. These are essential aspects of its potential as an empowering and privacy-minded digital currency. However, these characteristics also require additional tools and strategies to ensure its capacity to maximize privacy and personal freedom.</p><p>Many newcomers to Bitcoin see it as a short-term investment vehicle, primarily focused on fluctuations in the price of bitcoin rather than the revolutionary potential behind decentralized money. Novice users may leave their bitcoin exchanges, which essentially negates the freedom-related benefits of Bitcoin.</p><p>Most popular cryptocurrency exchanges are centralized (CEXs), meaning third parties have control and oversight over users’ funds. The well-known expression “not your keys, not your coins” refers to the fact that those who have access to bitcoin assets’ private keys (CEXs) ultimately have control over the assets.</p><p>When users put their private keys in the hands of others, this is an aspect of their privacy (and freedom) that they are giving away in exchange for convenience.</p><p>The pitfalls of CEXs go beyond the privacy-related issue of private key ownership, too.<a href="https://crystalblockchain.com/articles/the-10-biggest-crypto-exchange-hacks-in-history/"> Major crypto exchange hacks</a> have occurred in the past, resulting in users losing their bitcoin. Some bitcoin exchanges, including<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriga_Fintech_Solutions"> Quadriga</a>, have been outright scams, defrauding users of their money.</p><p>One of Bitcoin’s most integral features is how it offers users the ability to have custody of their own assets, without fear of outside interference. An understanding of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin and the history of its development is an important aspect of learning how to use it as a defensive privacy tool.</p> Defensive Tools to Establish Personal Privacy <p>Those with limited familiarity with Bitcoin often presume it to be an anonymous currency, but the opposite is true. Bitcoin operates under principles of transparency, which allow all transactions on the blockchain to be publicly viewed and verified.</p><p>Users’ public keys can be linked to past transactions, which can be linked to users’ personal identities through Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. KYC requires that merchants collect data about their customers. For instance, if you use Bitcoin to purchase an item from a website, that website may collect your address and other information, creating a link between that information and your Bitcoin address. Users’ IP addresses can also be linked to Bitcoin transactions, leading some users to enlist services that hide their IP addresses.</p> Anonymizing Strategies <p>New tools have been emerging that seek to improve Bitcoin’s privacy in order to give users more control over how personal data is shared.<a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/how-coinjoins-fix-bitcoin-privacy/"> Coinjoin</a> is one popular anonymizing strategy for Bitcoin. Coinjoin works by allowing users to temporarily join their funds together, acting as a kind of opaque wall between previous and future transactions.</p><p>Additionally, privacy experts tend to recommend privacy-minded internet browsers to make bitcoin-related activity less publicly viewable.<a href="https://www.torproject.org/"> Tor</a>’s browser is a well-established anonymizing tool. Its free browser gives users the ability to mask their web activity from outside parties using multi-layered encryption. When it comes to communicating about cryptocurrency transactions, experts recommend end-to-end encrypted messaging services like<a href="https://signal.org/en/"> Signal</a>.</p> Wasabi Wallet <p>Privacy-minded digital wallets are an effective way to maintain control over your bitcoin and to address the privacy concerns inherent to Bitcoin.<a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/"> Wasabi Wallet 2.0</a> is a privacy-focused bitcoin wallet that is user-friendly and offers a shortcut to the privacy-enhancing benefits of Bitcoin as a tool for crypto-anarchists.</p><p>Wasabi Wallet is a zero-knowledge tool, which means its developers collect no information about users. Making use of the Tor network, block filtering, and coinjoin technology, Wasabi Wallet 2.0 is trust free. It is also a non-custodial wallet, giving users control over their own private keys, offering the full self-determining potential of Bitcoin.</p> Wasabi Wallet as a Defensive Technology <p>Without access to the right tools, protecting oneself from insidious surveillance and data collection can feel overwhelming. Across the internet, privacy and security issues are widespread, and many web-based services are oppressively hierarchical, offering little to no independence and freedom for users.<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/"></a></p><p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">According to one study</a> from the Pew Research Centre, four in five Americans feel they have little to no control over how their data is viewed and collected online, and around the same number believe the pitfalls of this digital surveillance outweigh any benefits. The same study shows that well over half of Americans are concerned about digital surveillance.</p><p>Those interested in preserving their privacy online have rightfully gravitated towards Bitcoin and the crypto sphere, which has a history rooted in strong-willed individualism in the face of intrusion from overbearing institutions. While some people associate the term “anarchy” with the avoidance of rules or consequences, the opposite is true—crypto-anarchist ideals are centered around transparency, equality, and fairness for all. Privacy is a key component of personal freedom, and tools like Wasabi Wallet help users defend their individual online property rights as part of a path toward a more liberated life.<br><br></p>

<p>Have you ever dreamed of opening your own hotel? Did you ever harbour aspirations to transform an old and dilapidated building into an alluring art-deco establishment where literary types gather to sip tea and compare notes about their latest masterpiece? Maybe you have, at some point in your life, imagined an opulent opening day, when the Grand Crypto Hotel welcomes its first set of guests through its revolving doors.</p>



<p>Back in the day, you would have to be a millionaire, or a real estate tycoon to be able to open such a hotel and partake in hotel ownership. But what if I explained that there is a way that you can own a part of that hotel without great wealth? Is your interest piqued yet? Sit down there beside the fire and listen while I tell you about tokenisation. It won’t take long, I promise.<br></p>



 A brief history of tokenisation<br> 



<p>In today’s technology-savvy world, we understand tokenisation as the process of turning sensitive data into non-sensitive data tokens. That then can be shared or traded without compromising the underlying information. Banks use tokens to transmit banking details to a payment processor, for example, to prevent data breaches.</p>



<p>But tokenisation itself is a concept as old as mankind itself. Clay tokens used to count, store, and communicate financial data are known to have been used circa 4,000 BC in regions today known as the Middle East. Early tokens were individual pieces made in different sizes to represent quantity. Later, the tokens would be etched with lines or dots to denote the quality of whatever they represented.</p>



<p>These early tokens were used for administrative purposes, in local economies. Much later, they led to the advent of writing. So from the very beginning, tokenisation has been used to convey information. Data.</p>



<p>This trend of representing data continues today, albeit in a more sophisticated fashion, more in accordance with modern technology.</p>



 Tokenising the hotel industry<br> 



<p>If you ask any hotelier what their main business goal is, you’re likely to hear that their focus is to increase occupancy rates, and maximise revenue per room, commonly known as RevPAR. Millions of hotel rooms worldwide lie unoccupied, i.e., they’re not producing revenue. And as the pandemic made evident, being able to fill your hotel is never certain. So, in light of this economic quandary, hotel managers have been forced to reinvent the business and find alternative ways to make their establishments profitable again. Tokenising their hotels is one of these new ventures.</p>



<p>But how does<a href="https://zaisan.io/nft/project-management/"> tokenising a hotel</a> actually work, and what benefits does it bring? Tokenisation opens up two interesting avenues: Fast access to monetary resources (capital, in other words), and tokenisation-as-as-service.<br></p>



 Releasing capital, fast<br> 



<p>Hotels range from small, family-run establishments, to larger, franchise-owned mega buildings. The plot of land where they stand might be worth millions, and when considering the furnishings, equipment, ornaments, furniture, etc., the value of a hotel site might run into the billions. The problem is if the hotel has no guests, all that value is locked unto itself. In fact, it costs a lot of money just to have the place open, in terms of staff, energy consumption, water, etc.</p>



<p>During COVID-19, millions of hotel rooms remained dormant for the better part of two years, with many hotels looking for different ways to unlock all this locked capital. In this situation, the hotel owner could just sell the property, but this would mean finding a buyer, which is easier said than done, particularly in times of uncertainty. And if the property is sold, the hotel would obviously be in the hands of somebody else. This might not be in the seller’s best interest.</p>



<p>Tokenisation would enable the hotel owner to sell part of the hotel, by digitising the hotel’s assets through blockchain technology. Once the digital version of the hotel is uploaded to the chain in the form of tokens, the owner can begin selling these assets to different buyers. People would effectively own part of a hotel. The blockchain would keep all the information transparent and secure. So, the hotelier can track which tokens are sold, to whom, and at what price.</p>



<p>In this scenario, tokenisation enables the fragmentation of the sale (rather than selling the entire hotel to one person). This means that every investor retains what is called fractional ownership. In other words, you no longer need to be an eccentric billionaire to own a hotel. Or part of it, anyway.<br></p>



 Tokenisation-as-a-service<br> 



<p>Tokenising a hotel opens up brand new possibilities for turning a profit via blockchain, including tokenisation-as-a-service.<br>The digitisation process creates a perfect replica of the hotel on the blockchain, a ‘digital twin’, if you will. Using smart contracts, several specialised platforms now enable this virtual representation of your establishment to manage daily tasks.</p>



<p>These include maintenance, supplies, etc. through third-party contractors, for example. This has an immediate and obvious benefit: cost reduction, by a great margin. The hotel manager (the human one) can delegate all these tasks to the digital twin, and focus on more pressing matters. Tokenisation-as-a-service saves a whole lot of money and frees up a great deal of time.</p>



<p></p>



 How to tokenise your hotel: NFTs or FTs? 



<p>In the hotel industry, these differences can be explained through the example of tokenising a hotel. Let’s say you want to tokenise ownership of the hotel with fungible tokens, you can, for example, create a 100.000 hotel tokens, and each token represents ownership of 1/100.000 of the hotel. Every hotel token is the same and can be easily traded as each token has the same value.</p>



<p>As described above, tokenisation (in blockchain) is essentially the process of representing a certain item with one or more tokens, and it can be done in two ways, namely through fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens. Fungible tokens are interchangeable, for example every euro is the same as every other euro. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are all unique and can have different values, such as different art pieces or different car parts, etc.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/nft-hotels-customer-loyalty/">But you can also tokenise ownership of a hotel with non-fungible tokens.</a> In this case you could tokenise the hotel rooms, the hotel restaurant, the hotel ground, etc. Each of these assets has a different value and people could then buy these individual assets rather than a fraction of the whole hotel. To make things even more interesting, you could then also tokenise high-value assets such as the ground of the hotel for example, using fungible tokens.</p>



<p>In this example both ways of tokenisation are used to fractionalise ownership, just in different ways. But they can coexist and work together.</p>



 Conclusion<br> 



<p>Whether it’s a relatively small family-owned hotel, or a location of a major hotel franchise, tokenising hotels, or hotel rooms, creates real investment opportunities for small to medium investors. And from the hotelier’s perspective, it’s a win-win situation.</p>

 Diardi Election — Instructions <p>Hey guys, we hope you’re all doing&nbsp;well.</p><p>This article will go over how anyone can participate in the upcoming Diardi elections using the web application we created for&nbsp;it.</p><p>The application is available at <a href="https://election.scalaproject.io">https://election.scalaproject.io</a></p> Instructions  Create Account <p>You can create an account on the app just like you would on any other platform and log in with your credentials.</p><p>Click the “Register Now” button to fill in the information.</p><p>Note that you can use any name you want, but remember that this name will be displayed on the Elections dashboard, and everyone will be able to see&nbsp;it.</p><p>We recommend using your Discord username if you have one. For example, MasterMind#2808.</p> Dashboard <p>After the registration, you will be redirected to the Elections dashboard.</p> How does the election&nbsp;work? <p>Let’s introduce the mechanisms behind the Diardi elections.</p> vXLA <p>vXLA “voting tokens” are simply the same XLA coins you had in your wallet before the snapshot on October 31,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>You don’t have to do anything on your side to swap your XLA coins to vXLA. This has already been done on-chain at the snapshot&nbsp;time.</p><p>Those tokens are worth nothing and are only used to vote for applications on the election&nbsp;app.</p> Elections Process <p>The elections will end on November 18,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>During this period, you will be able to send your vXLA tokens to the election app to apply to become a Diardi node operator and also vote for the applications.</p><p>Obviously, you can vote for yourself!</p><p>Remember that 1 vote = 1&nbsp;vXLA.</p><p>After the election period is over, the candidates with the most votes will be elected to become node operators.</p> XLA Balance <p>Your current XLA coins always remain in your wallet. You can check by connecting to your favourite remote node or by syncing&nbsp;locally.</p><p>The vXLA voting tokens are only available when you are connected to the Diardi remote&nbsp;nodes.</p> Snapshot <p>After October 31st, you can send your coins back to any exchange if you&nbsp;want.</p> Number of node operators <p>Depending on the number of applications, we are looking for 32 or 64 Diardi node operators.</p><p>The Scala team will reserve some nodes for the core team members for testing and development purposes: 4 spots if 32 operators are elected and 8 spots if 64 are&nbsp;elected.</p> How to&nbsp;apply? <p>This section will explain how you can apply to become a Diardi node operator.</p> Requirements <p>Anyone can apply to become a node operator, but all candidates must be able to own and operate a server with a public IP&nbsp;address.</p><p>The server specifications would be similar to running a Scala node since the proof-of-algorithm is much faster than that of regular&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>Thus, even a dual-core server will be plenty, but it will give you the upper hand if you have a faster server with a very stable/fast network. What’s given below will be recommended specifications for a Diardi&nbsp;node:</p>  8 cores  8 GB&nbsp;RAM  Minimum of 64 GB of&nbsp;storage  <p>Note: It is strongly suggested to use a VPS for better performance and stability!</p><p>If you believe you have all the requirements to become a node operator and you can commit to it, follow the steps&nbsp;below.</p> 1. Retrieve your Deposit&nbsp;Address <p>Once logged in, you can click on the “Copy Deposit Address” button in the Dashboard to copy your deposit&nbsp;address.</p><p>This is the address you will deposit your vXLA tokens&nbsp;to.</p> 2. Deposit your vXLA&nbsp;tokens <p>-&gt; From the GUI/CLI wallet<br>Open your GUI or CLI Scala wallet, ensure it is synced and then connect to the remote elections node.</p><p><a href="http://election-node.scalaproject.io:11812">http://election-node.scalaproject.io:11812</a></p><p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: You must use the election remote node to be able to access your vXLA tokens; if you use a regular remote node and send your real balance to the election wallet, it will be lost&nbsp;forever.</p><p>-&gt; From the Telegram wallet<br>You also can use the Telegram wallet to send vXLA tokens to the election application, and those who have an XLA account will be auto-generated to vXLA. You can verify this by running /balance which will show your vXLA&nbsp;balance</p><p>Simply use the following command to the Wallet Bot in Telegram:</p><blockquote>/withdraw vxla your_election_deposit_address all</blockquote><p>If you want to send only a portion of your balance use the&nbsp;command</p><blockquote>/withdraw vxla your_election_deposit_address &lt;amount&gt;</blockquote><p>Where amount is the number of vXLA you want to&nbsp;send</p> 3. Vote <p>Once you have deposited all your vXLA tokens on the application, you can vote for yourself (or someone else if you don’t want to apply to become a node operator) by clicking on the vote button next to your&nbsp;name.</p><p>You can click on the “View Votes” button to see all the votes you have cast, and you can click on the “View Transactions” button to see all the transactions that have happened on your deposit&nbsp;address.</p><p>You can verify all the vote counts by using the following address, view key, and the remote node&nbsp;above.</p><p>Address — SvkGTcFJj6u9qh4Gs6T9QCcvLLh1KV5qhba35fReeC8VDhDzbeSkDySQPVJgKSh6fxH7UNNtLbr6UF9RDSURiE2u2vTDjb9g5</p><p>View key — 92c064be19242b8a9f839a10eee2b581a219c859c06111238b8af05399edc208</p> Candidates Presentation <p>We want to allow all Diardi Node Operator candidates to introduce themselves and explain why they think they can be significant assets for the Scala project and community.</p><p>If you have submitted your application to become a node operator, you can now introduce yourself and provide more information to support your application.</p><p>Comment under this Trello card: <a href="https://trello.com/c/LclsOxJB/106-diardi-elections-candidates-presentations">https://trello.com/c/LclsOxJB/106-diardi-elections-candidates-presentations</a>.</p><p>Don’t forget to provide the username you are using in the Elections app!</p> Conclusion <p>The candidates with the most votes will be selected to become Diardi node operators. The Scala team will contact the elected operators on Discord or by&nbsp;email.</p><p>The details of the following steps will be announced on Discord and Twitter, for example, how to configure the Diardi&nbsp;node.</p><p>Happy voting!</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/diardi-elections-instructions-46f2bba73acb">Diardi Elections — Instructions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With spring here in Australia, there’s no better sentiment for announcing the full decentralization of the Verida Testnet — a globally distributed project founded with Aussie roots. Our testnet name pays homage to the wattle, the <a href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/acacia/">Acacia</a> — the largest genus of vascular plants in Australia.</p><p>Over the last few months, the Verida team has been quietly preparing for an upgrade of the Verida Acacia testnet to provide a fully decentralized identity layer. In the early stages of the Verida network, it was much faster to create a centralized identity server. This allowed us to have a working network sooner rather than later. We’re entering the next phase of the network where we can provide a 100% decentralized network. Decentralizing identities is a critical step in that&nbsp;pathway.</p><p>Starting November 2022, we’ll progressively open the network to the public. This is a milestone step to seek valuable feedback and iterate, on our way to Mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p><p>The Verida Network comprises the underlying protocol, technology and documentation built by Verida. Developers can leverage the Verida SDKs to use and contribute to the code to improve the network. Service providers can deliver infrastructure to the network by running nodes that users can select to&nbsp;use.</p> 1. What do I need to&nbsp;do? <p>Developers will be required to update to the latest SDK. There are breaking changes as the protocol will now be looking up identities and data storage infrastructure from the blockchain. More details will be provided to developers closer to the testnet upgrade. Join our #acacia-testnet channel on Discord to stay up to date with the latest information.</p><p>End users will be required to update to the latest Verida Vault. This allows and empowers users to create new identities that are now decentralized. It’s a huge paradigm shift from the current Web2 model that collects troves of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Note: Due to the nature of this upgrade, the existing identities (DID’s) and data on the current Testnet will be reset. All data and identities will be lost unless you&nbsp;backup.</p> 2. What’s included in this Testnet&nbsp;upgrade? <p>We have a number of updates going live across the Verida network, Verida Vault and SDKs as part of the Acacia decentralized Testnet&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This will include the following high-level updates:</p>  Decentralized DID Registry: The current DID registry is currently stored on a centralized server and accessed by the protocol via an API. This DID registry will be moved to live on-chain, giving anyone the ability to register their own identity on the network. This upgrade also includes a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  Verida SDK: Updates to the Verida SDK to leverage the new blockchain based DID Registry.  Verida DbStore: Improvements to provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  Verida Vault: Updates to use the latest protocol SDK and to sponsor gas fees for verified mobile&nbsp;users.  Verida Connect: Enhancements to support the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.  <p>Our <a href="https://developers.verida.io/">Developer Portal</a> will be updated to reflect the changes as the Testnet becomes fully decentralized.</p> 3. What are the Acacia Testnet limitations? <p>With the public upgrade of the decentralized Acacia Testnet, it’s important for users and developers to keep in mind current constraints.</p>  The Acacia Testnet should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It’s great for getting your application ready for&nbsp;Mainnet.  Data stored and accounts created on Acacia will not be transferable to Mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum’s Testnets and&nbsp;Mainnet.  Verida is currently running the encrypted storage nodes for the Acacia Testnet. We will progressively open up the network to be operated by trusted node operators in the coming&nbsp;months.  The Acacia Testnet will continue to exist as a test network once the Verida Mainnet launches later this year. We’ll keep you updated on important dates.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We’ve done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but please remember, this is still a&nbsp;Testnet.  <p>Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/verida/support">opening a ticket on Github</a> or let us know in <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">Discord</a>, so we can fix them as soon as possible.</p> 4. How can I keep&nbsp;updated? <p>For any questions, issues or feedback relating to our Testnet launch, please join our community on <a href="https://discord.verida.io">Discord</a> and join the #acacia-testnet channel.</p><p>Stay up to date with our latest announcements, news, ideas and inspirations, join and engage on our community channels.
