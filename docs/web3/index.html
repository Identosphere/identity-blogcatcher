<p>A few weeks ago a person shared a link in a comment on one of my videos. It was a 2007 talk with a roundtable discussion about neuroeconomics hosted by the Philoctetes Center for the Multi-Disciplinary Study of the Imagination, formerly housed in the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. The organization, named after the <a href="https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/philoctetes.html">mythological wounded Argonaut and holder of Heracles’s bow</a>, failed after the collapse of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auSfaavHDXQ">Bernie Madoff’s</a> Ponzi scheme. Madoff had been a benefactor and was in the audience (to the left of the rear podium) at the event from which these clips were drawn.</p>
<p>Including the Q&amp;A period, the talk was around two hours long. Watch it in full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_B0rvSxUqY&amp;t=0s">here</a> or my 45-minute highlight reel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWPGIp9gHvs">here</a>. I thought it contained so much provocative information, and clearly there were networked influencers in the room, that I spent a few days creating a series of clips that I could share with readers of my blog. I plan to make more of these short posts featuring digestible bits of information I find interesting and pertinent to my recent lines of inquiry – artificial intelligence, networked sensor systems, swarm or collective intelligence, tokenization of social relations, and cybernetic governance for evolutionary optimization towards some new phase of digital, photonic, simulated “life.”</p>
<p>Participants in the 2007 roundtable included:</p>
<p><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/albertobisin/">Alberto Bisin</a> – NYU professor of economics with a specialty in econometrics and behavioral economics</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globalcustodian.com/will-brown-leaves-jp-morgan-for-barclays-capital/">William Walton</a> – former chief economist at JP Morgan, later at Barclays Bank</p>
<p><a href="https://www.helixcenter.org/participants/edward-nersessian/">Edward Nersessian</a> – psychiatrist at Weill-Cornell Medical College and staff of New York Psychoanalytic Institute, co-founder of the <a href="http://philoctetes.org/about/">Philoctetes Center</a> and <a href="https://www.helixcenter.org/">The Helix Center</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_A._Phelps">Elizabeth Phelps</a> – Harvard professor of cognitive neuroscience with a research focus on emotion, cognition, and memory as well as social behavior and economic decision making</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Glimcher">Paul Glimcher</a> – lead developer of the field of neuroeconomics and founder of the NYU Institute for the Study of Decision Making, lead investigator in the Kavli-funded “Big Human Data Research Platform”</p>
<p>I’m going to post half the clips tonight and half tomorrow. Before you choose a few to watch (they’re just 2-4 minutes each), I invite you to review and think about this infographic I made depicting a range of activities associated with Vienna from cybernetics to crypto-currency; from logic to metaphysics; from music to psychoanalysis. Consider the wave forms of matter, sound, economic forecasts, and thought. Glimcher said he was seeking a “Generalized Neural Theory of Human Decision Making.” He didn’t know why they needed it, but increasingly it feels like it’s wanted as a gift for the humanoid robots.</p>
<p>If you want to click the links on the graphic <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YhH5y1I2L8lwEnLzs6jWNrH0u64_04PbksgIdcthPuo/edit?usp=sharing">try this</a>.</p>
<p>For insights into how I have been thinking about these topics you can listen to an hour-talk I had with my friend Cliff about the prospect of living inside and “outside-in robot” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZpBvdnUbCU">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Listen and think about choice, prediction, and use of sensors and currency to shape behavior.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does it make you feel that JP Morgan wasn’t very effective at training people to act like a machine?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you imagine how economic modeling will become integrated into biology? Can you see how gamification and tokens fit into this scenario?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where he’s talking about “safety systems” for cars, can you see how this would be applied to people through their digital twin?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Where they talk about potential applications for using oxytocin (related to dopamine) to instill trust in people, I think this has been accomplished through devices and social media feeds. We are self-engineering our minds through personal technology. They did it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Listen to what she’s saying and then consider the use “outside-in” robots to monitor and manage the emotions of kindergarten children. This is something Cliff and I talked about in our video.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Part two tomorrow. I really do want to hear your insights. These clips are each just 2-4 minutes long. so take a break from the bot noise and really think. Use your imagination!</p>

<p>With spring here in Australia, there’s no better sentiment for announcing the full decentralization of the Verida Testnet — a globally distributed project founded with Aussie roots. Our testnet name pays homage to the wattle, the <a href="https://www.anbg.gov.au/acacia/">Acacia</a> — the largest genus of vascular plants in Australia.</p><p>Over the last few months, the Verida team has been quietly preparing for an upgrade of the Verida Acacia testnet to provide a fully decentralized identity layer. In the early stages of the Verida network, it was much faster to create a centralized identity server. This allowed us to have a working network sooner rather than later. We’re entering the next phase of the network where we can provide a 100% decentralized network. Decentralizing identities is a critical step in that&nbsp;pathway.</p><p>Starting November 2022, we’ll progressively open the network to the public. This is a milestone step to seek valuable feedback and iterate, on our way to Mainnet&nbsp;launch.</p><p>The Verida Network comprises the underlying protocol, technology and documentation built by Verida. Developers can leverage the Verida SDKs to use and contribute to the code to improve the network. Service providers can deliver infrastructure to the network by running nodes that users can select to&nbsp;use.</p> 1. What do I need to&nbsp;do? <p>Developers will be required to update to the latest SDK. There are breaking changes as the protocol will now be looking up identities and data storage infrastructure from the blockchain. More details will be provided to developers closer to the testnet upgrade. Join our #acacia-testnet channel on Discord to stay up to date with the latest information.</p><p>End users will be required to update to the latest Verida Vault. This allows and empowers users to create new identities that are now decentralized. It’s a huge paradigm shift from the current Web2 model that collects troves of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Note: Due to the nature of this upgrade, the existing identities (DID’s) and data on the current Testnet will be reset. All data and identities will be lost unless you&nbsp;backup.</p> 2. What’s included in this Testnet&nbsp;upgrade? <p>We have a number of updates going live across the Verida network, Verida Vault and SDKs as part of the Acacia decentralized Testnet&nbsp;upgrade.</p><p>This will include the following high-level updates:</p>  Decentralized DID Registry: The current DID registry is currently stored on a centralized server and accessed by the protocol via an API. This DID registry will be moved to live on-chain, giving anyone the ability to register their own identity on the network. This upgrade also includes a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  Verida SDK: Updates to the Verida SDK to leverage the new blockchain based DID Registry.  Verida DbStore: Improvements to provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  Verida Vault: Updates to use the latest protocol SDK and to sponsor gas fees for verified mobile&nbsp;users.  Verida Connect: Enhancements to support the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.  <p>Our <a href="https://developers.verida.io/">Developer Portal</a> will be updated to reflect the changes as the Testnet becomes fully decentralized.</p> 3. What are the Acacia Testnet limitations? <p>With the public upgrade of the decentralized Acacia Testnet, it’s important for users and developers to keep in mind current constraints.</p>  The Acacia Testnet should only be used for prototyping, development, and testing purposes. It’s great for getting your application ready for&nbsp;Mainnet.  Data stored and accounts created on Acacia will not be transferable to Mainnet. These are separate networks, similar to Ethereum’s Testnets and&nbsp;Mainnet.  Verida is currently running the encrypted storage nodes for the Acacia Testnet. We will progressively open up the network to be operated by trusted node operators in the coming&nbsp;months.  The Acacia Testnet will continue to exist as a test network once the Verida Mainnet launches later this year. We’ll keep you updated on important dates.  You may encounter a few bugs and/or performance issues. We’ve done our best to make things work as smoothly as possible, but please remember, this is still a&nbsp;Testnet.  <p>Please report any issues by <a href="https://github.com/verida/support">opening a ticket on Github</a> or let us know in <a href="https://discord.verida.io/">Discord</a>, so we can fix them as soon as possible.</p> 4. How can I keep&nbsp;updated? <p>For any questions, issues or feedback relating to our Testnet launch, please join our community on <a href="https://discord.verida.io">Discord</a> and join the #acacia-testnet channel.</p><p>Stay up to date with our latest announcements, news, ideas and inspirations, join and engage on our community channels.

<p>Amman (Jordan), San Francisco (United States), November 1st, 2022 – A new hope for Human Rights in the Metaverse emerges as the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (UN-ESCWA) adopts Metaverse Safety Week, an annual global awareness campaign led by XR Safety Initiative (XRSI) that brings the world together to safeguard the Metaverse. XRSI’s Global Digital Policy Advisor, Kristina Podnar, made the announcement at the Arab SME Summit in the presence of global regulators and members of the Jordanian Royal Family.</p>



<p>UN-ESCWA is one of five regional commissions under the United Nations Economic and Social Council’s jurisdiction and promotes Western Asia’s economic and social development through regional and subregional cooperation and integration. XRSI is a San Francisco-based nonprofit Standard Development Organization (SDO) focused on helping build safe and inclusive emerging technology ecosystems.</p>



<p>Kristina Podnar, XRSI’s Global Digital Policy Advisor, noted that “the Metaverse is one of the most talked about modern technology concepts. As we look forward to activities that range from leisure and gaming to professional and commercial interactions, financial transactions, or even health interventions, we cannot shy away from the corresponding tough conversations around data protection and cybersecurity, ownership, misuse, interoperability, and portability. I am delighted that XRSI is facilitating conversations across sectors which will move all of us beyond talk and into action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the focus on bringing the world together and proactively addressing the Metaverse-related risk impacting humans and societies, XRSI celebrates the third annual awareness campaign between Dec 10th and Dec 15th. The Metaverse Safety Week is created and promoted by XRSI with these key focus agendas:</p>



  Encourage the Metaverse stakeholders, such as organizations, governments, academics, creators, and global citizens, to adopt the intervention for safety awareness by organizing conferences, meetups, and webinars, conducting internal employee awareness training, issuing transparency reports, digital asset distribution for promoting safety or making pledges related to safeguarding the Metaverse.  Help Governments, Big Tech, Academia, Think Tanks, Civic Organizations, and Communities worldwide understand how they can combine resources and play leadership roles to stay ahead of the challenges that the Metaverse brings along.  Create a better and safer Metaverse for all by spreading awareness and promoting policies, guidelines, safety frameworks, and research.  



<p>Kavya Pearlman, the XRSI CEO, notes that “Metaverse brings new economic opportunities and enables several profound innovations to life but also brings along safety, privacy, and ethical risks. Each year before the holidays, the world must come together to ensure that we engage with the Metaverse technologies with safety, security, and human rights at the forefront. By dedicating an entire week to various themes, XRSI intends to create a reflection point on the safety and trust aspects of Metaverse technologies.”</p>



 Metaverse Safety Week 2022 – December 10th-15th, 2022 



<p>The 2022 virtual event is a week-long event that commences on the 74th Human Rights Day, 10th December, at a unique virtual venue, with rich and immersive experiences crafted explicitly for the occasion. Metaverse Safety Week features a global agenda with sessions, social moments, panels, and live interviews this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Metaverse Safety Week focuses on building an open, inclusive, safe Metaverse by inviting the ecosystem stakeholders to connect, collaborate, and share their research, knowledge, and passion. Any organization can adopt the awareness campaign to create their own programming or support the XRSI-led campaign by submitting requests to speak, conduct a panel or create a parallel event altogether. The Metaverse Safety Week awareness campaign is a community-driven global movement for responsible innovation, better regulations, and more profound knowledge of the world we are immersing in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stake natively on Polkadot easier than ever and with as little as 1 DOT thanks to this new scalability feature for Polkadot’s staking system.</p><p>Nomination pools are a new feature for <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking">Polkadot’s staking system</a> that allows users to pool their DOT tokens together on-chain to nominate validators and receive rewards, significantly improving the system’s scalability. Now, anyone with as little as 1 DOT can receive rewards for staking natively on Polkadot.</p><p>Coupled with the recently launched <a href="http://staking.polkadot.network">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, the new user-friendly staking app that recently came out of beta, nomination pools lower the barrier to entry for participation in staking directly on the network and simplify the staking process. Now, users with less DOT and those looking for a more passive staking experience can stake directly on the network.</p><p>Crucially, these updates also reduce the incentive to stake through third-party services and intermediaries. By cutting out the middleman and staking natively (directly on the Relay Chain) DOT holders can help keep Polkadot secure and decentralized while receiving competitive rewards of up to 18%*.</p><p>Native, protocol-level nomination pools also represent a major innovation in the broader blockchain industry, where stakers with less tokens are often disadvantaged and staking pools typically necessitate relying on intermediary services.</p> The need for nomination pools <p>From the beginning, Polkadot’s Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) system was designed for maximum security, decentralization, energy efficiency, and fair representation, efficiently balancing the interests of smaller and larger DOT holders alike. It has always been a goal for Polkadot to provide inclusive access to staking participation and lower the barrier to entry as much as possible for nominators.</p><p>But following the launch of Polkadot’s Relay Chain in 2020, <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/polkadot-and-kusama-staking-changes/">rapid scaling</a> of the network in 2021 and an increase in demand for staking participation put a strain on this innovative staking system. To ensure the network's security, a maximum number of 22,500 nominators was introduced and governance passed a series of motions that gradually increased <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/157">the minimum nomination amount to 160 DOT</a>. This limit was eventually <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/921">lowered back down to 10 DOT</a>, but the minimum amount needed to be part of the top 22,500 nominators and earn rewards is now dynamically determined and is still somewhere around 170 DOT at the time of writing.</p><p>To remedy the system’s scalability issues and remove the limitations introduced on participating as a nominator, several <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">improvements to Polkadot’s staking system</a> were developed <a href="https://polkadot.network/tag/staking-updates/">over the past year</a>. The most significant and exciting of these is the nomination pools feature, which launched first on Kusama and is now live on Polkadot.</p><p>Before nomination pools, the only way to participate in the nomination process and receive rewards natively was for users to directly nominate validators, using their stake of DOT tokens to select up to 16 trustworthy validators.</p><p>However, not only does direct nomination require users to have a significant stake in DOT tokens to participate, it also requires playing a more active role in researching, selecting, monitoring, and periodically reevaluating their choice of validators.</p><p>With nomination pools, the creator of a pool manages nominations on behalf of pool members, reducing the time and overhead necessary to participate in nomination. Of course, pool members should still conduct their own due diligence when determining which pool to join. In contrast to direct nomination, pools also do not require users to create both a stash and controller account, further reducing the complexity of native staking.</p><p>Alternatively, before nomination pools DOT holders could stake indirectly via third-party services and liquid staking providers, but at the expense of network decentralization and security. Indirect staking also meant that DOT holders had to give away their economic voting power to third parties, often handing over a percentage of their rewards in the process.</p><p>Beyond making native staking more accessible for those with less DOT, nomination pools also remove the theoretical limit on the number of users the system can handle, allowing it to continue to scale as demand for staking participation continues into the future.</p> How nomination pools work <p>With nomination pools, multiple DOT holders can pool their tokens together and act as a single nominator, collectively backing a set of validators chosen by the pool creator with their combined stake.</p><p>Rewards are automatically split pro-rata among the members of the pool, and nomination pools do not currently take a commission. This means that pool members can currently expect the same rate of rewards for their stake as they would if participating in the system as a direct nominator.</p><p>To ensure economic incentives are aligned and network security is maintained, slashes are also applied proportionally to pool members who are actively bonded.</p> Joining a nomination pool <p>The simplest way to participate in nomination pools is through the <a href="https://staking.polkadot.network/dashboard">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, the network’s new, user-friendly web application for staking. More advanced users can also participate via <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>.</p><p>Joining a nomination pool through the Staking Dashboard is as easy as connecting your account, selecting a pool, and signing a transaction to contribute your DOT to the pool. For a complete walkthrough on how to join a pool through the Polkadot Staking Dashboard, see the <a href="https://youtu.be/gQ-ZucYgWZc">tutorial video walkthrough</a>.</p><p>Note that you can only participate in a pool with a transferable balance and the amount you participate with is transferred from your account to the nomination pool. Those who have already bonded funds can bond additional funds or re-stake rewards. Currently, you can only belong to one pool at a time. Because the member funds are transferred from your account to the pool's account, any funds you nominate to a pool will not appear in your balance.</p><p>Additionally, voting for governance with pooled funds is not currently possible. In order to unstake, or simply switch from one pool to another, you’ll need to wait the 28-day unbonding period on Polkadot.</p> The stakes are infinitely better on Polkadot <p>Polkadot's native nomination pools are an important and valuable addition to the network. As a result of this update, NPoS becomes more scalable and provides a more user-friendly and inclusive way to stake on Polkadot, opening up staking to many more DOT holders.</p><p>Pools also offer new opportunities for validators. With nomination pools deployed, the number of DOT entering the staking system is likely to increase, and validators will have an incentive to ensure the inflow of tokens is directed towards them.</p><p>Join or open a nomination pool today via the <a href="http://staking.polkadot.network">Polkadot Staking Dashboard</a>, or via <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=light%3A%2F%2Fsubstrate-connect%2Fpolkadot#/staking/pools">Polkadot-JS Apps</a>.</p><p>Read more about staking on <a href="https://polkadot.network/staking/">the Polkadot website</a>, or <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">visit the Polkadot Wiki</a> for a more technical deep-dive on nomination pools.

Consequently, Findora is looking for hackathon submissions that showcase confidential transfers or selective disclosure of personal data using Findora’s SDKs.</p><p>$5,000 will be awarded to the team or individual with the best submission. Also, feel free to swing by and learn more about zero-knowledge cryptography and how to apply it to your&nbsp;project.</p><p>Documentation for the <a href="https://docs.findora.org/developers/events/eth-san-francisco-2022">Privacy Routing SDK and ZK-DID&nbsp;SDK</a>.</p> Findora’s Hackathon Challenges and&nbsp;Details <p>There is a grand prize of $5,000 for the individual or team that creates the best privacy&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>Findora’s hackathon follows two&nbsp;tracks:</p>  Best use of the Privacy Routing SDK for confidential transfers.  Best use of the ZK-DID SDK for selective disclosure of personal&nbsp;data.  <p>Challenge #1: Use the Privacy Routing SDK for private transfers between wallets on the Findora EVM chain. Get creative by combining your private transfer on Findora with another project’s hackathon challenge.</p><p>Challenge #2: Use Findora’s <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/adding-privacy-to-blockchain-identity-management-through-zkdid-6adb12a50a3f">ZK-DID</a> solution to allow selective disclosure of personal data.

Submissions will be judged by a panel from Discreet Labs, a contributor to the Findora protocol.</p><p>Click <a href="https://sf.ethglobal.com/">here</a> to register before November&nbsp;1st.</p> Why Privacy? <p>Findora believes privacy is a necessary component of any financial system, and the lack of privacy is holding Web3 back from mainstream adoption.</p><p>Users would be troubled to discover that others have the ability to see their bank account balances and transactions. Companies would avoid issuing payroll or costs for fear of exposing sensitive information to competitors. Yet that is the current experience on&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Web3 must provide a comparable level of privacy as Web2 before mass adoption is possible. This is the mission of&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>Findora is using zero-knowledge proofs to create a privacy platform that can solve these problems. By combining privacy and auditability, by prioritizing compliance and personal ownership of data, Findora prepares Web3 for real-world application and lays the foundation for a free and decentralized digital&nbsp;future.</p> ZK-DID <p>ZK-DID has the ability to restore ownership of personal data to&nbsp;users.</p><p>For example, you could prove your credit score is above a certain number, or your GPA is above a certain level, without revealing the specific numbers or other data. You could prove your age without disclosing your birth&nbsp;date.</p><p>Using zero-knowledge proofs, ZK-DID lets users choose what information they reveal to third parties while preserving the information they wish not to disclose.</p> What Is&nbsp;Findora <p>Findora combines the programmability of Ethereum with advanced privacy-providing ZK-technology. It allows developers to build innovative privacy dApps using Solidity, SDKs, and the functions they are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>An innovative L1, Findora is a leader in zero-knowledge cryptography. Its ZK-technology will allow developers to combine privacy and auditability for compliance purposes. Through SDKs, Findora is a plug-n-play privacy tool for all of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Findora makes Web3 viable for mass adoption through privacy and zero-knowledge innovation.</p><p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/findora">Discord</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/findora">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/findoraen">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Medium</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/findorafoundation/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FindoraFoundation">Facebook</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/findora-privacy-hackathon-at-ethsf-2022-512f64a3585f">Build Privacy at Findora’s 2022 EthSF Hackathon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation">Findora Foundation</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hello everyone. I’m popping in to let you know that Jason and I have decided to postpone our trip until March. We had good intentions, but sometimes life throws you curveballs. We’re both feeling a bit tender, not at the top of our game, and California demands we come fully engaged. We’ve been touched by all the support we received and have been in contact by email or mail with most donors. If you are reading this and haven’t heard from us already, please drop Jason a line at argusfest@gmail.com. We didn’t have contact information for everyone. Jason will be working to edit segments of our material over the next few months to create an introduction that he hopes will create space for more people to picture the challenge humanity faces as Web3 sensor network installation and the financialization of natural life proceed at a brisk pace. Some of the donations will support Jason’s work on that project, and the rest we’ll hold for the spring trip. We are more than happy to return donations to anyone who requests it. His van is now roadworthy after weeks of difficult labor, and that is a happy milestone achieved.</p>
<p>Since Jason will be focused on developing that video over the winter months, I will be working to develop some basic skills in the technical arena. I got a second monitor and am making progress; though I can certainly never match the quality of his editing. I have presented a few podcasts and walk throughs of my elaborate maps – the labyrinths. Today I tried out an hour-long format with my friend Cliff. We started with a peek into the origins of WGBH Boston and public television, talked about the stories we live inside, and then pivoted to a critical examination of new technologies of emotion-sensing software and cyber-physical networks that aspire to be “outside-in” robots. They intend for us to live inside these networked “robots.” Billionaires and proponents of Generalized Artificial Intelligence want us to adopt digital identities, transact through coded token “social” currencies, “perform” humanity, and help them manifest new forms of information-based “life.” No thank you.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Outside In Robot Chat – <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/?p=14615&amp;preview=true">here</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t think Google / Alphabet or Eric Schmidt appreciate these investigations. Below is a discussion Jason and I did last week deconstructing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2kOmSh4h84">SmartCon chat</a> Schmidt did recently with Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Eric Schmidt Smartcon chat – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l8DQ8uM5Ko">here</a>.</p>
<p>I got another ding on my youtube channel last week, so I can’t upload or stream for now. I added today’s chat with Cliff to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCscUZcrVKlV6NnRpWADQzgw/videos">my back up channel</a> and invite you to subscribe to it and / or send me your email so I can add you to the notification list when I put up new content. I’ve also been working to upload videos to Archive.org where they can be viewed and downloaded. Look for “Alison McDowell” or “Wrench In The Gears.”</p>
<p>Someone made a suggestion that I begin to engage people via a regular Q&amp;A. I wasn’t sure, because I don’t get many viewers, but after talking with Jason and Cliff I decided maybe I could try and solicit questions in advance via a form and then select one or more to address in a given week. If I don’t get submissions, I can always read an old blog post for the podcast. See <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wrench-in-the-gears-podcast-downloadable-audio-of-select-talks/">this page</a> for downloadable audio-only content.</p>
<p>My hope would be to support people as they examine these systems in their own communities. “Looking at the Labyrinth” seems to be exactly what needs to be done if we are to get to the middle and walk out, don’t you think? If you have a question for me or an observation about what this looks like where you live, consider sending something my way. For now I’m thinking maybe Wednesday evenings around 8pm EST. Jason hasn’t had a chance to make the form yet. I just asked him today. In the meantime, these are the questions I plan to use. If you’re really excited about this idea, feel free to email a submission to me at timpsila@protonmail.com.</p>
 
 Tell me a little bit about yourself. I’d love to know generally where you’re located,&nbsp;what&nbsp; you care about, what your gifts are – that sort of thing. Just a few sentences is fine. 
 I’m interested to hear&nbsp;what interests you about my research / perspective. Where does it resonate with you? 
 
 Do you have an observation to share about how you see this “predator energy” showing where you live? 
 
 
 Do you have a question or comment about a recent presentation? 
 
 
 Please share your preferred contact information – phone and/or email. 
 
 If I use your inquiry in my weekly mailbag podcast, I’ll be sure to drop you a line in advance. I’m working on my Zoom skills, so if you’d be open to having a recorded chat be sure to let me know. 
 
 Thanks again to everyone who made contributions. I’ve come to trust my intuition, and my gut said wait. I’m excited that by spring we’ll have new material we can share with audiences in California to help them understand the lens we’re using on this unfolding drama.

<p>A short writeup for the Polkadot ecosystem on implementing the newly released nomination pools feature.</p> What? <p>Nomination pools are a new type of scaling solution that's being added to Polkadot staking. It mainly targets the stakers who do not have enough DOT to participate actively in the normal staking process, i.e. as a “nominator”. Learn more about pools at the following links:</p>  <a href="https://youtu.be/_wjAYivFQBU">Nomination Pools and The Story of The Polkadot's NPoS</a>.  <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools">Nomination Pools | Polkadot Wiki</a>.   How? <p>Pool members have a much simpler API compared to nominators: They join a pool, they can increase or decrease their stake in that pool, and they can claim their rewards whenever they want.</p><p>On the other hand, the process of creating and managing a pool is entirely new and we expect that to be the most work heavy part for our ecosystem, wanting to support pools. Nonetheless, you can focus on the “Pool member experience” at first, since most of those who want to manage a pool will be “power users” who can find their way in Polkadot JS Apps or other UIs with rough edges.</p><p>Here are some resources to help you with implementation:</p>  <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/index.html">pallet-nomination-pools documentation.</a>  <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/">https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-march-2022/</a>  <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io">https://matrix.to/#/#nompools-support:matrix.parity.io</a>  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33/views/3">https://github.com/orgs/paritytech/projects/33/views/3</a>   Why? <p>Polkadot’s complicated taking system has been the subject of a lot of community feedback over the last year. A portion of these stakers have already migrated to other staking services. A number of them are nominating on Polkadot, but are not always earning rewards. Therefore, we expect a large number of end users to wish to move back to staking directly on the Relay Chain (as opposed to more centralized services) and pools are exactly the tool for that. This is a great opportunity for the entire ecosystem to help these users achieve this goal, while attracting more users.</p><p>We encourage all wallets in our ecosystem to identify nominators who are not earning rewards, and invite them to join nomination pools. See <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/issues/7902">this issue</a> as further information around this.</p> Common Mistakes / Notes <p>Here are a few mistakes that we realized over the last few months UI implementers should keep an eye on.</p> Pool Members   In general, whenever a pool member changes their total point, the chain will automatically claim all their pending rewards for them. This is not optional, and MUST happen for the reward calculation to remain correct (see the documentation of `<a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.unbond">bond</a>` as an example). So, make sure you are warning your users about it. They might be surprised if they see that they bonded an extra 100 DOT, and now suddenly their 5.23 DOT in pending reward is gone. It is not gone, it has been paid out to you!  Joining a pool implies transferring funds to the pool account. So it might be (based on which wallet that you are using) that you no longer see the funds that are moved to the pool in your “free balance” section. Make sure the user is aware of this, and not surprised by seeing this. Also, the transfer that happens here is configured to to never accidentally destroy the sender account. So to join a pool, your sender account must remain alive with 1 DOT left in it. This means, with 1 DOT as existential deposit, and 1 DOT as minimum to join a pool, you need at least 2 DOT to join a pool. Consequently, if you are suggesting members to join a pool with “Maximum possible value”, you must subtract 1 DOT to remain in the sender account to not accidentally kill it.  Points and balance are not the same! Any pool member, at any point in time, can have points in either the bonded pool or any of the unbonding pools. The crucial fact is that in any of these pools, the ratio of point to balance is different and might not be 1. Each pool starts with a ratio of 1, but as time goes on, for reasons such as slashing, the ratio gets broken. Over time, 100 points in a bonded pool can be worth 90 DOT. Make sure you are either representing points as points (not as DOT), or even better, always display both: “You have x points in pool y which is worth z DOT”. See <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/6195ef41946017ec860d2d8ad58f9bc18b5797bf/frame/nomination-pools/src/lib.rs#L633">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/6195ef41946017ec860d2d8ad58f9bc18b5797bf/frame/nomination-pools/src/lib.rs#L624">here</a> for examples of how to calculate point to balance ratio of each pool (it is almost trivial ;))   Pool Management <p>The pool will be seen from the perspective of the rest of the system as a single nominator. Ergo, this nominator must always respect the `staking.minNominatorBond` limit. Similar to a normal nominator, who has to first `chill` before fully unbonding, the pool must also do the same. The pool’s bonded account will be fully unbonded only when the depositor wants to leave and dismantle the pool. All that said, the message is: the depositor can only leave the chain when they <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_nomination_pools/pallet/struct.Pallet.html#method.chill">chill</a> the pool first.</p>

<p>In the future, thanks to a revolutionary set of technologies — built on the principles of fair access and decentralization — humanity will experience greater freedom and security than at any point in history. Each individual will enjoy self-sovereignty, and collaboration and creativity will be at an all-time high.</p>



<p>In 30 years, there will be fewer centralized gatekeepers to decide who can participate in society. There will be fewer king makers to determine who wins and who loses.</p>



<p>In this era — the Golden Age of freedom and self-expression — education and opportunity will be accessible to everyone, innovation will thrive, privacy will be normal and expected, and the people (and governments) of the world will agree that a vibrant society depends on respecting and upholding human dignity, security, and consent.</p>



<p>This is ECC’s vision for the future; and for our part, we will empower economic freedom for billions with a fair, open currency, accessible to every person on the Internet.</p>



 Zcash today 



<p>Today is Zcash’s birthday. Launched on Oct. 28, 2016, Zcash was the first project of any kind to successfully use zero-knowledge proofs. Earlier this year, Electric Coin Co. (ECC) <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/nu5-activates-on-mainnet-eliminating-trusted-setup-and-launching-a-new-era-for-zcash/">implemented Halo</a> — a new and improved zero-knowledge proving system — to remove reliance on complex setup ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The efficiencies built into this upgrade made possible — for the first time ever — private, trustless digital cash payments on mobile phones. Halo is now being tested in other projects for its privacy and scalability benefits; and in <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/ethereum-zcash-filecoin-collab/">a partnership</a> with Protocol Labs, Filecoin Foundation, and Ethereum Foundation, ECC is collaborating with these teams to unlock recursion in Halo and explore how the technology might be used in the respective ecosystems. (Also, there’s <a href="https://filecoinfoundation.medium.com/new-agreement-between-filecoin-foundation-and-electric-coin-co-63df066212b1">a multi-million-dollar pool</a> for developers and teams who are interested in adding utility for the Filecoin and Zcash chains.)</p>



<p>Next year, in 2023, ECC will release a fully-supported commercial mobile wallet in the iOS and Android app stores with the rationale that Zcash adoption will grow when (1) the user experience is excellent — easy and fast — and (2) users are given compelling features and capabilities that support a growing number of use cases. This is aligned with our North Star, a commitment to help build a world-class user experience for ZEC, the Zcash token.</p>



<p>In 2023, we’ll also make a formal recommendation to move Zcash from <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/should-zcash-switch-from-proof-of-work-to-proof-of-stake/">proof of work to proof of stake</a>. This is ultimately a Zcash community decision, but we believe the benefits far outweigh the risks, and we are looking forward to the discussion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much more to be excited about, such as a <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/long-term-sustainability-with-the-zcash-posterity-fund/">posterity fund proposal</a>, <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-proposal-for-shielded-assets-zsa-uda-for-defi-on-zcash/40520">ongoing third-party work</a> on Zcash shielded assets, a <a href="https://zfnd.org/zebra/">Rust-language Zcash node</a> being built by the Zcash Foundation, continuing decentralization and development funding with the recent formation and momentum of the <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> organization, and some impressive Zcash partnership announcements on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve only just begun.</p>



 ECC’s 30-year plan 



<p>Empowering billions of people around the world with economic freedom is a monumental task, and it will require many mission-aligned people and teams to commit to it. Starting with a 30-year goal in mind, ECC has worked backwards to conceive a path for our contribution toward achieving it. There are increasingly more strategies and contributions to Zcash from across the ecosystem, and we look forward to collaborating to realize our collective vision of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For obvious reasons, the roadmap is more detailed in the near future.</p>







 2052: Zcash for billions 



<p>In the year 2052, every person on the Internet will have the ability to obtain and use Zcash according to their own preferences. Economic freedom requires private digital cash that is equitable, available, permissionless, privacy protecting, and resilient; and we (not just ECC, but many Zcash community contributors) are laser-focused on building the absolute best solution. We’ve come a long way since 2016, but the technology will have to evolve, starting today, to scale to billions of users.</p>



<p>This, of course, is not the end goal. It’s a milestone. We envision Zcash as a critical component to economic freedom for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



 2032: Deliver a world-class UX for ZEC 



<p>Goal</p>



<p>ECC will have delivered a world-class user experience for ZEC (the Zcash token) — a fair and open currency within a framework that protects freedom, dignity, consent, and security.</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2032</p>



  Using ZEC across ECC and third-party applications is so easy users don’t have to think about it. It is at least as easy to use ZEC as it was to share photos and videos in 2022 world-class apps, such as Tik Tok or WhatsApp.  ZEC users: The number of actual human users — people who have purchased, sold, sent or received ZEC in the previous 24 months&nbsp; — is 1 billion across the globe.  Zcash is a top-five cryptocurrency by market cap.  Sentiment: Zcash users are likely to recommend Zcash to a friend or colleague. This is measured in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score">Net Promoter Score</a> (NPS). For Zcash, the NPS is ≥ 50 every year.  Decentralization: Because decentralization is important to user security, censorship-resistance, and project longevity, at least 10 long-term, viable organizations are now focused on Zcash.  



 2025: Proof of stake and interoperability 



<p>Three years from now, we will have delivered an ECC-built and -supported mobile wallet on top of an interoperable Zcash protocol that leverages a proof-of-stake consensus. Features in incremental wallet releases will be based on Zcash user feedback, industry feedback, and market research. The wallet will support core PoS and interop use cases.</p>



<p>Goal</p>



<p>Zcash will have transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. There will be strong support for Zcash interoperability and broad access to ZEC across DeFi and CeFi. At this point, we expect strong demand for Zcash/ZEC among the “early majority.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2025</p>



  ZEC users: The number of users has doubled from the previous 16-month period, and the ECC wallet is seeing 1 million monthly active users.  Zcash is a top-10 cryptocurrency by market cap.  Sentiment: The Zcash Net Promoter Score (NPS) is ≥ 50 every year.  Decentralization: At least five long-term, viable organizations are focused on Zcash.  



 Late 2023: UX foundations 



<p>By the close of 2023, the ECC mobile wallet will be available in the iOS and Android app stores&nbsp; with network-level privacy and instant sync — providing speed, convenience, and greater access. This is critical for a world-class UX for ZEC and lays the foundation for growing ZEC users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Goal</p>



<p>Deliver an open-source wallet that is available on Apple and Android stores and well supported by ECC; improve the ZEC UX including network privacy and instant sync; improve the Zcash tech stack (wallet, SDK, lightwalletd, protocol) sufficient to double users by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Success criteria for 2023</p>



  Users: The number of users has doubled from the previous year.  Sentiment: The Zcash Net Promoter Score (NPS) has been ≥ 50 for the last 12 months.  Decentralization: At least four long-term, viable organizations are focused on Zcash.  



 The next four months: Establish new baseline 



<p>ECC’s No. 1 priority at the moment is updating the Zcash protocol and our wallet SDKs to help third-party providers fix wallet syncing issues. An increased on-chain transaction load has resulted in unacceptable sync times for many everyday users, and ecosystem partners are also affected. We are focused — across teams — on alleviating these issues as soon as possible, so Zcash users have an experience they expect and deserve. Our immediate objectives are centered on working with third-party wallets that are built on the ECC SDKs (Edge, Nighthawk, and Unstoppable) to:</p>



  Ensure users can spend their funds (funds that are already synced when they open their wallet)  Ensure users can receive and spend new incoming funds at a rate of a month’s worth of transactions in one hour  Implement updates which provide users clarity on syncing progress  Ensure none of those wallets are impacted by frequent crashes or inconsistent behavior (such as failing to display some already synced transactions), nor do they require work-around behaviors due to the ECC SDK  



<p>Other success criteria for this period</p>



  ECC teams agree on the definition or proxy for global ZEC user counts.  Research and engineering have defined and communicated a revised three-year roadmap inclusive of user growth objectives, proof of stake, and interoperability.  



 Prioritization and achieving objectives 



<p>To deliver on all this important work, ECC has laid out a process that mandates our leadership meets every four months to revisit strategy and roadmap, evaluating data for the current period and reviewing waypoints. Functional owners (for example Steven Smith in Engineering) will be responsible for functional roadmaps that are aligned with the strategic roadmap and for determining where they need cross-team support. Each success criteria will be owned by an assigned functional owner to track and determine how we (all of ECC) can align to best meet the objective.</p>



 Empowering economic freedom 



<p>“Zcash for billions” is a change-the-world vision. Maybe that’s cliché, but today, too many people are forced to use discriminatory, poorly managed, and insecure centralized entities to store and transfer money digitally. Too many people are forced to live within fiat systems that are managed by governments that don’t have their constituents’ best interests at heart. Most cryptocurrencies do not provide adequate privacy and security protections for most use cases, and they expose users to surveillance which can lead to exploitation, manipulation, and seizure.</p>



<p>Today, billions of people in the world do not have access to a fair and open currency or supporting financial services. We build and support Zcash to drive greater economic freedom and opportunity for everyone.</p>

<p>Academy will accelerate global education on privacy and action that can be taken to combat issues found on commonly-used communications tools.</p><p>Neuchâtel, Switzerland — Friday, 28 October 2022: Today, <a href="https://nymtech.net/">Nym</a>, the leader in network layer privacy, announced the launch of <a href="https://shipyard.nymtech.net/academy">Shipyard Academy</a>, a privacy learning program for anyone who wants to play a role in transforming the internet from a massive vehicle of surveillance and control into a secure digital realm where privacy is the&nbsp;default.</p><p>Privacy is not baked into the core internet infrastructure and today, surveillance is the norm as individuals are subjected to unwanted targeting and manipulation. The purpose of Shipyard Academy is to accelerate the awareness and understanding of what individuals can do to preserve their privacy rights and take back control of their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Nym Chief Strategy Officer Jaya Brekke says, “Web3 was supposed to do things differently to the surveillance capitalism of Web2 by introducing new design principles and a different economics. But so many online communities in Web3 nevertheless use surveillance-prone platforms like Discord and Telegram. Shipyard Academy aims to reach people on those very community platforms and elsewhere and begin onboarding people to the world of privacy, Nym and our privacy allies across the&nbsp;stack.”</p><p>The six-week program will commence on 5 November 2022 and will cover topics including:</p>  How mass surveillance that happens at the network&nbsp;layer  How Nym solves this&nbsp;issue  The privacy problems with many of today’s most popular community apps  Full stack privacy awareness and why privacy is a core principle of&nbsp;Web3  <p>The program comprises three stages over six weeks, which are self-paced for learning. A learn-and-earn aspect will be set at the end of each stage through tasks and quizzes for participants to progress through to the next stage. A total prize pool of up to 100K NYM tokens will be distributed to top participants across three&nbsp;stages.</p><p>At the end of the program, participants will have the opportunity to apply to be a Nym ambassador, a “Nymja”, after being fully equipped to participate in and contribute to the Nym community and mission. Nymjas are champions of a future where privacy is the default. As a Nymja, successful participants will work closely with the Core team to develop Nym and the privacy agenda in their local contexts, earning a stake and partaking in the further decentralisation of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>The Academy is the first step for anyone new to Nym and the privacy space regardless of experience.

 Tor Optimization for Better Coinjoins <p><br>It is, unfortunately, no surprise to anyone that the privacy network <a href="https://status.torproject.org/">Tor has been under Distributed Denial of Service attack</a> for the last few months, and as a result, has been suffering from severe latency and reliability issues in routing traffic. Many bitcoin projects, including Wasabi Wallet, depend on Tor as a mission-critical infrastructure to protect the privacy of their users. In light of the attack, this resulted in infrequent coinjoins for Wasabi Wallet users. As a countermeasure to address this reliability issue, the Wasabi client switched from connecting with the backend onion server to using Tor exit nodes and routing traffic to the clearnet domain of the coinjoin coordinator. All traffic is still anonymized to prevent the client from leaking its IP address to the coinjoin coordinator server and protect user privacy. After performing testing and scenario analysis, the Wasabi contributors realized it would vastly improve the reliability and frequency of coinjoin rounds, preventing inputs from being blocked by the coordinator. Inputs are usually blocked if they repeatedly fail to sign the coinjoin transaction, to protect against DDoS attacks on the coordinator itself. Users downloading the latest release should now expect much more reliable and frequent coinjoins, vastly improving their experience. As this doesn’t directly address the Tor hidden identity registry DDoS attack but routes around it, zkSNACKs is also extending its fundraising support to help the Tor team fund developers to work towards resolving this ongoing issue. &nbsp;</p><blockquote>Tor is a critically important project for privacy on bitcoin and the internet that millions of people rely upon on a daily basis. Wasabi Wallet is grateful that such a tool exists and will do as much as possible to support Tor by promoting it and helping with its fundraising. Tor reliability is directly impacting the user experience of Wasabi Wallet users, so we care about this issue a lot. ~ Max Hillebrand, Wasabi Contributor and CEO at zkSNACKs.</blockquote> A New Privacy Progress Feature <p><br>Privacy is often an abstract concept that is hard to relate to for most users. Making privacy more understandable by providing elegant visuals is taking one step closer to bringing privacy to millions of bitcoiners around the world.<br><br>On the home screen of the Wasabi desktop app, a privacy progress bar is now available, showing the size of each coin and their privacy levels within a colour scheme. Users now have a complete view of their wallet privacy with the existing wallet privacy score (that remains unchanged). The privacy bars can be expanded into a privacy ring viewed in a pop-up dialog, which provides additional information about each coin, its size and its privacy level. This gives optional insight into the wallet's status, allowing users to have a better understanding of how much privacy they’ve achieved at any given time.</p><blockquote>There is something satisfying with checklists and loading bars, especially when completed. It feels like progress is made and work gets done. While we believe privacy is a habit rather than a fixed goal, we hope that bringing privacy progress visuals will help more users take the leap and reclaim their privacy. ~ Max Hillebrand, Wasabi Contributor and CEO at zkSNACKs.</blockquote>

 Announcing Game of Chains — Open for Registration! ✨ Do you see the sun rising over Gaia in the background? ☀️<p>Dearest Cosmos Validators</p><p>The 3rd Public Incentivized Testnet in the history of Cosmos, following <a href="https://github.com/cosmos/game-of-stakes">Game of Stakes</a> &amp; <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/goz">Game of Zones</a>, is open for <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">registration</a>! 🎉🎉🎉</p> Announcing — “Game of&nbsp;Chains”! <p>Game of Chains is an incentivized testnet program that will help validators develop confidence around <a href="https://informal.systems/2022/05/09/building-with-interchain-security/">Interchain Security</a> (ICS) and provide a public platform where this new technology can be thoroughly tested.</p><p>What is Interchain Security?</p><p>Interchain Security is a feature which will allow the Cosmos Hub to share security with other blockchains. On a technical level, this means that the Cosmos Hub validator set will gain the ability to validate other blockchains alongside the Cosmos Hub. These blockchains are called “consumer chains”, and will be secured by the Cosmos Hub’s billions of dollars of staked&nbsp;ATOMs.</p><p>In August, Informal Systems published<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security/releases/tag/v0.1"> v0.1 pre-release</a> of Interchain Security, which, at a high-level, is an implementation of the Interchain Security protocol that is set to go live in January 2023. This protocol implements: validator set change packets and confirmations; slashing packets; distribution packets; Cosmos-SDK modifications. You can check out the full specification<a href="https://www.notion.so/Interchain-Security-Testnet-cc65af3d57724c2bab52a04f3f3d3a7d"> here</a>.</p><p>For this testnet, we will work together to test out features of the protocol that validators will be running! Further, validators will have an opportunity to test “real world” consumer chain software that will be adopting Interchain Security in 2023! These projects include: <a href="https://linktr.ee/neutron.org">Neutron</a>, Duality and&nbsp;Stride!</p><p>20 000 ATOMs will go to Game of Chains&nbsp;winners!</p><p>Cosmos Hub validators will compete for rewards throughout this public testnet which is funded by the community pool via <a href="https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/77">Prop 77</a>! Thank you to the entire Cosmos community for supporting this initiative. ✨</p><p>Rewards will be distributed to winning validators based on a points system (more details to come!). These rewards will be allocated to validators that complete certain tasks, and submit an entry for Testnet&nbsp;awards.</p><p>👉Please note that only active Cosmos Hub validators are eligible for rewards! Further, if you win, your validator will be required to provide KYC information in order to receive ATOM&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>What are the next&nbsp;steps?</p><p>First, any interested validator needs tosign up to participate in Game of Chains! <a href="https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022">https://interchainsecurity.dev/game-of-chains-2022</a></p><p>To start coordinating your participation in Game of Chains, you will be added to the Cosmos Network discord channel with the information provided in the registration form. Make sure you are in the discord <a href="https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork">here</a>. Channel: #game-of-chains</p><p>Game of Chains is scheduled to launch on November 7, 2022. The testnet will run for 2–4&nbsp;weeks!</p> Good luck Cosmos validators, and let’s make Interchain Security secure!&nbsp;💪  <p><a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/announcing-game-of-chains-open-for-registration-d1818662de8e">Announcing Game of Chains — Open for Registration! ✨</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network">Cosmos Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

         Elena Nadolinski: Privacy for the People                <p>By Nicole Zakheim</p><p>Photography: CAYCE CLIFFFORD</p><p>Published October 27, 2022</p>            <p>Driven by a passion for computers and community, a cryptocurrency founder creates a solution for all.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>One night in 2017, Iron Fish founder Elena Nadolinski attended a birthday party at the Palo Alto home of Protocol Labs founder and CEO Juan Benet. Her then-boyfriend, now-husband and Figma co-founder, Dylan Field, had been roommates with Benet, and they were part of a close group of friends. The party was filled with talk about cryptocurrency generally, and Ethereum specifically. Benet’s company had started Filecoin, a cryptocurrency-operated file storage network, and he was about to roll out the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized storage and file referencing system that can operate on Ethereum.</p>



<p>Something about the conversation struck her as particularly urgent—all these “incredibly brilliant people, being all very excited about this piece of technology”—cryptocurrency, but it was still too complicated for most people to widely adopt it. It required hours of setup, some technical knowhow and access to powerful computers. To Nadolinski, who had had immigrated to America from Russia when she was 8, it seemed like two ideas in opposition: cryptocurrency promised to be a currency for the people, by the people, but it was still limited to those with the resources and ability to immerse themselves in technology to participate. What about the rest of the world? On the way home, Nadolinski sat shotgun, phone in hand, scrolling down an internet wormhole as Field drove across the dark city.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadolinski had been recognized as a teen by the White House as an up-and-coming computer science superstar, interned at Microsoft and had been recruited as an engineer by the buzzy startup Tilt, and then worked at Airbnb, but she admits that by the time of this party, she didn’t really get the technology that powers the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency. “It’s inaccessible for even a smart, technically savvy person,” she says. She Googled: “What is Ethereum?” and flicked through the results. When she remembers this moment now, she laughs at herself trying to get to the bottom of a set of wildly complex questions while driving home from a party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ethereum is this world computer, right? So, okay, that’s a really big phrase. What does that mean? Ethereum does distributed computations. Again, what is that? That seems confusing. And so the first kind of use case that I read about it was something to do with decentralized voting. How do you make voting more fair? And I thought, okay, that’s interesting, but that doesn’t seem like such a breakthrough. And so I kept kind of digging and digging and digging into it. And the first use case that actually made the most sense to me was non-fungible tokens.” She saw the non-fungible tokens, or NFTs—digital files whose proof of ownership can be stored on the blockchain, so a person can show they own the “original”—as a compelling use of the blockchain because they introduced scarcity to something that was previously considered endlessly replicable. Within several months, Nadolinski went from thinking about scarcity to charting a path to a more accessible cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>This is how Nadolinski, now 30, talks—moving from one massive idea to the next, toggling between tech lingo and business jargon in a rapid conversation style that makes concepts like “world computer” or “non-fungible token” easier to understand. After her Ethereum-Google in 2017, Nadolinski researched cryptocurrency ecosystems, reading white papers and speaking with founders, protocol developers and engineers. As a curious computer scientist, she was drawn to the complexity. But as a person, she was drawn to cryptocurrency’s close-knit community and its members’ enthusiasm for its possibilities. She started attending hackathons and meetups, asking questions, offering solutions, making friends and contributing in such a meaningful way that she started receiving invitations to present. Soon, she stepped away from her job at Airbnb to pursue cryptocurrency full-time.</p>



<p>Today, Nadolinski and her team are close to launching Iron Fish as a layer 1 blockchain to support a new cryptocurrency as well as a privacy layer for other existing cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are the least private way of transacting; the transparency of crypto transactions is the pillar of trustless verification. It means anyone could track an individual’s crypto transactions in real time using data-mining techniques. Since crypto digital wallets have unique addresses, their transactions can be traced by cross-referencing with personal data. And even while some cryptocurrencies are private, and others can be made private, the processes are cumbersome, confusing and still may be vulnerable to deanonymization. All transactions on Iron Fish are encrypted, protecting the user by hiding transaction information through a cryptographic technique called zero-knowledge proofs. Eventually, as Iron Fish becomes more mature and integrates with more existing blockchains, any cryptocurrency transaction can be made private in a compliant way. This means that, some day, users could have all the advantages of any cryptocurrency without the privacy issues that currently plague it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The name Iron Fish alludes to the protective power of cryptography. During World War II, the United States used codes to communicate with allies that were based on Native American languages, spoken by Native American enlisted men called Code Talkers. The code, never broken, was declassified in 1968. Nadolinski chose the word Iron Fish, meaning submarine—“besh-lo” in the code derived from the Diné (also known as Navajo)&nbsp; language—because the idea of a submarine was strong, protective and something secret, or in this case, private.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Issuing currency is a primary function of modern governments, which enact policies to keep it stable so a nation’s economy can function. Cryptocurrency can be a way to hedge against the inflation or deflation that comes with traditional currencies. “For people in the United States, it’s like, well, ‘I think maybe it’s nice in a moral, philosophical way for me to hedge my bet in terms of which currency I keep my wealth in,’” Nadolinski says, “but for other people in Venezuela, Turkey, Argentina, Russia, Ukraine, all those countries are experiencing inflation … if they could have a way out …” Beyond that practical application, Nadolinski’s company is part of a rapidly growing cohort of encryption and privacy tools—messaging, browsers and VPNs—designed to protect users from the threat of data scraping, surveillance and hacking. “Freedom is synonymous in many ways with privacy,” Nadolinski says. “So even though Americans have forgotten how good they have it, there are so many arguments for them to still care about private cryptocurrencies.” Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire understood the promise of Iron Fish the moment he heard about it, and Sequoia invested in November 2021. With a deep technical background, Maguire had heard about the promise of blockchain technologies since at least 2007. So when he met Nadolinski more than a decade later, he was intrigued by her vision for realizing blockchains’ potential for usability and privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maguire imagines a scenario where Iron Fish would be even more necessary—a hypothetical future in which cryptocurrencies are used for everyday transactions, in which it would be possible for scammers to see people’s anonymous-but-public transactions and trace them back to a wallet and know where that person is, what they’re doing, and even what they’re planning to do. “Imagine you’re buying an airline ticket to fly from L.A. to Europe,” Maguire says. “So someone can guess you’re going to be out of town for the next week and they can go rob your house.” Nadolinski also tells a story about speaking to a good friend who said they wanted a private cryptocurrency to spend at Burger King, because they didn’t want their health insurance provider to know about their diet habits and raise their rates. This is only partially hypothetical. At the moment, cryptocurrencies cannot be spent at Burger King, but can be spent at McDonald’s, and retailers like Amazon, Overstock, Microsoft and AT&amp;T, among others.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Nadolinski and her parents immigrated to America when she was in elementary school. They lived in several places but eventually settled in Virginia. She spoke little English and her parents held her back a year so she’d be in the same grade as another student who spoke Russian and English. This was a disaster; Nadolinski remembers her as a bully who intentionally mistranslated things. So Nadolinski pushed herself to learn English rapidly at school, and as she grew up, she found a cohort of “supersmart, badass” girlfriends who “all wanted to change the status quo.” Her parents worked as software engineers, and she’d page through their books at home. In high school, she took her school’s AP computer science class and taught herself everything else she’d need to know to become vice president of the computer science club and president of its robotics club. She loved her teammates, the kind of kids who liked to tinker and code, and who, she jokes self-awarely, “liked to stay after school for hours to make sure that the robot goes straight.” The robots went straight enough that the team earned a second-place finish at a global competition. She <a href="http://www.collegiatetimes.com/news/virginia_tech/article_aa071111-6125-55fd-9520-bd05d14d20b2.html">was honored</a> at the White House with the Aspirations in Computing Award from the National Center for Women in Information Technology, and the Central Intelligence Agency gave her an award, recognizing a program she designed to compress images. The irony doesn’t escape her today, pointing out that image compression is related to encryption, which the CIA knows something about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nadolinski first heard about cryptocurrency in 2011. During a fundraising brainstorm for the robotics team, a teammate suggested they use the school’s computer lab to mine Bitcoin. The currency was still new, and worth between $1-$30 each. Nadolinski shut the idea down, saying, “That’s silly. It’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH5-rSxilxo">never going to work</a>.” And just as her opinion of cryptocurrency from 2011 has evolved, the rest of the world is catching up. Larry David starred in a 2022 Super Bowl commercial, playing a character who scoffs at the wheel, ridicules the light bulb and mocks the indoor toilet. The commercial was for FTX, a notably accessible cryptocurrency exchange. Today Nadolinski laughs, ruefully describing how if she’d been game for the idea, the team would, in all likelihood, be perpetually endowed. As of this writing Bitcoin trades at about $20,000, and has been as high as $68,000.</p>



<p>After graduating high school, Nadolinski studied computer science at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. During the school year, she interned at the cloud computing services company Rackspace for engineer Dave King, who is still a mentor and friend. For up to 10 hours a week, she tackled a backlog/wishlist of “tiny tickets,” but King remembers one of Nadolinski’s projects that was “not that tiny.” He says she handled the moment gracefully when managers suddenly realized that some code she’d been updating impacted several other pieces. “We thought it was scoped, and it was clearly not scoped,” he says with a chuckle. It launched Nadolinski into a nine month project, “She was in rooms seeing how implementation might happen and seeing how to make the decision,” King says. “I think Elena was quite fastidious in attention to detail … which is something that brought her success. She was good in collaborative situations, as the intern, understanding how people made things work and fixed things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>King says great engineers are distinguished by their ability to figure out ways to get around problems, something he saw in Nadolinski immediately. “Like, there are five little hurdles. Which ones are the ones we invest in to fix? And which ones do we just let go? Knowing how to manage your time, making choices for today and the future. Some people are like, ‘We have to fix everything all the time.’ And that is not as productive.” Nadolinski spent summers interning for Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, and after graduating in 2015, she took a full-time job there. Nadolinski realized she loved collaborative building but hated bureaucracy. After a year, she moved to San Francisco to immerse herself in the more collaborative startup world. She got a job working again for King, this time at the new crowdfunding company Tilt, but it was acquired by Airbnb about seven months after she started. “She was asking me about the user acquisition strategy,” says King, remembering Nadolinski as being particularly savvy about business even as she was working on the engineering side. “Tilt went international to grow our customer base, and signups were very high, but you can only go into so many new markets,” he continues. “And we had a conversation like, ‘Is this really going to work?’ And she didn’t get the answers she really wanted … and when we took the acquisition, I was like, ‘Oh, Elena figured this out six or seven months ago.’ She had a healthy skepticism about the information she was getting, and really getting into the details of things to understand what was going on.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now at Airbnb, several months after the Ethereum epiphany at the birthday party, she attended EthWaterloo, a 36-hour Ethereum hackathon in the Canadian computer science hub of Waterloo, Ontario, which attracted hundreds in October 2017. There, she worked on the problem of how to enable decentralized video streaming on the IPFS. She talks about how problem solving in one area unlocked insights in other areas: “And that got me to ask, ‘What is decentralized computing,’ and ‘How do you prove an honest computation?’” That thinking led her to zero-knowledge proofs, which use cryptographic techniques to verify transactions without exposing user data, which is now a big part of how Iron Fish works. But it was more than the thinking and problem solving that made EthWaterloo a turning point for Nadolinski. She tells a story about how at 3:30 a.m., Dan Finley, the man who wrote MetaMask, a cryptocurrency wallet for Ethereum, helped her debug her own MetaMask integration. “And that was a very special feeling. It was like, ‘Wow. This community is so welcoming and so encouraging and is so available to help.’ And so, from that hackathon in particular, it’s like, ‘Wow, I want to be part of this.’” She went on to attend and present at more hackathons, giving talks while live-coding non-fungible smart contracts onstage in about 30 minutes. She says she wanted to encourage more people to experiment with Ethereum, to see this emerging technology as approachable. And it started to work. Focused on being relentlessly pragmatic and approachable as opposed to theoretical, Nadolinski became an in-demand speaker and collaborator. When she gave a talk called “Demystifying Zero-Knowledge Proofs” in 2018 at Devcon IV in Prague, tracing the history of cryptography through to its involvement in cryptocurrency today, people reached out on Twitter and Telegram, thanking her for making such a complex topic so understandable and asking how they could start learning more themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After that talk, she was invited to speak at EthBuenosAires in 2018, the first event of its kind in Latin America. At the same time, Airbnb wanted her to go to Barcelona for a user-research study, a rare, exciting opportunity. She was torn. She was constantly learning from her colleagues at Airbnb, and appreciated the company’s focus on aesthetics, but she’d already booked the trip to Argentina. “That was the turning point of, like, ‘Okay, I feel like I have two jobs, and I’m sucking at both of them, and I need to choose one,’” she remembers. “And I obviously chose crypto.”</p>



<p>“So, I was looking into NFTs already,” she continues. “I was looking into zero-knowledge proofs, and I worked backward. I said, ‘Okay, let’s just assume that in whatever time horizon, crypto payments are going to be ubiquitous, whatever that means. What do we need to get there?’” Privacy seemed like the obvious answer. She explains that today’s levels of transparency are unsafe for users, as in Maguire’s hypothetical plane ticket-buying scenario, but also unsafe for nations. “Everything that you do on any kind of most known blockchains is fully transparent to the world,” she says. “If you use Ethereum or Bitcoin today, your wallet information is available to anyone in the world to see what exchanges you use, what items you have, what protocols or smart contracts you’ve ever interacted with.”</p>



<p>By 2018, ZCash rolled out an open-source protocol called Sapling to try to solve for privacy with zero-knowledge proofs. All forms of currency, whether cash, credit or digital, face the challenge of making a transaction private enough so people feel free to use it in everyday life, while enabling regulators to ensure all transactions are legal. And this balance makes cryptocurrency innovation especially tricky. But this was Nadolinski’s passion, and, after raising funding in 2021 to start hiring a team, it would become her business model: users would move their cryptocurrencies to Iron Fish’s blockchain, which would cloak their assets by anonymizing and encrypting their data, and the miners who add to the blockchain would receive a fee paid in the Iron Fish token, $IRON. This incentivizes use of $IRON for everyone who wants to move their currency to the Iron Fish blockchain. The cryptocurrency community is still figuring out a balance between privacy and minimizing crime committed with cryptocurrency. A crypto wallet typically has a private key, which is analogous to a password, to allow the user to spend their funds, and a public key, to allow the user to request funds. Most privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, including Iron Fish, also support view keys, in addition to private and public keys, at the wallet level. Initially, only the creator of the wallet has access to that wallet’s private, public and view key. The holder of a view key can see all associated transactions with that wallet, even in a fully private system. This allows regulated entities, like exchanges, to be compliant and provide audits. Nadolinski says her team is also working on adding controls on how a cryptocurrency can move in and out of the Iron Fish layer, a kind of monitoring capacity on the bridges between blockchains to limit hackers from taking advantage of the Iron Fish privacy platform. Nadolinski explains, “Crypto can’t go forward without privacy. But the future is going to be privacy-with-compliance. That’s what we are working on at Iron Fish.”</p>



<p>Nadolinski is also working to make Iron Fish especially user-friendly. The Iron Fish core team has a mantra to make Iron Fish “the Apple of blockchains”—inuitive, easy to use and something that works right out of the box. “And it’s actually very difficult to make it work out of the box, because it’s really complicated tech, but we’re trying our best,” Nadolinski says with a self-aware laugh. To get there, she and her team consistently survey early users for feedback about the blockchain implementation and the wallet. And she’s been inspired by Airbnb’s use of design, she says, to make an otherwise unusual experience—“You go into someone else’s house and you sleep on their bed,” or using cryptocurrency—cool. She points to how several private currencies feature black websites, with code-style text or pirate motifs, aesthetics that speak to secrecy, but which are not universally appealing. Her site has inviting language and features bright colors and sea creatures rendered in a woodblock aesthetic. One fish wears sunglasses. But her biggest point of user-design pride is the installation process. Instead of a typical cryptocurrency setup, a multi-step ordeal that can take up to three hours, anyone can run an Iron Fish node using just one command line in the terminal.</p>

<p>***</p>



<p>In May, Nadolinski launched Iron Fish’s second incentivized testnet, a standard way to ensure a new blockchain is stable and bug-free, in which a working version of the blockchain is used by a limited cohort who spot problems in the code and try to stress-test the system. Phase two is wrapping and Phase 3 will launch in the first quarter of 2023, aiming for a mainnet launch in the third quarter. Participants earn $IRON tokens in exchange for certain kinds of participation. At its peak so far, the second testnet has hosted 11,000 concurrent nodes. Bitcoin, the most-used cryptocurrency, for comparison, typically hosts about 15,000 concurrent nodes. “I think that is a testament to how easy it is to run Iron Fish,” says Nadolinski.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This testnet is the last one before the team pushes the blockchain live. Stakes are high. This phase is so critical because, unlike traditional software that can be updated to fix bugs or add features, big changes can break the blockchains themselves. “These testing phases are very stressful because it’s like, if you miss one thing in mainnet, you’re really screwed,” says Maguire. While small updates can be rolled out without breaking the chain, to make a big update, a coordinated effort has to occur in the community of exchanges, miners and users to accept the change, a difficult proposition for a technology spread across a global community. Maguire observes that big code changes where the currency survived the disruption have only happened a handful of times, notably with Ethereum and Bitcoin. “These things were catastrophically painful conversations in these communities and took years to settle,” Maguire says. “So once you ship crypto code, it’s basically final.” And bad code can be a disaster. Estimates of how much cryptocurrencies hackers are stealing vary widely, but the numbers are notable. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze">Federal Trade Commission reports</a> that Americans lost $1 billion in 2021, but the FTC acknowledges that its reports represent a fraction of the likely total. The blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, which doesn’t guarantee its data, estimates that <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2022-Crypto-Crime-Report.html?">$14 billion worth of cryptocurrencies has been stolen because of weaknesses in code</a>.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Nadolinski says the Iron Fish testnet is now processing more zero-knowledge proof transactions than any other chain. But she is balancing development and optimization with the pressure to launch. Iron Fish’s value depends on getting people to want to use it, and testnets create the kind of buzz that leads to adoption. Maguire speaks to the pressure from the community: “They’re like, ‘We’re desperate. Get this thing out. We want to use Iron Fish in production.’” Nadolinski is sensitive to that sense of urgency. After all, she’s doing all this because of the cryptocurrency community, which she got introduced to through her husband, Field. “He is one of the most connected people I’ve ever met,” she says. When she was at Microsoft, Tilt started recruiting her, so she Googled its co-founders, James Beshara and Khaled Hussein. She spotted Beshara in the 2015 Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list for Consumer Tech. Also in that year’s cohort was Field, pictured with a tremendous grin, one that makes him stand out on the page, still searchable today. “And I scrolled past this face, and it was like, ‘Wow. This person’s my age, was an intern at Microsoft, started a company, raised $3 million.’ I was like, ‘Whoa. I thought I had to have years of experience to do this. And here’s a person who just did it.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shortly thereafter, she accepted the job at Tilt, moved to San Francisco, broke up with her boyfriend and gave in to her friends’ prodding to join a dating app. One day, she chose OKCupid and started scrolling. “I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, where did I move?’ There was that phrase: the odds are good, but the goods are odd. Yeah. And I kept scrolling and scrolling and scrolling, and getting kind of depressed. Then I see a face, and I thought, ‘Whoa, I recognize that face.’”</p>



<p>She says she assumed Field was out of her league, but she wanted to start her own company and hoped he’d agree to meet to talk shop. He was the first and only person she messaged, asking him either to coffee or lunch, and dropping in a link to her LinkedIn profile. Field responded enthusiastically, but said that the LinkedIn link was a first for him on the dating site. Nadolinski laughs telling the story now: “I was privacy-conscious and my OKCupid account had almost no information. It had a picture, but you couldn’t tell it was me.” She’d posted only one image, a picture taken from far away. In it, she wears glasses, which she typically doesn’t. “It had my age and my height, because I thought that was important. I’m very short. And my Facebook wasn’t publicly accessible. So I wanted to show him that I’m a real person. The only way I thought of doing that was my LinkedIn profile. It was a very logical decision.”</p>



<p>He replied that lunches were hard, but he could do dinner. It’s not lost on Nadolinski that she had to design her own privacy-protecting solution for interacting authentically on a dating app. They’ve been together ever since. When Nadolinski talks about founding Iron Fish, she focuses on how the tech community, and the cryptocurrency community specifically, rewarded her curiosity and generosity with help and encouragement. Her appreciation for how that community has been uniquely accessible in spirit, even if not in technology, is what she’s built Iron Fish around. Now she’s poised to make the community she loves so much even larger, sharing it through greater accessibility—with most anyone with a computer, or two, and internet access. “A lot of people around the world are excited about blockchain. They’re excited to participate in a new layer 1 project,” Nadolinski says. And with her focus on pragmatic solutions and that user-friendliness, she’s excited to help them as a member of a community that has helped her so many times.&nbsp;</p>

Photo background by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske">Markus Spiske</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a><p>Data security is one the most pressing issues of modern times. In our digital society, companies continue to request personal user information in exchange for their services — without individuals fully comprehending what they’re agreeing to. What’s worse, these companies fail to secure this data from outside attacks, which have become all too&nbsp;common.</p><p>The current regulatory model is broken. It requires companies (large and small) to capture private information about individuals to “verify” them. This creates large honeypots of personal information in corporate data centres and creates a huge attack vector for&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Despite these challenges, we’re at a sliding-door moment in history. New technologies for the safe storage and sharing of personal data now exist. This is important as data growth on the internet isn’t slowing down. <a href="https://techjury.net/blog/big-data-statistics/#gref">In 2020, every person generated 1.7 megabytes per second</a>. Yet US <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/a-customer-centric-approach-to-marketing-in-a-privacy-first-world">Mckinsey research</a> suggests only around 33% of people believe companies are using their personal data responsibly.</p><p>With data hacks and leaks on the increase, it raises questions about the fundamental design decisions for securing personal data. Can alternate models that put the user first really offer stronger protections for individuals? I believe&nbsp;so.</p><p>Web3 aims to protect personal information as digital property rights through users owning and controlling their data. By putting data back in the originator’s hands it means there are fewer large repositories of data controlled by companies that can be hacked and leaked. By not having to hold that personal data, companies can also reduce their risk exposure.</p> Notable hacks and broken&nbsp;trust <p>The frightening list of hacks of personal data is <a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/">long</a>. Here are some of the largest leaks in recent&nbsp;years:</p><p>Facebook: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?r=US&amp;IR=T">533,000,000 users from 106 countries</a> had their phone numbers, full names, locations, birthday and in some cases emails leaked. This data is from a vulnerability that was patched in 2019 but the data was released publicly in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Microsoft: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2020/01/22/microsoft-security-shocker-as-250-million-customer-records-exposed-online/?sh=79a44d374d1b">250,000,000 users</a> worth of customer service and support logs spanning 14 years were found to be accessible through unprotected servers with public access. Containing IP addresses, emails, geographic locations, confidential case notes and case&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>LinkedIn: <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/linkedin-breach/">700,000,000 users’</a> phone numbers, physical addresses, geolocation data and inferred salaries were stolen in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>In the first half of 2022, Flashpoint <a href="https://flashpoint.io/resources/report/state-of-data-breach-intelligence-2022-midyear/">reported 1,980 data breaches</a>, 60% the result of hacking. And these are only the reported breaches. Common data leaks reveal email addresses, names, addresses, credit card numbers, health and financial information.</p>Source: <a href="https://flashpoint.io/resources/report/state-of-data-breach-intelligence-2022-midyear/">Flashpoint</a> (2022)<p>These are public companies with vast resources that can hire the best and brightest minds in security. It’s commonplace to store passwords as hashes for security but the rest of your data is plain text. So, why is the rest of user personal data, like phone numbers and postal addresses, stored less securely?</p><p><a href="https://www.lepide.com/research/2020-state-of-data-security-report.pdf">Lepide found in their 2020</a> global survey that 57% of companies have two or more open data shares and 77% have over 5,000 ‘stale’ sensitive files. Businesses struggle to know where their data resides, why it has been collected, who has access to it and how it is actually being used. Additional copies of data increases a company’s attack exposure, creating more data sources that can be exploited by&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>Why does personal user data have to exist in duplicate across different companies in centralised databases? Uploading your drivers licence to a company to be verified in exchange for services is an example of&nbsp;this.</p><p>We are “duplicating” our personal data for each of these companies. The duplication of these personal identifiers increases our individual risk if there’s a future leak. This is particularly a concern when we repeatedly see company failure to keep data safe, time and time again. These databases shouldn’t exist in the first place. Instead an individual should control their own data in their own database.</p><p>End-to-end encryption and personal data ownership and control can change&nbsp;this.</p><p>Individuals can own their personal information and share it “on demand” with companies who can verify, then delete, eliminating the huge systematic security risks created by current regulatory requirements.</p> No one cares about privacy until they need&nbsp;it <p>Before the internet, it was commonplace for people to print births, deaths and marriages in the paper. As old newspapers get digitised, it becomes possible for scammers to search for ‘your mothers maiden name’ and birthday. This is an example of an unintended consequence. It was impossible to predict the impact of printing a birth in the newspaper before the digital&nbsp;era.</p><p>Scientist, Carl Sagan, captured this sentiment:</p><p>“It was easy to predict mass car ownership but hard to predict Walmart.”</p><p>In much the same way, it’s impossible to predict the long-term consequences of troves of stolen personal data. It’s not a far stretch to imagine the worst-case scenarios as governments seek to streamline processes.</p><p>Take personal health data, for example. With a large enough pool of stolen health data, it would be possible to build risk assessment models with it. These models with their opaque algorithms are licensed by health insurers to deny cover to your childrens’ children because of risk factors in your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data security isn’t just an issue&nbsp;now.</p> Zero-party data management is a step&nbsp;forward <p>Many companies are shifting from legacy data collection methods through the use of third-party cookies and data acquisition with data brokers and assessing alternative options. This is being hastened by the <a href="https://www.deloittedigital.com/us/en/blog-list/2020/what-the-end-of-third-party-cookies-means-for-advertisers.html">phasing out of third-party cookies</a> which will affect brands and advertisers. Third-party cookies are now being blocked by default in web browsers. <a href="https://thecustomer.net/forrester-on-the-the-zero-party-data-revolution/">21% of users</a> in the US are searching with cookie-blocking add-ons to prevent cross-site tracking.</p><p>Users are waking up to being ‘the&nbsp;product’</p><p>This shift is prompting most companies to uplift their first-party data approaches. That is data collected directly from user in-app and website behaviours and not shared elsewhere. This data is still generally captured as a requirement for interacting with the&nbsp;company.</p><p>An approach that honours the user is adopting zero-party data strategies. Zero-party data is shared intentionally by a user with a company. Intentionally being the operative word. This could be their purchase preferences, likes or other personal data that they’re comfortable having the company recognise them by. This data can play a valuable role for companies in personalising its experience for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Zero-party data is the user consenting what they wish to share about themselves. It establishes a stronger trust relationship between the company and user, through transparency and data minimisation around value exchange. Zero-party data is higher quality data, compared to other forms of data, as it comes straight from the&nbsp;user.</p>Source: <a href="https://www.groupfio.com/getting-by-without-cookies-why-zero-party-data-is-the-future-for-digital-marketing/">FiO</a><p>Whilst zero-party data establishes principles for a stronger consent model for sharing personal information, that data still is typically stored with the company it’s shared&nbsp;with.</p><p>This brings us back to the problem and the solution — how data is stored. Web3 data models and personal data vaults truly give users privacy-preserving tools with strong consent workflows for how this information is shared and engaged&nbsp;with.</p> So, how do we achieve&nbsp;this? <p>If the top companies we interact with everyday are getting hacked, what does this mean for the rest of us? What’s the solution?</p><p>Shift data ownership and control to the user and encrypt&nbsp;it.</p><p>Encrypting personal data when it’s not in use makes it harder for hackers to get access to the human readable data. So the question then becomes, where should the encryption occur?</p><p>If the encryption happens on the server then the UX for the user is simple. The trade off is there’s no way for the user to know that it’s actually happening. It’s kind of like buying a car from a used car salesman who says: “Trust me, this is a great car. Just take my word for it. There’s no need for a vehicle inspection, it’s a total waste of money.” Would you just take them at their word? Or would you feel better if those claims could be verified? You’d need more than a stranger’s word.</p><p>If the encryption is done on the user’s device, the individual has control over their keys and can verify that their data is being encrypted. However, this means that the user is responsible for their key management. If they don’t take this seriously or fully understand it, they can get locked out of their accounts with no way to reset&nbsp;access.</p><p>End-to-end encryption enables private and secure data sharing for all. This is a key capability that should be built into data communications to ensure user privacy. Data is encrypted from sender to recipient, remains encrypted during transit and cannot be decrypted by anyone but the intended recipient. We’ve seen Zoom and Whatsapp recently implement this in their&nbsp;apps.</p><p>It’s possible for users to own their personal data, store it in a secured encrypted decentralised database network and consent to share it when seen appropriate.</p><p>This is a core primitive for Web3 that Verida has brought to market for user-controlled data storage solutions.</p> Secure data web3 storage for personal&nbsp;data <p>One of the challenges in today’s digital ecosystem is the lack of secure private data storage for user-owned personal data. This is one very critical component for data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>File storage networks in web3 are a growing sector. The top four protocols have a combined market cap of $2.4 billion (Filecoin, Arweave, Storj &amp; Sia) as of Oct 24th 2022. They remain unsuitable for the most sensitive personal information, which is generally structured in databases, as they are open public storage networks most suitable for blob storage like media, audio and video. By design they are not able to provide compliance required by regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI, and&nbsp;CCPA.</p><p>There have been attempts to store encrypted data on these protocols, but the encrypted data still remains public. It’s susceptible to (and highly likely) that improvements in technology will be capable of breaking the encryption, making everyone’s private information public for the world to&nbsp;see.</p><p>“Encrypted Data Vaults” are an emergent storage solution that help preserve data privacy and ensure trusted data access. They provide users with access to data storage they control with their own private keys, similarly to how users control private keys to access their crypto tokens. They can be managed by a user through a self-custody digital wallet and available in web browsers and on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p>Source: <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/concepts/data-storage">Verida Self-Sovereign Data Storage</a>&nbsp;(2021)<p>At Verida, we’ve implemented encrypted data vaults that store data on Verida<a href="https://github.com/verida/documentation/blob/feature/where-to-store-web3-data/docs/network/storage-node"> storage nodes</a>, which is open source software and can be self-hosted. The nodes provide end-to-end encrypted database storage. This means that the operator of the data node cannot read the data stored in the node they’re running. This data is synchronised in real-time with the Verida Vault for easy interaction with applications.</p><p>Access to the data on the storage nodes are protected with authentication and authorisation protocols that ensure access is tightly controlled, unlike existing public storage protocols. Users can move their data to different, private nodes, at any time. Data can be guaranteed to be stored in a particular country or region, to ensure compliance with “cross-border” data regulatory requirements common in most countries.</p><p>Users can choose what personal information they share with companies and revoke that access at any time. This brings forward a future web where users can safely control personal data, without duplication. It’s a&nbsp;win-win.</p> Managing personal data needs to be&nbsp;easy <p>MetaMask is one of the most popular crypto wallets. It had 545,000 monthly active users in July 2020, hit <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/metamask-users-defi-ethereum-decentralized-finance-consensys-crypto-2021-8">over 10M by August 2021</a> and was <a href="https://decrypt.co/86263/ethereum-wallet-metamask-reports-21-million-users">21M by November 2021</a>. Usage of crypto wallets is growing, their ease of use is improving. A growing number of people are taking control of crypto assets and becoming familiar with this new technology. We see this same trend extending beyond crypto to personal data,&nbsp;too.</p><p>In the future users will have a digital wallet on their phone, only accessible to them. This digital wallet holds and protects their private encrypted data. The user can grant outside access on an “as needs” basis, for trusted service providers to deliver personalized offerings. This enables end-to-end encrypted zero-party data sharing between users and companies.</p><p>Once given access, third parties can validate data, provide a digitally signed verification certificate, then delete it. This verification certificate can be shared with companies so a user no longer has to provide the actual data to any company to access the&nbsp;service.</p>Verida Vault: Data and Credentials<p>All personal data is portable and doesn’t have to be duplicated. Our digital wallets will become the home interface for our data, that is owned and managed by the user. This is what Verida is building with the <a href="https://www.verida.io/vault">Verida Vault</a> mobile application.</p> Building a safer future for personal&nbsp;data <p>Web3 brings a fundamental change to the ownership and control of user data. Sensitive personal data doesn’t have to stay concentrated in closed platforms and duplicated across different company databases where it’s at risk of security breaches.</p><p>User-owned data can be shared cryptographically with companies and applications when needed. New open data markets and associated business models can also form based around user consent and zero-party data.</p>Digital wallets are key to personal data&nbsp;control<p>Challenges with implementing these new web3 data models do exist. The problem of personal data duplication across corporate databases is partly driven by regulatory requirements to store and retain data. But regulation and data architectures are shifting. We are seeing innovation occurring <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/finnish-consortium-pilot-eidas-compliant-self-sovereign-identity-network-409161/">particularly in Europe</a> that are user-centric initiatives giving control of data back to&nbsp;users.</p><p>The unbundling of data ownership from applications in Web3 shifts personal data control from companies to individuals. This ultimately can reduce data security risks for companies, as they don’t need to store the data themselves.</p><p>Verida is building open source technologies that makes implementing data encryption and personal data storage solutions easier. The Verida open source libraries have a package for managing the user’s keys. Verida simplifies the process for developers to implement good encryption practices. Verida has built the Verida Vault to handle the key management for users in the Verida&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Verida is working closely with partners for ecosystem growth, health, and success.

<p>Ron Conway, a well-known American venture capitalist, once said ‘I think for technology and innovation we have to ignore politics.’</p>



<p>Technology is a clear driver for ingenuity and innovation. Politics, on the other hand, is where intrigue, personal agendas, and the pursuit of power by any means necessary conflate to create a turbulent sea of neverending strife. When the two cross over, results are not always good.</p>



<p>Technology has often been implicated in political scandals. In 1971, a Xerox machine became ground zero for the Pentagon Papers affair that would have grave repercussions for the Nixon Administration. (The scandal would, indirectly, contribute to Nixon’s resignation following Watergate.) In Russia, political technology is a euphemism for election rigging. And the 2016 US election was marred by allegations of foreign interference through social media platforms.</p>



<p>Besides, technological devices have also had a positive influence on politics. Data analytics enables political strategists to obtain more accurate information about voter behaviour. Through this, they can mount more effective political campaigns, for example.</p>



<p>Into the political stage now jump non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. This article explores the potential applications of digital tokens in the political ecosphere, focusing on fundraising and exclusive NFT-led events.</p>



 Fundraising in the age of blockchain 



<p>Fundraising is a vital tool for any political party intending to become a serious contender in any democratic election. But the political spectrum is, few would deny, a murky pond teeming with shady operatives. Such often resort to morally questionable tactics to gain the upper hand on their opponents. And running deep beneath this darkened surface is a layer of political donors and lobbyists who stake absurd amounts of wealth to push their agenda forward. The so-called dark money is the engine that moves the levers of power. Transparency and accountability are anathemas to all this.</p>



<p>The solution to this issue is complex. Often, those involved in such fundraising schemes have little desire for any solution to be found. Preserving the status quo -and the cash flow- tends to override any moral concerns.</p>



<p>In August 2021, NFTs found their way into the political arena when Scott Jensen, a Republican gubernatorial candidate for Minnesota, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/candidate-for-minnesota-governor-releases-campaign-nfts/">issued a series of NFTs to support its campaign</a>.</p>



<p>Jensen released two NFTS, with a run of 25,000 each, and a price tag of $5 per NFT. The proceedings would support his campaign for Governor. By purchasing these items, the buyer would also get access to extra perks, such as meeting Jensen in person.</p>



<p>Democrats are not far behind in the NFT race. Early in October, a group of fundraisers for the Democratic party launched a series of politically-themed NFTs through Front Row, an NFT marketplace. The NFTs themselves were digital representations of people from the Texas Democratic Party. Specifically, the group of more than 50 Democratic lawmakers who had fled the State of Texas in an attempt to block a vote restriction bill put forward by the Republican party. Each NFT was priced at $250. The buyer would be considered a ‘donor’ to the party, with the actual platform -Front Row- taking a fee.</p>



<p>Both in Jensen and the Texas examples, there would be a price limitation of $5,800 to conform to existing campaign financing laws. (Political action committees -PACs- and party committees are not subject to the same guidelines, and that’s where ‘dark money’ reigns supreme.)</p>



<p>The use of NFTs turns these partisan fundraising efforts into interesting experiments. While limited in scope, they certainly offer a glimpse into what might become part of future political campaigns, both in the United States and elsewhere.</p>



 NFT-only political events, and beyond 



<p>Grassroots movements are essential to foment democratic principles in the community. These organisations promote participation, engagement, and inclusiveness, and help drive voter turnout. Members meet regularly in church halls, conference rooms in hotels, and even in pubs, to discuss current matters, etc.</p>



<p>A proposed use case for NFT in the political ambit is the celebration of ‘NFT-only’ conferences and other events. These could only be attended by members of any chapter of local or national grassroots groups who hold a scannable NFT. The tokens could unlock perks for the holder, such as meeting a particular speaker (such as the Jenssen NFTs), digital goodies, merchandise, etc. At the time of writing, there is no known political event adhering to this NFT-led initiative. Hence the 2022 VeeCon event will only be open to those who own a VeeFriend NFT.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In the grand scheme of things, NFTs remain a relatively nascent technology. They have only become a thing in 2021, in the wake of the now infamous Beeple NFT sale. Throughout this year, we have seen NFTs enter the popular lexicon and more and more mainstream commercial ventures dipping their toes into this fascinating Pandora’s Box. In 2022, American retail giant Macy’s auctioned off a range of NFTs based on its iconic Thanksgiving Day parade balloons. Comic book publisher Marvel has released several rounds of comic book-themed NFTs. This alone represents a constellation of possibilities.</p>



<p>NFTs for the political stage remain in a ‘try-before-you-buy’ phase, so to speak. But even though the road ahead remains somewhat hazy, the foundations for a larger NFT sphere of influence have been laid in politics and elsewhere.</p>

         Partnering with Evy: Product Protection You Can Trust            <p>Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team are making product insurance plans effortless—for merchants and customers alike.</p>  <p>By Stephanie Zhan and George Robson</p><p>Published October 25, 2022</p>       



     
	 
		
			 
 
    



 
 
   
<p>You replace your old cell phone with the latest and greatest model—and it falls on the floor and cracks. Or you buy a beautiful new couch—and spill red wine all over it. We’ve all experienced the frustration of seeing a purchase turn into a headache. The more you spent, the more anxiety-inducing those moments can be—even if the seller is down the street, and certainly if they’re half a world away. If you did spring for insurance to replace that dropped phone or wine-stained sofa, it might take hours to dig through old emails for your policy information and navigate the claims process, only to learn the fine print says you aren’t covered.</p>



<p>And in Europe, you likely don’t have a policy at all. Today, only a fourth of top online sellers offer product protection, and offline retailers have plans that could be vastly improved. Consumers are left on their own, and sellers forgo valuable opportunities to increase their sales and customer loyalty.</p>



<p>But now, Evy co-founders Simon Kemoun, Shana Azria and Tanguy Le Stradic are changing all that. Built from the ground up, their platform offers a simple set of APIs merchants can integrate to offer product insurance, allowing them to price customizable protection plans by category and deliver tailored coverage at lower deductibles. What’s more, Evy can handle the claims—often instantly. Sellers get a turnkey solution that helps their business grow, while customers get transparent policies, stress-free customer service and best of all, peace of mind.</p>



<p>When our friends at La Famiglia introduced us to Simon, Shana and Tanguy last year, Evy was just the three of them, and no product. But they did have complementary backgrounds (Simon previously founded a consumer social app and is a former McKinsey consultant; Shana was a senior engineer at Apple; Tanguy hails from rising-star French neobank Qonto) that combined to give them outsider insight on this space, and they had conviction in their technology-first approach. We were proud to lead their seed round earlier this year.</p>



<p>Fast-forward nine months later, and Evy has now grown into a talented and hard-working team of 10 and counting, offers insurance plans across multiple product categories with partnerships rolling out in phones, other electronic appliances, furniture, and more, and is already expanding beyond their roots in France into several other European countries. This week, as we celebrate their new pan-European partnership with e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.manomano.co.uk/">ManoMano</a>, we are as excited as ever about what the future holds for Simon, Shana, Tanguy and their team—and ultimately, for shoppers everywhere. With each expansion into a new product insurance category, Evy is taking another step toward a world where we can all get what we need, worry-free.</p>



<p>Evy is hiring now! If you’re interested in joining the team, please <a href="https://getevy.notion.site/Careers-at-Evy-239e76fd976e4b87960b6b4a45777473">reach out</a>.</p>

 Introduction <p>After the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">Merge</a>’s success, the Ethereum network transitioned from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model into a Proof of Stake (PoS) one, making it a less energy-intensive blockchain. However, amid the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/09/17/3-must-know-benefits-of-the-ethereum-merge/">numerous positives</a> that the merge appears to have yielded, a <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/04/21/ethereum-merge-threat-lido-finance-proof-of-stake-dominant-defi-platform/">threat of centralization</a> is beginning to rear its ugly head. Thankfully, the Distributed Validator technology can address most of the problems that are associated to this danger.<br></p><p>The task of validating the blockchain has fallen to staking clients instead of miners. Under PoS, the job of a validator is to confirm or propose to add a new block to the blockchain. If the validator's attestation or proposal is timely and accurate, they receive a small reward in ETH. <br></p><p>In theory, anyone can set up a validator node, stake the required amount of ETH, and participate in the network. Yet, several intending validators are instead going through <a href="https://v1.stake.fish/en/ethereum/services/">staking services</a>, with all their <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">risks</a>. But why?<br></p><p>In this article, we’ll look at the current issues (spoiler: centralization) for validators and stakers on Ethereum PoS and how those problems can be solved with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT).</p> Issues with the Ethereum PoS model<br> <p>There is a range of risks for validators and stakers alike when it comes to the Ethereum PoS model. Let’s have a look at each of these issues.</p> Centralization <p>When it comes to retail users, especially those holding small amounts of ETH (Ethereum PoS requires 32 ETH to run a validator), it becomes a complicated procedure for them to set up a validator or maintain it. Hence, it’s very likely that these network participants are inclined towards staking their ETH via staking services. <br></p><p>Since most crypto users hold their funds on custodial platforms such as centralized exchanges, they’re likely to also use a custodial staking service to stake their ETH. Even though custodial staking services promise ease of use and convenience, there are several risks associated with using them, the chief of which is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-11/biggest-ether-staking-service-has-a-centralization-problem">centralization</a>. A central authority is not exactly good news in a global monetary network, and the idea of handing over your keys to an operator who is not immune to slashing penalties, errors, hacks, or even censorship can be devastating for the whole ecosystem. <br></p>The total value of ETH staked by some of the most important actors and platforms suggests a growing centralization problem. (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/centralization-risks-and-flaws-of-ethereum-merge">Source</a>) Single points of failure <p>When a user runs a solo validator, the custody of a validator's private keys is a crucial matter. If a validator losses access to their private keys, they could lose access to their funds. This represents a difficult user experience and constitutes a single-point-of-failure risk. The Ethereum PoS protocol doesn’t make it easier either, as its rules prohibit redundancies of any kind. Thus, a validator can only sign messages or remain online via a <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">single machine</a>. <br></p>The process of becoming a validator on Ethereum PoS. (<a href="https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/my-journey-to-becoming-a-validator-on-ethereum-2-0/">Source</a>)<p>If an attacker breaks into a validator’s machine and gains access to the private key, their activities can cause the affected validator to suffer a slashing of their stake. When a stake is slashed, a portion of the validator’s locked funds is deducted by the protocol. Ultimately, this leads to a loss of funds, revealing the massive vulnerabilities of a single point of failure.</p> Validator liveness check <p>Suppose a validator client fails to sign messages for any reason, ranging from breaks in the network connection or cloud failures to software crashes or hardware issues. In that case, they suffer penalties due to inactivity. They will lose a portion of their staked balances. <br></p><p>Penalties due to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/discover/solutions/double-signing-protection">double-signing</a> can also arise, especially if a validator suddenly goes offline while signing a message. Thus, validator clients risk deposit slashing if they sign multiple instances with the same key, sign the same message twice, or go offline when others are offline. This favors professional validators and discourages the average user with the resources to become one from being a validator, therefore leading to a few validators retaining most of the power.</p> Private key custody <p>There’s a well-known saying in the crypto ecosystem, “Not your keys, not your coins.” If you don’t have custody of your private keys, you’re always at the mercy a of custodial service for the safety of your funds. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/">Staking services</a> offer a way out for participants who do not want to face the risks of dealing with a solo validator setup and maintenance directly, but there's a catch. Stakers using these services have to hand over their private keys to the service in a setting that requires them to trust the staking service operator fully. They must trust the operator for the security of their staking private key.<br></p><p>With staking services, key ownership can be a tricky topic. A sense of security comes with having control over your private keys as a solo validator. Using a staking service will require you to give up that sense of security, trusting someone else to do it for you. For systems where anything can go wrong and malicious actors lurk under the guise of honesty, it is not advisable to trust someone else with the custody of your keys.</p> Forking penalties <p>Under the PoS regime, validator clients connect to Beacon nodes. In the unlikely event that a Beacon node to which a validator is connected <a href="https://www.bsc.news/post/ethereum-bug-leads-to-node-failure-and-a-subsequent-fork-in-the-network">develops a fault</a>, a fork will be created. If the validator client is affected by this anomaly, it will follow the forked chain and appear offline to the main PoS protocol, resulting in penalties.<br></p><p>—-------------------------------<br></p><p>Centralization is sufficient to defeat the purpose of a permissionless and transparent blockchain, but the threats to security and loss of deposits due to penalties are enough to discourage anyone from participating. These issues have created the need for the development of Distributed Validator Technology. Let’s understand what is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) and how it aims to solve the issues mentioned above.</p> What is Distributed Validator Technology (DVT)? <p>Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) is a decentralized open-source protocol that allows the duties of a validator to be distributed among multiple nodes, as opposed to a single machine, leveraging threshold cryptography. DVT provides a decentralized staking layer on Ethereum, allowing anyone to create and share a validator over multiple <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/fault-tolerance">fault-tolerant </a>machines such that, if any one node is offline or faulty, the validator can continue to perform its duties. The fault-tolerance of a system simply refers to the system’s ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.<br></p><p>In essence, DVT adds an additional layer of fault-tolerance for Ethereum validators removing the possibility of redundancies such as a single point of failure, centralization issues, etc.<br></p>A graphical overview of Distributed Validator Technology (earlier known as SSV). (<a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/eth2-secret-shared-validators-85824df8cbc0">Source</a>)<p>Distributed Validator Technology is a blend of distributed key generation, multi-party computation, Shamir's secret sharing, and Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms that permit validator duties to be split across several nodes without violating the staking rules of Ethereum. We’ll understand these algorithms and what role they play in DVT in the below sections.<br></p><p>In case you’re interested, here’s a video explainer of DVT by Aditya Asgankar from the Ethereum Foundation:</p><p>Distributed Validator Technology not only shares a single validator's duties across several machines but also “distributes” its private keys. Remember, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/ethereum-competitors-advantages-and-disadvantages/">Ethereum</a> requires a validator to create or sign messages with its private keys on a single computer. By distributing shares of the private key among multiple nodes and utilizing a distributed key generation scheme, DVT eliminates the single point of failure, as we will see below.<br></p><p>DVT emerged as an idea proposed by the Ethereum Foundation in 2019 in preparation for Ethereum's transition to PoS. Ethereum validators operate with an Active-Passive setup in which backup nodes remain offline. When the active node goes offline, downtimes occur before the backup node can come online, as there are no automatic switches. With DVT, validators can now enjoy an <a href="https://kemptechnologies.com/white-papers/unfog-confusion-active-passive-activeactive-load-balancing">Active-Active arrangement</a>, operating like a multi-signature setup and eliminating single points of failure.</p> How does Distributed Validator Technology work? <p>As mentioned, Distributed Validator Technology combines distributed key generation, Shamir's secret sharing, multi-party computation, and Istanbul's Byzantine Fault Tolerance. You can look at DVT as a multi-signature scheme, but instead of confirming <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/bitcoin-tumblers-privacy-coins-and-prifi-private-crypto/">transactions</a>, it is used to perform consensus-required validator duties on the blockchain.<br></p>A working overview of steps involved in the DVT consensus mechanism. (<a href="https://rattibha.com/thread/1530589456872271872">Source</a>) The Distributed Validator Technology pillar: Distributed key generation <p>The first and one of the core components of DVT is a <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-distributed-key-generation-is-866adc79620">distributed key generation</a> (DKG) scheme. DKGs involve multiple parties contributing to calculating and sharing a private key such that no single group member has full control over the secret key. The private key is encrypted and split among all participants.<br></p><p>Usually, these nodes qualify as non-<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusting</a>, meaning their operators do not need to know one another, creating sufficient room for fault tolerance. DKG makes way for the <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold signing</a> scheme.</p> Shamir's secret sharing and threshold signing <p>Next, <a href="https://medium.com/@keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">Shamir's secret sharing</a> allows the private key to be split such that each participating validator client holds only a piece of the puzzle, and no individual share is sufficient to sign messages. Instead of requiring every participant to be available to reform the secret or sign messages, Shamir's secret sharing employs a threshold, usually predefined, giving room for the validator client to remain online even if there is a faulty or malicious member.<br></p><p>For an example, say we have four operators contributing to a DVT setup, and the threshold for signing messages is 3 out of 4. If one computer goes offline or is not trustworthy, three nodes remain active and can sign messages. With the private key split among four nodes, there is no single point of failure.<br></p><p>Note that Ethereum PoS uses <a href="https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/building_blocks/signatures/">BLS signatures</a>, which allow for aggregation, meaning that it recognizes multiple signatures with the same key and can combine these transactions into one. So, when all participants sign a transaction, the BLS signature system combines all signatures without requiring a complete reconstruction of the private key.</p> Multi-party computation <p>Secure <a href="https://web3wednesdays.xyz/multi-party-computation/">multi-party computation</a> plays a critical role in Distributed Validator Technology. Through MPC, contributing operators can use their secret shares in signing messages and performing computation without reconstructing the secret on any single device. With MPC, the threat of centralizing the private key during computation is eliminated, and the decentralized nature of the distributed validator setup remains intact.</p> Consensus <p>The final piece in the puzzle is a consensus algorithm among Beacon nodes that can achieve fault tolerance through threshold signing schemes. Consensus is achieved among the Beacon nodes to which ETH validators are connected. Beacon nodes are responsible for assigning duties to validator clients.<br></p><p>Using <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/threshold-cryptography-an-overview/">threshold cryptography</a>, a private key is encrypted and split amongst Beacon operator nodes. A threshold number (3 out of 4, 5 out of 7, etc.) is required for any commands to be issued to a validator client. This way, no single Beacon node operator would have unfettered power over a validator.<br></p><p>To reach a consensus over a block in a DVT setup, the <a href="https://media.consensys.net/scaling-consensus-for-enterprise-explaining-the-ibft-algorithm-ba86182ea668">Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a> algorithm singles out one Beacon node in the DVT setup as the leader who will propose the block and share it with fellow Beacon nodes. If more than 66% of the Beacon nodes agree that the block is valid, it is added to the blockchain.<br></p><p>If the leader goes offline or is compromised in a DVT setting, the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm will reassign the role to another DVT Beacon node within twelve seconds.</p> Use cases of Distributed Validator Technology <p>Since its proposal in 2019, DVT has been successfully developed by two leading actors: <a href="https://ssv.network/tech/">Secret Shared Validator Technology</a> and the <a href="https://obol.tech/">Obol Network</a>. While these are direct projects spun out with DVT as their core, here are the major possible applications of Distributed Validator Technology:</p> The use of Distributed Validator Technology on Decentralized staking pools <p>Most staking pools today are custodial and have single points of failure, relying on a single validator node with a single key., Added to the threat of a single point of failure is the challenge of experiencing slashing and penalties across the board.<br></p><p>Using a <a href="https://docs.obol.tech/docs/dv/validator-creation">distributed validator setup</a>, staking pools can switch to a decentralized model, reduce penalties and slashing by ensuring minimal downtimes and diversify their current offerings.</p> Staking infrastructure providers <p>To understand how staking infrastructure providers can leverage DVT to offer more robust services, we first need to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.jscape.com/blog/active-active-vs-active-passive-high-availability-cluster">Active-Active and Active-Passive</a> configurations.<br></p><p>When it comes to cloud infrastructure, there are essentially two options on how to configure connections – Active-Active &amp; Active-Passive. In an Active-Active configuration, traffic is load-shared between interfaces based on flow. If one connection becomes unavailable, then all traffic is routed through the other connection. In an Active-Passive configuration, one connection handles traffic, while the other is on standby.<br></p><p>Companies that provide infrastructure to meet individual or institutional staking need solutions towards redundancies of cloud providers with Active-Passive configurations. With DVT setups, infrastructure providers can enable Active-Active cluster redundancies and encourage dynamism in deployments and configurations.</p> Solo validator setups <p>Solo validators that were previously discouraged by high barriers of entry and the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/64-of-staked-eth-controlled-by-five-entities-nansen">risks</a> associated with <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/crypto-staking-misconceptions-benefits-risks-and-taxation/">ETH staking</a> can now participate using a DVT configuration. <br></p><p>With a distributed validator setup, in-house validators can distribute their signing power across multiple nodes in an Active-Active cluster redundancy arrangement. Thus, they minimize the risk of failure and penalties due to downtime, double-signing, etc.</p> In summary, Distributed Validator Technology can be a game-changer <p>Distributed Validator Technology addresses the many challenges of ETH staking and lowers the entry barrier for the average person while encouraging true <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">decentralization</a> on Ethereum. With DVT, institutional or retail validators can meet the protocol’s requirements of safety or liveness, or even both, increase resilience, enjoy Active-Active redundancy configurations, and diversify their operations based on several factors.<br></p><p>As Ethereum now operates fully as a proof-of-stake blockchain, its validators will continue to lean towards more secure and practical configurations for their operations. DVT presents an opportunity for staking on Ethereum to become more decentralized and profitable, even for retail participants. Currently, Obol Network is leading the charge in building an ecosystem for trust-minimized staking that enables people to create, test, run &amp; coordinate distributed validators.

     Q3 was an amazing quarter full of growth and exciting new milestones, including the first-ever Horizen ecosystem summit and the first meme coin on TokenMint!&nbsp; 
<p>We are amazed to see the amount of growth we have experienced in a single quarter. We launched several new products and upgrades, grew the team, welcomed a new meme coin to the ecosystem using our new products and more! We are excited to continue meeting new milestones with our growing community.&nbsp;</p>
 Q3 Highlights 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_numbers-2.jpg"></a></p>
 Product and Engineering&nbsp; 
<p>The engineering and product teams focused on releasing upgrades to existing products like TokenMint and Cobalt this quarter to enable a wider variety of use cases on the Horizen ecosystem. This included Cobalt upgrades and <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-user-guide-2/">documentation on how to use</a> it in preparation for additional functionality like NFTs on Tokenmint!</p>
 TokenMint 
<p>TokenMint Mainnet Launch</p>
<p>Our no-code tokenization platform, <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/tokenmint-is-live-on-mainnet/">TokenMint</a>, was launched on mainnet in Q3! The platform provides a streamlined process for anybody to launch their own token easily and quickly without having a technical background. An introduction of TokenMint with a user guide was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-create-and-launch-a-cryptocurrency-token-with-tokenmint">featured on Cointelegraph</a>. The leading technology media Venture Beat also featured a story on TokenMint where the author covered the importance of tokenization and the value of platforms such as TokenMint in the effort of making blockchain technology more accessible for the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Punkz Token Launch&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform has already been used to launch the first meme token on the Horizen ecosystem called Punkz Token! The token also has it’s own game called <a href="https://pipeflare.io/all-games">Punkz Hero</a>, launched with our partner PipeFlare! Be sure to check it out and get Punkz for playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team has started to add additional features to TokenMint as well. This includes NFTs! While the functionality is currently available on testnet. The team is working towards the mainnet launch, which is coming soon! This will enable people to create their own NFTs utilizing TokenMint and store them on our Cobalt browser wallet. This was an important step for our project because it is one of the many functionalities requested by our community. We were excited to deliver a product many members wanted to see! If you want to try launching your own NFT on TokenMint, head to the home page now, select the NFT tab and check out the guide on loading<a href="https://blog.horizen.io/how-to-load-nft-data-into-an-ipfs-repository/"> NFT data to IPFS.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NFT-zencon0_D1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Thanks to the new NFT functionality on TokenMint’s testnet we launched the first NFT series in time for ZenCon0! The series, called <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/zero-gravity-coming-to-tokenmint-an-exclusive-nft-for-zencon0/">Zero Gravity</a>, was issued to all event attendees as a special surprise for those who joined us.</p>
<p>The NFT functionality was also added to <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/cobalt-wallet-ver-1-4-0/">Cobalt wallet version 1.4.0</a>! This version also added ZEN transactions between Cobalt wallet addresses to further extend the usability of our web wallet for our users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the engineering team has been making great progress on the <a href="https://www.horizen.io/blockchain-academy/technology/advanced/evm-ethereum-virtual-machine/">EVM</a> sidechain. The <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/why-evm-compatibility-matters/">EVM sidechain will open our ecosystem</a> up to existing blockchain developers and projects because Ethereum has the largest and most diverse public blockchain ecosystem. This means that EVM compatibility is one of the key ingredients for blockchains like ours to build a successful ecosystem. The team is currently working on the circuit to ensure that our EVM is as secure as possible and is expecting a launch date in early Q1 2023!</p>
<p>There are many benefits to EVM compatibility including existing Ethereum-based defi infrastructure. There are well-established Ethereum smart contracts for an wide range of blockchain-based products, such as automated market makers, decentralized exchanges, peer-to-peer lending protocols, stablecoins, and more. All of which the team is working on or working with new and existing partners to bring to the ecosystem soon!</p>
<p>We also released <a href="https://blog.horizen.io/download-the-mandatory-zen-3-2-0-software-upgrade-today/">ZEN 3.2.0</a>! This mandatory upgrade is the first step to&nbsp; preparing our exchange partners, mining pool operators, and full node users for upcoming ecosystem expansion and included upgrades like:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Upgrading integration test suite to Python 3 
 Updates to build system, compatibility with newer versions of Linux 
 Fix IsInitialBlockDownload false positive error message 
 
<p>The final date to upgrade without disruption is approximately October 21st! So be sure to upgrade soon if you haven’t already!</p>
 Community Growth&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_community.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The community has continued to grow steadily this quarter with the largest growth being seen on LinkedIn. Its exciting to see all of our new community members coming together to share their thoughts on what the ecosystem should look like and actively engaging with the team to provide feedback. We look forward to learning more about our newest community members as we continue to expand what Horizen is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This growth has continued to be seen across not only our community, but the web traffic for Horizen as well. We saw a 13% increase in <a href="https://heap.horizen.io/">HEAP</a> organic impressions, which suggests that a portion of our new community is developer-centric. Another exciting growth number we saw was the Horizen Academy content topic growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.horizen.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ZBF_2022-Q3-review_OCT22_webtraffic.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Our marketing team is in the process of launching a new Horizen Academy! The academy will include content that expands existing articles and educational resources about upcoming products and ecosystem expansion.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce that we have recently tagged our first release candidate of Zebra (<a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.0">zebra 1.0.0-rc.0</a>), the alternative Zcash node implementation written in Rust. This is the first time that there has been an alternative zcash node implementation running on mainnet and that we are excited to see some Zebra nodes now appearing on the <a href="https://blockchair.com/zcash/nodes">Blockchair node explorer</a>!</p><p>We are very happy to share that Zebra also supports the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra#configuring-json-rpc-for-lightwalletd">lightwalletd backend JSON-RPCs</a>, can be used as a lightwalletd backend and is <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/zebra-powered-lightwalletd-with-zecwallet-lite/42868">currently an optional backend for ZecwalletLite</a>!</p><p>With this release we have solved the last few outstanding bugs and issues that could have affected the security, performance and stability of the Zcash network and are confident that long-lived Zebra nodes can be run on mainnet. As such, we are looking forward to Zebra experiencing more “production use”, and we will be shortly be engaging security auditors to conduct an audit of the Zebra code to ensure that users can be confident in its security and stability.&nbsp;</p><p>This release of Zebra can be used to join the Zcash peer-to-peer network, which helps to keep Zcash working by validating and broadcasting transactions, and maintaining the Zcash blockchain state in a distributed manner. Zebra’s network stack is interoperable with zcashd, and Zebra implements all the features required to reach Zcash network consensus. Zebra validates all of the <a href="https://zips.z.cash/protocol/protocol.pdf">Zcash consensus rules</a>.</p><p>So please spin up some instances and let us know what you think!</p>

<blockquote>TL;DR: Introducing a new framework for Sismo governance: Sismo Contributor ZK badge holders get voting power according to their contribution. First use case: the community will curate which badges can be deployed on the main curated environment.</blockquote><p>Sismo has now been live for a few months and the list of <a href="https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/what-are-zk-badges">ZK Badges</a> on the <a href="https://playground.sismo.io/">playground</a> has started to grow since the release of our <a href="https://factory.sismo.io/">Factory</a> — where non developers can create ZK Badges for their users in 5&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>The <a href="http://playground.sismo.io">playground</a> is a permissionless environment where anyone can create their own ZK Badges. Only the best Badges from the playground environment make it to the main <a href="http://app.sismo.io">Sismo curated environment</a>.</p><p>Today we are opening the curation process to the Sismo community through an open governance system, based on contributions.</p><p>We will of course dog-food our own protocol and ZK Badges to track contributions&nbsp;:)</p> Community-based Badge&nbsp;Curation <p>The Sismo <a href="https://playground.sismo.io/">Playground</a> environment is an open sandbox for anyone to create, test and imagine new ways to benefit from Sismo’s protocol privacy-preserving attestation system. This openness means that a lot of different types of badges are created and that some of the highest quality ones are drowned in a mass of other badges that could be deemed low-quality or less aligned with Sismo’s&nbsp;vision.</p><p>On the other side, the Sismo <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Curated</a> environment core value is to provide a more curated experience for users and applications looking for carefully selected ZK Badges that they can trust. The objective is for the Sismo community to progressively take charge of vetting which ZK Badge will be able to be migrated to the Curated environment from the Playground environment.</p>ZK Badges in Sismo’s Curated environment<p>To help in this endeavour, a set of <a href="https://www.notion.so/Badge-Curation-Guidelines-a62b5d7205734b44b41c603bf1516f4c">Badge Curation Guidelines</a> have been proposed to the community to support them in their decision process. It has the aim to ensure that the Sismo Curated environment only hosts ZK Badges that have been proven to hold a sufficient level of quality, transparency, fairness, and alignment to Sismo’s manifesto.</p> The need for a new governance model  Straightforward token voting is&nbsp;flawed <p>The issues with solely coin-driven governance are&nbsp;known:</p>  It empowers token holders and their interests more than the other type of stakeholders in a project community.  It is susceptible to governance attacks through vote buying or borrowing.  It gives oversized power to wealthy participants compared to small holders and these “whales” can often have conflicting interests in other&nbsp;projects   Lack of private&nbsp;voting <p>The lack of privacy in the current voting system opens the way to bribing or intimidation attacks against specific actors and can prevent some stakeholders from expressing their honest opinions.</p> Exploring the potential of Proof of Contribution <p>An additional metric that should be taken into account in governance systems is the amount of value each voter brought to the system. It seems natural to give more power in the governance to those who contributed the most to the underlying project.</p> Proof of Contribution  Verifying the fact that an account corresponds to a person that has used a protocol, passed some educational training, funded an initiative, contributed to building a system, or performed some useful work in the project ecosystem. Useful participation rewarded with improved governance power is less dystopian than a social credit system because you have a say in the criteria&nbsp;used. Sismo ZK Badges as membership &amp; weighted voting credentials <p>Sismo ZK Badges provide a valuable set of attributes for contribution-based governance models:</p>  They are tokenized attestations of history/activity/reputation packaged as a standard ERC-1155 NFT a.k.a Soulbound Tokens&nbsp;(SBTs)  They preserve the privacy of their owners. They can be minted on a new address that is not linked to the addresses that fulfilled the requirements to get the badge.&nbsp;(<a href="https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/what-are-zk-badges">more</a>)  (Soon) They will allow users to aggregate their reputation by gathering their badges on a single or several pseudonymized address(es) in the&nbsp;future.  They are non-transferable.  <p>This last property allows ZK badges to be less concentrated (no sale/transfer to the rich) and to remain owned by active participants. The non-transferability of badges also limits trustless vote-buying in the sense that any vote-buying will require the seller to hand over his private&nbsp;keys.</p> A new framework for Sismo Governance <p>Check out the new governance process at <a href="https://governance.sismo.io">https://governance.sismo.io</a></p> “Sismo Contributor” badge as core voting power denominator <p>The core voting power denominator is represented by the <a href="https://app.sismo.io/sismo-contributor">“Sismo Contributor” ZK badge</a> (on Polygon mainnet).</p><p>The “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge can be minted by different types of contributors from the Sismo community (check <a href="https://sismo.notion.site/Governance-Overview-5224949448d64bdb81f3d70b3b4cc5f0">Governance Overview</a> for details) and is comprised of 3 tiers assigned according to the significance of the minter contribution:</p><p>Tier 1 contributors (Users): 1 voting point per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Tier 2 contributors (Community Members): 50 voting points per the&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Tier 3 contributors (Builders): 500 voting points per&nbsp;proposal</p><p>Anyone having minted at least one badge on <a href="https://app.sismo.io/">Sismo Curated App</a> (not the playground) is at least eligible for Tier 1. Community member can easily get to Tier 2 by attending a Sismo event or minting a “Proof of Humanity” ZK Badge, and to Tier 3 by contributing actively to Sismo’s ecosystem initiatives or open source development.</p><p>The voting power assignment to the “Sismo Contributor” ZK badge, the badge group generation rules, and the tier allocation are all susceptible to being modified through governance in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>This badge will attest that its minter has already interacted at least once with Sismo protocol, community, or ecosystem and will act as a first basic Sybil resistance lever.</p> Conclusion <p>The early stages of Sismo Governance are a perfect time to experiment with alternative governance models that could prove themselves to be valuable. Because it uses Sismo protocol at its heart, this experiment can be reused as a template and improved on by other communities, incentivizing more usage of Sismo ZK&nbsp;Badges.</p><p>Get involved:</p>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sismo">Discord</a>  <p>Read about our current governance process:</p>  <a href="http://governance.sismo.io">governance.sismo.io</a>   Reference   Moving beyond coin voting governance -<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html">https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html</a>

 Verida Q3 2022 Quarterly Update Verida Q3 2022&nbsp;Update<p>The past few months have again been busy for the Verida team and our protocol development. Work has continued on the development of the Verida Vault with the Android release now available, NEAR integration complete and Wallet Connect support implemented. The Verida Acacia testnet which will shortly become fully decentralized too. Despite a volatile market environment, our community remains engaged and new partners continue to join the network as we work to provide user owned data identity solutions for&nbsp;all.</p> Engineering  Verida Vault <p>Web3 apps need to offer the standard of UX that people are used to today. Verida has worked with Excited, a product design agency based in the Ukraine since 2019 for the design of the Verida website and Verida Vault mobile application. Last month, we were thrilled to announce that the Verida Vault was awarded the coveted <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-vault-designers-win-prestigious-red-dot-award-48deb4336813">Red Dot Award</a> for its interface design.</p>The Verida&nbsp;Vault<p>The Verida Vault mobile app acts as both a “data wallet” and “crypto wallet” for end users. It provides private key management and a user-friendly interface with the Verida network and supported blockchains.</p><p>We shipped the Android release of the Verida Vault in August and it is now available in<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault"> Android Play Store</a>. This broadens Vault availability beyond iOS which can be found in the<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632"> Apple AppStore</a>. Both are in developer preview. APIs are stable except where noted in our<a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/intro"> documentation</a>.</p><p>We welcome developers to come build user-centric, decentralized apps with the vast capabilities of the Verida Vault, including identity, user data, messaging, profiles, Single-Sign-On (SSO), rewards, tokens, and transactions. Learn more about the Vault in our release article&nbsp;<a href="https://news.verida.io/the-verida-vault-is-now-available-in-developer-preview-on-ios-and-android-70d0acdce3dc">here</a>.</p> Product <p>NEAR is now supported in the Verida Vault (testnet only). This includes the ability to store your NEAR tokens, send and receive and make crypto transactions.</p><p>WalletConnect is now supported on Ethereum (Wallet Connect v1), Algorand (Wallet Connect v1) and NEAR (Wallet Connect v2) via the <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect SDK</a>. dApps supporting WalletConnect can pass the connection details while connecting with Verida, providing their users with a unified Connect experience, i.e. a single QR-code to scan to connect both Verida and Wallet&nbsp;Connect.</p><p>The Verida Vault crypto wallet import feature has now been extended to provide more flexibility for users. In addition to importing an existing Verida multichain wallet, users can now import accounts for individual blockchains (e.g. Ethereum).</p> Protocol <p>A key focus for the engineering team has been working towards the Acacia Testnet protocol release that will be rolling out from November 2022&nbsp;onwards.</p><p>Smart contract development:</p>  We have open sourced the <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts">protocol smart contracts</a> currently under development.  Significant engineering effort has gone towards our <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a> that will be launched shortly on Testnet. This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/ethr-did-registry">ethr-did-registry</a> with extensions that support “per application” based service endpoints, a built-in “proof” mechanism that unlocks the ability to create a generic “data bridge” to prove verified off-chain data on any Verida supported blockchain.  The <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-Name-Registry">Verida Name Registry</a> has been developed, tested and is ready for deployment. This enables Verida accounts to have human friendly names as aliases for their&nbsp;DID’s.  Work has commenced on development work for our future token reward&nbsp;systems.  <p>Verida SDK development:</p>  A major refactor of the Verida SDK has been completed that integrates with the new, <a href="https://github.com/verida/blockchain-contracts/tree/develop/VDA-DID-Registry">Decentralized DID Registry</a>.  Enhancements to the Verida DbStore provide more access controls, an enhanced authorization token based security model and the ability to enforce remote deletion of databases.  <a href="https://developers.verida.io/docs/single-sign-on-sdk">Verida Connect</a> upgrades adding support for the new token based authorization model and remote device access revocation.   Marketing &amp; Community  Community Rewards&nbsp;Program <p>In September we launched our first <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-launches-community-rewards-program-with-crew3-8ae84153f160">community rewards program with crew3</a>. Through crew3, we are rewarding and recognizing all the hard work of our community through exclusive Discord roles and future Verida Reward Tokens. We had over 130 members of the community participate in the first sprint, with many more <a href="https://news.verida.io/october-sprint-of-the-verida-rewards-program-is-here-c1c42763cb9c">participating in the October sprint</a>. We are thrilled to welcome so many new members to our community of Veridians.</p>Verida Crew3&nbsp;Rewards Australia (Crypto Convention) <p>Verida had a booth at the inaugural Australian Crypto Convention in the Gold Coast, Australia. It was incredible to see over 3000 people attending over the weekend, demonstrating the strength of the crypto and web3 community in Australia. The team spoke to hundreds of attendees and projects interested in web3 and private&nbsp;data.</p>The Verida team all set up at Australian Crypto Convention<p>We were delighted to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/KenjenSlade">Shane</a> from the Crypto Bureau. With a background in high school education, Shane is providing much needed crypto and web3 education to everyday Australians.

It’s clear there is a huge growth of projects and innovation happening across India with one of the fastest crypto adoption levels in the&nbsp;world.</p>Verida at Decrypt&nbsp;India Singapore (Asia Crypto&nbsp;Week)​​ <p>The Verida team participated in Singapore for Asia Crypto Week attending over 16 events, including Web3 Connect, Algorand Greenhouse, FileDrive, Token2049 and After2049. The team featured on two panels and made a huge number of exciting new project connections.</p> What’s next <p>We have an exciting end of 2022 planned that will continue to push Verida to the forefront of self sovereign identity, data storage and interoperability.

<p>We’re excited to announce that we’ve expanded support for Brave Translate—our tool to translate websites privately and securely—and that we’ve added 93 languages, going from 15 supported languages to 108! New languages include Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic—<a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/8963107404813-How-do-I-use-Brave-Translate-">check out the full list</a>. Brave Translate is currently available for desktop and Android (v1.45), with iOS support coming in a future update.</p>
<p>Chromium’s native translation service caches user translation requests, passing that data along to Google’s API. Brave Translate, however, is privacy-preserving and enables users to privately translate websites in over 100 languages, without exposing browsing activity. Brave uses a self-hosted server and the Lingvanex translation engine to power translations, which means no caching, and no feeding your translation requests to privacy-threatening models.</p>

<p>Written by Anirudha Bose</p>
<p>Signing DApp transactions for EVM chains is a security nightmare. It’s very common for users to blindly approve a signature request while being completely oblivious to what the transaction is going to do behind the scenes. This is commonly referred to as “blind signing” in the world of cryptocurrency (not to be confused with blind signatures in cryptography).</p>
<p>Blind signing is unfortunately a very common attack vector in crypto, where an attacker tricks the user into signing a transaction that drains their wallet (since there’s no way for the user to distinguish between a legitimate and a malicious transaction). Earlier this year, in a phishing attack on OpenSea users, an attacker stole hundreds of NFTs by simply tricking victims into signing a transaction to sell all their NFTs for 0 ETH. This story is far too common for the crypto ecosystem to ignore.</p>
<p>With Brave browser release 1.45, we are excited to debut a smarter signing experience on Brave Swap for all EVM transactions. With our latest updates to Brave Wallet, our signing experience is getting a redesign that aims to take the stress out of approving transactions. On any trading platform that’s powered by the 0x API (including Brave Wallet internal swaps), you’ll see clear and straightforward descriptions of how the transaction will impact your token balances.</p>

 The perils of DeFi 
<p>Using DeFi apps today is a lot like going to a shop and asking the shopkeeper to take whatever cash they need from your wallet for the purchase. The contracts you interact with already have an approval to spend part or all of your token balances, using the <code>approve()</code> method of the ERC20 interface. Consider the following transaction approval popup on Metamask, which is a Uniswap trade for USDC-ETH on the Optimism network:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Approving this transaction requires a leap of faith, since none of the original swap parameters like maker and taker assets, quote amounts, etc. are visible on the approval screen. You’re essentially signing complete gibberish. It’s not just poor user experience; it’s&nbsp; unsafe. This info can be spoofed to execute almost anything without your awareness.</p>

 What the hex? 
<p>Transactions are to smart contracts what HTTP requests are to web services. DApps use a data segment in EVM transactions, known as calldata, to indicate which function to invoke in a smart contract and with what parameters. The calldata however is just a sequence of bytes that’s not human readable. You can view the calldata segment of a transaction on Etherscan under the “Input Data” section, as in the following example:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Anatomy of EVM calldata 
<p>The calldata is a read-only, byte-addressable space where the data parameter of a transaction or call is held. This calldata is encoded by wallets and Web3 clients following the Contract Application Binary Interface (ABI). Let’s look at a simple contract with a method to add two <code>uint256</code> numbers, and see how you’d construct the calldata to execute this method:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>The first four bytes of the calldata, known as function selector, specify the function to be called. Method arguments are packed in chunks of 32 bytes, with types smaller than 32 bytes zero padded if necessary. Fixed-size types like <code>uint256</code>, <code>address</code>, etc. are represented within the available 32 bytes. However, dynamic types like bytes and arrays follow head-tail encoding. In this scheme, the data is packaged at the tail-end of the transaction’s calldata. The arguments are references in the calldata to where the content is.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the calldata example above based on the encoding rules to have a better understanding:</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>We can now update our example contract logic with heavily-commented inline assembly (albeit a bit contrived), to demonstrate how EVM parses the calldata behind the scenes:</p>



    



    



    
    


 Parsing complex calldata 
<p>Here’s a more realistic example of how to parse the calldata of the 0x contract function <code>sellTokenForTokenToUniswapV3</code>, involving dynamic types. Recall that dynamic types use the head-tail encoding scheme, unlike fixed-size types. Our example is a swap trade from COW to USDC, using the following path for the order: COW -&gt; WETH -&gt; USDC.</p>
<p>The function we’re trying to invoke is:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>Here’s the same calldata, but broken down and grouped to indicate how we can parse it to extract meaningful insights about the swap trade.</p>



    



    



    
    

<p>Note that parsing the calldata is not enough—we also needed to figure out the information embedded in the <code>encodedPath</code> argument, which is a Uniswap V3 order path. Thanks to our newfound ability to make sense of the entire calldata segment, we can now infer that the raw hex represented the swap trade 1421.74 COW -&gt; 1000 USDC.</p>

 The end product 
<p>Technical improvements can only be appreciated if an impact is felt by users. So the final piece of the puzzle was to design a UX that gives users all the necessary details to confidently approve a swap, while keeping it generic enough that it can be extended to a vast majority of DEX transactions in the future. After brainstorming with our product designers, here’s what the end product looks like:</p>
<p>


    



    



    
    




    



    



    
    
</p>
<p>A few highlights of this design:</p>
 
 It displays all the security-critical information about the swap, such as sender account, maker and taker assets along with network information, quote amounts, and exchange rate. 
 It works both for swaps from Brave Wallet as well as third-party DApps integrating the 0x API, on all EVM-compatible networks. 
 The UX could easily be extended to support cross-chain bridge transactions, where the networks for maker and taker assets would be different. 
 The origin of the transaction (i.e. eTLD+1 and the site favicon) are displayed to prevent phishing attacks. 
 

 Conclusion 
<p>We implemented an <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/12797">ABI decoder</a> in brave-core for EVM chains to bring safety and transparency to the transaction approval process. This allowed us to reveal insights about what a seemingly opaque transaction is supposed to do, and build a dedicated UX around it to make the signing process more user-friendly.</p>
<p>In the 1.45 release of the Brave browser, we are bringing this capability to 0x swaps on Brave Wallet, and will soon extend it to Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap, and Sushiswap, which should cover more than 70% of all DEX volume on Ethereum.</p>
<p>Building a secure and transparent signing experience in Brave Wallet remains a strong focus for us on the Wallet team. We intend to expand on this work to bring similar UX improvements beyond swaps, such as interacting with lending, cross-chain bridges, and staking DApps.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in our blog posts regarding releases <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-1-0/">5.1.0</a> and <a href="https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-release-5-2-0/">5.2.0</a>, the Zcash network is processing a significantly increased number of shielded transactions. The network remains stable and secure, transactions are being processed normally, and we are making additional performance improvements in 5.3.0 to reduce concurrent memory utilization during scanning among other memory and performance related optimisations in the <code>zcashd</code> node.</p>



<p>ECC’s No. 1 priority at the moment is updating the Zcash protocol and our wallet SDKs to help third-party providers fix wallet syncing issues. An increased on-chain transaction load has resulted in unacceptable sync times for many everyday users, and ecosystem partners are also affected. We are focused — across teams — on alleviating these issues as soon as possible, so Zcash users have an experience they expect and deserve. Our immediate objectives are centered on working with third-party wallets that are built on the ECC SDKs (Edge, Nighthawk and Unstoppable) as well as continuing to make improvements to node performance and memory usage.</p>



 Wallet Performance Improvements 



<p><code>zcashd 5.2.0</code> improved the performance of wallet scanning with multithreaded batched trial decryption of Sapling outputs. However, for some nodes this resulted in growing memory usage that would eventually cause an OOM abort. We have identified the cause of the growth, and made significant improvements to reduce the memory usage of the batch scanner. In addition, the batch scanner now has a memory limit of 100 MiB.</p>



<p><code>zcashd</code> now reports the following new metrics when <code>-prometheusport</code> is set:</p>



  (counter) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.outputs.scanned</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.size.transactions</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.batchscanner.usage.bytes</code>  (gauge) <code>zcashd.wallet.synced.block.height</code>  



 RPC Interface 



  The <code>finalorchardroot</code> field in the <code>getblock</code> result and the <code>orchard.commitments.finalRoot</code> field in the <code>z_gettreestate</code> result have been changed to match the byte ordering used for the <code>orchard.anchor</code> field in the <code>getrawtransaction</code> result. These previously produced different hash values from the orchard.anchor field due to having been byte-flipped in their internal representation in <code>zcashd</code>.  



<p>The binaries for the 5.3.0 release will be available on our download site shortly and the <a href="https://z.cash/support/schedule/">Zcash Schedule page</a> has been updated to reflect this release.</p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the latest round of partners that joined Brave’s Wallet Partner program this month. Since its June debut, the Wallet Partner program has onboarded 62 DApps, and promoted their use among Brave Wallet users through Brave Ads and other Brave-owned properties. In addition to our program partners, dozens more DApps are following suit by integrating Brave Wallet outside the program, helping to organically spread the word about Brave’s built-in secure multi-chain wallet.</p>
<p>To learn more about our previous Wallet Partners, check out past announcements:</p>
 
 <a>June</a> 
 <a>July</a> 
 <a>August</a> 
 <a>September</a> 
 
<p>This month’s newest additions feature:</p>

 ACryptoS 
<p><a href="https://medium.com/acryptos">ACryptoS</a> is a multi-chain yield optimizer whose core offering is auto-compounding Single-Token Vaults, which use unique strategies to increase DeFi yield without the risk of impermanent loss. The vaults first launched on BNB Chain, but are now deployed across Avalanche, Fantom, Gnosis, Cronos, and more. Their mission is to build a better, safer DeFi world where their users can sleep soundly while their deposits earn yield.</p>

 BadgerDAO 
<p><a href="https://badger.com/">Badger</a> is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate the growth of Bitcoin in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) across multiple blockchains. It is an ecosystem where projects and people from all across DeFi can collaborate and build together. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives, while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties.</p>

 Compound 
<p>The <a href="https://compound.finance/">Compound</a> protocol is a decentralized and autonomous interest rate protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The core use cases are borrowing assets and earning interest. Compound is one of the first DeFi protocols on Ethereum and currently holds ~$2.3 billion worth of liquidity in smart contracts. Compound III, its newest deployment, enables users to supply a supported collateral asset like WBTC and borrow USDC against it, in addition to earning interest if they supply USDC. Governance of the protocol is decentralized such that COMP token holders can propose or vote on code upgrades. Discord, Twitter, and the comp.xyz forums are where the community publicly discusses protocol development.</p>

 Cronos ID 
<p><a href="https://cronosid.xyz/">Cronos ID</a> is the identity and communication layer on top of  <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos. The Cronos ID Domain Service enables users to associate a unique human-readable “.cro” domain with their crypto wallet address. In the coming weeks, the Cronos ID Notification Service and the Cronos ID Messaging Service will enable peer-to-peer and DApp-to-consumer communication using only wallet addresses. Cronos ID is incubated by  <a href="https://cronoslabs.org/">Cronos Labs</a>, the ecosystem accelerator of Cronos Chain.</p>

 DappRadar 
<p><a href="https://dappradar.com/">DappRadar</a> positions itself as the world’s DApp store at the heart of Web3. It tracks more than 12,000 DApps over 50 blockchains, providing reliable and accurate data for the users who want to discover and explore the world of NFTs, blockchain games, metaverse, and more.</p>
<p>“Brave Wallet’s integration to DappRadar is a powerful partnership of two pioneering companies in Web3. Users will be able to track digital assets in Brave Wallet while exploring the world of DApps on DappRadar. Privacy at its best, while discovering blockchain games, NFTs, DeFi, metaverses, and more,” said Patrick Barile, COO of DappRadar.</p>

 Ferro 
<p><a href="https://ferroprotocol.com/">Ferro</a> is the leading stable coin swapping venue on  <a href="https://cronos.org/">Cronos</a>, the first EVM-compatible chain built on Cosmos in partnership with Crypto.com. Ferro has gained even more relevance during the recent bear market months as it works hard every day to optimize the returns that liquidity providers generate from more than $100 million in deposited DAI, USDC and USDT. Ferro differentiates with its clean, modern look and feel and its best-in-class yields.</p>

 Jungle Cats 
<p><a href="https://junglecats.io/">Jungle Cats</a> is an NFT project based on the Solana blockchain—a collection of Lions and Lionesses taking a journey through gamified rewards and on-chain breeding to mirror the life cycle of what they consider a real-life feline family. The Jungle Cats use their voice—$GROAR (SPL utility token)—to venture deep into the Jungle Safari and participate in the ecosystem.</p>

 Matcha 
<p><a href="https://matcha.xyz/">Matcha</a> is a decentralized exchange from 0x Labs, the team behind the 0x protocol. The DApp is designed to aggregate on-chain liquidity across the Ethereum and EVM ecosystem in order to offer its users maximal value on their trades. Max value means low fees, deep liquidity, and low slippage. Matcha transparently displays all costs and fees associated with trades, and doesn’t take any profits from quoted and final prices, should there be any savings when the trade settles.</p>

 Mean Protocol 
<p><a href="https://meanfi.com/">Mean Protocol</a> is a set of rules and interoperable smart contracts that help DApp developers facilitate everyday banking workflows and investment banking operations. One of the key components of Mean Protocol is Payment Streams, which provide the payment rails for developers to build real-time finance applications.</p>
<p>“Brave’s wallet integration is a pivotal stepping stone in making crypto assets mainstream. MeanFi’s integration with Brave brings our mission to onboard the next billion users to crypto a step closer to reality,” said Michel Triana, CEO and Co-founder of Mean Protocol.</p>

 Minted 
<p><a href="https://minted.network/">Minted.network</a> is a decentralized NFT platform native to Ethereum and Cronos. It aims to bring more tools for collection owners to design, curate, and offer utility to their communities with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Minted’s key functions are its self-custodial trading platform, native NFT launchpad, multi-chain support, and its security-first infrastructure. The $MTD token on Cronos is used to reward users by sharing the revenue from platform fees and other utilities.</p>
<p>“Our vision for Minted is to become a ‘Digital Bazaar of Wonders’ for creators and new and experienced collectors alike,” said Matt Wan, Director of Brand &amp; Business Partnerships at Minted.</p>

 Moonshine 
<p><a href="https://moonshinelabs.io/">Moonshine Labs</a> is innovating the framework for the next tech revolution by offering a customizable Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform. Directly connect to every partner and user across our platform, The Verse. Create your project’s paradise. Build your business. Escape the mundane. The Verse is a passion project for the entire team: from the Founder, Charles, dreaming of this world for the last 20 years, Co-founder Will innovating on emerging tech, and lead designer Chris, placing each item with love and care.</p>
<p>“The multi-chain Brave Wallet brings unparalleled security and browser-native support to over 200 crypto assets for our users and partners,” said Will Stone, Co-founder of Moonshine Labs.</p>

 Odos 
<p><a href="https://odos.xyz/">Odos</a> is a decentralized exchange aggregator on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon that allows users to swap between a variety of crypto assets via their unique order route planning. Their patented algorithm traverses a large universe of possible token swap combinations and non-linear paths, delivering greater savings to users. Odos offers the ability to swap between up to six assets in a single transaction and provides institutional APIs to partners who are interested in leveraging Odos’ Smart Order Routing in their applications.</p>
<p>“Supporting Brave Wallet greatly enhances the seamlessness of user interaction with Odos by providing a no-hassle pathway to getting started through the Brave browser,” said Matt Deible, Research &amp; Product Lead at Odos.</p>

 Overtime 
<p><a href="https://overtimemarkets.xyz/#/markets">Overtime</a> is a fully decentralized sports positioning platform that allows users to trade seamlessly through an automated market for sports, which means there’s always a position to be taken on a fan’s favorite games. Born out of the Thales protocol, their mission is to gamify DeFi one step at a time and ultimately close the gap between traditional markets and new, decentralized, and autonomous sports markets.</p>
<p>“Supporting Brave Wallet on OVERTIME was an easy decision. As pioneers in Web3 sports markets we are happy to integrate with Brave and offer our product to its 55+ million users access to markets of the most popular leagues such as the English Premier League, National Football League, Bundesligua, Formula 1, and many more” said Red, Growth Lead at Overtime.</p>

 Rarible 
<p><a href="https://rarible.com/">Rarible</a> is a leading community-centric, aggregated marketplace for NFTs that also offers multi-chain trading for NFTs listed directly on the site. Launched in 2019 by  <a href="https://twitter.com/alxfal"></a>  Alexei Falin and  <a href="https://twitter.com/insider0x"></a>  Alex Salniko<a href="https://twitter.com/insider0x">v</a>, Rarible offers a platform to artists and collectors looking to create, collect, and trade digital collectibles from multiple chains. Since its inception, Rarible has grown rapidly and become one of the most well-known and highly ranked NFT projects in the market, backed by Venrock and CoinFund.</p>
<p>“Rarible is proud to be partnering with Brave to provide the best and safest user experience for our community. With this partnership, we will create a seamless and secure environment for users to explore the world of NFTs on the Rarible aggregated marketplace” said Deborah Won, Partner Marketing Manager.</p>

 SPACE ID 
<p><a href="https://space.id/">SPACE ID</a> (SID) is building a universal name service network to seamlessly connect people, information, assets, and applications across blockchains. It’s chain-agnostic, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and open-source. Incubated by Binance Labs, SPACE ID launched the first version of SID with .bnb Domain Name Service Public Registration in mid-September as the first Top Level Domain (TLD). In other words, SPACE ID is providing the integral identity infrastructure in the BNB Chain ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Supporting Brave Wallet on SPACE ID was a no-brainer. We value the privacy and security the browser brings to our community members, so letting their integrated wallet that requires no additional extension be used to register and manage .bnb domains simply made sense,” said Solo, Head of Growth at SPACE ID.</p>

 Synthetix 
<p><a href="https://synthetix.io/">Synthetix</a> is building a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol for use by any other protocol. Its deep liquidity and low fees serve as a backend for many exciting protocols on both Optimism and Ethereum. Many user-facing protocols in the Synthetix Ecosystem, such as Kwenta (Spot and Futures), Lyra (Options), Polynomial (Automated Options), and 1inch and Curve (Atomic Swaps) tap into Synthetix to use its liquidity for different purposes. Synthetix is built on Optimism and Ethereum Mainnet and powers the Synthetix Ecosystem.</p>
<p>“Integrating Brave Wallet helps Synthetix and its ecosystem provide a great on-chain experience to new and experienced DeFi users,” said Matt, Communications Lead at Synthetix.</p>

<p>We’re proud to announce that Panther has joined the <a href="https://www.leadingprivacy.com/">Leading Privacy Alliance</a>, an initiative aspiring to be a DAO unifying leading Web3 companies around the shared goal of improving privacy in crypto and beyond. The Leading Privacy Alliance was launched on October 9th, leading to Devcon Bogota, and Panther is among the first companies to join this initiative.<br></p><p>The LPA has been established to address the issue currently facing everyone involved in the Web3 space –how to make working privacy-first an industry standard. The alliance seeks to educate end-users and clients on the importance of the right to privacy, not because there might be something to hide, but for privacy is essential to freedom.<br></p><p>The alliance was founded by <a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Blockwallet</a>, <a href="https://dusk.network/">Dusk Network</a>, and <a href="https://hoprnet.org/">HOPR</a>. Panther is, alongside Omnia, the first company to join. Panther’s Senior Architect Adam Spiers gave a talk during the launch event, explaining the reasons for Panther to join this movement.</p><blockquote><p>Making <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/private?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#private</a> scalable blockchain protocol for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Web3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Web3</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DeFi</a> applications is how <a href="https://twitter.com/ZKPanther?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ZKPanther</a> contributes to an holistic and interoperable approach of privacy, shares <a href="https://twitter.com/adamspiers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adamspiers</a>. <a href="https://t.co/oarcKILrWJ">pic.twitter.com/oarcKILrWJ</a></p>— Leading Privacy (@LeadingPrivacy) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeadingPrivacy/status/1579246326625488896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>As a project that aims to enable trust and privacy in the DeFi space, it is a natural fit for Panther to join the Leading Privacy Alliance. We strongly believe that the sector's stakeholders need to form a coalition to defend the right to privacy.<br></p><p>Web3 deeply needs to be a borderless platform where members can unite, create a shared voice representing the entire industry, and exchange experiences and ideas.<br></p><p>We’re looking forward to playing our part in advocating for privacy and seeking clarity on privacy regulations.<br></p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 How Online Privacy Concerns Today is Rooted in the Internet’s Early Days<br> <p>Bitcoin is at the forefront of future-thinking approaches to payments, investing and a range of other applications that extend far beyond its role as a digital currency. While Bitcoin represents the future of digital currency, its prioritization of censorship resistance has links back to the cypherpunk movement, which first emerged in the 1980s and became prevalent in the 1990s as internet adoption began to pick up steam. <br></p><p>Tracing contemporary privacy concerns back to early online privacy activists can be an enlightening way to develop a sense of where Bitcoin may be headed in the future. Some of the top figures who advocate for online privacy, including Timothy May, have links to the original cypherpunk movement. Assange penned the 2012 book <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cypherpunks-Freedom-Internet-Julian-Assange/dp/1944869085">Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet</a>, which bolstered mainstream awareness of the cypherpunk movement. <br></p><p>Cypherpunks tend to believe in the power of cryptography and other online privacy strategies centered around combating widespread digital surveillance. For decades, cypherpunks have been designing strategies and platforms to preserve online privacy for those who recognize its importance. Let’s dive into the history of the cypherpunk movement and how its adherents and principles are having a continued impact on the Bitcoin landscape.</p> Who Were the Original Cypherpunks? <p>In the early nineties, a group of computer scientists, programmers, and cryptographers assembled with mathematician Eric Hughes in order to discuss what they saw as the looming threat of increased surveillance facilitated by the burgeoning internet infrastructure. These early internet activists shared a libertarian sensibility—believing that the state should hold only minimal involvement in citizens’ private lives. The cypherpunk movement grew out of monthly meetings between this group and its name was a play on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> genre of science fiction coined by Jude Milhon, which itself drew influence from early hacker culture. <br></p><p>The group created the first anonymous remailer, &nbsp;the cypherpunk mailing list, in which they developed visionary ideas about online privacy. Tim May—who previously worked at Intel—was a founding member and prolific contributor to the cypherpunks electronic mailing list. He also put forth the idea of tools enabling anonymous browsing of the web as well as the idea of anonymous online marketplaces and anonymous whistleblowing systems—all of which are ideas that have seen a number of applications in the years since. The cypherpunks communicated in a brash, jargon-laden style, and their mailing list grew into a core hub of the discussion and development of online privacy strategies. The mailing list became defunct in the early 2000s, but by then the movement was fully up and running and had developed anonymous ways of communicating and sharing resources online.</p> Is the Cypherpunk Movement Active Today? <p>In his work “<a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</a>” Eric Hughes wrote “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” Frequently, politicians and those who run large social media companies assert that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy">privacy can no longer be expected online</a>, and that only those who have something to hide should be worried about being watched. As Glenn Greenwald pointed out in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en">an influential TedTalk about online privacy in 2014</a>, we make countless choices every day about what we choose to reveal and obscure from others in our lives and we should protect our right to be able to do so online.<br></p><p>Many online privacy-minded applications and initiatives were either created by people with links to the original cypherpunk movement, or were directly inspired by its philosophies. As mentioned, Julian Assange was an active member of the cypherpunk mailing list and his WikiLeaks organization was directly inspired by the cypherpunk focus on the need for anonymous whistleblowing resources. Other influential people associated with the cypherpunk ideologies include Jacob Appelbaum, who was not involved with creating the cypherpunk mailing list but was later a core member of the team that developed the open-source anonymous communication platform, Tor; Adam Back, who created Hashcash (a proof-of-work algorithm) and Blockstream (a company providing products and services built around Bitcoin), and Bram Cohen, who created BitTorrent. <br></p><p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper using concepts that drew directly from the work of Adam Back, with whom Nakamoto had been in contact. In Bitcoin’s whitepaper, Nakamoto referenced the revolutionary concept of a currency in which transactions are publicly viewable while utilizing private keys to sign unique transactions. Bitcoin was a leap forward in the development of the kind of cryptocurrency first posited by the cypherpunk movement.</p> Recent Cypherpunk Developments <p>Much of the appeal of Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies is centered around the values championed by the cypherpunk movement. Decentralized, anonymous currency rooted in cryptography offers resistance to unnecessary (and ultimately corrupt) government interference. Ideally, cryptocurrencies place privacy and transacting power back into the hands of individuals who are able to control what information they share. <br></p><p>Alongside the continued growth and development of Bitcoin—which maintains its cypherpunk-influenced integrity—there has also been a movement towards cryptocurrencies that have moved away from decentralized models. In the interest of mainstream growth and adoption, they stray from the individual privacy efforts that are central to the cypherpunk vision. Converting centralized (fiat) currency into Bitcoin often requires the use of centralized exchanges and the regulations these entail, which typically degrade users’ privacy. Many new Bitcoin users utilize centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken, which collect extensive personal information and have policies that threaten transaction privacy. <br><br>Bitcoin is central to the development of a forward-thinking movement towards individuals holding the keys to their own Bitcoin. However, there are aspects inherent to Bitcoin that have <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/why-we-work-on-bitcoin-privacy/">privacy concerns that innovators are taking steps to combat</a>. The fact that every Bitcoin transaction and address balance is viewable to anyone on the blockchain is key to the decentralized authentication of Bitcoin transactions, as it avoids the need for middlemen. When each transaction’s details can be viewed, it ensures nobody breaks the rules.<br><br>While Bitcoin addresses are not directly linked to users’ identities, they certainly can be. Once one active address’ identity is revealed, the privacy of each party that has engaged in transactions with the compromised address can be threatened. Additionally, “know your customer” requirements from online merchants, which verify users’ identities over time as a security function, can disturb users’ privacy when ostensibly anonymous transactions are connected to these transactions.</p> Coinjoin as a Contemporary Cypherpunk Innovation <p>An important concept when it comes to Bitcoin’s ability to provide an anonymous and private payment method is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-is-the-bridge-to-bitcoin-fungibility/">fungibility</a>. Fungibility refers to the ability of an asset to be exchanged freely for the same denomination of the same asset. For instance, an unmarked $20 bill’s value does not depend on the bill’s provenance. On the other hand, non-fungible stores of value include artworks, which are unique and where previous ownership is factored into an item’s worth. <br><br>Bitcoin is designed to be a fully fungible currency, but this can be threatened when certain coins can be linked through their transaction history to an unscrupulous user or exchange. One technique associated with restoring fungibility for Bitcoin users is <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/how-coinjoins-fix-bitcoin-privacy/">Coinjoin</a>. Coinjoin is an obfuscation strategy that severs the tie between previous transactions by joining coins together, which effectively anonymizes them. <br><br>CoinJoin activity itself can be viewed on the blockchain and there is still a limit to the success of this obfuscation strategy. Some users may feel that coins that have undergone this process are undesirable. For this reason, the widespread adoption of Coinjoin may be necessary in order to create a situation <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/methods-for-the-destigmatization-of-coinjoin/">where obfuscation is destigmatized</a> and seen as a privacy-retaining tool, rather than as a sign of suspicious activity.<br><br>The growing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin is an example of destigmatization of this nature, as the link between Bitcoin and anonymous online marketplaces like Silk Road (wherein users paid in bitcoin for goods and services that were illegal in certain jurisdictions) became less of a focus.</p> Wasabi Wallet as a Tool for Cypherpunks <p>One groundbreaking tool that goes a long way towards making Bitcoin adhere to the privacy standards that the original cypherpunks strove for is <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a>—a privacy-focused, non-custodial Bitcoin wallet. Wasabi Wallet uses Coinjoin obfuscation and integrates <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> as a strategy to prevent network deanonymization attacks. <br><br>One challenge faced by Bitcoin wallet developers is how to ensure the privacy of users while also making wallets user-friendly and accessible to those without extensive technical knowledge. The original cypherpunk movement was composed of developers, programmers, mathematicians, and cryptographers. The movement’s motto — “cypherpunks write code” — refers both to the programming skills of the community and the focus on encryption. These days, widespread adoption among those without specialized knowledge is the goal of many developers of Bitcoin-related tools. <br><br>Wasabi Wallet is a desktop wallet, which tends to allow for more robust software than mobile offerings. It prevents third party access to users’ wallet information, increased fungibility provided by Coinjoin technology, and offers the privacy benefits of the Tor onion network.<br><br>The recently-launched <a href="https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi2-0-released/">Wasabi Wallet 2.0</a> provides a revamped interface. Wasabi Wallet lets users choose between three coinjoin strategies, depending on whether their main priority is maximizing privacy, maximizing speed or minimizing costs. Users can easily view their wallet’s privatization progress and can also implement Discreet Mode, which further hides sensitive information. <br><br>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to naturally attract those who value online privacy and who see the benefits of being in control of how information is collected and distributed. Wasabi makes it easy to send and receive Bitcoin with more privacy than other services suited to average bitcoin users. Coinjoin and other anonymization strategies implemented by Wasabi are paving the way towards a landscape in which it’s possible for all Bitcoin users to be cypherpunks, even without specialized knowledge. <br><br><br></p>

<p>Regardless of the industry or vertical, organisations have a huge amount of compliance obligations that must be followed to avoid penalties or closures and ensure continuity of service. How are these compliance obligations managed, and is there any room for improvement?</p>



 Traditional compliance management 



<p>Traditionally, observations and measurements have been captured using manual, paper-based forms. These forms have proven to be difficult and complex to use, and often suffer from inaccuracies as a result of these inherent problems.</p>



<p>Data collection and management with paper forms can be an inaccurate and labour-intensive process. Data is often key punched twice and then reviewed for missed, out-of-range, or erroneous responses — an inefficient validation process that can be time-consuming and inaccurate.</p>



<p>Handheld Computers, A Feasible Alternative to Paper Forms for Field Data Collection, University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Luckily, these paper-based forms quickly got replaced by their digital counterparts as soon as these alternatives became available. This move to digital forms solved many of the problems paper-based forms suffered from and proved to be much easier to use. Better data entry, less use of paper, and a reduced cost are only some of their features.</p>



<p>While digital forms revolutionised the process of being compliant, they did not come without a cost. The recorded data has to be stored and shared with the relevant regulatory bodies for review and sign-off, which sounds simple in theory but has shown to be rather difficult in practice. Records can be erased, servers can become corrupted, data formats change and data loss can become a huge issue for businesses. Organisations are now beginning to harness new and emerging technologies to solve these issues and ensure transparency and compliance.</p>



 Enabling compliance using blockchain technology 



<p>Blockchain technology has been deemed to be critical for the future of data storage by some, and for good reason. It introduces features like immutability, security, and decentralisation, allowing organisations to verify events, timestamp actions, and ensure real-time compliance.</p>



<p>Blockchain is starting to gain adoption and momentum, as new high-powered protocols have emerged. Some of these protocols no longer have transaction fees and are capable of handling much more transactions per second than previous protocols, to support enterprise-grade applications. The potential of blockchain technology seems boundless, but organisations need to be practical in selecting a chain that meets both their compliance and regulatory obligations.</p>



<p><a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/europechain/">Europechain by Zaisan</a> is a perfect fit for businesses that have security, compliance, and performance on their requirements list. Europechain delivers trust by allowing organisations to harness the power and scalability of robust blockchain technology while complying with EU legislation &amp; regulation.</p>



 Process Timestamping 



<p>A process timestamping tool like <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">FACT by Zaisan</a> manages business processes, captures proof of compliance, and tracks procedures. FACT delivers a versatile toolbox for the recording of events from a wide range of predefined smart form templates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flexible template builder enables the configuration of all types of checklists, including compliance checklists. These checklists are cryptographically hashed and time stamped on Europechain to increase security, visibility, and transparency. In addition, roles and activities can be assigned to enable task distribution and increase management awareness of task completion.</p>



<p>FACT is a multi-industry application with an intuitive user interface, allowing for fast and efficient onboarding. Furthermore, FACT has flexible team settings to facilitate the segregation of tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below are just some of the use cases for FACT.</p>



  Real-estate technical inspections  Food safety and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) compliance  Equipment maintenance-checks  Asset tracking  Road-safety management programs  Lean-six-sigma routines  Supplier/contractor-performance management  Safety management  



<p>FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees, with the added benefit of having all events timestamped and added to Zaisan to ensure transparency and completion of time-sensitive tasks. The feature-rich system also allows for visibility through notifications and the reporting dashboard, which can aid in providing insight into team performance and task delivery.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  FACT is a highly flexible, blockchain-based, mobile tool to manage business processes, capture proof of compliance, and track procedures  FACT provides businesses with the opportunity to minimise repetitive, paper-based tasks and maximise the efficiency of employees  FACT offers multiple uses cases, including -but not limited to- HACCP compliance, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/fact/">compliance management</a>, asset tracking, safety management, and many others  Europechain is a perfect fit for businesses whose priorities are security, compliance, and performance

This episode features Chris Dixon – founding general partner of a16z crypto and former entrepreneur himself – and Kevin Rose – the co-founder of Proof Collective, as well as co-founder of Digg, former investor at GV, and longtime entrepreneur and podcaster.</p><p>In this wide-ranging hallway-style conversation from web3 with a16z, these two veterans of both web2 and web3 movements go long on tech trends both in web3 and beyond, including NFTs and art; AI; the evolving roles of modding, copying, and copyrights on the internet; tech’s expansion from Silicon Valley to LA and New York; and more. Their discussion is not just a journey through time (long cycles of computing, web2 to web3) and place (LA, SF, NYC), but into "the age of wonders". Are we at the end of (computing) history, or the beginning?</p><p>For more on the latest in web3 trends, be sure to subscribe to our podcast “<a>web3 with a16z</a>” (which is hosted by Sonal Choksi, the longtime former showrunner of this show) wherever you listen to your pods.</p>

 <p></p><p><a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/what-is-web5/">Web 5</a> puts users in control of their own data. Right now your bank balance, credit card transaction history and the identity information on your utility bills are in dozens of databases owned by dozens of companies with dozens of terms of service you probably haven’t read. </p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/incubation-verifiable-credential-selector">Verifiable Credential Selector</a> (VCS) is an open source widget that makes it easy for you to gain possession of your data from Financial Technology (FinTech) apps. VCS uses <a href="https://vimeo.com/704181883">Decentralized Identifiers</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/704181719">Verifiable Credentials</a> so once you have control of your data, you can selectively share only what’s required - instantly rather than waiting minutes.</p><p>Today, we are announcing the 0.1 release of the VCS that allows retrieving data from <a href="http://MX.com">MX.com</a> and <a href="http://Sophtron.com">Sophtron.com</a> and providing it to the FinTech app that embeds the VCS.</p><p>In the next few months, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/tbdex">tbDEX</a> will release the infrastructure for users to take possession and the VCS will make this upgrade easy for FinTech companies because today’s version uses the same standardized data format.</p><p>With the two providers, MX and Sophtron, already integrated, users can retrieve data from over 40,000 banks, brokerages, apps, utility companies, credit card companies and other financial institutions.</p><p>If you are building a FinTech app, are a data provider, or just want to help make Self-Sovereign Identity and Web 5 a reality, please reach out on our <a href="https://forums.tbd.website/c/incubation-verifiable-credential-selector-dev/13">Forum</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a>, or open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/incubation-verifiable-credential-selector">GitHub</a>.</p>

 Scala Project — Diardi Elections <p>We know that you’ve all been patiently waiting for news from us regarding Diardi V8 (the next iteration of our network implementation) and the future of our project, and we’ve got something exciting for&nbsp;you!</p><p>As most of you know, we have planned to implement a staked election system for the Diardi Operators since its inception.</p><p>Now, after months of development effort, we present to you the Diardi Election Application as well as the process of how we will let everyone stake their XLA to try and get a spot on the Diardi operators list.</p> What are the Diardi Operators? <p>So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, the Diardi operators are the ones who will produce blocks on the same chain (every 4th block) using a known address. Contrary to the pure Nakamoto consensus, this brings up the issue of decentralization. That’s where the catch lies: at the moment, if you look at the network, it’s being dominated by 2 or sometimes even just one&nbsp;pool.</p><p>This in itself is not that bad, as all (most) pool operators have been very open and cooperative with us. But the problem doesn’t end there. What if, by sheer chance, this one very large pool were to be attacked? Doesn’t that mean our entire network is now at the mercy of this one lonely server? To combat this, we thought to decentralize this issue by letting a group of members outside of the mining community publish blocks as checkpoint blocks.</p><p>A lot of 51%-attacks revolve around a pool mining a large number of blocks in private and releasing their largest chain to the public network, thereby rendering an entire set of blocks useless. This is very hard to do with Diardi in place, as the malicious pool operator (or the hacker of this malicious pool) must not only have a massive amount of compute power but also have colluded with many Diardi operators as well to conduct an&nbsp;attack.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>It’s pretty simple, actually. To ensure that the Diardi operators applicants are also worthy Diardi operators, we will have staked elections.</p><blockquote>Staked elections involve a user putting up a certain amount of XLA that he holds to showcase that he has the most monetary stake in the chain and thus more than anyone else to lose if the chain may be attacked.</blockquote>A screenshot showcasing the election application<p>We will take a snapshot of the Scala chain with all the user balances on October 31st, 2022. Users will get access to a special remote node that they can connect to with their seeds to send their vXLA (since this is now a forked chain) to our voting application; once the election period of 2 weeks is over, we will select the first Diardi operators (32 or 64) depending on the number of candidates.</p><p>⚠️ IMPORTANT: Please remember that balances sitting on exchanges will NOT be counted as your coins, and you will not be able to send that to the election application. So please move your coins to your own wallet before the snapshot date and move them back to the exchange after, if you’d like to, once the snapshot has concluded.</p> Compensation <p>The Diardi operators who get elected will be allowed to run Diardi nodes, providing them with 25% of all produced&nbsp;blocks.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are curious to know more about how Diardi works, check our Wiki: <a href="https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi">https://wiki.scalaproject.io/specifications/feature-desc/diardi</a></p><p>As usual, let us know on <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">Discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">Telegram</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p> Community 👋 <p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact&nbsp;us:</p>  Website: <a href="https://scalaproject.io/">https://scalaproject.io/</a>  Discord: <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy">https://discordapp.com/invite/djAFVvy</a>  Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/scalaofficial">https://t.me/scalaofficial</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scalahq">https://twitter.com/scalahq</a>  Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ScalaNetwork/</a>  Scala Mining Stats: <a href="https://scalastats.com/">https://scalastats.com/</a>  Email: hello@scalaproject.io   <p><a href="https://medium.com/scala-network/scala-project-diardi-elections-c5467832c4df">Scala Project — Diardi Elections</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/scala-network">Scala</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 💡Validator Spotlight — Octeka&nbsp;💡  Validator Spotlights showcase the amazing people working to guarantee the security and decentralization of the Findora blockchain.  1) Tell Us About&nbsp;Yourself <p>Hello, my name is Patrick, I’m from Quebec/Canada, and I run the Octeka validator on&nbsp;Findora.</p><p>I’ve been in the gaming industry for almost 20 years, working on a lot of well-known titles for companies like 2K and Ubisoft. I’ve worked in various roles, but my main ones were Build Master and Engine/Tools Programmer.</p><p>Also, I have some great experience in cloud computing and building cloud architecture from the bare metal. I do have a full server rack at home running OpenStack with Kubernetes, compiling code, running builds, and yes, also validating.</p><p>I’m very passionate about all technology-related stuff, and cryptocurrencies are one of my main interests.</p> 2) What brought you into crypto/web3 in the first&nbsp;place? <p>In the early days of ETH, a friend of mine was pushing blockchain mining, so I decided to build myself a mining rig and try my hand at&nbsp;it.</p><p>Even though Web3 has grown a lot, I still believe we are in its early days, still exploring/pushing its potential. So, I wanted to be part of the next big thing, and I think this is&nbsp;it.</p> 3) What is your experience in validating or web3 in&nbsp;general? <p>I’ve been playing around with Solidity to interact with smart contracts and went to the bottom of it by creating some&nbsp;.net and golang tools that helped me learn most of it. I might use that knowledge to build an app or a game, not sure which&nbsp;yet!</p><p>I’m also currently running a validator on both Findora and Harmony using multiple nodes at different locations to make sure to have good uptime, with metrics and alerts set up in case of emergencies.</p> 4) What makes your operation unique? Why should delegators stake with&nbsp;you? <p>Like most of my fellow validators, we are here to provide a solid, reliable validating service to anyone who would like to stake with&nbsp;us.</p><p>We have servers located in Canada, the United States, and also in Europe for redundancy and reliability.</p><p>Also, we keep a close look at our servers metrics, to make sure we always have the proper hardware and that everything is running smoothly. We use an alerting system to make sure we respond as quickly as possible to any problem that could&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Right now, we don’t have any commission fees, but when it happens, it will never go higher than 5%, and the gains will be used to stake on other validators.</p> 5) Why do you want to validate with&nbsp;Findora? <p>Like some of us, we learned about Findora from the Harmony.ONE community, and we liked the key idea of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Also, things seem to be moving for the chain, and it seems to have more and more communications every week, so we believe that bringing our validating experience to this chain is a great next step for&nbsp;us.</p> 6) Where can our community go to learn more about you or contact you? Do you have a validator dashboard link? <p>We are currently building our website, but we are always reachable through Twitter or Telegram (@octeka_one). You can see our findorascan profile&nbsp;<a href="https://findorascan.io/node/3E108EA444087E0D804A39A665AEB0D319E94BC0">here</a>.</p><p>Learn more about Octeka on <a href="https://findorascan.io/">findorascan.io</a></p> About Findora <p>Scaling privacy for the future of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography.

 Why release a transparency report? 



<p>Electric Coin Co. (ECC)* is committed to openness and transparency — as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital currency and in support of our mission to empower people with economic freedom. This transparency report details company income, expenses, and use of funds during Q1 2022.</p>



 Key takeaways 



  Bootstrap received coins at a value above the ECC operating-expense level for Q1 2022. During this time, Bootstrap received coins at an average of $1,055,000 a month (at the Q1 average ZEC price for each of the three months’ distribution dates at $137.75), and ECC incurred average monthly expenses of approximately $700,000.  At the end of Q1 2022, Bootstrap and ECC collectively held approximately $6.1M in USD and approximately 96.1K ZEC.

 <br> <p>In his work “<a href="https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html">A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto</a>” Eric Hughes wrote, “Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” The weight of this comment may not be immediately obvious but is increasingly relevant in our day-to-day lives.<br><br>The importance of online privacy is relevant to everyone—not just users who are looking to avoid the scrutiny of authorities for reasons related to questionable activities. Even users who are comfortable with having their every move online tracked should be aware that large data breaches regularly occur at major companies and governments. These events expose users’ personal data to hackers, which can be exploited in various ways.</p> Everyone on the Internet Should Understand Online Privacy. But do they even care?<br> <p>As a journalist and online privacy advocate, Glenn Greenwald pointed out in a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters?language=en">widely-circulated </a>2014 TED talk that the Internet was, at one time, thought of as a new frontier for democratization and liberation. According to Greenwald, the internet could now be considered a "zone for mass surveillance". <br><br>Greenwald claims that some feel there’s no harm in mass online surveillance because it only threatens those who are engaging in illegal activities. This line of thinking includes the idea that only those who have something to hide should be concerned about their privacy. It frames the notion that some people wouldn’t want to share every aspect of their lives with the government as defensive behavior. In 2010, Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, claimed that privacy should not even be expected online as it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy">no longer a social norm</a>. This is a dangerous belief, which unfortunately seems widely accepted in mainstream narratives despite its negative effects on individual liberties. Why should one care about privacy? Is one truly free to speak without it?<br><br><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/373338/global-opinion-concern-online-privacy/">According to one study published in 2022</a>, more than half of internet users are concerned about their online privacy. Let’s take a look at some key concepts and terms relevant to online privacy and steps users can take to better control and protect their data.</p> Important Concepts Linked to Online Privacy <p>Common concerns that relate to online privacy may include the preservation of sensitive personal and financial data and users having a say in who they are advertised to.</p> Personal Data <p>Personal data is any information that can be used to identify you. It can include your name, address, social insurance number, birthday and can also extend to your entire financial, educational, employment and medical history. Information including online identifiers and browsing history can also be considered personal information. One qualifier that defines personal data is that it is <a href="https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/the-gdpr-what-exactly-is-personal-data">clearly about one particular person</a>. <br></p><p>Personal data is considered valuable by advertisers and regulatory bodies alike, and the collection and sharing of users’ personal data is an important aspect of how many companies and apps are configured. Personal data is collected by websites, social media platforms, employers and more. This data is stored on web servers across the world, often changing hands in ways that are unknown by the users themselves. The selling of data is often part of the fine print and terms of service when using apps and websites, and is defined under things like GDPR or CCPA.Such regulations are often thought of as privacy friendly, but really only state that you have to consent to the sale of your personal data.</p> Online Encryption <p>One step that users can take to make themselves less vulnerable online and to put their privacy more into their own hands, is by focusing on apps and software that offer encryption. Encryption refers to the scrambling of the data stored and shared online, aiming to allow only trusted entities to interact with personal data. <br>Encryption ensures that only those with the relevant access keys are able to view the related content. It allows users to have more, but not ultimate, security over the information they share. Using a secret passphrase known only to the sender and receiver to unlock information is an excellent way to improve your security.<br><br>End-to-end encryption refers to encryption wherein only a user and their intended recipient are communicating without the ability of even the communication service to view or collect users’ data. While some messaging services are said to offer end-to-end encryption, some online security advocates challenge these claims as the services may provide “backdoor” access to government bodies. Oftentimes, the justification for this is to collect data necessary for fighting crime.</p> Threats to Online Privacy <p>When it comes to ways of protecting personal data, there are steps that individuals can take to decrease the risk of security breaches and minimize the amount of information readily available to unwanted external parties. Tools from ethical, security-minded companies can help users store and share data with more control, making use of the latest web security technology.<br><br>While taking steps at the individual level can enhance users’ online privacy, there are policies at the institutional level that can make it difficult to avoid the collection and sharing of personal data. In these cases, simply learning about policies and programs that involve your personal data is a way of being more aware of circumstances when your data could be collected, and of knowing how it could be used.</p> Mass Surveillance <p>Signing up for any new online account or app often involves agreeing to a range of terms and conditions wherein users permit organizations to collect agreed-upon information in exchange for the use of the application. Whether it’s on computers or phones and whether or not users are aware of what information is being collected, government bodies and private organizations alike are able to create detailed profiles of people based on data they willingly provide to websites. Often, users don’t even read the terms and conditions when signing up for a new service. <br><br>Controlling the amount your private data is collected may be increasingly relevant as smart cities that adopt surveillance technologies become more prevalent. Mindful online conduct may include making a list of each of the accounts and online services you subscribe to and determining whether the information you knowingly provide to each of these entities is worth the benefits of each service.</p> Online Privacy Regulations <p>Data breaches affecting companies as large as Facebook have sparked conversations as to the degree of involvement government policies should have regarding the collection and use of personal data. While government regulation is often necessary to lay the foundation for public market participation, the excess of such is also a risk factor that commonly limits progress.<br><br>As whistleblower disclosures have shown, government bodies themselves may also collect and use data in ways that average internet users could not have anticipated or foreseen. In the United States, for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act">all phone and internet data has been monitored by Federal law enforcement since the ‘90s</a>. This data is unfathomably vast, so agencies including the NSA and the FBI create systems that analyze this data for use by intelligence and local law enforcement agencies.<br></p> Software Vulnerabilities and Secure Protocols <p>There are a number of security risks associated with typical internet usage. Free, public Wi-Fi is becoming increasingly available—which is a boon for those who work on the go and those with limited data plans—but these free, public Wi-Fi networks can be easy targets for those seeking access to users’ personal data for nefarious purposes. <br><br>Adversaries can access unsecured devices on public networks, which can provide unfettered access to important personal information including credit card data, passwords and personal documents. When users’ privacy settings allow for file-sharing across a network, it’s an opportunity for hackers to implant malware on users’ devices, further compromising their online privacy.<br><br>There are steps diligent users can take to make themselves less vulnerable when using unsecured networks. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a> (virtual private network) creates a private network on top of an existing public network, improving security. VPNs also often include encryption, making stolen data less useful to hackers. <br><br>HTTPS is a protocol that helps to protect data by preventing access from parties aside from the primary user and the server they’re accessing, using encryption and a series of communication exchanges referred to as a “handshake.” Other security-minded steps include turning off sharing on devices on public networks and keeping Wi-Ffi off, aside from when it’s being used as devices are known to transmit some data even to networks users aren’t connected to.</p> Online Privacy and Bitcoin <p>Bitcoin is seen by many as being a new frontier for digital privacy. Its potential for decentralization means that users have more ability to control their own data and to have more agency in controlling decisions that relate to their privacy. <br><br>However, Bitcoin transactions are, by design, not confidential. Transactions on the block chain are secure, but their details are publicly viewable. When bitcoin is obtained in a way that is linked in some way to a user’s identity, and when information about transactions is shared, its pseudonymity in future transactions is easily negated. For example, if a user makes an online purchase using bitcoin, but does so through a regulated exchange which requires the completion of KYC processes, then pseudonymity can easily be compromised.<br><br>There are inherent issues associated with many bitcoin exchanges and users may be left with a sense of uncertainty with regards to how their personal data is being used. Developers may be able to collect sensitive personal information and the exchanges themselves are vulnerable to hacks, as seen in the Mt. Gox debacle and many since.</p> Wasabi 2.0 <p>Initiatives like <a href="https://wasabiwallet.io/">Wasabi Wallet</a>—which offer anonymous communication using the Tor network, coin mixing and non-custodial personal control over private keys—can go a long way towards putting users in control of their bitcoin and retaining their privacy online. <br><br>The anonymization strategy employed by Wasabi Wallet and other Bitcoin privacy solutions is called <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coinjoin.asp">coinjoin</a>. Coinjoins are a collaborative bitcoin transaction. Users send their bitcoins to themselves with other users at the same time to reclaim their privacy. When the transaction occurs, everyone’s bitcoins are mixed with one another to make it much harder, if not impossible, to trace their transaction history.<br><br>As technology continues to grow into nearly every aspect of our lives, privacy as a resource is growing more scarce. We recommend the use of privacy tools, like Wasabi Wallet, to maintain your right to privacy. Consider taking control of your personal information to defend yourself from the intended (and unintended) repercussions of our increasingly digitised society.</p>

    <p>An NFT collection is a grouping of one or more NFTs, with or without images. Before you can create a collection, you must store the data (image and metadata) of your NFT collection in an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). However, the main reason for storing your NFT data in an IPFS is that you don’t lose it. Once your data is lost, your NFT becomes worthless.</p>
<p>So, if you create, sell, or buy an NFT, it is prudent that you make a copy of the NFT’s off-chain data in the cloud of a pinning service.&nbsp; By doing so, you can ensure that the off-chain data is accessible through a specific Base URI address in an IPFS hosting service. This allows you to upload the same data to two different nodes in a network or repeatedly upload/download the off-chain data and still maintain consistency.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we are using <a href="https://www.pinata.cloud/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhY-aBhCUARIsALNIC07w73iECD--ubIeyIqbZPkyTbtmv-sCa7xEPUE_H8xBr6m5dcKrsJ8aAuIMEALw_wcB">Pinata</a> as the IPFS pinning service for storing your NFT data.</p>
 Prerequisites 
<p>Before you can begin using Pinata, make sure that you have the following:</p>
 
 Pinata Account 
 
<p>Note: We use Pinata as our pinning service to IPFS. If you are using a different pinning service, it is highly recommended that you save your asset locally as a backup.&nbsp;</p>
 
 NFT Assets 
 
 
 
 
 Associated image(s) and Metadata 
 
 
 Text Editor&nbsp;<br><br>
 
 You can use any text editor 
 
 
 
 Preparing your NFT Assets 
<p>Perform the following steps in preparing your NFT assets for IPFS upload:</p>
<p>1. Collect all of your NFT assets in one folder in your localhost computer:</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Convert each asset into ‘Document’ file type by:</p>
<p>a. Right click each file, click ‘Get Info’.</p>
<p>b. Under Name &amp; Extension, delete the file extension (e.g., .png, .jpeg, .mp3)</p>
<p></p>
<p>c. The pop-up, Are you sure you want to remove the extension? appears. Click Remove.</p>
<p></p>
<p>d. After deleting the file extension, the file type is now Document. Repeat these steps for all other assets.</p>
<p></p>
 Uploading your NFT Asset Folder to the IPFS 
<p>3. Upload your NFT asset folder to Pinata to get the folder’s content id (CID) number.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Create a metadata file for each asset with associated CID.</p>
<p>a. Each asset you’ve uploaded needs to have an associated file with metadata attributes (formatted in JSON). Download a sample metadata file <a href="https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/sample-nft-metadata">here.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>b. Check that the image URL is ipfs://{CID of assets}/{name of asset}</p>
<p>c. Format the metadata file with the associated token ID (e.g. 1, 2, 3)</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Upload folder of metadata files to Pinata. Afterwards, copy the CID number by using the copy icon.</p>
<p></p>
 Adding your BASE URI to the Token Generator 
<p>6. Get Base URI for <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">Token Generator</a>. In the Token Generator, paste the CID number into the Base URI field. Make sure you&nbsp; format the Base URI as:</p>
<p>ipfs://{metadata CID}/</p>
<p></p>
<p>Simply follow the remaining steps on the <a href="https://testnet.tokenmint.global">TokenMint Token Generator</a> to create your own NFTs!</p>

         Augmenting Human Intellect, No Code Required                <p>By Megan Finnerty</p><p>Photography: CAYCE CLIFFORD</p><p>Published October 13, 2022</p>            <p>Notion’s co-founders are growing an enduring business by nurturing the creative community.</p>       



 
 
   
<p>In 2015, Notion co-founders Simon Last and Ivan Zhao had removed from their lives anything that wasn’t writing code and eating noodles. Three years into building their startup, they scrapped the code powering their app. They were running out of money. They’d just laid off their only colleagues. And to stretch what money they had left, they’d moved from San Francisco to Kyoto, Japan, which was less than half as expensive.</p>



<p>In the downstairs of a rented two-story house so small that only a traditional Shoji screen separated their bedrooms, Zhao says they spent 18 hours a day at their laptops, not bothering to dress, clean or cook. “We were just, code, code, code,” Zhao remembers. “Then, ‘Hey, let’s go out for food.’ Then, we go eat, go back to work, and do it again.” Neither man could speak or read Japanese, but Zhao is from China, and he could read the menus well enough for them to figure out “beef” or “chicken.” (About 70 percent of the writing, Japanese Kanji, was similar to the Chinese Hanzi he grew up reading.)</p>



<p>The 20-somethings didn’t mind the drudgery or the lack of personal space. They were consumed with reinventing a piece of software called Notion, and if they couldn’t figure out how to turn it into an everyday tool people would want to run on their computers or smartphones, they would have laid off their friends, burned through millions in angel investment and wasted years of their lives for nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two believed Notion was worth this effort because they were trying to make it into something that would revolutionize people’s relationships with computers and software. They wanted to make software that could empower a global community of everyday people to make their own apps and tools without having to write code, all to unlock new levels of creativity and productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, having added a third co-founder in COO Akshay Kothari and grown from a cult following to more than 20 million users, Notion has a multi-billion-dollar valuation and is aiming to unseat Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace as the enterprise-level collaborative productivity software. By all accounts, the mad dash in Kyoto paid off. The founders have time to dress properly, and even enjoy the occasional home-cooked meal. But, in many ways, their biggest challenges are still ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In 2013, Zhao and Last raised about $2 million from angel investors—a mix of friends, family and friends of friends. Zhao, who had learned to code as a child, had a big vision—to enable people to use any computing device with the same creativity and flexibility that they bring to their writing, allowing them to approach devices as a new medium, whatever that might mean someday. Zhao was trying to make good on ideas that he describes as romantic, ones developed by his idols: tech pioneers Alan Kay, Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart. These men saw computers as a way to help humans be more imaginative, more creative, more capable of leveraging intelligence in ways not yet imagined. In the 1960s and ’70s, these men, particularly Engelbart, envisioned a future in which people used computers to design their own software to accomplish whatever they wanted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, billions of us use computers, yet only <a href="https://www.future-processing.com/blog/how-many-developers-are-there-in-the-world-in-2019/">0.34 percent</a> of the global population are software developers. Most everyone has to download an app or run a piece of software to accomplish a task. Zhao compares this to how, prior to the spread of literacy with the invention of the printing press around 1440, only clergy and scribes could read and write, so the rest of the population never composed great works of literature, soul-stirring poetry or world-changing scientific research.</p>



<p>In San Francisco, while Zhao still believed he was right about his grand vision, he realized he was wrong about his market. It was a crucible moment. The first version of Notion was a tool that non-coders could use to make their own apps. Disappointingly for the co-founders, it turned out, even if they were Last’s and Zhao’s actual friends, non-coders didn’t want app-building software. “It was not really a product,” Zhao says. “It didn’t work because the product was not understandable for most people. It was more for nerdy tech crowds. We realized, in order to be a big software tool, we have to start from a product that is already ubiquitous, that people recognize, and hide the tool-making, hide the programming ability, like how you sugarcoat broccoli. Nobody wakes up wanting to make software. Well, very few people.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most people, he reasoned, wake up and want to use their computers to browse the internet, to write or to solve a work problem. Even though he had started Notion to help humans use computers for more than word processing, he realized this new version would have to be just that, only built with some flexible tool-making capabilities layered in—closer to, he imagined, the kind of software his idols had once envisioned. However, when they rolled out this new Notion to their friends, they saw the framework they’d chosen to build with, a Google web framework called Web Component, crashed constantly. “Bugs came from everywhere,” Zhao says. “It was unstable. People were losing their content.” Zhao and Last would have to start over using the more stable React Libraries (now the market leader), just as they were burning through the last of their investment. Some of the earliest team members had already departed, and retaining the rest was growing more untenable by the day.</p>



<p>“It was kind of like despair, I would say. I almost never had that feeling before,” Zhao remembers. Things looked pretty bad from the outside, too, says Kothari, who had been one of Notion’s angel investors. He and Zhao met every six months or so, sharing insights and suggesting possible employees. “I thought [investing] was a mistake, because the company didn’t go anywhere,” he says. “It almost ran out of money.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last had joined Notion while in college, so as the older founder, Zhao was left to decide how to save the business: “And that feels like—fuck it. Let’s just reset this.” Now just the two of them, Zhao and Last wanted to go somewhere cheaper than San Francisco, and somewhere they’d never visited. They picked Kyoto, almost on a whim, and subleased their spaces in San Francisco.</p>



<p>“It was a lot of fun, some of the happiest times,” says Zhao. “It was very intense and focused. A brand-new code base is always happy. There’s no legacy code. You don’t need to clean up the whole thing. It’s almost like you have a brand-new house—you can decorate however you want, versus the old house, you have to clean, repaint the walls and all that.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Today, seven years after that sweaty, exciting time in Kyoto, Last and Zhao are back in San Francisco and Notion is working as an all-in-one collaborative productivity software. Their bright, loft-style offices have sisal mat floor coverings, Michel Ducaroy’s famously curving Togo couches and Alvar Aalto’s iconic, simple wooden Artek stools. The tones are neutral and warm. Zhao refers to overhead fluorescent lighting as “hell.” He chose all the furniture and finishes, putting as much thought into the offices as he has into the product. A portrait of Engelbart hangs prominently in a first-floor hallway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notion is staking a claim in a market dominated by giants—Microsoft and Google, with more than 2 billion users between them. Yet, Zhao says, within a decade, every software company could be considered a competitor, because Notion will eventually be able to make any kind of tool, or will be able to integrate with countless pieces of software. Today, Zhao estimates Notion can consistently replace about a dozen pieces of software like project-management or list-making tools. This matters because the software-replacement opportunity is massive: companies with more than 2,000 employees use an average of 175 pieces of software, and smaller companies use an average of 73, according to Okta’s 2021 Business at Work study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At its most basic, Notion enables people to use just one interface to make, edit and customize documents; to manage projects; to create information-sharing wikis; and to design all kinds of charts and tables. It set itself apart from competitors—which also include Dropbox, Atlassian and Oracle—through a growing set of clever, built-for-purpose templates such as to-do lists, product roadmaps and client databases. There is a whole Notion-adjacent economy, filled with quirky templates, like this <a href="https://thenotionbar.gumroad.com/l/renaissancealbum">album credit</a> tracker for Beyonce’s “Renaissance,” created by Notion-optimization consultant Frances Odera Matthews. Notion’s design also distinguishes it, with a restrained, black-and-not-quite-white aesthetic. “It’s brown,” Zhao says, pointing to what very much looks like the white background of a Notion page pulled up on a laptop. “You can’t see it, but you can feel it.” Notion’s biggest differentiator is how users tailor it to their personal or professional needs by incorporating whatever mix of blocks—charts, databases, notes, videos, photos, lists, maps—they want to use to accomplish a task.</p>



<p>Sequoia Capital partner Dannie Herzberg is proud to be among Notion’s “power users,” running her work life on it. She was head of enterprise sales at Slack when she met Zhao, who visited the offices often to learn from the company’s startup journey and lay the groundwork to make Slack Notion’s first integration. Zhao had cold-emailed Herzberg, saying he was a fan of how Slack built its product and brand, and, impressed by the energy in the email, she invited him to drop by the office. “He came to the Slack office, which was brand new and very nicely designed in this midcentury-modern way. I’d never had a guest come to the office and touch the tables, and appreciate the quality of the leather of the chairs. I marveled to myself, ‘Who is this man?’ He is so discerning and so curious.” Herzberg liked Zhao so much that she downloaded Notion immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sequoia partner Mike Vernal, a former Facebook vice president, was an original Notion angel investor back in 2013. Soon after joining Sequoia in 2016, he noticed startups increasingly running their businesses on Notion, using it to send memos or make decks. Sequoia led Notion’s 2021 round of $250 million. “For a two- or three-year window, Notion was high on our list of companies that we admired from afar,” Vernal says. His impression of founders flocking to Notion is more than anecdotal. Zhao says that 68 percent of the most recent Y Combinator class ran their companies on Notion. “And they’re the future Fortune 500 companies,” he says. “So it’s less about where we are today, but it’s like, we want to be the place where future companies are operating.” That said, with the new investment money, Notion and its backers also want it to be the place companies are operating today.</p>

<p>***</p>



<p>Zhao grew up with his mom in Ürümq, a city of 4 million in China’s northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, also known sometimes just as Xinjiang. There, he learned how to code as a participant in the International Olympiad in Informatics, a grade school mathematics and computer science competition. He also developed an appreciation for aesthetics as a student of traditional Chinese watercolor. When he was in high school, his mom wanted more for his education, so she moved them to Vancouver. On the west coast of Canada he learned English from watching “Spongebob Squarepants.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao attended the University of British Columbia, and, figuring he already understood computer science, focused on cognitive science and art, having picked up photography his senior year of high school. He says his artist friends helped him hone his sense of aesthetics, watching movies with his film studies friends, helping his then-girlfriend and her friends with fashion school portfolios. In 2012, as he prepared to graduate, many of his friends needed online portfolios. “I’m the nerd of the friend circle, so I started coding people’s websites for them. And there were no good tools,” Zhao said. “They’re all kind of ugly, right?” He made maybe five websites. “Then, I realized, it doesn’t make sense. Those people have taste; they just don’t have good tools.”</p>



<p>Around this time, Zhao read a 1962 paper by Engelbart called “Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework” that crystallized his thinking. Engelbart conceived of computers as a way to increase humanity’s capacity to solve complex problems, not to just run computations, which was the bulk of computer work at the time. He wrote, “Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean a mixture of the following: more rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions….”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While humans were routinely using computers to do this kind of work by the early 2010s, when Zhao was reading this paper, he saw that a crucial element of Engelbart’s vision was still missing. Nearly all people now relied on computers to help them do all kinds of things, yet most couldn’t write their own code. And until more people could do that, Zhao felt that the real promise of human-computer interaction would be limited to the creativity of coders, who tend to write software that solves their own problems, or they write software that people will pay to use. They don’t write hyper-specific code to do a clever, unique thing an individual person wants to do.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I was like, ‘Holy shit. This is what I’m going to do.’ There’s nothing else that has more leverage to use my skill set than to help people to use their computer beyond just a typewriter. At that point, that’s where Notion’s idea got formed.” Zhao became obsessed with democratizing access to the tool-making ability of coding. He saw the idea of people being able to make their own software as integral to their ability to be creative, to shape their own environments, to create culture and value. He wanted coding to stop being a tiny community of specially educated people. He envisioned a tool that could turn the world into a community of no-code software builders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao started working on the first version of Notion while day-jobbing at the ebook startup Inkling in San Francisco. But within a year or so, he left Inkling and started to assemble his team. Zhao and one of his early Notion colleagues were members of a “small scene” of people passionate about visually oriented programming environments who followed each other on Twitter, sharing projects and insights. The colleague mentioned one of the people in the scene, a student at the University of Maryland, College Park, named Simon Last, was doing interesting work. Zhao looked at his portfolio, which featured, among other things, code that enabled people—kids, presumably—to add body parts to a creature based on their answers to either/or logic gates. Zhao reached out and asked Last for a meeting. He offered Last an internship, showing Last the same Notion prototype he’d shown Kothari during the investment conversation. “There is a saying, ‘Education is different from schooling,’ and he understood this,” says Zhao.</p>



<p>Zhao remembers sneaking Last into a nearby bar, the Trick Dog. It shared a bathroom with a coffee shop, so Last would go in the coffee shop and come out via the bathroom into the bar. “And then he decided to drop out of school and just work on this full time with me,” remembers Zhao. Last’s dad visited to appraise Zhao, perhaps suspecting the men were doing things like sneaking into bars. “His dad’s a school principal,” Zhao says with a laugh. “We shook hands, [I had to show] I am not a crazy person.”</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>In March 2016, after the year in Kyoto testing iterations of Notion’s functionality and design, endlessly pulling up pages on the design software Figma, Zhao editing in one area, Last finessing elsewhere, they launched Notion 1.0. This version had Notion’s iconic, black-and-not-quite-white look, and the ability to do word processing, of course, as well as to make drag-and-drop to-do lists and wikis, and it had more than 30 document templates for things like product roadmaps. The men didn’t yet charge to use Notion; they wanted to grow users first. Zhao’s mom loaned him $150,000 to keep the startup afloat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get users, Zhao and Last hatched a plan to get Notion featured on Product Hunt, a site that lets people submit tech products on daily lists for the community to comment and vote on. The product with the most votes in 24 hours earns additional promotion, as well as international tech-community hype. Their plan involved asking the famed entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant, who had invested in Notion early, to wake up at midnight, when the new day’s list opened, and to tweet to his followers to vote for Notion on Product Hunt.</p>



<p>“And he has a bazillion Twitter followers,” says Zhao. (Today, Ravikant has slightly less than a bazillion, at 1.9 million.) The gambit worked. “That kickstarted our product on Product Hunt. We got a lot of traction there.” Soon, tech insiders, people involved with Y Combinator and other startup incubators, were using it. That’s how Vernal and others at Sequoia started seeing Notion pop up. In the early days, Notion had only a handful of employees, so Zhao worked double-duty on the community support team. He says this helped him understand how to make Notion more useful, and it gave him a sense of Notion’s growing community—people smitten with the minimalist aesthetic, or who loved customizing templates to make book-reading logs or skincare diaries. As he readied Notion for a 2.0 version, Zhao would also reply to users directly on Twitter, building community there by showing that real people were behind the product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vernal said this focus on nurturing community was key to getting a foothold in the product world. “It would be futile and foolhardy to try to compete with Microsoft and Google in a top-down way, to build a similar product and sell against them,” says Vernal. “Instead, they found a small group of really die-hard fans that carried the product with them. They looked for ways to cultivate the community at every step along the way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>***</p>



<p>The Notion community ballooned in March 2018 when David Pierce, then the personal technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, wrote a glowing review of Notion 2.0. The headline read: “The Only App You Need for Work-Life Productivity.” The article called the updated version a “rare renaissance app.” This new version featured new project management capabilities and relational databases, the kinds of everyday tables and spreadsheets that power countless projects and companies. Notion’s innovation was letting users configure views of those databases in customizable ways, so different people could see the same information presented in different ways. They started charging users monthly subscription fees between $4 and $10, and began turning a profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao was unfazed by this success. He focused instead on evolving the product toward his original vision of empowering people to make their own tools, and on growing Notion as a business. The team was only about eight people, but he had just the person in mind to call to help them grow into their next phase. That summer, Kothari, one of Notion’s angel investors, was working for LinkedIn in India, and was visiting San Francisco. He and Zhao met up, just as they always had. This time, Zhao offered him a job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kothari was born and raised in Ahmedabad, a city of 8 million in India’s western Gujarat state. His parents sacrificed to send him to school in America, so Kothari says he did nothing but study when he got to Purdue University in Indiana. After graduating in 2007 with a degree in electrical engineering, he worked for an alum at a Los Altos, California, investment firm. After a year, he didn’t get the H-1B visa he’d need to stay working in America. As a backup, he’d applied to Stanford University, knowing that if he got in, he could remain in the country as a student. There, Kothari, liberated because he was paying his own way, took a design thinking bootcamp course just because it sounded like fun.</p>



<p>“It’s like, everybody can be a designer. You can be a designer. I can be a designer. And I was like, ‘This sounds amazing,’” Kothari remembers with a laugh. “And we did all sorts of really wonky projects. As an electrical engineer, I was like, ‘Oh my God! What did I sign up for?’ I think the first project was to redesign how people eat ramen noodles. I was pushed to go talk to people in supermarkets when they were buying ramen. And just talk to people in restaurants, observe how they’re eating ramen, and see if you can change something about their experience. And I felt so uncomfortable, but I stuck with it.”</p>



<p>As part of a class project in 2010, he created the news aggregation app Pulse in about six weeks and soon turned it into a business. A year later, Zhao posted on the blog Hacker News that he was moving to San Francisco to find a job. Kothari was a heavy user of the site, visiting multiple times a day to weigh in on conversations, to see what other developers were up to and to recruit. Kothari remembers that when Zhao posted, he shared a game app he’d developed in 2010 called “Three Degrees of Wikipedia,” which is no longer available. Wired wrote about it, and the Apple App Store featured it. Zhao remembers the day when he suddenly started making money from it in $.99 cent increments. “That day felt like Christmas. I was playing basketball and found out, and I was like, ‘What the fuck?!’” he says with a laugh. Kothari said he thought it had a beautiful, clean design, and he happened to be looking for a designer. “I reached out on a whim,” he said. (Kothari still has the email.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao chose Inkling instead. Within three years, Kothari had sold Pulse to LinkedIn for $90 million, and Zhao had started Notion. It would be Kothari’s first investment. “I still remember his pitch. And at that point…it was really just the ambition of the project that resonated with me,” Kothari says. “He’s out there, just trying to democratize software, make it so that everybody can put these building blocks together.” Kothari said he was so impressed with the scope of Zhao’s vision that he thought about Notion for months after the pitch, ultimately calling him and offering Zhao a bigger investment. “He was kind enough to take it,” Kothari says.</p>



<p>Over the years, Kothari rose through the ranks at LinkedIn, becoming vice president of product and moving to India’s tech center, Bengaluru, to help run LinkedIn India as it expanded. So by the time the men met up in 2018, Kothari had built new processes, teams and cultures inside a company with thousands of employees all over the world. He was who Notion needed. After a few months convincing his wife that they could reinvent their lives in San Francisco, Kothari joined as chief operating officer. His first job was six months of answering support-desk tickets. He talked to thousands of customers and grew to understand the use cases and depth of the product—setting him up, he says, to figure out how to build out the rest of Notion. Zhao sees Last as his product co-founder and Kothari as his business co-founder. He refers to Kothari as a human stem cell, a person who can spot any need in the company, design a plan to do the work, master the work and then eventually hire the right person to lead the new team doing that work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around this time, Notion was at just under a million users, and investors were trying to win the founders over by sending cookie dough and dog treats and by showing up at the company’s gated office in the Mission District, according to a 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/technology/start-ups-rejecting-venture-capital.html">New York Times</a> story. Vernal remembers Notion’s first few offices had a no-shoes policy, and when he sent Sequoia partners to learn about the company, he would remind them to wear good socks. Notion was profitable, so the founders didn’t seek official funding rounds. Instead, the company focused primarily on growing the community. They did this, Zhao says, by building relationships with power users. These were the kind of people who took it upon themselves to translate the Notion user guide into Korean because it was only available in English; who ran the Notion subreddit, now with 200,000 subscribers, and who ran the Notion Facebook groups in Korea and the Middle East, both with tens of thousands of members. Zhao saw these people as members of a community, offering them early access to new features, face time with Notion team members and the opportunity to give input on features. He had a hunch that investing in individual users would ultimately get Notion into big companies. He imagined these people would like Notion so much, they’d keep using it at work. Eventually, this hunch would prove right.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>For two years, Kothari did all kinds of jobs, built out playbooks and hired leaders to run the new teams, before moving on to the next business need. By the start of the pandemic, Notion had about 40 employees and they’d raised about $50 million as an insurance policy against pandemic uncertainty, says Kothari. They needn’t have worried, and they haven’t spent it. As the world pivoted to remote work, signups grew. After more than a year of pandemic lockdowns, high school and college students started streamlining the overlap of remote school and remote friendship by using Notion to organize their lives—and they were talking about it on TikTok. In viral videos, Gen Z power users would show off the ways they’d customized Notion to help them get more out of their hobbies and to collaborate on school projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, on New Year’s Day in 2021, as Notion workers were relaxing at home, Kothari and Zhao started getting alerts saying Notion had crashed. They’d seen it coming, says Zhao, like a Doomsday clock. Every day of the pandemic added more users, and they were running out of database storage. They knew they needed to move Notion onto multiple databases, but they hadn’t prioritized it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bleary from the night before, Notion team members suddenly had to explain to their roommates, spouses and kids that they had to work. The site was down for four nerve-wracking hours. “It was pretty much all hands on deck,” Kothari says. Zhao remembers eight-hour Zooms, day after day, after the crash. For the next six months, the company stopped building new features and instead focused on strengthening its infrastructure and migrating to multiple databases. When the work was done, the company celebrated with Zoom karaoke, complete with custom lyrics to “Amazing Grace.” Zhao, of course, has a copy stored on one of his Notion workspaces. “It was probably one of the best investments we made,” says Kothari. “Because the investments we made there allowed us to build Notion in a way that it could serve the teenagers using Notion for their use cases all the way to big enterprises using it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>Kothari and Zhao think a lot about those big enterprises. Today, they are transitioning as a business from a startup to a mature company, and transitioning as a product from a tool with a cult following—the kind that people namedrop in Twitter profiles to show tech-design cred—to a tool used by the world’s largest companies. Growth has been rapid since the 2021 investments. As of summer 2022, Notion, which has 70 percent of its users outside of America, had opened offices in Dublin, New York City, Tokyo and Hyderabad, and had onboarded 300 employees, up from about 45 last year. The company is hiring for about 75 more positions. Competition to tell a compelling story to big companies is fierce. Other startups are working to build out similar capabilities; in 2021, Google Workplace added something like Notion’s interconnectivity with the launch of Smart Canvas, and Microsoft has done the same for 365 with its Fluid Framework upgrade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao’s early insights about what makes software ubiquitous—the ability to help people solve everyday life or work problems as easily and intuitively as a document editor—is now a key selling point. Notion leaders focus on explaining how, for the everyday office worker, it can be used “out of the box.” People and teams can customize it to greater and greater degrees, but average users can install it and start working immediately, using templates in the Notion catalog. In another move toward ubiquity, Notion launched the beta version of its public API in 2021, enabling developers to connect Notion to payment systems and customer relationship managers, further rooting it in a workplace software ecosystem. To make Notion more competitive, the company recently acquired the calendaring company Cron, the software-building company Flowdash, and the cloud integration and workflow automation platform Automate.io.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kothari and Zhao talk about this moment as still the “early innings” of Notion, and see Notion 1.0 as about lists, Notion 2.0 as about databases and the upcoming Notion 3.0 as about whole workflows. For example, they want to make Notion capable of publishing into varied content management systems with one click of a button. To do this, within the next 18 months or so, they will improve Notion’s project management capabilities, among other features, giving the software the final “Lego bricks” it needs to take on most SaaS companies, says Zhao.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a perfect world, Zhao sees the next iteration of Notion as changing life as profoundly as the iPhone changed people’s personal and work habits. “The iPhone totally opened up creation,” Zhao says. “There is a before and an after.” To grow the user base enough to drive this change, Zhao says it will take more than 18 months, of course: “In the next 5 to 10 years, Notion could be the front-end infrastructure for the world. Notion takes care of search, notifications, permissions. Just dream of a piece of software, and you should just be able to build that using Notion.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao’s vision of creating a community of people empowered to make computers help them be more creative and productive has remained constant. Vernal tells a story about Zhao pitching Sequoia by walking through the last 50 years of computing history, with a <a href="https://www.notion.so/about">narrative arc</a> showing Notion as the next step in decades of iterations. “I thought it was the single best pitch I’d ever seen in my time here, a work of art,” he says. “And multiple other people told me that was one of the best pitches that they had seen at Sequoia.”<br><br>That story he told to Sequoia is the one Zhao started piecing together in college, when he read Engelbart’s paper about how humans could someday use computers to become more powerful problem solvers. It’s a story about how for years before Notion, so many pieces of software were just digitized versions of analog office tools—typewriters, file cabinets, desktop ledgers replaced by online document editors, databases and spreadsheets. Today, with tens of thousands of templates circulating, Notion reflects that when millions of people are empowered to make their own online tools, they mostly design trackers, project management tools and elaborate tables. Already today, some Notion-adjacent businesses are making more than $1 million a year by designing clever templates. On Etsy alone, there are tens of thousands of templates—meal planning, creating an astrology journal, and bootstrapping startup operations. But it won’t always look like this, says Zhao and Kothari. As Notion’s features become more robust, the tools we make with it will become more complex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the early days, 40 years ago, when personal computing started, the lines were blurry. The computing pioneers thought everybody would make their own tools, make their own software,” Zhao says, returning to a favorite idea. “And Notion’s mission is about software tool-making.” Even if those tools just look like black-and-not-quite-white document editors at first.</p>

 Meet our new hire — Kelsey Veldman, Junior Marketing Manager <p>#17 — This is the seventeenth post in our “Meet our new hire” series, where we introduce you to the latest additions to our team here at BlockWallet.</p><p>We’d like to welcome our latest team member, Kelsey Veldman! Kelsey is a well-rounded marketing manager with experience in managing marketing content, overseeing social media accounts, and pushing out project updates to the community. At BlockWallet, Kelsey plays a pivotal role in supporting the day-to-day marketing activities at BlockWallet.</p> What’s your job position? <p>I’m a junior-marketing manager at BlockWallet, and I support BlockWallets mission&nbsp;by:</p>  Working alongside marketing on the latest campaigns  Helping to keep our community up to date on our social platforms  Monitor feedback on our social platforms around user experience and features so our team can consider adding these to our&nbsp;roadmap   Which projects have you worked on&nbsp;before? <p>I’ve been part of the team at a decentralized finance platform, managing the marketing content, social media accounts, and project updates to our community.</p> When did you first get involved in&nbsp;crypto? <p>I’ve been involved with crypto professionally for over a year now. But my personal interest peaked in 2020 when I began following projects, keeping up to date with market trends and the progress crypto was making on the traditional markets. I’ve been investing in crypto since 2020, and I’ve been hooked ever since. I knew I wanted to understand more and grow my knowledge, and there’s nowhere better than with BlockWallet.</p> What made you interested in BlockWallet? <p>I did a lot of research trying to grow my knowledge in crypto, grow my portfolio, and also join an exciting crypto startup like BlockWallet. Overall, the product is what got me really interested. The focus on privacy and security resonated with me, and in addition to that, they had a stunning user experience. I couldn’t wait to jump on board. The team is amazing and everything about the role excited me! Marketing, crypto, and people orientated!</p> Why do you think privacy matters on blockchains? <p>Blockchain technology is built around data security, using both private and public keys to secure our data. Without privacy, we are constantly at risk of hacks and theft. No one wants their personal information freely available for anyone to access, and this is what blockchain promises.</p> Do you have any predictions on where crypto will be 5 years from&nbsp;now? <p>I think crypto adoption is inevitable. We see more and more countries accepting crypto as a form of payment and I think NFTs will find real-world use cases in our daily lives. My belief is that crypto will continue to grow until it’s embedded into everyone’s daily&nbsp;lives.</p> Parting thoughts <p>I’m really excited to have joined such a great team and look forward to connecting with the community more, bringing you all the latest updates, and watching the growth that BlockWallet is on track&nbsp;for.</p> About BlockWallet <p>BlockWallet is a privacy-first self-custodial browser extension wallet where you can store, send or receive crypto and interact with your favorite blockchain apps privately.</p><p>As crypto sees mainstream adoption, blockchain’s lack of privacy often translates to security risks. BlockWallet is here to ensure that on-chain privacy does not lag behind. The wallet provides a set of advanced privacy tools wrapped in a familiar and user-friendly wallet experience, eliminating friction and making privacy accessible for everyone.</p><p>BlockWallet protects you and ensures privacy by default. When you make transactions or interact with blockchain apps, BlockWallet routes all node requests through Privacy Proxies, which mask the IP address and other metadata, that can be used to identify and track you on a blockchain. BlockWallet offers integrated Flash-Bot Protection, shielding you from sandwich attacks when you trade on DEXes. Meanwhile, the Phishing Protection feature helps you combat phishing scams by generating unique artwork on all sensitive pages.</p><p>BlockWallet is not a compromise. It’s privacy-first, but it still packs all features you would expect from a wallet. With full Web 3.0 support, the wallet allows you to connect to any&nbsp;DApp.</p><p>Become a part of the BlockWallet community today:</p><p><a href="https://blockwallet.io/">Homepage</a> | <a href="https://blockwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/GetBlockWallet">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/blockwallet">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/69gvNKatdb">Discord</a> | <a href="https://discord.com/invite/EKVZ2xWXEH">GitHub</a> |&nbsp;<a href="http://hello@blockwallet.io/">E-mail</a></p>

 Making privacy features on Findora easier for EVM developers. <p>Developers building on Findora’s EVM can utilize zero-knowledge privacy features of the UTXO layer with an upcoming enhancement currently under development.</p> Simplifying Privacy For EVM Developers <p>Findora currently offers auditable privacy on its UTXO ledger, but how do EVM developers take advantage of Findora’s zero-knowledge privacy features without having to learn new functions? An enhancement under development works to resolve that by allowing a way for developers to conduct private transactions on Findora’s EVM through an&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>At the moment, sending confidential transactions requires routing that transaction through the UTXO layer, which is parallelized to the EVM ledger. The current EVM does not support private transactions, making it necessary to build on the UTXO side with Findora’s zero-knowledge library. Findora’s EVM Privacy enhancement solves this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>To make it easier for developers to integrate Findora privacy features, the teams are working on an SDK solution that relies on pre-compiled contracts for plug-’n-play composability. EVM and Solidity Developers wouldn’t need to know Rust, UTXO, or zero-knowledge proofs, but instead, simply call a function from the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>With the upcoming SDK, transactions can be automatically sent to the UTXO side for zero-knowledge privacy functions, and then sent to the EVM chain. The EVM developer will only need to use solidity to add privacy functions, using the same familiar calls and&nbsp;methods.</p><p>The architecture is still being developed but, when implemented, will give developers a whole new level of freedom to integrate privacy into their dApps. Simply put, EVM developers won’t need to learn a new language or framework to implement privacy solutions into their dApps on&nbsp;Findora.</p> Why Privacy Does Not Mix with an EVM Environment <p>EVM compatibility requires feature parity with Ethereum. Since Ethereum lacks native privacy features, native privacy features are unable to be directly implemented on Findora’s EVM environment and other EVM-compatible chains. This raises the question, how will Findora accomplish confidential transfers while maintaining feature parity with Ethereum?</p><p>Findora confidential transfers are possible because of the zero-knowledge cryptography on its UTXO chain, and that chain is parallelized with the EVM ledger through <a href="https://docs.findora.org/prism/overview">Prism Transfer</a>. Using Findora, EVM dApps can access private transactions only by being routed over Prism to Findora’s UTXO chain, and that architecture won’t change. However, to prevent developers from needing to understand UTXO and ZK, the team is working on an SDK solution to make life&nbsp;easy.</p> Putting Developers First <p>Once deployed, developers can quickly add privacy functions to their EVM&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>For example, a team might build a confidential version of gofundme on the blockchain that protects donors’ wallet addresses, or set up an on-chain payroll system that won’t broadcast workers’ salaries on-chain. Confidential transfers are an important part of any financial system, and they will be easy to integrate through Findora’s upcoming EVM privacy&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>Findora aims to give developers room for more creativity. Please share your thoughts not only on the proposed architecture but also on how dApps could leverage the technology.</p><p>To join the conversation, make suggestions, or offer ideas on how to improve documentation, please join Findora’s <a href="https://discord.com/channels/789009413976883220/890233521417908255">Developer support channel</a> on Discord or join the official <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Findora&nbsp;Reddit</a>.</p> About Findora <p>Scaling privacy for the future of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability.

 “If Science Can Save Us…” — BlueYard Conversations over Dinner in&nbsp;London <p>Scientific discovery drives technological change that leads humans to flourish. From climate breakdown, to shortages of essential resources, to existential threats that imperile our democratic systems, the need for a radical acceleration of scientific progress and breakthrough technology is more urgent than ever, and will be a defining challenge of this decade. Further, not only will scientific breakthroughs be essential, but also bringing these technologies to market and mass adoption, with sustainable economic&nbsp;models.</p><p>But “if science can save us,” we will need to exponentially multiply our science and engineering resources and abilities, unleash more entrepreneurial talent, repurpose vast amounts of long-term oriented capital, and foster a more urgent global political dialogue to increase the probability that we can overcome these challenges quickly enough in our lifetimes to make a difference. We will also need clear security and ethical frameworks to ensure this is not humanity’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter#The_Great_Filter">great filter</a>&nbsp;moment.</p><p>To help foster a conversation and share insights, on Thursday the 13th of October BlueYard is hosting an evening of conversations over dinner in London, with short talks and open conversations with leading entrepreneurs, scientists, and policy makers in the space. As always, attendance is invite-only and limited to 75–100 people, to ensure high-quality interactions.</p><p>The evening will include a keynote address by Astronomer Royal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Rees">Sir Martin Rees</a> centered around his forthcoming book: If Science is to Save Us, and short talks / open conversations with leading scientists, entrepreneurs, and policy-makers including <a href="https://www.silverlining.ngo/executive-director">Kelly Wanser</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lynas">Mark Lynas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryony_Worthington,_Baroness_Worthington">Baroness Bryony Worthington</a>, <a href="https://obifelten.com/about-obi/">Obi Felton</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Seldon">Sir Anthony&nbsp;Seldon</a>.</p><p>The event is at capacity, but we have reserved a handful of remaining seats for entrepreneurs, scientists, and curious minds from all corners of the intellectual world — if you are interested in attending, <a href="https://blueyard.typeform.com/to/pvGx9o0o">kindly register here</a> and we will get back to you&nbsp;shortly.</p><p>BlueYard is committed to keep our events safe and open to all. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OISqevTub7Q1DJO9Cn0bSlS4LHumXGGgLc7yIVI85sg/edit">View our code of conduct&nbsp;here.</a></p>

<p>For the past seven years, a dear friend who’s been in the trenches with me fighting the securitization of vulnerable populations as human data commodities on blockchain got drawn into a two-day webinar with well-known influencers in the crypto-skeptic space. She’d been excited about the opportunity to connect with an international network of people working on shared concerns. I know that hopeful feeling one gets when encountering a new group of folks who seem to get some parts of the puzzle but still have significant gaps. It’s a tantalizing opportunity to think you may be able to help fill in some of those holes, make a difference, and bring clarity to our collective understanding of the problem.</p>
<p>She did a great job. Her ten-minute presentation on ed-tech, impact finance, and blockchain identity starts at timestamp 15 minutes in the video below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This friend was the person who worked with the NAACP at the state and national level to pass a resolution opposing the requirement that any person obtains a blockchain digital identity to access public services, including public education, health services, food assistance, shelter, or legal support in the judicial system. You can find the text of that very timely (July 2019) resolution <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6028594bfa7b4d7d140a17b2/t/602b4d35ab0deb12bbc2b449/1613450551237/2019-Resolutions.pdf">here</a>; simply do a keyword search for “blockchain.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>She gave me invaluable insight into pay-for-success finance and how it presented in Silicon Valley at its earliest stages. I wrote a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/12/22/silicon-valley-a-laboratory-of-smart-surveillance-and-privatization/">blog post</a> about the early pilot deals in December 2018. At the time, we had no idea that bio-computation and epi-genetics were being woven into prediction markets in human futures (see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnNSjVGWqTO56_VtHPIAbU4Nt1itLeOSn">interview series</a> Jason Bosch, Leo Saraceno, and I did on Atomic Ecologies for background on that). So much has happened over the past five years and so quickly that it’s been hard to catch a breath to reflect on where we’ve been. What’s clear to me is that the ties between global finance, emerging tech, and California’s fraught, unresolved history of eugenics can no longer be ignored. I’m looking forward to the trip Jason and I have planned to the Eureka state to conduct field visits and try and rebalance some of these harmful energies in November. We’ll keep you updated from the road, so be sure to subscribe to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AlisonMcDowell/videos">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for this friend, I probably wouldn’t have taken the time to dive deeply into this anti-crypto spectacle. But I was curious, and to be honest, the more I looked into who was behind this event, the more curious I got. If you follow my work, you’ll know I am no fan of crypto-currency and see its many failings. My primary concern, however, has always been the smart contract layer, digital identity in “smart environments,” risk analytics tied to “pay for success” financial dealings, and speculation on natural life. While many entered into the blockchain space as a financial hobby, I entered the door where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1BmJKCAR7I&amp;t=7738s">Shaun Conway</a> and impact investors planned to carry out data surveillance on toddlers in government-subsidized <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2018/08/14/digital-colonialism-south-africa-puts-preschoolers-on-the-blockchain/">South African pre-k programs</a> as a test run for global futures trading in behavioral compliance.</p>
<p>When you enter the “<a href="https://readynation.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/db_files/Kauffman-ReadyNation%20PKSE%20Report%2012041922.pdf">invest in kids bonds</a>” door knowing there are plans to create asset-backed securities in toddlers and trade them (and perhaps short them) on global markets, the single-minded interrogation of cryptocurrency exchanges and NFT rip-offs feels woefully inadequate. If the stakes weren’t so high, it might be amusing to watch folks who’ve been swimming in the shark-infested waters of financial derivatives for years point fingers decrying crypto-Ponzi-schemers. Calls for better regulation and professed empathy for those who lost their savings to fraudulent digital money schemes ring a bit hollow once you realize many of the panelists’ livelihoods are intertwined with the same financial interests, journalism outlets, and think tanks that were enmeshed in the crash of the global economy via toxic-real estate debt products. These are the same folks who are now in the process of developing the risk modeling, tokenomics, and APIs needed to run the smart “Ricardian” contract, “sustainably resilient,” open-air prison.</p>

<a href="https://archive.ph/MiIgn">https://archive.ph/MiIgn</a>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201123225052/https://littlesis.org/oligrapher/5759-securitized-income-sharing-agreements">https://web.archive.org/web/20201123225052/https://littlesis.org/oligrapher/5759-securitized-income-sharing-agreements</a>
<p>Our shared mixed reality panopticon is constantly remade through the cognitive warfare of algorithmic information management. Curated language and narrative tropes are strategically wielded in perpetual skirmishes of semiotics and steganography. Every data point you feed the machine is a psychometric goldmine. They know what you want to hear, manipulate your hopes and fears, and tell you just enough to keep you wondering and coming back for more. We’re wandering around in a Sugarscape simulation, an artificial society where only a fraction of the world’s population comprehends the game’s rules, the stakes, or how deep the illusion goes. That goes for what passes as “the resistance,” too.</p>
<p>The more I research, the more I’ve come to appreciate the challenge of pinning down “reality.” Each of us lives our version of the “reality” story burdened by tragically incomplete access to information, misunderstood motivations, hidden alliances, and communication snafus. The world’s a stage. We are players, whether we realize it or not. The master screenwriter tosses out last-minute script edits with plot twists that demand skillful improvisation and suspension of disbelief. The show must go on, so I keep moving through the next scene, the next act, hoping for moments of clarity as I try to stay ahead of the alt-consensus-reality apparatus. I hope that for the small audience that appreciates my outsider mom perspective, I can pierce the veil here and there to warn of potential misdirection, landmines, and conceptual boxed canyons.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I spent many hours watching videos from the two-day event, scanning the landscape of the people and institutions involved. Among them were <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adjoint-distributed-ledger-technology-and-smart-contracts-for-real-world-finance-72a5cd83e063">Adjoint, Inc.</a> (smart contract financial settlement), Systemics (Ian Grigg’s <a href="https://cryptome.org/jya/digigold.htm">DigiGold</a> infrastructure, <a href="https://iang.org/papers/triple_entry.html">triple-entry accounting</a>, and <a href="http://www.systemics.com/docs/ricardo/issuer/contract.html">Ricardian smart contracts</a>), Brookings Institute (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/product/impact-bonds/">educational impact bonds</a> and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Chapter-Five_Breakthrough.pdf">interspecies currency</a>), <a href="https://cebma.org/">Centre for Evidence-Based Management</a> (international NGO promoting data analytics of the kind that will be needed to run social impact deals), Bloomberg News, and The Financial Times. There were mid-level digerati promoting books and blogs whose larger purpose, as I saw it, seemed to be to obscure and dismiss the predatory nature of tokenized life in Web 3.0.</p>
<p>The symposium was organized by self-described crypto-skeptics Steven Diehl and Darren Tseng, finance sector programmers. They’ve been quite effective stepping into their assigned enthusiastic “callow geek” roles. Just a couple of well-intentioned young men looking to save the world from Bitcoin libertarians and Ponzi schemes, right? Pull back the curtain, and the plot thickens a bit. The excerpt below is from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210704193305/http:/internetofagreements.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-Stephen-Diehl-Transcript.pdf">transcript</a> of Diehl’s <a href="http://internetofagreements.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PDF-Stephen-Diehl-Transcript.pdf">presentation</a> on October 13, 2017, at Mattereum’s “Internet of Agreements” conference in London, focusing on coded law and smart contracts.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFlu61wJe2Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFlu61wJe2Y</a>
<p>“What does Adjoint Inc. do? I’m the CTO of this company, and we’re here in London. The boring side of our business is we create settlement networks for creating executable forms of industry standard contracts, like ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) and EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) agreements, for modeling the structure of financial products, such as derivatives, swaps, options on mutually distributed ledgers.</p>
<p>I don’t work in the public chain database at Adjoint; I work on private server networks between financial institutions, such as (something missing here, but this is the way it was stated in the transcript). Primarily we look at modeling executable forms of OTC derivatives contracts, and I’m particularly focused on taking a description of the semantics that involve the temporary rights and obligations of counterparties that are party to a derivatives trade, modeling that as code, and then putting that on a distributed database so that we can have more efficient settlement systems. The more interesting part of our business is that we also spend quite a bit of time doing research and development on what I would call third and fourth-generation blockchains. I do a bunch of research and development on verifiable computing and formal methods, things like zk-SNARKs (Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) and reasoning about the semantics of contracts formally.” Stephen Diehl</p>
<p>Vinay Gupta, head of <a href="http://internetofagreements.com/">Mattereum</a> and host of the event where Diehl spoke, was strategic architect of Joseph Lubin’s Consensys, an organization that has been working diligently since 2017 to frame out the infrastructure needed to scale DeFi, ReFi, and “green pill” social impact finance. This isn’t just about making ESG portfolios and stakeholder capitalism more accountable and efficient. A second goal, which may ultimately supersede creative debt finance as a force shaping society to fit cybernetic circuits, is the aggregation of impact tokens meant to fuel the machine learning that will refine artificial intelligence and possibly catalyze the Singularity.</p>
<p>Throughout the conference, most panelists downplayed Web 3 and blockchain, often asserting that there were no viable use cases and that these technologies didn’t solve any existing need. This was repeatedly stated by a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-pritchard-b6a9424/">gentleman</a> who had formerly served as a managing director in JP Morgan’s global technology office and a VP of their derivatives operations. His point was that distributed ledger technology is not new. This is correct; the concept dates back at least to the 1990s. However, at that time, there wasn’t the capacity to scale the sensor networks, unique digital identifiers, NEMs, and MEMs required to build out socio-technical / cyber-physical environments. He left JP Morgan in 2017 for greener fin-tech consulting pastures.</p>
<p>Had he stayed through the 2020 sale of the firm’s Quorum Enterprise Ethereum Platform to Consensys, he likely would have had a better handle on the role the smart contract layer plays in the financial settlement space. It is interesting to consider how derivatives and human capital management could one day interface in a matrix of embedded contracts operating in service of prediction markets and real-time risk analysis. One place to keep an eye on is Dallas, Texas, where the StriveTogether affiliate Commit has partnered with JP Morgan on block-chained cradle-to-career pathways for “opportunity youth.” For now, most people don’t recognize these pathways as cybernetic governance systems mediated by blockchain technology. Greenlight Credential’s competency-based transcripts store health and mental health data as badges. RedCritter NFT “good behavior” tokens train children to jump hoops for scrip at the ed-tech equivalent of the company store. Both are twenty-first-century upgrades to B.F. Skinner’s pigeon pellets. Rather than being trained to guide missiles with programmed pecks, tomorrow’s children will be taught to code immersive “reality” and digital “trust.”</p>
<p>The world planned by the technician class is meant to run on tokens, and Eric Schmidt and Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2kOmSh4h84&amp;t=147s">super excited about that</a>. In such a future, we would have infinite contracts with the built environment that would require us to deposit the proper token to activate X, Y, or Z “opportunity.” It is a whole new perspective on the “payment” space that requires us to reimagine “money” more abstractly – more like my friend Jason Bosch’s idea of “freedom tokens.” As such, the payment space is something we should all be keeping an eye on, especially now that “cross-border” payments get muddier in an extended reality where we may end up exchanging tokens with virtual machines living “in the cloud.”</p>
<p>I found it interesting that the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-ruth-wandh%C3%B6fer-523b22/?originalSubdomain=uk">former chair of PSR</a>, the Payment Systems Regulator, was a symposium panelist. PSR is an NGO created as part of the UK Treasury’s Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act of 2013. This woman moderated a discussion about crypto regulation with a <a href="https://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/diamond-stephen/">corporate governance law professor</a> based at Santa Clara, the Jesuit University embedded in early California pay-for-success pilots, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1509876128508526592">SEC cybercrime investigator</a> who teaches at Georgetown and Duke Law. All three schools are major promoters of social impact finance. The cybercrime investigator didn’t seem to realize Web 3 is about digital ID and the industrial internet of things, prerequisites for ushering in globalization 4.0 and remote robotic labor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto wallets and Bored Ape NFTs have been offered as Hegelian-dialectic appetizers, delectable snacks, and a caloric boost to fuel narratives to nudge us towards “solutions” we’re told will restore civil society’s “social contract.” Such an approach could meld distributed ledger technology and ubiquitous edge computing to “serve” us “better”! All the fraudulent greed and crassness we find assaulting our senses promises to be cleared away as so many crumbs on fine linen tablecloth before the main course, UN Sustainable Goal-aligned e-government solutions wedded to Microsoft’s Planetary computer and Ervin Laszlo’s World Homeostat, arrives. That is the end game, managed life (Kubernetes, cybernetics) using nano-tech track and trace energy economics interwoven with infinite unseen contractual arrangements.&nbsp; Maybe the guy’s long thread making a case for blockchain and Web 3 being inconsequential was an inside joke.</p>

<p>It was posted on April Fool’s Day, and these folks love signaling each other, presuming the rest of us are dupes and oblivious to the ongoing rotten game. If and when the Web 3 rollout will become viable remains an open question. However, in my opinion, it would be folly to imagine the financial interests standing behind Adjoint, Inc. aren’t pouring money into blockchain, machine learning, sensor networks, molecular engineering, and quantum computing to realize this mechanical delusion. Throughout those two days, there was sleight of hand uplifting blockchain and Bitcoin as straw men to be gleefully knocked down. These people are experts and must know where things are headed with DLT (distributed ledger technology) in the financial derivatives space. Or, if they don’t, they should have their salaries and book royalties held back until they get up to speed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/havellrodrigues/">Havell Rodrigues</a>, a hedge fund manager interested in impact finance and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, launched Adjoint, Inc. in 2016. By 2018 it had expanded internationally with offices in Houston, London, and Zug, Switzerland, the hub of the crypto valley. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andras-miklos/details/experience/">Andras Miklos</a>, formerly senior project manager at Credit Suisse, where he “developed a business intelligence and benchmarking model for assessing the strategy of the UK Private Banking business” and a “financial planning model for the Luxembourg Platform enhancement strategy of the Private Banking and Wealth Management division,” briefly headed Adjoint’s Zug office before climbing the ladder to become treasurer of the board of the Swiss Finance and Technology Association and vice president of digital custody systems for State Street Digital in Zurich. It is unclear if Adjoint is still operating. I could not find a website; there was a dead end on the company’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/adjoint/">LinkedIn page</a>, “<a href="http://adjoint.io/">nosuchbucket</a>,” and Rodrigues’s profile dates his tenure there from August 2016 to August 2021. Tseng’s LinkedIn features Adjoint as his current employer, and it seems logical that if that had changed, he would have made those updates in advance of this much-lauded event.</p>
<p>At a 2017 Mattereum conference Diehl and another panelist Ian Grigg who developed third-party accounting and Ricardian Contracts, legally enforceable smart contracts for financial instruments, in the 1990s were interviewed by Jason Louv. Someone gave me a heads-up in the comments of one of my videos that Louv is an Austin-based practitioner of Enochian chaos magic at Ultraculture. He has written for Vice, Boing Boing, Motherboard and authored several books, including one on John Dee. Last year Louv interviewed Vinay Gupta, head of Mattereum, for his <a href="https://podcast.magick.me/ep-15-vinay-gupta-on-meditation-enlightenment-and-saving-the-world/">podcast</a>. Gupta, a consultant to the military, corporations, and the Open-Source community on how to save the world with blockchain and micro-insurance spackle, was among the presenters at the Mormon Transhumanist Association conference on Blockchain this past March.</p>

<p>I sense that the Diehl, Grigg, Gupta triangle is significant. Web 3 is meant to become a matrix of energetic entanglements where “money” and eventually “compliant behavior impact tokens” will be exchanged to make social values and relationships visible to the machine where they can be analyzed and regulated. Grigg was experimenting with complementary currencies as “beautiful money” back in 2005-2006 with a <a href="http://www.monochrom.at/flowerbank/index-en.htm">Digital Pressed Flower Currency</a> project carried out in association with media artist <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3654931/">Johannes Grenzfurthner</a> and philosopher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO9afSeA15g">Stefan Lutschinger</a> in Amstetten, Austria. I made a six-minute video about their project linking it to Mexico’s conditional cash transfer program and Julian Huxley’s research into the metamorphosis of the axolotl a few weeks ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the symposium’s panelists was affiliated with the Brookings Institute, a think tank promoting Johnathan Ledgard’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Chapter-Five_Breakthrough.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1665283702162835&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LBSNrbhhh8_cEbayl1lm4">interspecies currency</a>. Energy exchanges through meta-data tagged digital currency will be mediated through invisible contracts like all those “terms and conditions” boxes you click through to use digital products. You know, the ones most of us don’t read, but we click “agree” anyway? And if we did read ALL the text and didn’t agree with some aspect of the arrangement, then what?</p>
<p>Another participant represented the Center for Responsible Lending; an NGO set up to protect low-income people from predatory debt traps. The organization spun out Self-Help, a community development operation active in the affordable housing space, read Opportunity Zones, where histories of redlining are now being turned into money-laundering vehicles for giant real estate portfolio holders. A few years back, Martin Eakes, founder of the Center for Responsible Lending, lauded Bank of America, with whom he had partnered, for creating SafeBalance Banking, where people would not be able to overdraw their accounts. The spin was about saving people from costly fees, but in the back of my mind, I’m thinking about <a href="https://www.iedigital.com/resources/press-releases/worlds-first-internet-of-things-bank-helps-you-take-control-of-your-finances-and-kerb-overspending">ieDigital’s shocking wearables</a> that zap a person when they get close to their balance or turn down the heat in their homes. Such things are now possible with Web 3 Internet of Things banking. Who is being protected? Families falling into the ever growing pit comprising the working poor? Or “too big to fail” banks?</p>

<p>What if you don’t want a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://informationsecuritybuzz.com/articles/worlds-first-internet-things-bank-gives-electric-shock-spend-much-cash/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1665283766167416&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_D-T64hn91OQFp44WnNpl">Pavlok shock bracelet</a> linked to your Universal Basic Income debit card? It’s not as though you will be able to ask for a custom contract to which you would agree. It’s all being rigidly coded into the “open,” “distributed,” and “resilient” Metaverse ledger – <a href="https://www.lamina1.com/">Lamina1.</a> That ledger isn’t a person by design. They don’t want us to trust people who may tap into their humanity, opt to make exceptions to the rules, and not carry out the dictates of the code with fidelity. So many of the mind games being played out, the polarization and betrayals of confidence and shifting alliances, are intended to break ground for the coming mathematical reality written about in 1921 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Zamyatin">Yevgeny Zamyatin</a> in his novel about totalitarian world order in “We.” Trust mathematics, not humans. That is the prevailing message.</p>
<p>What do you do if you don’t agree to the terms but are compelled to use the product anyway? Eventually, those terms won’t just be for apps but will be necessary for access to buildings, “mobility solutions,” payment systems, public spaces, and so on. We all check those boxes and hope our agreement doesn’t come back to haunt us in the future. We have no idea about all the things to which we’ve technically agreed. They know to hide everything in the fine print. Sometimes they even change the terms and conditions later, sending a courtesy email to keep you advised on the rules of the updated game.&nbsp; I’ll bet Stanford’s smart toilets will have lots of fine print. These contracts will be linked to simulation modeling and predictive analytics around risk. In a presentation given by Gupta at a 2017 Dutch Blockchain Coalition gathering, “Deep Dive into Identities,” titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR1UOU-YEE">How Blockchain Can Change Our World,</a>” he describes a future scenario where our digital identities are patched together with sets of “claims” about us backed by insurance guarantees. One of his slides states: “As long as someone will insure you, you exist.” Think about that.</p>

<p>That is the world we’re allowing to be built for nature and future generations, because we cannot or will not make the time to understand what is unfolding, look at the labyrinth’s walls, grab the string, and walk out. Another crypto-skeptic panelist, an affiliate of the Oxford Internet Institute, wrote the textbook on in-game virtual economies, not unlike a labyrinth, and how they were a good thing and could teach us many lessons. That, of course, is the logical end game for the growth imperative of capital. The next generation, the children, the refugees, the prisoners, and the working poor, will be coerced into coding a cloud-based empire interwoven with cutting-edge military psychological technologies. It will be B.F. Skinner’s maze of tokenized behavior pellets. Thanks to Google, Niantic, and In-Q-Tel, we can continue to grow our consumption of goods and services while generating data to fuel the machine learning that seeks to steal the sacred and substitute flimsy, profane simulacra.</p>
<p>Of course, no one will want to live inside that story. So, to drive the plot forward, the focus must be kept on use cases around unregulated digital money, ludicrous assets, and toxic celebrity. My friend’s presentation shone a light off this narrow path, but a person can only do so much with ten minutes of airtime. Unpacking the implications of what it will mean to live on the blockchain through digitally twinned social constructs mediated by artificial intelligence in an in-depth manner would probably result in most people walking out of the theater prematurely. They can’t have that, right?</p>
<p>Those bigger-picture conversations, for now, are primarily had in smoky back rooms among the deep-pocketed backers of the big show – the ESG social impact investor crowd. I’ll note here that the event included the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jprangaswami/details/experience/">former head data scientist</a> for Salesforce and Deutsche Bank, simply listed as a financial technologist on the video, as well as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-pritchard-b6a9424/?originalSubdomain=uk">former Managing Director in derivatives for JP Morgan</a> and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/deteran/details/experience/">head of corporate affairs for SWIFT</a> from 2013-2019 who’s more recently been serving as a member of the Bank of England’s Central Bank Digital Currency Engagement Forum. While it may appear a low-budget enterprise with videos that have under a thousand views, this symposium was definitely within the sphere of influence of powerful players in the derivatives finance and data analytics space.</p>
<p>The event included a keynote by a colleague of Robert Hertzberg, the state senator proposing California’s digital identity legislation. This US Representative from Sherman Oaks, CA has come out strongly against crypto currencies while being silent on Web 3.0. A former Berkeley professor quit over the amount of crypto money flowing into his department. As a theoretical example, the self-described mad scientist offered an “institute of demonology” in his remarks about sketchy crypto funding sources in the academy, which called to mind a <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Golem-of-Prague-The-Golem-of-Rehovoth-Gershom-Scholem-Commentary-Magazine.pdf">1966 article</a> about Chaim Pekeris and the Golem of Rehovoth supercomputer. I emailed him to see if he knew of it, but I never got a response. I found it interesting that he named his firm, one that provides cybersecurity for the UAVs that will patrol our shared extended reality prison, Skerry (Scary?) Technologies. This refers to tiny islands of individual consciousness in Neil Gaiman’s Sandman Series “The Game of You.” Make Bitcoin the bogeyman. Stop short of extending one’s analysis to cyber-physical environments designed to “learn” us through digital surveillance, including from the bird’s eye view. Life is less complicated, and the story holds together better, with more explanatory coherence, if you can silo off uncomfortable information and make it someone else’s concern.</p>
<p>Seeing a black swan at the beginning of the UK MP’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZl-R8y92C8">presentation</a> was odd. He’s with the Cooperative Party, which took advantage of the lockdowns to push Universal Basic Income in April 2020. He also just happens to be a leader in sustainable finance and leans towards the Malthusian population control side because it’s, well…” green.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several folks from El Salvador were brought in to attest to the ineffectual Bitcoin rollout in their country in tandem with increasingly brutal-authoritarian tactics by President Bukele. No mention of the 2007 Interamerican Development Bank arrangement setting up conditional cash transfers tied to low-income women and children’s education and health compliance in El Salvador. Better to keep everyone focused on the Chivo wallets, wallets that most citizens only activated to get the sign-on payment and then discarded, rather than explore what is on the horizon with blockchain digitization of Latin America’s public benefits systems. Once these skeptics get rid of unregulated, predatory crypto wallets the World Bank will sweep in and give the youth of Latin American (Africa, India, Polynesia) some variant on The Learning Economy Foundation’s UN Sustainable Development Goals “Learn Card.” In the new blockchain education economy “opportunity youth” will play online games and be psychometrically profiled as social impact data commodities while stacking up educational badges and tallying up the digital scrip their families need to survive. </p>

<p>It is these youth that the producers of the masque have tapped to do the grunt work of coding and securing the empire for the digital conquistadors. No one mentioned <a href="https://nftportal.co/salesforce-launches-nft-cloud-program-for-brands-to-mint-and-sell-nfts/">Salesforce stepping into the NFT space</a> (panelist JP Rangaswami’s old firm). Can Soulbound Tokens be far behind? Probably not, given the planned role of the company’s <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B5dm5EAB">Social Suite dashboard services</a> for ESG impact finance reporting. Speak of Bukele but not of the next iteration where structural adjustment demands poor nations mortgage their children as improvable human capital. Stay silent about tech <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/18/18097398/salesforce-contract-customs-border-protection-marc-benioff-immigration">companies that operate in the social impact space</a> while maintaining contracts with Customs and Border Control. </p>
<p>In this crypto spectacle, Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert gleefully play over-the-top, villainous “ugly Americans” shilling Bitcoin alongside Bukele, the young, malleable leader tapped by digital conquistadors to create conditions, through brutal measures and generous payouts no doubt, that will pave the way for a new kind of leader, one who will transparently facilitate the implemetantion of billionaire-backed universal basic income, an efficient and accountable socio-technical infrastructure intended to enmesh El Salvador’s children and their families in Web3 “progress” as digital compliance assets. The greed and crassness of volcano-powered Bitcoin is a perfect foil against which to roll out UBI in an attempt to pull Latin America’s robust informal economy into the digital enclosures.</p>

<p>One of the more meta conversations involved a two-part discussion of storytelling in the crypto-sphere by an actor who grew up in Austin, earned a degree in politics and economics at UVA, and became the main protagonist in the show Gotham. Gotham is also an AI data analytics platform developed by Palantir for government agencies. Through its low-bono technical assistance “philanthropy,” Palantir” was the third-party verifier for early pay-for-success finance deals in mental health and homelessness. The Gotham actor described crypto as an energetic social contagion. On that point, I wholeheartedly agree.</p>
<p>While some participants situated the crypto discussion within a context of past and ongoing harms to communities of color, the Global South, and the poor, few were able to apply those lessons to the new forms of predatory finance that are emerging with Web 3 and digital identity. There was talk of exorbitant fee structures, predatory loans, and losses of uninsured assets. What was left unsaid, however, is that hundreds of NGOs, think tanks and academics (Impact Management Project) are working furiously to sketch out marketing campaigns that seek to legitimize the tokenization of people and the environment as alternative asset classes / creative collateral for “beautiful blockchain money,” not to mention micro-finance schemes targeting aspirational entrepreneurs, often low-income women. Do they imagine we will embrace the “green-pill” regenerative finance pitch with public goods tracked on ledgers so the machines can “see” what our communities value? Charles Eisenstein is constantly pushing the “sacred economy.” Since he’s “teamed up with Sep “I put IoT sensors in the slippers of Wildflower Montessori students to track their social behaviors,” Kamvar, <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sdkamvar/overview/">former head of MIT’s Social Computing Group</a>, how long will it be before we see&nbsp; blockchain impact deals where instead of coins, you have tokens tied to the economic prospects of toddlers. Sadly, I can envision James Heckman, JB Pritzker, Paul Tudor Jones, Steve Ballmer, and Stanley Druckenmiller making champagne toasts to that.</p>

<p>New realities of telepresence and haptic robotic labor were downplayed, even though the plan is for blockchain identity to evolve into an accumulation of digital wallet tokens subject to review by non-human agents set up to oversee the legitimacy (or not) of pre-programmed economic and social transactions. We are meant to assume that living under the Global Brain’s benevolent gaze will be democratic, humanized, safe, trustworthy, and accountable. They want us to embrace governance algorithms that know us better than we know ourselves and promise to protect us from unchained life’s sinister and exquisite extremes. It is the dark side of the liberal politics of social care to realize that perhaps the safety net of public welfare was actually set up so that it could be run, decades later, by Palantir and Salesforce and Microsoft’s planetary computer. This program runs on polarity and serves the interests of power to tag, trace, and reinforce oppositional ideology. The boxes they have set up for us make it far less likely that we will question the most basic assumptions of our reality. The progressives can never imagine the government or non-profits would seek to harm the vulnerable, and the conservatives can never imagine the same of their churches or the chamber of commerce.</p>

<p>In my opinion, those at the top are hoping that this Radio-Eugenics World War Three will be a mostly bloodless coup of natural life where a majority agree to willingly embrace distributed ledger chains of “progress” as if the behaviorist, cybernetic enclosures to “save the world” had been the peoples’ and the patriots’ idea all along. The goal is to find the sweet spot where those espousing collective global progressive materialism might be able to strike an uneasy balance with the anti-government, free market, religious crowd. The producers of this play believe they can thread that needle. Imagine you can zoom out and see it as a polarized, emergent structure of domination rather than the ideological struggle the talking heads are making it out to be. In that case, it’s fascinating to watch them try. Picture puppet masters on the left and right contorting themselves in an uncomfortable yet necessary, synchronous dance routine as they attempt to manifest Oliver Reiser’s “World Sensorium,” an outcome they imagine will ultimately benefit both ends of the dipole that is global social physics.</p>
<p>We’ve made our way through the exposition phase of this grand Maya illusion, an all-encompassing techno-masque in which the Earth’s inhabitants have unwittingly been drawn in as both audience and cast. With the dramatic arc established, we’re now enmeshed in structured narratives meant to draw our attention to the manufactured harms of crypto-currency and ridiculous NFTs. I don’t mean in any way to dismiss the actual damage caused. The “crypto bubble,” as these folks describe it, has been devastating for both human victims and the environment. Yet anyone who understands how systems of power operate recognizes tactical sacrifices are made to advance ever more ambitious aims. Those seeking full spectrum dominance don’t give a damn who they crush on their march into delusions of a digital empire where atoms are replaced by bits that can be shaped to the metaphysical whims of billionaire sorcerers and their mad scientist acolytes.</p>
<p>We are being pushed towards a climax where the audience/actors aligned with adversarial parties are supposed to coalesce behind a resolution that will be falsely uplifted as one that restores trust, reinvigorates democracy, ensures freedom and choice, mobilizes grassroots participation, enables shared prosperity, uplifts marginalized communities through the coordinated efforts of a data-driven civil society, and saves the world. This is a plan laid out by the same people enabling the continued operation of the world’s largest financial derivatives portfolios.</p>
<p>Act one established the context and set the mood: wealth inequality, technological disruption, social strife, environmental degradation, and anticipated labor automaton. Act two built dramatic tension with fin-tech crooks, selfish and foolish speculators, extravagant energy consumption, decadent digital property, and authoritarian puppet leaders. Act Two is where the Crypto Symposium ended with a cliffhanger. My prediction is that the final act brings resolution through tokenization of the commons with a shift to “green” proof-of-stake and next-gen nuclear. Before the curtain falls, there will be agreement on proper regulation of digital payments and property to benefit all citizens of extended reality in alignment with a global truth and trust commission. With Pierre Omidyar’s “Good ID” in place, a world of peace and collective harmonization can be regulated through the One World Homeostat, assuming human rights are respected within the terms and conditions imposed by the smart contract layer of international arbitration.</p>
<p>At the end of the two-day symposium, Darren Tseng and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akalin/details/experience/">Jan Akalin</a>, a youthful management consultant formerly with Adjoint whose LinkedIn indicates business ties with Russian firms, announced the launch of a 501(c)4, Center for Emerging Technology Policy. This new think tank is intended to advise officials by working internationally through public-private partnerships, connecting policymakers with knowledgeable technologists to advance inclusion and strengthen “democracy” in an “increasingly interconnected world.” You know the saying, in the Web 3 matrix of digital identity and decentralized ledger technology, “no one is left behind” to rock the boat or question the presumption that living within cybernetic circuits is a future to which we should aspire.</p>
<a href="https://emergingtech.center/">https://emergingtech.center/</a>
<p>Now raise your hand if you think BlackRock and the venture capitalists behind the Impact Management Project have invested billions into creating the vast Web 3 cyber infrastructure network to stop harming poor people and endangered species. No? That’s what I thought. It’s about setting up regulatory procedures to properly measure harm and enact socially acceptable predictive profiling using “evidence-based” protocols and digital twinning. The game of mixed-reality social impact requires ameliorating some of the most egregious harms even as new channels of trauma are devised and branded as solid investment opportunities that no coincidentally expand the influence and power of global NGOs and faith communities.</p>
<p>Austerity, adversity, and crisis drive the impact-data economy, opening the door to a new financial system meant to supersede the neoliberal policies that enabled it. The new paradigm will derive value from tokenizing compliant behavior demonstrated through attestations and networked digital agreements. Tokens will be leveraged to “humanize” the Singularity machine through outfits like Ocean Protocol. The digital exhaust of our biology, intellect, emotions, and social interactions is the supreme sacrifice to the anti-life parasitic force that inhabits the extended reality matrix run on Ricardian contracts and distributed ledgers. Remember, it’s all “for our own good” so we can be “safe.” That is how Hal 9000 intends to create order from chaos – holons with cyber-physical integration that force submission to global sustainable development goals. Meanwhile, Palantir’s all-seeing eye will be looking on to verify that all is “trustworthy” and in alignment with BlackRock’s wishes.</p>
<p>The 2018 white paper, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tapscott_DeclarationofInterdependence_NewSocialContract_BlockchainResearchInstitute1.pdf">A Declaration of Interdependence: Towards A New Social Contract For The Digital Economy</a>,” by Don Tapscott of the Blockchain Research Institute, is setting up this planned future. It’s the same vision depicted in Institute for the Future’s 2017 foresight road map, “<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iftf_blockchainfutures_map.pdf">Blockchain Futures 2017-2027: A Blockchain Decade From Currencies To Computing And The Commons</a>,” only with a slightly rosier lens.&nbsp; On the one side, they’ll be selling Florida and Texas libertarian tech investors on the wonders of DeFi, school choice digital vouchers, reduced government techno-efficiencies, and deregulation; while on the flip side, they’ll be pitching Left Coast progressives on tokenized cooperatives, blockchain Universal Basic Income, and digital ID for undocumented people and marginalized communities. Decentralized ledger technology (DLT) is being set up as the winning option across the political spectrum.</p>
<a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iftf_blockchainfutures_map.pdf">https://wrenchinthegears.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/iftf_blockchainfutures_map.pdf</a>
<p>The digital conquistadors have unimaginable amounts of money to throw at this, and they are, because DLT and smart contracts integrated with internet of things tokenization IS their new empire. They won’t tell people that living in extended reality means satellites and drones will always know where you are. And not just your location; the global computer will evaluate your bio-stats, financial liquidity, preferences, and movements in real-time to assess and mitigate risk based on parameters encoded in its mechanical hive mind consciousness. They won’t tell you that “liberation” left or right may mean competing for gig work in another country where you are hired by an HVAC machine, not a person, a machine. This radical participatory voting? They won’t lead with the fact that the machines will have tokens, too, and legal rights like people.</p>
<p>Information warfare is about deft curation and personalized storytelling to a known audience. I’m suggesting it’s possible to view this two-day event as a storytelling marathon where presenters gave their intended audience, one groomed for outrage for several years by many outrageous things associated with Bitcoin and NFTs, what they wanted, which was an outlet to grouse and demonstrate ethical superiority over “the other.” In this case, the others were consistently framed as fraudulent, Ayn Rand libertarians, sometimes racist, sometimes expats, engaging in dark activities, ducking regulations and taxes to pursue tacky, superficial, self-aggrandizing agendas of greed and chaos.</p>
<p>My awareness of the Web 3 blockchain space is centered around friends with ties to gatherings like ETHDenver, where the players, while still enmeshed in the venture capital power structure, craft identities meant to evoke a decidedly more altruistic and egalitarian vibe with much talk of advancing the common good through shared tokenized assets and redistributive governance protocols. While there were a few mentions of Ethereum at the Crypto Symposium, the presentations certainly did not equally interrogate the potential pitfalls of smart-contract, tokenized progressivism. No, the villain of this tall tale was meant to be a greedy libertarian populist with nefarious intent, not a Silicon Valley multi-millionaire looking to hook folks up with tokenized Universal Basic Income so he could siphon off their behavioral data to run futures markets and train his robot army.</p>
<p>As I watched the videos and saw big holes in content and what felt like strategic omissions in the narrative framing by many people who should have known better, I became angry. It triggered memories of a naive Alison who poured her heart into fighting terrible tests that were being weaponized against children in schools, only to realize the battle was so much larger than tests and that one of the key people who’d been set up to “lead” the resistance, <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/2017/09/20/when-someone-shows-you-who-they-are-believe-them-the-first-time/">Diane Ravitch</a>, had a well-connected venture capitalist son whose company, Raine Group, was heavily invested in alternative credentialing systems and extended reality educational environments. It was the first time I realized that it was not enough to gird yourself against outside opponents. Often the threat comes from the inside, which hurts because you don’t want to harden your heart in the face of such duplicity.</p>
<p>I made several dozen short clips of 1-4 minutes each from these presentations,&nbsp; pulling out specific cases where presenters whose background indicated they should know what we were dealing with was far more than Bitcoin fraud and unregulated pump and dump schemes pull punches and direct people away from how decentralized ledger technology, sensor networks, impact tokens, and smart contracts would be used to upgrade traditional financialized debt products to meet the demands of ESG investment portfolios. In a few cases, I added scrolling bars that pointed out what was NOT being said.</p>
<p>Only then did I realize the bear I’d been poking had ties to financial behemoths with their histories of corruption, mismanagement, and authoritarian government systems. To look at Diehl and Tseng, it might not occur to you that their Boston headquarters was in the <a href="https://explorebostonhistory.org/items/show/2">John Hancock Tower</a> in the Back Bay, a 1970s modernist nightmare whose stability is perhaps only slightly better than the derivatives products for which they’d been developing automated settlement systems at <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171010005550/en/Smart-Contracts-Platform-Company-Adjoint-Joins-ISDA">Adjoint, Inc.</a> Cliff says when confronting such systems, it’s best to stand obliquely in a calm, firm manner rather than advance in anger, because it feeds off of that energy and can use it against you. I’d made a tactical miscalculation, a mistake, taking an assertive stance. Mind you, this was a free conference and ostensibly meant for the public good. Diehl responded by asserting copyright claims on three of those clips, enough to take down my channel, though the third was simply removed, and the final, fatal claim was not made.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thus, I continue to hang on to my hundreds of hours of content for the time being. I have it all backed up, and since I’m not into blockchain media, it’s a bit of a puzzle about where to relocate. If I disappear from YouTube, I encourage you to subscribe to my <a href="https://wrenchinthegears.com/">blog</a> (see email box in the sidebar) and send me an email to timpsila at protonmail dot com, and I will put you on my list for new posts and live streams. Live and learn. I deleted all those clips. Instead of a blow-by-blow, I gave you a broad-stroke overview and included over a hundred screenshots with links in an appendix at the end. Feel free to explore and compare this additional context with the panelists’ commentary. Consider what was left out of their narratives. It can often reveal more than what was said aloud.</p>
<p>When I started my education activism, I struggled when I shared information on pay-for-success finance and emerging technologies like blockchain identity and wearable technology. It was a rare gift when someone understood what I was saying immediately. When it happened, you could see the lightbulb go off for them as the missing piece was inserted, and everything fell into place. That didn’t happen often. It was more likely that someone would listen to you, and then in the weeks and months following, it was apparent that none of the information had any impact on their thinking. They were simply continuing to walk the same well-trodden path.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would try to ascertain where a particular person fell on the spectrum. I had three categories. The first was people who were too busy or stressed and simply did not have the bandwidth to let the information sink in. That was a large percentage. The second group was people who could understand what I was saying, the time, and the knowledge base but could not accept it because it would make it too difficult to continue their life without making substantial changes. For them, it was about cognitive dissonance, discomfort, and fear, maybe with a bit of laziness thrown in. The last category was the people who knew exactly what they were doing and were extremely good at playing their role as enablers of the new paradigm.</p>
<p>Trying, often unsuccessfully, to ascertain the degree of complicity in people used to take up a lot of time in my headspace. I’ve since come to realize it probably doesn’t matter. We can never fully understand people’s motivations, the realities they inhabit, or the stories they tell themselves to get out of bed and face the day. Most of us are touched by some part of this domination structure through our actions or those of our loved ones, colleagues, neighbors, or people in our social circles. The only way to escape the labyrinth is to see it, situate ourselves, and make peace with it. Ariadne’s thread is there for us to walk out of the labyrinth once we can acknowledge the walls, look down at the floor, and pick it up. Any person can make a goal of becoming oriented to one’s position in the tangle of energetic contracts we’ve unknowingly entered into, wash ourselves clean of those terrible bonds, and step out of the play. Until that happens, we will continue to find ourselves caught in a dramatic back and forth – sometimes the actor, sometimes the audience, sometimes a willing participant, sometimes not.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I continue to learn and practice, even as I stumble and fall. I was frustrated with many of these crypto-skeptics – with their inability to see and articulate the clear and present danger that I see. They didn’t understand that their event, their focus, and their new think tank were designed as a vehicle to bring about a gentler, soul-killing, cybernetic dystopia of tokenized, programmed “goodness.” Initially, I tried to make them wrong, which was a mistake. I can’t presume to know their story. I can only seek clarity in mine.</p>
<p>As a mother, I know that securitized toddlers, giraffes, and rivers will never create “beautiful” block-chained money or “green” liquid assets. That is not what it means to be a good relative. I’ll chant it over and over in the hope that understanding may one day sink into the consciousness of the derivatives traders, the mathematicians, and the blockchain coders of social and environmental “justice.” I believe that can happen; I am not a nihilist. Until then, I’ll keep lines of communication open, calling on the cosmos beyond the limits of the material in the corners where the barbed hooks of micro-insurance can never reach. </p>
<p>There, divine chaos sings a song of life, wholeness, and healing. It is there that our hearts are truly seen.</p>

 Introduction <p>Threshold cryptography is one of the most secure techniques for crying out cryptographic operations. For context, cryptography is a field of study in computer science that emphasizes securely accessing and transferring information between two or more parties without external influence. The importance of cryptography cannot be overstated, not only in the virtual but in the real world as well.</p><p>In practice, cryptographic techniques are targeted at keeping information or secrets between the concerned parties away from adversaries. Looking at the bigger picture, cryptography aims to create secure ecosystems that can remain functional with or without the participation of trusted entities.</p><p>In 1994, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/195058.195405">Alfredo et al.</a> proposed one of the earliest proof-of-security systems based on threshold cryptography. In the early years, the military, governments, and organizations that held private data were the only major users of threshold cryptosystems. Since then, there have been several applications of threshold technology.</p> What is threshold cryptography? <p>Threshold cryptosystems protect information by encrypting and distributing secrets amongst a cluster of independent computers that qualify as <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/fault-tolerance">fault-tolerant</a>. The fault-tolerance of a system simply refers to the system’s ability to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.</p>Artist Natasha Hanacek’s conception of threshold cryptography through an analogy of a lock that can only be opened by three people working together. (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2020/07/nist-kick-starts-threshold-cryptography-development-effort">Source</a>)<p>As the name suggests, it enables individual keyholders to lock a secret in a way that no single keyholder can open the lock individually. Instead, it requires a minimum number of keyholders out of all keyholders (a threshold number) to unlock the secret.</p><p>Since the general idea is to assume that the participating entities are susceptible to compromise, decrypting the shared secret or signing a message requires the cooperation of some, not all, participants, usually above a minimum number. Threshold encryption also ensures that keyholders are able to collaborate without seeing other participants’ parts of the key.</p><p>With a minimum threshold, it can be ensured that even if some of the participants collude, the secret remains secure. In essence, this technique makes sure that a single individual doesn’t have the full authority, which can lead to vulnerability in the system. It also ensures that even if one or more individuals are unavailable, the secret can be unlocked and doesn’t cause bottlenecks. This makes the system fault-tolerant.</p>A diagram showing the process of breaking a key into several parts. The system then requires a threshold number (2 out of 3) to reconstruct the key. (<a href="https://medium.com/poa-network/poa-network-honey-badger-bft-and-threshold-cryptography-c43e10fadd87">Source</a>) How does threshold cryptography work? <p>To understand how it works, let us assume we have a secret (S), for example, the seed phrase of a wallet address. After encrypting S using a public key, we split up the corresponding private key among a fixed number of participants, say N.</p><p>After setting the number of participants N, threshold cryptography introduces a new variable, which we call K, representing the minimum number of participants required to reform the secret or sign a message. As we mentioned earlier, threshold schemes consider fault tolerance and assume that a single point of failure is not ideal for any functional system. Therefore, in a threshold cryptosystem, the number of participants required to decrypt the secret has to be greater than or equal to K but less than N, where K is also less than N.</p><p>Let's say you are a member of a board of trustees of ten people. The secret you’re trying to safeguard is encrypted with its private key split up into shares and distributed amongst the board in secrecy. No board member knows what other fractions exist and who holds them, except the piece in their possession.</p><p>To sign a transaction using the private key, the board chooses a threshold of seven persons. This means that seven out of the ten board members must agree and cooperate if the need to carry out any operation that involves the private key arises. Thus, even if half of the board is compromised, they will not be able to reconstruct the secret without at least two more people. Getting 7 out of 10 points of failure is not exactly something that often happens. Furthermore, even if one bad actor can corrupt another six actors, it would anyway be equivalent to a direction taken by a clear majority. This thereby suggests that the system is secure as long as the majority (higher than a threshold number) of participants are acting in a democratic way.</p> Applications of threshold cryptography <p>Threshold schemes offer more security than many other cryptographic techniques. As a result, several cryptographic protocols, operations, and applications adopted it.</p><p>Their applications can be found in various sectors such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, authentication, ad-hoc and sensor networks, etc. Here are some of threshold cryptograpy’s most common applications today:</p> Mitigating MEV <p>MEV, short for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">Maximal Extractable Value</a>, is a “tax” that miners, validators, and other blockchain actors extract by reordering transactions before confirming them on the blockchain. Although MEV extraction has been used for good causes like balancing token prices across decentralized exchanges, most MEV extraction techniques are outrightly malicious, profiting from a user’s trades without their knowledge.</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/modular-vs-monolithic-blockchains/">Blockchains</a> like Ethereum do not require transactions in a block to be processed in any specific order. Thus, validators can rearrange transactions in it however they like. The validators profit from this reordering or rearranging of certain transactions so that they can extract a profit via liquidation or arbitrage.</p><p>In a threshold cryptosystem built on the blockchain, the participants collaborate off-chain to create a single transaction and submit it to the network. Since the private keys are split up among multiple computers or nodes, the transaction leaves no on-chain trail behind.</p><p>Some protocols, like <a href="https://blog.ruby.exchange/how-skale-solves-the-front-running-problem/">SKALE</a>, have applied threshold cryptography schemes to combat MEV. SKALE’s S-Chain validators create a key collectively. Senders use this key to encrypt transactions before submission to the network for validation. When encrypted transactions lie in the mempool, their details are shielded from validators. After they are posted to the blockchain, transactions remain encrypted until validators decrypt them.</p><p>While transactions are in transit, they retain their encrypted form. Validators cannot decrypt them until they have approved them on the blockchain, thus blocking any opportunity for front-running, sandwich attacks, or reordering according to preference.</p><p>Even if some network nodes become compromised, the system remains functional because a single node cannot decrypt transactions. Both encryption and decryption are spread across the validators and require a minimum number (threshold value) of validators. As long as the majority –above the threshold– remain honest, the system remains secure.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://medium.com/@totalblockchainemail/osmosis-will-soon-be-frontrunning-mev-free-b7da89f04ce9">Osmosis</a> also intends to leverage similar techniques to mitigate MEV. Osmosis plans to encrypt the transactions in the mempool before they’re included in a block. This would hide the transaction information and prevent validators from re-ordering or censoring the transactions for their profit. Once transactions are encrypted, the shards of the private key are shared among all validators and the key can only be reconstructed by ⅔ validators. That way, Osmosis will be able to mitigate the MEV, since the block will be almost simultaneously decrypted while it’s being confirmed. Validators will not be able to extract value at the cost of users’ profit.</p>Simplified illustration of Shutter’s transaction execution environment. (<a href="https://blog.shutter.network/introducing-shutter-network-combating-frontrunning-and-malicious-mev-using-threshold-cryptography/">Source</a>)‌ ‌<p>Another platform mitigating MEV by leveraging the threshold cryptographic techniques is <a href="https://shutter.network/">Shutter Network</a>. Shutter Network is an open-source project that aims to prevent front-running (a type of MEV) on Ethereum by using a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol based on threshold cryptographic techniques.</p><p>Similar to SKALE &amp; Osmosis, Shutter also uses these techniques to send encrypted transactions in a way that protects them from front-runners on their path through the <a href="https://medium.com/@danrobinson/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest-ecc5f0505dff">dark forest</a> (the metaphorical hunting ground of front-runners that each transaction must cross).</p> Improving MultiSig <p>Multisignature schemes, popularly known as MultiSig(s) or multi signature wallets , require two or more participants to sign a message or approve a transaction before the transaction can be executed. Using the earlier “'board of trustees” example, if all board members had to vote on transferring funds in their treasury to a charity, all ten board members would need to contribute their signatures to the MultiSig scheme to approve the transaction.</p><p>Multisigs can be set up with an arbitrary number of keyholders. A 2-of-2 MultiSig requires that both parties holding the keys sign any message. With a 2-of-3 MultiSig, three parties hold the keys, but only two need to come together to sign a transaction.</p><p>MultiSig schemes are similar to threshold cryptosystems, as they are distributed systems. Yet, MultiSig participants each have a complete public key, while participants on threshold schemes receive only a share of a single common public key.</p><p>Threshold signature schemes are <a href="https://sepior.com/blog/top-5-reasons-threshold-signature-wallets-are-better-than-multisig">replacing</a> MultiSig applications. While MultiSig wallets are more secure than single signature wallets , threshold signature schemes cost less because they are computed off-chain. They relay a single transaction to the blockchain, while MultiSig relays all the individual contributions separately.</p><p>MultiSig schemes are a kind of threshold scheme without the threshold feature. They need all participants to contribute, as opposed to threshold signature schemes which only require a preset number of participants to sign transactions. To be clear, we can refer to MultiSig schemes as a threshold cryptosystem built on a blockchain’s application layer.</p><p>MultiSig schemes have been used in developing secure blockchain interaction infrastructure like wallets. Several cryptocurrency wallet providers are developing wallet infrastructure based on threshold schemes instead of MultiSig. Threshold schemes are more secure as they offer better privacy than MultiSig, consume less block space, are easier to deploy on any blockchain (unlike MultiSig schemes that several blockchains do not support), and are more flexible.</p> Multi-party computation (MPC) <p>Multi-party computation, also called secure multi-party computation, is a simple cryptographic scheme that involves multiple participants. If a single private key &nbsp;is split into shares and distributed amongst participants in an MPC protocol, each participant only knows the share in her possession and must do some collective computational work with each using their share.</p><p>A useful example for the use of MPC would be a group of individuals desiring to compute their average salary. They might use MPC to output the average of all these secret numbers without disclosing their own salary to the other members or another trusted third party.</p>Here’s a great explanatory video about Multi-Party Computation<p>When comparing MPC vs MultiSig, we need to consider their purposes are completely distinct. While MultiSigs are used to distribute between multiple parties the power to sign transactions, messages, or decisions in general, MPC’s goal is to perform computation without revealing the data being processed.</p><p>An average threshold cryptosystem splits the private keys among participants such that a minimum number of participants must contribute to decrypting the information or signing transactions. In practice, a threshold scheme is only similar to multi-party computation in being a distributed system. When you combine a threshold scheme with a partially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic</a> protocol, it can function effectively as a secure multi-party computation scheme.</p><p>Homomorphism allows participants to perform computation while retaining encryption, while the threshold feature ensures that decryption is only possible when dishonest participants are less than the threshold value. Thus, the scheme becomes a threshold multi-party computation protocol.</p><p><a href="https://www.qredo.com/">Qredo</a> is a blockchain protocol that uses a threshold multi-party computation scheme, combining a threshold signature scheme with multi-party computation. When signing transactions on Qredo, each separate node contributes to signing the message.</p><p><a href="https://silencelaboratories.com/">Silence Laboratories</a>, on the other hand, leveraged threshold multi-party computation schemes to offer not only singing a message with multiple shards, but also <a href="https://coinyuppie.com/ambire-ceo-is-web3-wallet-better-for-multi-party-computing-or-smart-wallet/">social recovery</a> in Web3 wallets. Using the threshold MPC scheme, Silence Laboratories enables the Web3 wallet providers to break a private key into multiple shards, which can be combined to reconstruct the key in case a user loses access to her part of the key.</p> Trusted setups <p>A <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-guide-to-understanding-trusted-setups/">trusted setup</a> is a procedure that involves more than one party. Its aim is to produce the standard parameters that a proof system or similar cryptographic protocols rely on. Trusted setups can also be called exceptional cases of multi-party computation, that require randomness, multiple individuals, and at least one honest party.</p><p>Earlier, we spoke of how some contributions in threshold schemes are usually completed off-chain or offline before submitting the results online. Threshold cryptosystems can be used to create trusted setups, as their formations' processes are inherently similar. Threshold signature schemes require a trusted setup phase.</p><p>The setup phase in a threshold signature scheme is called <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-distributed-key-generation-is-866adc79620">Distributed Key Generation</a>, usually the most important part of a threshold scheme. In a Distributed Key Generation setup, participants have to contribute to the key generation and distribution process. Each participant sends their portion of the private keys to the DKG function, which hands over the public key to everyone and splits the private key such that each participant receives a portion that must be kept secret.</p><p>While such trusted setups are similar to the average distributed system approach, they have a threshold. Only the threshold number of participants will be required to generate new parameters in a threshold-trusted setup. However, there is a risk of failure if the number of participants that conspire to betray the system is up to the threshold value. Also, some participants may receive incorrect shares, rendering their participation invalid. The latter problem is only valid if contributions stay offline, as participants can validate their shares on-chain.</p> Electronic Voting <p>According to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRru5o4AAAAJ&amp;hl=es">Gallegos-Garcia</a> et al. in a 2009 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=es&amp;user=pRru5o4AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=pRru5o4AAAAJ:xtRiw3GOFMkC">paper</a>, the security of electronic voting protocols needs to evolve to represent true democracy. When it comes to electronic voting, &nbsp;the existing security algorithms at the time had so far always been based on public key schemes.</p><p>This paper, on the other hand, proposed providing security to electronic voting protocols via threshold cryptography and blind signatures as a less expensive alternative. Not only do they cost less, but they also offer better <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/oliver-gale-digital-dollar-project/">privacy</a>, accuracy, and robustness.</p><p>Another paper titled <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2663036_A_Practical_Electronic_Voting_Protocol_Using_Threshold_Schemes">A Practical Electronic Voting Protocol Using Threshold Schemes</a> presents a novel secret voting scheme that fully conforms to the requirements of large-scale elections.</p><p>The participants in this scheme would be voters, candidates, an administrator, and a counter. The scheme uses threshold encryption to preserve the privacy and accuracy of the votes against the dishonesty of voters, candidates, the administrator, and the counter. Executed well, this could ensure the verifiability, fairness, and soundness of the voting process, and neither administrator, candidates, nor the counter would be capable of producing a false tally, affecting the voting result, or corrupting/disrupting the election.<br></p> In summary <p>Threshold cryptography is a field of cryptography that involves secure secret sharing while eliminating single points of failure usually associated with most distributed systems. In threshold schemes, the system remains functional as long as the majority, usually above the minimum number required to sign a message, remain honest. Even if one or two entities become compromised, the network will retain its integrity.</p><p>Several cryptographic protocols have adopted threshold schemes for different purposes, including inhibiting MEV extraction, building secure multi-party computation protocols, trusted setups, replacing MultiSig applications, etc. This cryptographic approach can pass as untested waters in computer science, and extensive research will continue to increase its applications and security potential. In the coming year, we might many more innovative techniques leveraging it to improve the security of systems with more than one party involved.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in DeFi using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.</p><p>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

<p>After 18 months of development we’re thrilled to introduce Noir: the language of zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Noir is a Rust-based domain specific language (DSL) for creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs. It’s the easiest way to write zk applications that are compatible with any proving&nbsp;system.</p><p>We’re also announcing two new Typescript libraries, NoirJS, which enables the compiling of Noir circuits in the browser, as well as Barretenberg.js, which enables proving and verifying those circuits in the&nbsp;browser.</p><blockquote>Get started with&nbsp;Noir</blockquote> What’s Holding Back ZK App Development? <p>The current zk stack is cumbersome and hard to understand. Our zk circuit-building counterparts like Circom and ZoKrates are powerful and flexible, but they require knowledge of cryptographic concepts, creating a barrier to widespread developer adoption.</p><p>Existing circuit compilation languages require two&nbsp;brains:</p>  a cryptography brain that understands proving systems, trusted setups, and some low-level cryptography, and:  an application developer brain that can reason intuitively about public and private state to create novel blockchain applications  <p>Not many people have two brains! And that means the number of zk app developers today is a small subset of the total number of blockchain devs.</p><p>The simplicity of Noir means that having one brain is&nbsp;enough.</p><p>By abstracting away underlying cryptographic complexity while retaining all the power and flexibility of other circuit-building languages, Noir allows any developer–not just those with cryptography knowledge–to construct zk apps. Developers can now focus solely on designing the logic behind private applications.</p> The Single-Brain Solution: the Noir&nbsp;Language <p>Noir makes the creation of zk circuits–and applications–easier than&nbsp;ever.</p> Simple, Familiar&nbsp;Syntax <p>Noir’s likeness to Rust makes it simple, familiar, and easy to understand.</p><p>Creating a conditional is as simple as writing “if.” Using other zk circuit writing languages entails downloading circuit libraries, reading them to understand their underlying logic, and then calling library implementations of basic features.</p><p>Many basic functions like Pedersen hashes don’t have to be reimplemented in Noir circuits–they’re baked into the language&nbsp;itself.</p><blockquote>Example: <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/mux1.circom">Circomlib’s implementation of a multiplexer</a></blockquote><p>Noir’s simplicity also means there are myriad quality-of-life improvements over alternative circuit writing languages.</p><p>Headache-free dependency management. Noir has its own package manager, nargo, that mocks Rust’s crate and package management system. nargo supports using dependencies uploaded to Github, allowing devs to separate the dependencies of their Noir circuits and the project integrating those circuits.</p><p>Simpler circuit debugging. Rather than writing scripts and downloading proving and verifier keys, developers can also use nargo to prove and verify circuits.</p><p>Autonomous execution. Finally, straight out of the box Noir allows you to build a compiled Solidity contract to verify proofs on any EVM-compatible blockchain. Smart contract developers can now execute logic based on Noir&nbsp;proofs.</p> Standard Crypto&nbsp;Library <p>Noir also possesses a standard library of highly optimized functions commonly used in circuit development.</p><p>The stdlib gives developers access to widely used, complex algorithms that are hand-written and tightly optimized by the Aztec team. There is always a trade-off between the simplicity of an abstraction layer and its efficiency — in this case, how efficiently programs are converted into constraints.</p><p>The standard library grants developers a high level of circuit efficiency while interacting with a simple, easy to use abstraction layer.</p> Proving System&nbsp;Agnostic <p>Finally, because Noir doesn’t compile directly to circuits but to an intermediary representation (akin to LLVM), it is compatible with multiple back-end proving systems including PLONK, Groth16, and&nbsp;Marlin.</p><p>We call this intermediate representation an ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation).</p><p>Aztec Network has a proving system back-end called Barretenberg that runs on Plonk. But developing with Noir means you can plug in any SNARK-based proving system according to your&nbsp;needs.</p> Noir in&nbsp;Practice <p>The intuitiveness of Noir has to be seen to be believed, so we’ve created some sample implementations of circuits in Noir to show you what they look like against common reference code:</p> 🧠 Mastermind <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind</a> is a simple number-guessing game, akin to the wildly popular puzzle game Wordle. Our implementation of Mastermind in Noir is approximately half the length of existing reference implementations.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/vezenovm/week3/blob/master/Part1/contracts/circuits/hitandblow.circom">Mastermind in&nbsp;Circom</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/vezenovm/mastermind-noir/blob/master/circuits/src/main.nr">Mastermind in&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote> 🌪️ Tornado&nbsp;Cash <p>Tornado Cash under the hood allows users to prove they possess a given note in a Merkle Tree. Below we show a sample implementation of a similar Merkle membership proof in only 10&nbsp;lines.</p><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-core/blob/master/circuits/withdraw.circom">Tornado Cash in&nbsp;Circom</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://github.com/vezenovm/simple_shield/blob/master/circuits/src/main.nr">Tornado Cash in&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote> Barretenberg.js <p>Finally, alongside today’s release of Noir, we’ve developed and published Barretenberg.js–a Noir Typescript wrapper for Aztec’s Barretenberg back-end. It allows application developers to create proofs in Javascript rather than through Rust commands.</p><p>The wrapper allows for proof construction straight in the browser, allowing zk developers to quickly and easily create full-stack Noir programs.</p><p>Noir abstracts away a lot of cryptography, enabling developers to use cryptographic functionality without concerning themselves with safety, thus lowering barriers to development.</p> Noir: The&nbsp;Language <p>The Noir language, being Rust-like, comes with features out of the box that should look familiar to any app developer:</p>  Functions  Submodules  Structs / user-defined types  If statements  Loops  Global constants  <p>And there are a few features we are working on but have yet to implement, like generics and higher-order functions.</p> Use Cases <p>Noir can be used today to build zk games much faster than was previously possible. Implementations of Wordle, Battleships, and Mastermind can be done in an afternoon.</p><p>With the Barretenberg.js library, developers can also create proofs of membership and identity, blind auctions, and proofs of action on Aztec Connect that can enable private airdrops.</p><p>We are convinced that Noir is a transformational step for practical zk development. As such, we’re currently working toward rewriting Aztec’s core circuits using Noir, and we’re continuously working to improve its usability.</p> Getting Started <p>You’ve heard of zero-knowledge proofs. You’ve even heard of SNARKs and PLONK and zkRollups. But you’ve never gotten started, because you don’t have a spare brain to dedicate to learning cryptography.</p><p>That all changes today. Here’s how to install Noir, compile your first zk program, and verify it in a Solidity contract, all in 15&nbsp;minutes:</p><blockquote><a href="https://docs.aztec.network/developers/noir">Getting started with&nbsp;Noir</a></blockquote><p>Once you’ve gotten off the ground, show us what you’ve&nbsp;built.</p><p>We also have a portion of the Aztec Grants Program dedicated to funding Noir developers with experience writing circuits in languages like Circom, Zokrates, or Leo. If you’re interested in actively participating in Noir development as an early tester, check out our <a href="http://aztec.network/grants">Grants page</a> for more information.</p><p>And if you’re headed to Colombia Blockchain Week, we have $20,000 in prizes we’re bringing to ETHBogota for novel zk applications built with&nbsp;Noir.</p><p>We’ll be publishing more guides on development with Noir and adding to the tooling infrastructure behind it, with a singular goal — making Noir the universal language of zero knowledge.</p> Ecosystem <p>The Noir ecosystem has just gotten off the ground. But now that we’ve shown you what we’re working on, we want you to contribute.</p><p>The goal is not a wanton <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">proliferation of standards</a> but a language stack whose universality and flexibility reinforces its utility across ecosystems.</p><p>And that means we want to hear from you. Contribute to the language and Barretenberg library, and join us on Discord to talk directly to the Noir team: <a href="http://discord.gg/aztec">discord.gg/aztec</a></p> Join Us <p>We’re on the lookout for talented engineers and applied cryptographers.

<p>The advent of blockchain technology circa 2008 was the starting shot for deep changes in how business is conducted across many sectors. From supply chain to entertainment, decentralised technology is finding its way into more and more use cases every day. The gaming industry is no exception. Blockchain now supports the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model, in which gamers can monetise their assets. This article explains the history of P2E and its mechanics and offers a comprehensive guide to help developers understand the concepts that underpin P2E models.</p>



 A look back in time 



<p>The year 2013 was chock-full of quirks. Onesies, those one-piece, often colorful jumpsuits for adults, became a thing this year. Also, selfie was named as word of the year by the Oxford Dictionary. US President Barack Obama -who, incidentally, was inaugurated for his second term in office in early 2013- became one of the high-profile personalities taking to the selfie craze with gusto. Hillary Clinton did, too.</p>



<p>In the crypto world, Bitcoin was on the rise, though its valuation fluctuated wildly throughout the year. The mother of all cryptos started 2013 with a worth of $13 per coin before reaching a peak price of $1,100 by December. As Bitcoin floundered, a related concept made its appearance: blockchain gaming. Huntercoin, the precursor of the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model, was born.</p>



<p>Huntercoin is built on the concept of ‘human mining.’ Whereas traditional Bitcoin mining requires powerful computer rigs and vast amounts of power to mine new coins, Huntercoin distributes coins around its gaming world. Players create Hunters (for a fee) to move around the map collecting coins, which must be deposited into banks that are randomly generated at regular intervals. From there, the coins can be redeemed into the Hunter’s (the player) wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project proved that the combination of blockchain -a technology still relatively new in 2013- and gaming could work. But just as the P2E industry was starting to find a solid footing, the <a href="https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/mt-gox-hack/">Mt. Gox hack</a> happened. Though specifically related to Bitcoin exchange facility, the popular perception of blockchain as a ‘fraud’ or ‘scam’ took hold. The consequences of the spectacular fall of Mt. Gox rippled out across the industry. Many nascent P2E projects were halted or canned altogether, as blockchain became almost toxic. It would be several years before P2E made a significant comeback.</p>



 2017: the year of the virtual cat 



<p>Cats are immensely popular animals on social media. ‘Funny cat videos’ tend to accrue hundreds of thousands of videos on TikTok or YouTube. And back in 2017, felines spread their domain into the crypto space through CryptoKitties, a P2E game that enabled gamers to purchase NFTs depicting cute cats. Over time, players could breed their NFT pets to create new ones, and so the cycle continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CryptoKitties became the first more or less mainstream blockchain game. And it made some respectable amount of money, too. The most expensive CryptoKitty ever sold, a purple creature by the name of Dragon, fetched $1.3m (around 600 ETH at the time.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advent (and success) of the virtual cat game reignited interest in blockchain gaming, opening the floodgates for a rush of P2E games that continues to this day.</p>







 But what exactly is P2E? 



<p>In other gaming models -notably, Pay to win (P2W) and Free to play (F2P), the revenue generated only goes one way: towards the game’s developers. Gamers themselves do not benefit financially. P2E turns this one-way street concept on its head by enabling gamers to financially benefit from the value they create.</p>



<p>P2E leverages the power of blockchain to create a fair and open economic environment where value is distributed among gamers.</p>



<p>This model centers around the ownership of in-game assets. A core tenet of P2W and F2P is that, while gamers can purchase assets like weapons, skins, magic items, etc., they do not actually own them. The game’s developer retains ownership. What the gamer is purchasing is the right to use those assets in their game only. This means the gamer cannot trade these assets, and crucially, cannot use them in any other game.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology subverts that concept. Blockchain is decentralised technology, which means there is no one single authority in control. And it further means that in-game assets are not stored in a centralised server, as is the case with P2W and F2P. Instead, assets are stored on all the nodes (computers) running that blockchain.</p>



<p>In P2E games, the gamers own the assets, which can increase in value in the game’s open economy. The more you play the game, the more value is generated, and the bigger the rewards for the player. These rewards can be additional in-game assets or resources or cryptocurrencies, all of which are tokenised in the blockchain. This is a key point. By tokenizing assets, the gamers can use them elsewhere. In another blockchain-based game, for instance, or by creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which can be traded. All this generates more and more value for the blockchain gaming environment and the players.</p>



 Zaisan as the nexus for providing comprehensive P2E services 



<p>Considering all the aspects explained above, companies require great expertise and understanding of the space to be able to provide efficient, comprehensive services.</p>



<p>Zaisan`fields that expertise, which enables the company to become the preferential choice for developers intending to create a P2E ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zaisan can:</p>



  Deploy <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/">backend infrastructure</a>  Offer <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-consultancy/">consulting services</a> to assist the client in choosing the right chain  <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-as-a-service/">Set up test environments</a>  <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/blockchain-as-a-service/">Set up a blockchain</a> customised to specifications  Build <a href="https://zaisan.io/infra/bridge/">blockchain bridges</a>  Provide <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft/project-management/">NFT project management</a>  Establish a <a href="https://zaisan.io/nft/staking-platforms/">customised staking platform</a>  



<p>Additionally, identity is a key component of many aspects of life, and this includes blockchain environments, of course. Zaisan has developed my.D, a proprietary <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Know-Your-Customer (KYC) service</a>, which enables clients to verify the identity of their potential clients. This streamlines the onboarding process and removes fraud from the equation.</p>

  KILT Protocol's migration from Kusama to Polkadot is an important technical milestone and the first parachain migration. Polkadot's 'canary network' model allows Web3 projects to test their technology in a real-world environment before upgrading to stable production networks.

<p>On October 3rd, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> made history by becoming the first parachain to accomplish a full migration from the Kusama Relay Chain to the Polkadot Relay Chain. Besides marking an important technical milestone, the migration also represents the first instance of a parachain taking the upgrade path from Kusama to Polkadot. This demonstrates an important use case for the ‘canary network’ model pioneered by Polkadot, giving Web3 projects a place to stress-test their technology in a real-world environment and mitigate risk before upgrading to a more stable production network. Polkadot’s technology stack helped make the historic transition from one network to another possible.</p><p>Kusama has always been a natural starting point for teams building in the Polkadot ecosystem. As <a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/kusama-polkadot-comparing-the-cousins/">Polkadot’s canary network</a>, it provides an experimental proving ground for Web3 innovation. It’s a space for teams to roll out novel features and see how technologies will perform under live network conditions before they’re deployed to the more secure, stable environment of the Polkadot Relay Chain, helping mitigate risk and providing the right conditions for parachains to evolve and mature. </p><p>Some projects have used Kusama as a network for experimentation on new ideas, where they can move fast and break things. Many teams have also used it as a pre-production environment, running a parachain on each network and using their Kusama parachain to deploy, iterate, and stress-test new technologies and features before pushing them to their production network on Polkadot.<br><br>However, some teams may decide they don’t want to run and maintain two parallel networks. In cases where the stability and bank-level security of Polkadot is integral to a parachain’s ultimate design and purpose, Kusama is very beneficial as an initial development environment that presents an upgrade path to Polkadot. It allows teams to complete their early-stage development, stress-test their technology, engage their community and launch partnerships before upgrading to the Polkadot Relay Chain.<br><br>“Happy to see KILT Protocol showing, for the first time ever, the live transition of an entire parachain ecosystem from one Relay Chain’s security umbrella to another. This is another demonstration of the power and flexibility of the Relay Chain model for decentralized application platforms,” said Dr. Gavin Wood, founder of Polkadot.<br><br>Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol, said, "It’s always exciting to do things nobody has done before. With this step, KILT becomes a business-ready decentralized network. Polkadot technology made it possible to transfer all achievements from the experimental phase to the production phase. Try that on any other technology base!"</p> Why KILT chose this path <p>KILT, a blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers (DIDs), is the first parachain to take this migration path, paving the way for other teams to follow. This decision was spurred by large-scale enterprises starting to implement business cases on KILT. These use cases require high levels of stability and security that cannot be guaranteed within the more experimental Kusama network, so following a governance decision by the KILT community, it was decided to make the logical move to Polkadot. <br><br>Kusama proved to be the right environment for KILT to develop applications quickly and try things out. Thanks to Kusama’s fast iteration cycles, KILT quickly became decentralized and added many new functionalities, allowing the network to prove its efficiency and utility. In the year since it went live, KILT partnered with many Kusama and Polkadot teams to integrate digital identities composed of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials. Five services “built on KILT” were launched, gaining tens of thousands of builders and users. Since Kusama runs around four times faster than Polkadot, with almost the same code, this greatly reduced the time needed to build and test secure KILT identity solutions now running on Polkadot.</p> How the migration was done <p>KILT won the 6th Kusama parachain slot auction, which ended on September 8, 2021. It transitioned to a decentralized network on November 10th, 2021, run by community governance. After 11 months of live deployment on Kusama, KILT secured their Polkadot parachain slot in the 24th parachain slot auction, which ended on August 11th, 2022. On August 16th, 2022 the plan to fully migrate the KILT parachain from Kusama to Polkadot was <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-moves-to-polkadot-b5d4b56f8040">announced</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-is-now-a-parachain-on-polkadot-56b9206c2114">historic migration</a> was made possible by Polkadot’s tech stack, in particular the cross-chain interoperability standard XCM and the Solo-to-parachain pallet developed by Parity Technologies. XCM allowed KILT to generate the final block on the Kusama parachain, followed by the first block on the Polkadot parachain. The Solo-to-parachain pallet allowed the KILT parachain to switch networks. All data and services built on KILT remained unchanged.</p><p>KILT not only proved the viability of using Kusama for early stage deployment and risk mitigation, but also demonstrated the technical path for migrating a parachain from one relay chain to another. By taking the upgrade path from Kusama to Polkadot, KILT is paving the way for future Web3 projects to also benefit from the valuable canary network model.

 Press Release: Nym amongst first industry signatories for the ‘Geneva Declaration on Targeted Surveillance and Human&nbsp;Rights’ <p>Call for industry privacy projects to sign the Declaration which was launched at the United Nations 51st Human Rights Council with signatories from government, civil society, academic and technology organisations.</p><p>NEUCHÂTEL, SWITZERLAND, 4 OCTOBER 2022 — Nym, the leader in network layer privacy, announces their signing of the new Geneva Declaration on Targeted Surveillance and Human Rights, a collective commitment to human rights in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>Led by civil society organisation <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/">Access Now</a> and the <a href="https://catalangovernment.eu/catalangovernment/">Government of Catalonia</a>, the Declaration was officially launched in Geneva during a roundtable discussion on “Spyware: A Threat to Human Rights and Democracy”, taking place in conjunction with the 51st session of the Human Rights Council. Nym CSO Jaya Brekke participated in this session as an industry representative, effectively leading Nym to be amongst the first signatories of the Declaration.</p><p>This is a solid first step in condemning the proliferation and use of surveillance technologies to target communities engaging in protected activities. Following the moratorium, urgent concrete action needs to be taken for any real change to better security for human rights and democracy. This includes the adoption of and regulatory support for privacy-preserving rather than surveillance prone technologies.</p><p>Brekke says, “It was a pleasure to come together with eminent people across sectors who share the vision that privacy as the default is in fact the very foundation for open democratic societies. The surveillance industry has, for too long, managed to make false claims that surveillance is necessary for security. The recent Pegasus attacks against environmental, human rights activists and politicians have finally made it obvious that the opposite is in fact&nbsp;true.”</p><p>“Surveillance technologies undermine security and democracy by turning anyone into a potential target. It is time to change the narrative, advocate and build strong privacy for everyone,” she&nbsp;adds.</p><p>The Declaration highlights that any export, sale, transfer, servicing or use of targeted digital surveillance technologies denies individuals fundamental privacy&nbsp;rights.</p><p>Director-General for Digital Nation and Urban Agenda at the Catalan Ministry of Digital Policies and Territory, Maria Galindo says, “Technology must provide new means to defend and improve human rights, not limit them. Right now there is no international framework to regulate spyware. So we must come together [all actors] to defend our digital rights, encourage transparency and accountability among those who sell and those who&nbsp;buy.”</p><p>“I am extremely satisfied to see private companies, like Nym, join forces in signing the Declaration of Geneva. I hope we can truly change how things work in the spyware market if more companies, governments, institutions and individuals join us,” she&nbsp;adds.</p><p>“It hurts the tech industry as a whole when bad actors enable the surveillance of individuals” says Senior UN Advocacy Officer at Access Now, Laura O’Brien. “It is important for all companies within the industry to work together — and in collaboration with civil society and governments through initiatives like the Geneva Declaration — to raise the floor for rights-respecting behaviour across the tech industry.”</p><p>Collectively, governments, civil society, tech professionals and academics worldwide need to join forces to fund, promote, build and support privacy in the digital realm. When given a viable choice, people will choose services that use privacy technologies.</p><p>Nym urges the tech, privacy and security industries to sign the Declaration and integrate privacy as a default within their infrastructure. The Declaration can be signed here: <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/geneva-declaration-end-spyware-abuse/">https://www.accessnow.org/geneva-declaration-end-spyware-abuse/</a></p><p>-END-</p><p>About Nym:</p><p>Nym is an open-source, incentivized, and decentralised platform that protects privacy at the network level of any application, wallet or digital service. Nym protects against traffic pattern analysis and metadata surveillance.

<p><br>October is here, which means that it’s time to share our progress and achievements in the previous month. Let’s look at what happened in September and what we’re preparing for this one!</p> Tech and Product <p>Thanks to many advances on the contracts’ side, the front-end, and updated documentation, Advanced Staking’s launch is within an arm’s length. Throughout its development, we’ve defined several new ideas and strategies that will be crucial to Panther’s v1 functioning.<br></p><p>In the first week of September, we identified a potential DoS attack vector within the Advanced Staking redemption mechanisms. After iterating through a few solutions, we’ve settled on a design that left no window for attacks and approved by our auditors. This fix required a few UI/UX changes, which were promptly handled. We are preparing a document about this fix that also explains how Panther will deal with this and a specific type of front-running attack.<br></p><p>Meanwhile, we’ve expanded the <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/dao/token/staking/phase-2-advanced-staking">documentation on Advanced Staking and Panther Reward Points (PRPs)</a>, highlighting the difference between Advanced and Private Staking, the components that make Advanced Staking Panther’s v0.5, a straightforward explanation of the rewards involved, and more. Also, as hinted upon on last week’s weekly mini-update, we implemented a calculation feature that involves stakers minting an NFT to timestamp their stakes. This is purely a functional feature. Another article in the works will break down how PRP rewards will work.<br></p><p>Progress is simultaneously being made towards Panther’s v1. As protocol architects settled upon APIs, work on the front end progressed to the last stages of UI internal testing and bug-fixing. <br></p><p>On a minor note, our governance token $ZKP, formerly listed as "$ZKP Token", is now labeled "Panther" on <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x909E34d3f6124C324ac83DccA84b74398a6fa173">Etherscan</a>. $ZKP remains as its ticker symbol.</p> Community  AMA on Panther’s contribution to ZPrize <p>Back in May, we proudly <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panther-joins-zprize-and-industry-leaders-to-further-the-zero-knowledge-industry-391a494a58d6/">announced our participation in ZPrize as a Silver Partner</a>, intending to contribute to the acceleration of zero-knowledge cryptography’s future. Panther embraced the task of architecting the challenge of “<a href="https://www.zprize.io/prizes/accelerating-the-poseidon-hash-function">accelerating the Poseidon hash function</a>.”<br></p><p>On September 8th, our Co-Founder Anish Mohammed and Head of Product Saif Akhtar got together with team members of Aleo and Polychain Capital, the other ZPrize Partners collaborating towards the Poseidon hash function prize. <br></p><p>They held an AMA on the Poseidon hash function and the role of each partner in the challenge’s funding, design, and execution. <a href="https://youtu.be/IIkwHFSfwvs">The recording is available on YouTube</a> for those interested in learning more about this promising building block of zero-knowledge applications.</p> Shyft’s Office Hours <p>On September 13th, Panther's Co-Founder Oliver Gale joined Shyft Network’s Office Hours with Juan Aja and Thomas Borrel, the Co-Founder and COO of Shyft Network.<br></p><p>The conversation centered around the theme “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBStZNWjvig">Regulations on the Rise</a>,” touching on the recent regulatory moves, compliance’s role in Blockchain, and the ways Panther and Shyft are working together to address these issues without compromising trust.</p> Panther zTalks #4: Privacy Regulations in Blockchain &amp; Product Updates <p>The 4th episode of zTalks, published on September 19th, was hosted by Carlos Cano (Content Creation), Saif Akhtar (Head of Product), Natalie Cheng (regulatory SME), and Emile Josselin (Head of Community). <br></p><p>The status of privacy in blockchain in the face of the Tornado Cash crackdown, the middle ground between privacy and compliance, and updates about Advanced Staking development were a few topics discussed in this month’s episode.

With recent regulatory crackdowns and market drops, many are reevaluating what innovations Web3 can truly offer. Privacy is top of this list, and firms like a16z are taking note of <a href="https://twitter.com/a16zcrypto/status/1575124707187347457?s=20&amp;t=m3JBGYohvsYrMniLDFN_xw">zero-knowledge cryptography</a>, as are other&nbsp;KOLs.</p> Warren Paul Anderson Speaks on Privacy at&nbsp;Mainnet Warren Paul Anderson, CEO of Discreet Labs, speaks on privacy at&nbsp;Mainnet.<p>Discreet Labs CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/warpaul">Warren Paul Anderson</a>, participated in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Phil_Kelly_NYC/status/1573343293353889797?s=20&amp;t=00McvRHubQ-SRWvMEjGsuQ">privacy panel</a> at Mainnet with Mina Labs and Quadrata Network. While some use anonymity to mask bad behavior, most anonymity in Web3 is actually pseudonymity and is used with good intentions.

<p>Fungai joined the Foundation at the beginning of this year, as our interim Engineering Project Manager, while our Engineering Manager was away on sabbatical. He quickly settled in, and began making a positive contribution, helping the team review and improve our engineering processes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fungai shepherded the Zebra project through NU5 activation, and the implementation of support for lightwalletd. He also oversaw the beginning of the transition of the FROST from the research phase to implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Pili’s return from sabbatical, Fungai is leaving the Foundation. We are all sad to see him go, and wish him the best of luck in his future adventures!&nbsp;</p>

<p>While opinions about the actual impact of web3 are widespread, <a href="https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/reports/web-3-0-blockchain-market-10746">web3 is certainly gaining traction</a> and will continue to do so in the coming years. Various web3 technologies have the ability to disrupt the status quo and have also highlighted new ways of managing data, while encouraging decentralisation. All in all, while the future for web3 is bright, more and more companies will have to adopt the technology in order for it to be the success it can be. Let’s take a deeper dive!</p>







 A brief overview of web1 and web2 



<p>To understand web3 and everything it is, and is not, it is important to first understand web1 and web2. As the name suggests, web1 and web2 are the technologies preceding web3. We will explain each of them below.</p>



 Web1: Simple, static, uninteractive 



<p>Web1 is an umbrella term for all the first web technologies. Unlike current web pages, pages in the web1 era, pages were simple, read-only, and anything but interactive.</p>



<p>This era was the start of the world wide web, allowing everyone around the world with an internet connection to access all the available information online. During this period many people created their own websites which contained all kinds of information, from vacation pictures to encyclopedias. The website owner maintained these pages and they contained no such things as a social aspect, dynamic content, or smart features.</p>



 Web2: The social revolution 



<p>As technology moved forward, web pages started getting more and more advanced. This allowed developers to create more interesting and interactive web pages, which marked the start of the web2 era.</p>



<p>In the web2 era, people are not just reading pages, they are also interacting with them and with other people. Websites that embrace the social aspect of the web like Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube were founded in this period and have become incredibly popular.</p>



<p>Another key part of web2 is e-commerce. While web1 pages occasionally offered products through awkward catalogue-like pages, web2 pages feature easy-to-navigate webshops with integrated payment methods. This led to online shops like Amazon gaining massive popularity.</p>



<p>All in all, the web2 era is characterised by interactivity.</p>







 What is web3? 



<p>Now you are familiar with the past and present, it is time to move on to the future. Web3 is a relatively new term, and there is no consensus on what it means exactly. However, it is universally agreed upon that web3 refers to the next generation of web technologies that will likely dictate what our digital future will look like. But what does this mean exactly?</p>



<p>One of the core values of web3 is decentralisation,&nbsp; and web3 has various key blockchain technologies that enable this vision of decentralisation, such as cryptocurrency, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">self-sovereign identity</a>, NFT, and more. In order to get a better understanding of what this means, let’s explain what each of these terms mean in the web3 context:</p>



  Blockchain: The underlying technology of many web3 applications. In essence, blockchains are nothing more than a constantly growing list of transactions.  They are linked together using cryptography, often being managed by a network of decentralised entities.  Cryptocurrency: The finance layer on top of blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies are tokens on top of a blockchain that can be exchanged between people using a blockchain. These kinds of cryptocurrencies are often managed in a decentralised way. This means the network (and its participants) decide how the tokens are created and distributed.  Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): The ability for individuals and organisations to own and control their identities, without intervention or interference from any third parties. In this context, ‘self-sovereignty’ refers to the ability of the individual or the organisation in control of the identity to share it and present it to other agencies with no intermediaries.  Non-Fungible Token (NFT): In short, a non-fungible token is a token that represents a unique object. An NFT is unique, meaning there is no 100% similar NFT. They are the opposite of regular/fungible tokens, which are all similar and interchangeable. Another key difference between regular tokens and NFTs is that NFTs are non-divisible. NFTs allow the tokenisation of both digital or physical objects.  



<p>In essence, web3 is nothing more than an umbrella term for the next generation of (web) technologies. And together, the technologies described above form the basis for web3. However, the definition of web3 and all the concepts and technologies associated with it are not set in stone. As time and technology move forward the definition and impact of web3 will become more clear.</p>



 The technology of the future? 



<p>Technology is moving forward at a fast pace. The first smartphone with internet connectivity was introduced only 20 years ago, yet a world without smartphones seems almost unimaginable these days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The same goes for web technologies. What started as a simple way for people to access information, has grown to become an integral part of our lives. Web technologies have evolved a lot over the years, with the latest and greatest technological advancements being referred to as web3. Only the future can tell whether it will actually be impactful. But one thing is certain, it is exciting to see technology moving forward!</p>

 Introduction <p>As Ethereum emerged to provide smart-contract functionalities that the Bitcoin network could not support, Ethereum competitors rose to provide alternatives to its lingering problems.</p><p>So-called “Ethereum killers” may pride themselves on being novel ideas but, until now, most of their success is largely attributed to the limitations of the second most valuable blockchain network in the world. As they attempt to outperform the smart contract giant, valuable trade-offs have enabled them to make unexpected progress.</p><p>We have lately seen developments that indicate that Ethereum competitors are on the verge of taking steps that will forever differentiate them. Even though Ethereum has a roadmap with upgrades and transitions that will address its current challenges in the long term, its competitors have been able to make huge inroads at its expense.</p><p>In this article, we will look into Ethereum and its different issues. We will also explore how its competitors address these challenges while highlighting the tradeoffs they have had to make along the way.</p> Ethereum's challenges <p>In 2015, Ethereum emerged as an alternative to Bitcoin and its perceived simplicity as a general-purpose blockchain. Although <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/privacy-crypto-projects-bitcoin-competitors-or-not/">Bitcoin</a> was a breakthrough blockchain innovation, it was limited to payments and serving as a store of value. Ethereum changed the narrative of the crypto space when it introduced smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications on its network.</p><p>After powering the 2017 ICO craze, Ethereum began to experience exponential growth. <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/panthers-road-to-decentralization-part-1-setting-our-foundations-2e7e3874c09e/">Decentralized</a> applications sprung up rapidly on the network, and the price of its native token, Ether (ETH), began a steady climb (although it isn’t immune to the crypto market’s characteristic swings). Since its early years, Ethereum has witnessed massive adoption, boasting a majority of the dApps in the ecosystem and powering the growth of Decentralized Finance.</p>Ethereum’s average transaction fees through hype cycles. (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum/chart/txn-fee-avg">Source</a>)<p>Ethereum's widespread adoption has turned out to be a bittersweet occurrence. On the one hand, its growth drives innovation and users towards the crypto space, allowing ideas to become a reality. It is also the ideal framework for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-defi-privacy-suite-why-panther-is-different-and-necessary/">DeFi</a>, blockchain gaming, the metaverse, and other blockchain applications. On the other hand, the network’s first attempt at mass adoption exposed its frailties, as it struggled to remain scalable and economical due to the increased adoption.</p><p>Let’s take a look at Ethereum’s main challenges:</p> Scalability <p>The lack of scalability on Ethereum is probably the most talked-about problem the blockchain network faces, mostly because it is more evident than others. Through the ICO boom and DeFi summer, transaction volumes on Ethereum surged astronomically, as expected with widespread adoption. One small problem, however, arguably stopped further expansion: the network’s speed, or lack thereof.</p><p>Ethereum today can only process about 15-30 <a href="https://ethtps.info/">transactions per second</a>. With surging transaction volumes, slow TPS figures will lead to network congestion, resulting in delayed transaction finality and humongous transaction fees (see below). With dApps like games or decentralized exchanges needing instant transaction finality, Ethereum's processing power is a real challenge for applications built on the network, and arguably a reason many use cases haven’t found adoption on Ethereum.</p><p>Back when Ethereum first launched, many believed that it could increase its number of transactions per second by ramping up its node size (the amount of data a user needs to store to run a node) over the long term. <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/">Nodes</a> are active participants that run the blockchain and store its data. Increasing node size to combat scalability challenges will lead to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-dev-addresses-node-centralization-concerns-in-runup-to-the-merge">centralization</a>, as only a few powerful entities can participate in a “huge node” system.</p><p>It’s worth noting here that increasing the block size to scale a network is a thing of the past. In recent years, the scalability conversations have moved on to Layer-2s and Rollups as solutions to scale the network without the challenge of centralization. However, centralization fears <a href="https://beincrypto.com/80-of-ethereum-blocks-were-relayed-by-flashbots/">still persist</a>, especially with the recent transition of the Ethereum network’s consensus mechanism from PoW to PoS.</p> Increasing Transaction Costs <p>Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/vitalik-buterin-says-transaction-fees-need-to-reduce-to-5-cents-to-remain-acceptable/75941/1">claims</a> that Ethereum's gas fees should be around $0.05, ideally. During the DeFi boom and the gas wars that followed, average gas fees on Ethereum <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/defi-boom-fueling-eth-gas-fees-threatens-viability-of-smart-contracts/">soared</a> to around $60-$70. Within the Ethereum ecosystem. gas fees are simply bids for including a set of transactions in the limited block space. In case of high demand, these bids go up as users attempt to fast-track their transactions to gain an edge. This results in extremely high transaction costs.</p><p>At such levels, interacting with applications on Ethereum is beyond the reach of the average Web3 user, making developers opt for cheaper blockchain networks like Solana and BSC.</p><p>It is important to note that <a href="https://blockchain.news/opinion/opinion-why-ethereum-merge-wont-lower-gas-fees">the Merge</a> has not solved Ethereum's gas fees challenges. However, recent upgrades and the crypto market mood have seen average gas <a href="https://thedefiant.io/ethereum-gas-fees-low-level">prices drop</a> from around $40 to $15.55 as of the second half of 2022.</p> Centralization Fears <p>When Ethereum existed as a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blockchain-proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work</a> blockchain, some mining pools were considerably larger than others and, as such, had more consensus power. Of course, this model sparked talks of centralization, which defeats everything Ethereum represents: a secure, scalable, and decentralized blockchain network.</p><p>Today, Ethereum has completed its transition (known as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">The Merge</a>) to a proof-of-stake model after launching a Beacon chain in 2021 in preparation. The new arrangement has phased out the miners, replacing them with validators who staked Ether (ETH). More centralization fears have emerged as institutional capital and large exchanges vie for a large chunk of ETH staking power.</p> Privacy <p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/is-privacy-a-human-right-philosophy-economics-legality/">Privacy</a> is almost non-existent on Ethereum and many other Layer-1 blockchains, which presents a problem. Ethereum is a fully transparent blockchain, which means that every interaction is not only stored on the ledger but accessible to the public. While transparency may be a good thing, it is extreme, especially for institutional players and DeFi traders.</p><p><a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/">Zero-knowledge rollups</a> built on Ethereum have solved the privacy challenge to some extent, but these solutions cannot pass off as traditional blockchains. Many of them are limited and unable to support smart contract deployment. For example, <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zkevm-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">zkEVMs</a> are still in a work-in-progress stage, and without EVM compatibility it would be impossible for Layer-2 privacy solutions to reach mass adoption.</p> MEV <p>MEV stands for <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">Maximal Extractable Value</a>, a concept regularly associated with the Ethereum network (however, MEV is not Ethereum-specific). MEV represents the highest value that miners can extract from changing the position of transactions when creating an Ethereum block. MEV is <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/miner-extractable-value-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/#the-good-side-of-mev">not exactly a bad thing</a>, although malicious attempts are now common. Protocols have used MEV to balance prices across decentralized exchanges.</p><p>While MEV was known as Miner Extraction Value in the proof-of-work era, Ethereum has since become a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain. Still, the network is susceptible to several kinds of tactics for extracting MEV, like sandwich attacks, liquidation, and front-running. Due to how profitable MEV is for validators, independent searchers, and other network participants (MEV extraction since 2021 was allegedly worth over $600 million), MEV is not going away anytime soon.</p> Ethereum competitors <p>So-called Ethereum killers have sprung up everywhere in the crypto space, each addressing one or more of Ethereum's lingering problems. Here are how the most prominent Ethereum competitors line up and the challenges they mitigate:</p> Ethereum competitors that aim for scalability (Solana, Polkadot, Near) <p>Ethereum averages 15 to 30 transactions per second, making it less scalable than several Ethereum competitors. Chief among Ethereum's competitors that prioritize scalability include Solana, Near, and Polkadot.</p><p>Solana uses a <a href="https://medium.com/solana-labs/proof-of-history-a-clock-for-blockchain-cf47a61a9274">proof-of-history</a> mechanism, as opposed to Ethereum's proof-of-stake, to validate transactions. With an emphasis on scalability, Solana transacts at breakneck speed, boasting TPSs of up to 65,000 per second. It’s worth pointing out that Solana's claimed TPS numbers are vastly inflated due to consensus voting messages being included on-chain. As of a report in January 2022, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-data-shows-how-solana-transactions-compare-against-ethereum/">Solana’s actual TPS</a> stands at around 3000.</p><p>Gas fees on Solana are usually less than a fraction of a cent, making it a more scalable option than Ethereum. As a tradeoff, Solana has few validators and is a less decentralized network than Ethereum, and its speed and low transaction fees make it susceptible to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-hit-with-another-network-incident-causing-degraded-performance">DDOS attacks</a>. Solana Labs' Co-Founder Anatoly Yakovenko has repeatedly denied the network's susceptibility to DDOS attacks. Yakovenko blames Solana's network congestion and halts issues on its <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1478414400339939331">cost model</a> for computing which requires the transactions to specify all the resources they use up-front.</p><p><a href="https://near.org/">Near</a> is a Layer-1 blockchain solution that uses a proof-of-stake model and a powerful <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3336187/sharding-what-it-is-and-why-so-many-blockchain-protocols-rely-on-it.html">sharding</a> technology that ensures the network is never congested, even during peak periods. As a result, block finality on Near takes under two seconds, making it more scalable than Ethereum. As with Solana, Near trades decentralization for scalability, as it has fewer validators than Ethereum and Solana.</p><p><a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> is another highly scalable blockchain, although it employs a different approach than Solana, Near, and Ethereum. Polkadot's infrastructure connects multiple parallel blockchains, and it achieves transactional scalability by spreading the transactions across the parallel blockchains. When all <a href="https://www.prolitus.com/blog/what-are-parachain-and-parathread-in-the-polkadot-blockchain/">parachains and parathreads</a> on Polkadot go live, it is expected to achieve speeds of up to one million transactions per second (it’s always recommended to always take TPS estimation claims with a pinch of salt).</p> Aiming for interoperability (Cosmos, Cardano) <p>Interoperability means interactions between blockchains. Most traditional blockchains do not have infrastructure that allows them to speak to one another. Although Ethereum supports <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/cross-chain-defi-possible-or-forever-limited/">cross-chain</a> bridges, the network's interoperability pales compared to Cosmos and Cardano.</p><p><a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a> defines itself as "A decentralized network of independent parallel blockchains, each powered by a BFT consensus algorithm like Tendermint consensus." This means that, unlike Ethereum or other Layer-1 competitors, Cosmos is not just a blockchain but a network of many of these blockchains operating in parallel with one another.</p><p>Cosmos typifies interoperability with its framework of Cosmos SDK, the <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/tendermint-explained-bringing-bft-based-pos-to-the-public-blockchain-domain-f22e274a0fdb">Tendermint</a> BFT (<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained">Byzantine fault-tolerant</a>) algorithm, and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.</p><p>Since every blockchain in the Cosmos network is powered by the same BFT consensus mechanism called Tendermint, these blockchains can operate independently and yet interoperate with each other. That way, Cosmos network aims to create an internet of blockchains. Presently, blockchains built on Cosmos do not enjoy their underlying layer's security, although the introduction of <a href="https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-security-is-coming-to-the-cosmos-hub-f144c45fb035">interchain security</a> will solve this problem.</p>A diagram of Cosmos’s “Hub and Zone” model that lets Cosmos scale communication across all app-chains. (<a href="https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/how-does-cosmos-work-how-does-it-compare-to-bitcoin-and-ethereum-part-2">Source</a>)<p><a href="https://cardano.org/">Cardano</a> is another blockchain network geared towards interoperability. While Ethereum's interoperability is valid within its ecosystem and based on the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC-20</a> standard, Cardano uses side chains to facilitate blockchain-to-blockchain communication. Currently, Cardano does not have any notable tradeoff for its interoperability functionality.</p> Aiming for security (MEV Mitigation) (Solana &amp; Osmosis) <p>MEV extraction threatens Ethereum's viability, and here's how Ethereum competitors have managed to combat MEV extraction on their networks.</p><p><a href="https://osmosis.zone/">Osmosis</a> is a decentralized exchange built on Cosmos, and it has introduced a threshold cryptography mechanism that effectively limits validators' ability to MEV. Using threshold cryptography, Osmosis encrypts trade values before they hit the mempool, ensuring that front-running is impossible.</p><p>Learn more about how Osmosis aims to leverage threshold cryptography to mitigate MEV in this video podcast of Osmosis Labs’ co-founder Sunny Aggarwal:</p><p>Solana's infrastructure also makes it <a href="https://chainstack.com/what-is-mev-and-how-does-solana-solves-its-mev-issues/">less susceptible</a> to MEV extraction techniques like front-running or the utilization of searchers, as there is no mempool. The lack of mempools also prevents sandwich attacks. On this network, front-running bots can be mitigated with taxes on invalid transactions and increasing the cost of sending spam requests.</p><p>Also, only leading validators in a cluster can access transaction information before finality. If any validator engages in malicious activities, they will be penalized. As said earlier, Solana trades decentralization for speed, MEV mitigation, and scalability.</p> Aiming for privacy (Secret Network, Oasis, Panther) <p>Privacy concerns on Ethereum are valid, seeing that Ethereum is a fully transparent network. Two blockchain networks that have made inroads into privacy are <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> and <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol</a>.</p><p>Secret Network has strong claims to be the first privacy-first Layer-1 blockchain solution. The network is built with the Cosmos SDK, and it leverages a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.</p><p>With encryption protocols, key management, and a Trusted Execution Environment, Secret Network provides a form of privacy known as <a href="https://scrt.network/blog/programmable-privacy/">Programmable Privacy</a>, which supports smart contract deployment. While Secret Network prides itself as a privacy-first blockchain, it does not improve on Ethereum's scalability challenges and has suffered <a href="https://forum.scrt.network/t/discuss-network-issues-w-shade-airdrop-2-21-22/5475">congestion</a> with even lesser transaction volumes than Ethereum.</p><p>Oasis is another privacy-first concept, and it uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and <a href="https://www.trustonic.com/technical-articles/what-is-a-trusted-execution-environment-tee/">Trusted Execution Environments</a> to achieve confidential computing. The privacy features on Oasis allow the network to support data tokenization and <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/economic-analysis-of-private-defi/">private DeFi</a>, protecting sensitive user information and allowing for reputation-based under-collateralization. While Oasis is also more scalable than Ethereum, it has fewer validators, making it somewhat susceptible to centralization.</p><p><a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Panther protocol</a> is a cross-chain, privacy solution. It provides transactional privacy to DeFi users using a combination of <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/what-is-a-zero-knowledge-proof-defining-zkps-in-different-levels/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> and game theory, thus, programmatically protecting their alpha. Panther also supports <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/kyc-aml-how-crypto-might-change-a-traditional-finance-standard-forever/">KYC</a> and selective disclosures between trusted parties, enabling various services such as ID, authorization, and data verification services.</p>Blockchains in Trusted Execution Environments. (<a href="https://medium.com/@nadeem.bhati/blockchains-in-trusted-execution-environments-tees-9343b6c3f9e8">Source</a>) Ethereum competitors ain’t a threat… for now. <p>Ethereum's competitors have been around for a long while. While many can lay claim to fixing some of the lingering issues plaguing the Ethereum network, none has successfully wrested a significant portion of Ethereum's market share.</p><p>Ethereum has a loyal community, and the abundance of developer resources plus its popularity gives it a significant advantage compared to its competitors. However, some feel like the clock is ticking for Ethereum to solve its scalability issues before another blockchain eats a piece of its proverbial pie.</p><p>Solana, Near, and Polkadot are more scalable options, Secret Network and Oasis offer programmable privacy, Cosmos and Cardano support better interoperability, and MEV extraction is less of a worry on Solana and Osmosis. It’s certainly within the leading smart contract’s roadmap to fix some of these issues while on others (such as privacy), it’s practically a given that the network has forfeited them.</p><p>Over the next years, we should see how Ethereum performs as a Proof-of-Stake network with full sharding abilities. In the meantime, no one can discard the sudden emergence of a qualified player to (either temporarily or permanently) contend for the top spots in Layer-1 adoption.</p> About Panther <p>Panther is a decentralized protocol that enables interoperable privacy in Decentralized Finance using zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>Users can mint fully-collateralized, composable tokens called zAssets, which can be used to execute private, trusted DeFi transactions across multiple blockchains.</p><p>Panther helps investors protect their personal financial data and trading strategies, and provides financial institutions with a clear path to compliantly participate in DeFi.<br><br>Stay connected: <a href="https://t.me/pantherprotocol">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ZkPanther">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pantherprotocol">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://pantherprotocol.io/">Website</a></p>

 Web3 game developers can access key functions to integrate assets on Findora into their games using Defungify. <p>Developers can now seamlessly connect their Web3 game to the Findora blockchain with Defungify, a middleware company focused on making Web3 game development as easy as possible.</p>Defungify Is Now on&nbsp;Findora<p>The integration will make life much easier for game developers building on the Findora network. They will have access to an easy-to-use system that integrates NFTs into games with functions like fetching NFT metadata, querying an NFT from the blockchain, and much&nbsp;more.</p><p>From Defungify:</p><blockquote>Every blockchain operates differently, and the technology isn’t trivial to integrate with. If a game developer decides to add a new chain, the game developer would be essentially starting from scratch. Once Defungify is installed, you’re instantly multichain for your game. It’s a way to futureproof the game so it has the best chance of success long&nbsp;term.</blockquote><p>💡Follow Findora on <a href="https://twitter.com/Findora">Twitter</a> or join the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Findora_Official/">Reddit Community</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p><p>Defungify focuses on integrating with new blockchains so developers can focus on building a fun game. Its extensive toolkit includes NFT minting, a game launcher, testnet support, native cross-chain convertible NFTs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Findora offers a way for gaming platforms to work privacy into their games and protect player data. This can open a whole new realm of possibilities for game developers as players can hide what NFTs are in their wallets and what competitive advantage they may&nbsp;have.</p><p>But the innovation isn’t limited to GameFi. A leader in Web3 privacy, Findora is finding new ways to apply zero-knowledge proofs, including building a <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/adding-privacy-to-blockchain-identity-management-through-zkdid-6adb12a50a3f">zk-DID system</a> and adding <a href="https://medium.com/findorafoundation/the-findora-improvement-proposal-that-could-bring-auditability-to-privacy-a21952ca4f55">auditability to confidential transactions</a> for institutional adoption. Findora is actively preparing its chain for GameFi activity.</p><p>Learn more about Defungify on their <a href="https://www2.defungify.app/">website</a> and follow their <a href="https://twitter.com/DefungifyApp">Twitter</a> for updates on their progress.</p> About Findora <p>Findora builds privacy through advanced zero-knowledge proof cryptography. An innovative layer-1, it combines a native UTXO ledger optimized for privacy with an EVM extension for programmability and interoperability.

<p>We’re happy to announce the release of Samourai Wallet 0.99.98f. <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/download/wallet">You can download the APK from our website </a>or on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samourai.wallet">Google Play</a>. You can find <a href="https://docs.samourai.io/en/wallet/releases#v09998f">release notes</a> on our documentation site.</p><p>This is a big update with dramatic UI changes, new functionality, the release of a brand new feature, and improvements for our power&nbsp;users.</p> PayNym Bot &amp; Toolbar&nbsp;Menu <p>You’ll notice that the Samourai logo in the top left of the toolbar has been replaced with your individual PayNym Bot image. A PayNym Bot is a visual representation of a BIP47 Reusable Payment Code. A Bot is created by taking a BIP47 code and applying a hashing algorithm which produces a unique fingerprint used to create the Bot image. So each bot image is unique to each wallet. If you tap your PayNym bot image you will open the new toolbar&nbsp;menu.</p><p>In the Toolbar Menu you’ll notice some new options such as Collaborate and Tools. So let’s move on to the next major UI update we have made, Collaborative Transactions (Cahoots) has had a major UI&nbsp;rework.</p> Collaborate <p>The collaborative transaction has a long history in Samourai. In March 2019 we released our first iteration of collaborative transactions. It required users to manually scan and share at least 5 QR codes with their collaborator. It was just a start but we knew it would develop into a key&nbsp;feature.</p><p>In November 2020 <a href="https://medium.com/samourai-wallet/wallet-update-0-99-96-introducing-soroban-adc9a36a7ddb">we released our new open source app-agnostic, Tor based encrypted communication protocol called Soroban</a>. This allowed us to automate the coordination of small 2 person collaborative coinjoin transactions to make them much quicker than before and without using a centralised coordinator. These transactions, STONEWALLx2 and Stowaway enjoy heavy use among our user base and have even been implemented along with Soroban in third party wallets such as <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p><p>In this update we have created a brand new UI for both initiating and collaborating in STONEWALLx2 or Stowaway transaction.</p><p>Up until now the collaborative transaction workflow and UI were somewhat of an afterthought, and users needed to be pretty savvy in navigating around the app to make use of the&nbsp;feature.</p><p>This update should make it even easier for anyone to participate or initiate a new collaborative transaction. Both initiation and participation are located in one easy to reach location (before this update there could be 4 different places to go to initiate or participate in a transaction like&nbsp;this!)</p><p>For those that need a quick primer on STONEWALLx2:</p><blockquote>This type of transaction is a two person coinjoin that the sender and a third party collaborate to send to an external wallet. This is a great choice when sending to someone who doesn’t have Samourai Wallet, for instance a merchant using BTCPayServer. Using a STONEWALLx2 transaction to make your payments undermines the Common Input Ownership Heuristic — a bedrock of blockchain snoops and&nbsp;spies.</blockquote> Introducing JoinBot <p>One of the problems that remain with Collaborative Transactions in Samourai Wallet is that you need someone to collaborate with. This can be a problem for many users, especially new users. They may want to explore the feature, or benefit from the privacy enhancements that Collaborative Transactions offer but be unable to do so because they don’t have anyone they can collaborate with.</p><p>This is the perfect time to introduce our newest feature, JoinBot. For a small spam prevention fee you can have JoinBot act as the second participant in a STONEWALLx2 collaborative transaction</p><p>There are some benefits choosing to use JoinBot as your STONEWALLx2 collaborator.</p>  Joinbot is always online, so it is great for time sensitive payments where you might not have time to find a collaborator who is online and able to help&nbsp;you.  Joinbot only uses UTXOs directly from Whirlpool postmix, so you do not need to worry about the history of the collaborating UTXOs and how they have been handled by the collaborator.  Since JoinBot is online 24/7 it always has UTXOs registered for remixing, so there are very good odds that you collaborating with extremely well remixed&nbsp;UTXOs.   JoinBot fees <p>There is a small anti-spam fee in addition to the usual miner fees when using JoinBot. The service fee is set at 3.5% of the send amount or 0.01 BTC, whichever is&nbsp;less.</p><p>For example, if you are sending 0.1 BTC using JoinBot as a collaborator the fee would be 0.0035 BTC, meanwhile sending 1 BTC would use the capped maximum fee of 0.01&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>The fee is paid in a second transaction automatically using another type of collaborative transaction called Stowaway.</p><p>The fee transaction is not associated with the JoinBot transaction on the blockchain. This makes sure the STONEWALLx2 transaction made with JoinBot looks like every other STONEWALL transaction out there, you cannot tell any difference.</p> Some caveats   You will need to have at least two unrelated UTXOs available in your wallet in order to successfully perform a STONEWALLx2 with&nbsp;JoinBot.  STONEWALLx2 requires that both participants each pay half of the transaction miner fee. This is respected with JoinBot, but you will reimburse JoinBot for that half of the miner fee within the anti-spam fee transaction.  For this initial release we are only allowing a maximum transaction amount of 1.5 BTC using JoinBot as a collaborator. The minimum amount you can send is 546&nbsp;sats.   Tools <p>We’ve also introduced a new screen in the wallet activated from the new Toolbar Menu. This screen is called ‘Tools’ and contains new UI for sweeping private keys and calculating addresses for your wallet. Most casual users will not have much need to use this section of the wallet, but will be a big upgrade for our power&nbsp;users.</p>  Sweep Private key — You now have full control of the miner fee you pay for sweeping a private key, as well as what address derivation you wish to sweep to. The final big change here is you can now sweep Taproot addresses into your Samourai&nbsp;Wallet.  Sign Message — We moved this from where it was buried in the settings. You can now very easily sign a message using any address on any derivation within your&nbsp;wallet.  Wallet Address Calculator — Again, we moved this from buried deep in the settings. You can now derive address, redeem script and private key from any address in your wallet on any derivation path.   Authenticate using&nbsp;PayNym <p>A few years ago we came up with a specification for allowing users to login to websites/apps without needing to provide a username or password, just by using their PayNym. Sparrow Wallet has already added this specification into their wallet. Keep tuned for further announcements about this feature in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Thank you <p>Download Samourai Wallet 0.99.98f today.

<p>Data sells. A common notion out there. Yet it is oblivious to many of us, or we merely undermine the underlying value of our data.</p>



<p>The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data – <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data">Economist</a></p>



<p>Many companies leverage the acquired data to make big bucks, while one on an individual level is left to wonder how he is shown advertisements that correspond to his intent or interests. Almost everyone is a victim of targeted advertisements, but targeted advertisements are merely the tip of the iceberg. Remember getting that loyalty card from your local supermarket to get reward points? Or how about signing up for the Starbucks loyalty program to get free coffee? All they took in return were some key credentials such as your name, phone number, email, date of birth, and address. Similarly, giving consent to a mobile application to access your contacts, location, messages, and gallery or enabling a website to access cookies. It leaves us with a simple question: should we be handing over all this data? A simple photography application might require access to your location and contacts. What could be the reason for that?</p>



<p>All these credentials are used to store data, which comprises personal, behavioral, and engagement information. This data helps in generating user profiles, which in turn are sold to companies ultimately generating revenue. Every offline and online transaction gives away data that holds a monetary value. Everyone is getting their fair share of the pie and the only person missing out from the whole equation is the one giving out his data voluntarily for a free coffee or some discounts. It is not the companies hacking into your data: you are providing it of your own volition.</p>



<p>Terming it as a “Faustian Bargain”, Jeff Wiles states that it is a tradeoff we have to make in the digital world, adding on to that he stated one cannot be an “online hermit” these days.</p>



<p>Most of our daily life transactions are either carried out online or offline through various identity instruments or credentials, which comprise physical — a national ID card, passport, college degree, bank details — and digital credentials — email logins, and social media accounts. These transactions are essential to carry out day-to-day activities. But by providing these details, one also shares information that is entirely irrelevant. People feel more in control using their physical credentials. But what if they go missing or become inaccessible? Certainly, disadvantageous, as it is time-consuming to get them made again, or to pay the delivery fee again in the case of sending the documents abroad. In some cases, missing identity credentials could also lead to fraudulent activities — identity theft or manipulation — geared towards malignant designs. In a transformative world where paperless means of communication are becoming more popular, physical means of information sharing pose a great hurdle</p>



<p>One might say digital credentials are much more secure. Think again.</p>



<p>In earlier times, signing in using your digital credentials was done in silos, which meant creating unique identities and passwords for every single domain or application. A rather cumbersome task. Managing all these credentials became even more arduous, with so many usernames to remember. This later changed to a centralised alliance between the companies and third-party identity — login with Google, log in with Facebook—with each party having bits of autonomy.</p>



 Data losses and the stolen identity dilemma 



<p>Digital onboarding undeniably helped with the issue of password management and identity management. But what many did not realise was that, in doing so, they were handing over the access to their data to third-party companies, entrusting them with even more data.</p>



<p>The problems pertain not only to an individual level. Enterprises suffered a huge number of losses owing to data breaches for more than a decade. Personally identifiable information — IDs, passports, names, addresses, credit cards — all had been compromised by hackers who mainly hacked into the central databases of not just enterprises, but government systems also.</p>



<p>The data of Equifax, the largest U.S-based credit bureau, was compromised in 2017. The data breach comprised personal credentials, including social security numbers, birth dates, and addresses. The initial figure quoted contained 143 million consumers; 209,000 consumers also had their credit card data exposed, which was later raised to 147.9 million. Dubsmash, a popular video app, had its data put up for sale by the hackers on Dream Market: a dark web market comprising 1162 million email addresses, usernames, and passwords stolen. Personal data of users of the Under Armour-owned fitness app MyFitnessPal was among the massive information dump on Dream Market as well, resulting in the leakage of 617 million customer accounts.</p>



<p>Even the hospitality industry was not spared. The biggest hotel chain, Marriott International, declared that data of 500 million customers had been stolen. The breach started in 2014, and it took the company 4 years to realise its data was compromised. Once again, the primary intent was to hack personal identifiers and credentials (credit card numbers and expiration dates).</p>



<p>The backlash that Uber had to face following a data breach sank the company’s stock. Uber had chosen to keep the breach secret, until it became publicly denounced. It later emerged that Uber had acceded to pay ransom money to hackers. If that is not enough, wait until you come across “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-verizon-yahoo/yahoo-in-new-117-5-million-data-breach-settlement-after-earlier-accord-rejected-idUSKCN1RL1H1">The biggest data breach</a>” of the decade: the popular search engine and webmail company, Yahoo, had its data breached too. The figures came down to 3 billion in 2016.</p>



<p>The average total cost of a data breach in the U.S. for the companies studied had grown from $3.54 million in 2006 to $8.19 million in 2019, a 130 percent increase over 14 years – IBM (2019)</p>



<p>Identifying the root cause of breaches, IBM reported malicious attacks to be a major contributor – 51 percent of data breaches were because of malicious attacks. The report conducted entailed 17 sectors from housing and entertainment, to the healthcare industry. The average total cost of a data breach in the healthcare industry was $6.45 million</p>



 GDPR to the rescue 



<p>To safeguard the individual’s data, the European Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into action. Companies with clients in the European Union were told to be prepared in advance to strengthen measures to keep data intact and to allow transparency to be in place – consumers should be aware of the data that is being acquired and the underlying reason behind the acquisition. Furthermore, they would gain the right for them to revoke their data.</p>



<p>Altruistic in its fundamental motive – to give control of an individual’s data to themselves and protect their data – the European GDPR regulations came into existence. The United States adopted a similar model and came up with the California Consumer Privacy Act. Companies started gearing up for GDPR compliance back in 2018.</p>



<p>According to the report published by IAPP, around 1.1 billion was spent on the preparation of GDPR alone in the UK — Forbes</p>



<p>The cost of continuous compliance reported for small and medium enterprises surpassed $100,000. A reported figure of $1 million was spent by 20% of the companies to be prepared for GDPR. Many companies had to dump their data and start from scratch, as the amount of capital for getting technical and legal expertise to remodel their existing system seemed inordinate and transcended their financial solvency.</p>



 Debunking the centralisation dilemma 



<p>Although driven by an altruistic cause, GDPR still operates on centralisation. With the introduction of GDPR, an idea of data security and data ownership was instilled amongst the masses, reaffirming our faith in enterprises, yet centralisation remains the biggest hurdle.</p>



<p>Centralisation itself is the biggest risk. No matter how secure you make it, or how much companies spend on cybersecurity measures regardless of the type of encryption level, hackers will find a way to break in.</p>



 Self-Sovereign Identity and Distributed Ledger Technology 



<p>If centralisation is the issue, would it be possible to make data more secure and increase personal data ownership using a decentralised solution? One of these possible decentralised solutions is <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI). SSI is essentially an identity base layer, which operates on blockchain technology, making it decentralised by nature.</p>



<p>A common question may arise, how does decentralisation avert security breaches and data hacks?</p>



<p>Decentralisation implies that data is being stored on distributed channels instead of one, meaning it is not stored in a centralised database. This makes it more secure, and data autonomy is not centralised. That means enterprises will not have to pay a hefty amount of money to cybersecurity companies to keep their data intact. While it sounds rather utopian, it is quite the contrary and it is very simplistic and attainable.</p>



<p>Imagine going to a car hire company and renting a car in another country. Now this company does not need to know about your date of birth or the expiry date of your licence. All it needs to know is that the permit is valid for the time duration the car is being hired for, is issued by a trusted authority (government of the country), and whether that issuing authority has legal credentials or strategic alliance with the country of the car hire company. As soon as the car is returned safely to the car hire company the information provided initially should be wiped out from their system unless there are security concerns.</p>



<p>To fully comprehend the alternative paradigm -SSI-, one must be familiar with the ecosystem in which it operates: blockchain. Before moving on to blockchain, one must be familiar with two key terms that the SSI incorporates:</p>



  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable credentials (VCs)</a>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</a>  



<p>Now, it all appears to be very complicated with the technical jargon involved, but it is a very simple model to understand.</p>



<p>Verifiable credentials imply that your personal information has been issued by an issuer, a governing body, an authority — say a government, an educational institute, or a bank.</p>



<p>Once you get a hold of these digital credentials, you become the subject or holder of these credentials. When you apply for something, these credentials need to be verified —Identity Interactions — hence the need for a verifier, be that a bank loan, a mortgage, or traveling abroad. These digital credentials can be verified across different companies.</p>



<p>Say you want to apply for an academic program in another country based on your qualifications. Your previous educational institute would be the issuer of the verified credential, once that credential has been issued to you it can be verified by the educational institute where you plan on studying, thus making them a verifier.</p>



<p>In the real world, our primary identifier is our face. The other ones are our national IDs, driving licences, or passports. Now think of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-use-cases/">DID</a> as a digital face. Each verifiable credential is attached to a unique DID, which is distributed, making it self-sovereign in nature. Think of DIDs as a mode of communication or the exchange of peer-to-peer information. It allows associating multiple claims to a single layer, can be accessed from any system, and the identity owner is in complete control to revoke them. The generated DID is always in pair with a public key and a private key. A DID can have many public keys. Everything is fragmented. A DID itself does not hold any information itself and merely resolves the issue of having an identifier linked to the credentials with public keys.</p>



<p>It should be noted that these verifiable credentials are not stored on the distributed ledger system. Think of blockchain as a giant spreadsheet where transactions are taking place, but that spreadsheet is not saved on a single database, in fact, it is an open-source spreadsheet, held within distributed storage, with information registries that correspond to transactions or exchange of public keys using DIDs.</p>



<p>The credentials are stored in a digital wallet that corresponds to a physical wallet. You only use the credentials that are required. What grants a user more power is the control of his/her identity. He does not have to reveal all the information present in his credential, only the information that obviates the need of providing additional information. In the SSI framework it is referred to as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs">zero-knowledge proof</a>: disclose information that is relevant – as mentioned earlier, a car hire company should not be concerned with your date of birth but should know that the permit you hold is valid. Furthermore, it gives you more control as you can revoke the information provided or allow it to be present in a system for a certain limit of time. For instance, an application wants to access your phone’s location. You allow it to do so for that time duration and then you simply revoke the access with the click of a button.</p>



 But are these digital wallets safe? 



<p>Yes, these digital wallets are created using an asymmetric coding technique, which usually helps in creating a pair of keys. One is the public key and the other one is a private key. The public keys, as the name implies are there to view anytime and are used for exchanging information and can be revoked, however, the private key is for the account holder himself, be that an issuer, a verifier, or a subject. It is only through a private key that one can pass on his credentials using his DID to an issuer who then validates the credentials and sends them to the verifier using his DID. In this way, a quick and efficient way of peer-peer information can be established.</p>



<p>It can be established that SSI gives complete control of public identity, safeguards personal data, and is accessible with the click of one button from anywhere in the world. Furthermore, it establishes trust between parties that guarantees the authenticity of the data being provided. It operates within the realm of ethical information sharing ultimately keeping your identity intact.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see what the future holds for SSI, but given the growing societal need for a secure SSI solution, it seems like it is only a matter of time before one of these solutions is widely adopted.</p>



<p></p>



 Key takeaways 



  Every offline and online transaction gives away data that holds a monetary value  Digital onboarding helps with credential management, but its downside is that, by using this method, the individual hands over the access to their data to third-party companies  Major data hacks have compromised the personal and financial data of millions of customers  GDPR aims to protect the right of an individual to safeguard their privacy. Yet, the GDPR framework is inherently centralised  SSI enables an individual to retain control of their data, and share only what’s relevant  SSI is based on Verifiable credentials (VCs) and Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) principles  Verifiable credentials imply that an individual’s personal information has been issued by an issuer, a governing body, an authority — say a government, an educational institute, or a bank.  You can think of a DID as a digital face that helps you identify yourself to others  Through the my.D product, <a href="https://zaisan.io/apps-tools/myd/">Zaisan offers a secure SSI solution</a>
