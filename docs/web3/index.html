<p>Polynomials are quintessential in machine learning for establishing relationships between outputs and inputs. However, there is also a field in cryptography which could not be made possible without polynomials - zero-knowledge technology. In zero-knowledge proof systems, computations are often represented as arithmetic circuits, and these circuits are translated into polynomials. This process is crucial for generating proofs that can demonstrate the correctness of computations without revealing the underlying data. The involved complexity explains the massive adoption hurdle for zk rollups compared to optimistic ones. Succinct aims to simplify the use of zero-knowledge proofs by providing a zkVM (SP1) that allows code written in languages like Rust to be proven in a privacy-preserving way. By doing so, it aims to lower the barrier to implementing zk-rollups and increase their adoption.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Uma’s background and her interest in zero knowledge tech  How Succinct’s story began  ZK light clients  ZK circuits  SP1 and the RISC-V instruction set  The prover network  Use cases  ZK rollups and commoditizing ZKPs  Incentivizing provers  Succinct’s business model  Supported blockchain applications  Bottlenecks in ZK adoption  Succinct metrics  SP1’s competitive advantage and future roadmap  The real world impact of verifiability  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/pumatheuma">Uma Roy on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/SuccinctLabs">Succinct on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>Short for Private Instant Verified Transaction, PIVX is a leading blockchain project that prioritizes user privacy, security, and decentralized governance. Unlike many mainstream cryptocurrencies, the project offers users a powerful alternative that emphasizes individual financial sovereignty.</p><p>To clear your doubts, privacy is not akin to malicious or anti-government. PIVX is open-source, licensed under MIT, and is committed to complying with global AML/CFT standards, including FATF regulations.</p><p>While I wouldn’t want to bore you with a long history of PIVX, here’s a compressed timeline of the project’s development.</p><p>· Launched on January 30th, 2016 under the name Darknet&nbsp;(DNET)</p><p>· Transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) after 259200&nbsp;blocks</p><p>· Rebranded to PIVX on January 1,&nbsp;2017</p><p>· Operates a robust decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), governed by masternode holders</p><p>· Became the first PoS network to enable transaction anonymity in October&nbsp;2017</p><p>· Delivered SHIELD, a fully customized integration of zk-SNARKs, in&nbsp;2020</p><p>· Multiple exchange listings and vendor integrations since inception</p> Getting Started with&nbsp;PIVX  1. Where to Store&nbsp;PIVX <p>You will need a wallet to store your PIV coins irrespective of how you choose to participate in the PIVX ecosystem. From the PIVX Core wallet to the much lighter <a href="https://app.mypivxwallet.org/">MyPIVXWallet</a> (MPW), third-party web wallets such as Komodo, Arctic, and NOW Wallet, there are a plethora of options to choose&nbsp;from.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, larger funds should be stored in cold storage such as the PIVX Core wallet or Ledger, while smaller amounts can be left on centralized exchanges for trading or the MPW for staking and masternoding.</p> 2. How to Get&nbsp;PIVX <p>You can purchase PIV using fiat or other cryptocurrencies on exchanges that support it. Alternatively, you can acquire the coins through peer-to-peer trading platforms.</p><p>The cryptocurrency is listed on popular CEX such as Binance, MEXC, Gate.io, BitMart, XT.COM, and several&nbsp;others.</p><p>Another interesting way to obtain PIV coins is by participating in the ecosystem. The PIVX marketing team routinely hosts giveaways on social&nbsp;media.</p> 3. Staking Your PIV&nbsp;Coins <p>Staking is one of the ways to participate in the PIVX ecosystem. Stakers secure the network and build the blockchain by creating the blocks and submitting them to the network. The interesting thing about staking PIV is that users can earn staking rewards while keeping their funds securely locked in offline cold&nbsp;storage.</p><p>Once a node has fully synchronized with the PIVX network and holds a minimum of 1 PIVX, it becomes eligible to participate in staking and contribute to network security. At the time this article was written, the estimated annual ROI was 13%. Check out this <a href="https://pivx.org/cold-staking">guide</a> to learn more about staking your PIV&nbsp;coins.</p> 4. Your Voice Matters, Become a Masternode Operator <p>Masternodes, and by extension, decentralized governance, is one of the cornerstones of PIVX. Masternodes provide layer 2 services such as instant send and additional security for the network. <a href="https://docs.pivx.org/masternodes/masternodes">Hosting</a> a PIVX masternode requires a 10,000 collateral, with an estimated ROI of around 15% per&nbsp;annum.</p><p>In addition to PIV rewards, masternodes are given voting rights to participate in governance.</p><p>PIVX’s decentralized governance system allows the community to propose and vote on projects, with masternodes playing a key role in decision-making. The treasury provides a monthly budget of 432,000 PIV for community-driven projects. Proposals that garner sufficient support from masternode holders are funded from this treasury.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-for-beginners-your-complete-guide-to-getting-started-52b091443ae7">PIVX for Beginners: Your Complete Guide to Getting Started</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.1.0">Zebra 2.1.0</a>. This release includes some necessary updates post-NU6 activation.</p>



<p>We are now verifying that V5 transactions in the mempool have the correct consensus branch ID before returning a transaction ID, which would indicate a successful insertion in the mempool, even though they would be eventually rejected by the block consensus checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Zebra also now returns an error when trying to submit transactions that would eventually fail some consensus checks (e.g. double spends) but would also return a transaction ID indicating success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release also bumps Zebra’s initial minimum protocol version such that this release of Zebra will always reject connections with peers advertising a network protocol version below 170,120 on Mainnet and 170,110 on Testnet. Prior to this change, these connections would have been accepted until Zebra’s chain state reaches the NU6 activation height. While this is standard procedure in Zebra after a Zcash network upgrade, this change to the minimum protocol version is classified as a breaking change in Zebra.</p>



<p>In addition, the <code>getblock</code> RPC method has been updated to return some additional information such as the block height (even if you provide a block hash) and other fields as supported by the <code>getblockheader</code> RPC call.</p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.1.0">v2.1.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

       AI in 2025: Building Blocks Firmly in Place        
Published December 9, 2024


 
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 


 
	 
        2024 was AI’s primordial soup year. In 2025, AI’s foundations are solidifying.         
Published December 9, 2024


 
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 


 
	 
  



 
<p>Last January, we compared ChatGPT to AI’s “Big Bang” and predicted that 2024 would be AI’s “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2024/">primordial soup</a>” year. The AI ecosystem was abounding with new ideas and potential energy. It was a ripe moment for new entrepreneurs. “There is much potential in the air, and yet it is still amorphous,” we wrote at the time. “Vision is required to convert it into something real, tangible and, ultimately, impactful.”</p>



<p>Today, the AI ecosystem has hardened. There are now five “finalists” in the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">race for biggest model</a>. Nvidia’s highly anticipated Blackwell chip is shipping <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-will-reportedly-start-blackwell-server-deliveries-in-early-december-the-first-servers-will-go-to-microsoft">this month</a>. Data centers, many of which were planned in early 2024, are entering full-on <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-data-center-buildout/">build mode</a>. TSMC is building new fab capacity and Broadcom is working on custom AI chips: the entire <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-ai-supply-chain-tug-of-war/">supply chain</a> has shifted into high gear. In every industry from healthcare to law to insurance, new AI initiatives are kicking off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If 2024 was the primordial soup year for AI, the building blocks are now firmly in place. AI’s potential is now congealing into something real and tangible—embodied by physical data centers that are rising up all across America from Salem, PA to Round Rock, TX to Mount Pleasant, WI. If 2024 was about new ideas abounding, 2025 will be about sifting through those ideas to see which really work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, we offer three predictions for the year ahead:</p>



 1. LLM providers have evolved distinct superpowers—this should lead to incremental differentiation and a contested pecking order in 2025 



<p>In 2024, the big model race was all about reaching parity with GPT-4. Five companies achieved this objective (or got close enough) and thus became “finalists:” Microsoft/OpenAI, Amazon/Anthropic, Google, Meta and xAI. Others dropped out of the race, most notably, Inflection, Adept and Character.</p>



<p>To get to GPT-4 quality, these companies ran roughly the same playbook: Collect as much data as possible, train on as many GPUs as possible and refine the pre-training/post-training architecture to maximize performance. With talent moving fluidly across organizations in 2024, few trade secrets remain.</p>



<p>As each player prepares for the next round of LLM scaling—which will likely involve another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/zuckerberg-says-meta-will-need-10x-more-computing-power-to-train-llama-4-than-llama-3/">10x increase</a> in compute scale—the labs are evolving differentiated superpowers. They have “chosen their weapons,” so to speak, for the battle ahead. In 2025, these distinct strategies should lead to disparate outcomes, with some players pulling ahead and others falling behind.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Google – Vertical Integration: Google’s advantage going into 2025 is vertical integration. Google is the only player with its own first-class chips: TPUs have a chance to give NVDA GPUs a run for their money in 2025. Google also builds its own data centers, trains its own models and has a very strong internal research team. Unlike Microsoft and Amazon, which have partnered with OpenAI and Anthropic, respectively, Google is going for the prize by owning every part of the value chain. 
 



 
 OpenAI – Brand: We’ve seen a handful of surveys on unaided awareness of ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. Gemini, and it’s not close. OpenAI has the strongest brand in AI, bar none. This has resulted in the strongest revenue engine among the big AI players, with OpenAI reportedly north of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html">$3.6B</a> in revenue. If success in AI ends up hinging on consumer mindshare and enterprise distribution, OpenAI may continue to widen the gap between itself and rivals.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Anthropic – Talent: 2024 saw a big exodus of research talent from OpenAI, paired with inflows to Anthropic. With Jon Schulman, Durk Kingma and Jan Leike all leaving OpenAI for Anthropic in 2024, Anthropic has been gaining mindshare with research talent. The company also made some big executive hires, adding Instagram co-founder Mike Kreiger as Chief Product Officer. With GPT-3 inventor Dario Amodei at the helm, Anthropic has carved out its position as a favored destination for AI scientists.&nbsp; 
 



 
 xAI – Data Center Construction: We wrote in our piece on “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">Steel, Servers, and Power</a>” about the importance of data center construction to the next phase of the AI race. With xAI bringing on their 100k GPU Colossus cluster <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/09/27/2024/elon-musks-new-memphis-data-center-hits-an-ai-milestone-with-nvidia-chips">in record time</a>, the company is now the pace setter for data center scaling. The next milestone for xAI and its rivals will be a 200k cluster and then a 300k cluster. If it ends up being true that “scale is all you need,” xAI is well-positioned to continue its rapid ascent.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Meta – Open Source: Meta, which already has strong distribution advantages through Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, has chosen to go all-in on open source. Meta is the only big player in the pack taking this approach. Meta’s Llama models have ardent fans and the closed-source vs. open-source debate continues to rage on. If frontier advancements start to slow down, Meta will be well-positioned to leverage its open-source models for rapid dissemination of these capabilities. 
 



<p>In the big model race, rigorous execution lies ahead. The competitive landscape and posture of each of the players has solidified. In 2025, we will see which of these strategies prove prescient—and which prove ill-fated.</p>



 2. AI Search is emerging as a killer app—in 2025, it will proliferate 



<p>Ever since ChatGPT came out, we’ve all been on the hunt for AI’s killer use case. What persistent new user behaviors will stand the test of time?</p>



<p>In 2024, many different applications were tested from AI girlfriends to AI rental assistants to voice agents and AI accountants.</p>



<p>One use case that we think will proliferate in 2025 is AI as a search engine. Perplexity has been on a tear since its launch, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/perplexity-search-ai-google.html">reaching 10M monthly active users</a>. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search in October, an expansion of its existing search-like capabilities. The Wall Street Journal ran a piece recently headlined “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/googling-is-for-old-people-thats-a-problem-for-google-5188a6ed">Googling is for Old People</a>.” Ironically, this challenge to Google comes just as the company is mired in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24302415/doj-google-search-antitrust-remedies-chrome-android">anti-trust litigation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI search is a powerful re-invention of a technology that rapidly became the internet’s killer app. Internet search is a navigational technology based on indexing the web. AI search is an informational technology based on LLMs that can read and semantically understand knowledge. For white collar workers, this will be a huge boon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI search may fragment what is currently a monolithic market. It’s possible to imagine a world where every profession has its own specialized AI search engine—analysts and investors now default to Perplexity, lawyers will use platforms like Harvey, and doctors will use solutions like OpenEvidence. Along these lines, one can think of Midjourney as search over the “pixelverse,” Github Copilot as search over the “codeverse,” and Glean as search over the “documentverse.” Unlike in traditional search, AI search can go much deeper semantically, and is therefore an order of magnitude more powerful, resulting in significant incremental productivity gains.</p>



<p>The text response as a product surface area is deeper than first meets the eye. Not all text responses are created equal. We think LLMs allow for real product differentiation across multiple dimensions, and that founders will build unique product experiences around these capabilities, targeted at specific customer audiences:</p>



 
 Intent Extraction: Tightly matching the response to the user’s intent becomes easier with domain specialization. For example, a doctor and patient asking the same question will want to see different types of responses. 



 Proprietary Data: Unique datasets like case law for lawyers, financial data for analysts or weather data for insurance underwriters will be important in white collar domains. Getting the answer right is table stakes in a business context.&nbsp; 



 Formatting: How results are presented to the user, for example how verbose or concise the response is, use of bullets, use of multi-modal content, reference to sources. Accountants tend to digest information differently than journalists, for example.&nbsp; 



 Interface Design: Code search needs to live in the IDE. Accounting policy search needs to live in your accounting SaaS platform. Semantic search benefits from context around the user’s existing workflow and data. Different domains will require different interfaces. 
 



<p>New domain-specific AI search engines will map themselves as tightly as possible onto the “theory of mind” of their target personas. Doctors, lawyers and accountants don’t think alike. As we become experts in a given domain, our patterns for extracting knowledge and making decisions begin to diverge. Doctors confront medical literature, lawyers confront case law, investors confront earnings reports. The way we dissect, analyze and make decisions on this knowledge is different in each domain.</p>



<p>There is likely to be a bifurcation between consumer and enterprise. In our capacity as consumers, we all have roughly the same needs, hence the smashing product-market fit of ChatGPT. However, in our capacity as professionals, we have different needs. It is fairly straightforward to imagine that every knowledge worker will have at least two AI search engines they use daily—one for work and one for everything else.</p>



 3. ROI will remain problematic and CapEx will begin to stabilize in 2025 



<p>We’ve written about <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">AI’s $200B question</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B question</a>, which explore the tremendous capital expenditure coming out of the Big Tech companies, and the lack of commensurate end-user revenue to derive a payback for these cash outlays.</p>



<p>Going into 2024, the Big Tech companies were nervous about AI being a threat to their oligopoly in the cloud business. As we wrote in the “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">Game Theory of AI CapEx</a>,” these companies felt they had no choice but to spend aggressively to ensure their continued dominance in an AI future. If they didn’t spend, others would, and they’d fall behind.</p>



<p>Entering 2025, the picture has changed dramatically. Big Tech companies have their arms locked firmly around the AI revolution. Not only do they control the vast majority of the data centers that power AI, but they own significant equity stakes in the big model companies, and they are among the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/06/ai-craze-getting-funded-by-tech-giants-distorting-traditional-vcs.html">largest backers</a> of new AI startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Big Tech feeling more confident, we think 2025 will be a stabilization year for AI CapEx. If 2024 was a scramble to sign deals for land and power, 2025 will be an execution year. Shovels are in the ground, and these companies will be focused on completing their new projects on-time and on-budget. They will then need to sell this installed capacity to customers and work with enterprises to help them achieve success with their new AI capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After roughly doubling CapEx levels since pre-ChatGPT, we may see some normalization in 2025. The latest CapEx figures released in Q3 suggest that the trendline is already starting to stabilize inside of Microsoft and Google. Amazon and Meta are still ramping, but may reach steady state in early 2025. (While Meta looks flat in the chart below, the company has issued guidance for increased CapEx in Q4).</p>



Source: Earnings transcripts, public filings



<p>Oligopolistic dynamics are likely to set-in as well. Each of the Big Tech companies follows their rivals closely. If it looks like the industry is on a glide path to a “new normal,” that may be welcome news for all. It would provide further support for a new equilibrium in 2025 vs. continued ratcheting of spend.</p>



<p>As new data center capacity comes online in 2025, AI compute prices should continue their epic decline. This is great news for startups and should incentivize net-new innovation. As we’ve pointed out in the past, startups are primarily consumers of compute vs. producers of compute, and so they benefit from overbuilding. The Big Tech companies are effectively creating a subsidy that will accrue to the entire AI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Many comparisons have been made between the Clouds and the railroad oligopoly of the Gilded Age. If data centers are indeed the rails of the digital economy, then the new AI rails will be securely in place by the end of 2025. The question remains what freight will ride on those rails, and how we can leverage this new technology to create value for customers and end-users.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of leveraging AI’s building blocks to create incredible new capabilities that will change people’s lives.</p>

<p>On October 31, Kraken <a href="https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/support-for-monero-xmr-in-europe?ref=hackernoon.com">delisted</a> Monero (XMR) from its European Economic Area (EEA) market, joining the growing list of exchanges that have brought down the hammer on coins that allow users to transact anonymously.</p><p>A perfect storm of regulatory pressure has battered privacy coins in 2024. Nearly 60 delistings, a record since 2021, have swept across centralized exchanges. Monero and Dash have been particularly hard-hit, with delistings skyrocketing sixfold and nearly twentyfold, respectively.</p><p>Given the stringent stance of regulators, one is left to ponder the future of privacy coins. Will there be more clampdowns or will they enjoy increased patronage amid a growing concern for financial privacy?</p> What Are Privacy&nbsp;Coins? <p>Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies designed to obfuscate transaction details. Like a magic cloak that hides your financial transactions from prying eyes, they make it extremely difficult to trace the sender, recipient, and amount of a transaction.</p><p>Think of it this way: when you use a regular cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, everyone can see your transactions on a public ledger. It’s like your financial life is an open book. But with privacy coins, your transactions are shrouded in mystery. It becomes much harder for anyone to track your spending&nbsp;habits.</p><p>Fun fact: Bitcoin may seem anonymous, but it’s more like a pseudonym. By delving into the blockchain, it’s often possible to unmask the identities behind public&nbsp;keys.</p> Brief History of Privacy&nbsp;Coins <p>One of the earliest pioneers in this space was Bytecoin, which introduced ring signatures to mask the origin of transactions in 2012. However, concerns about its initial distribution and lack of transparency hindered its adoption.</p><p>Monero, a fork of Bytecoin, built upon these foundations and introduced further privacy enhancements, including stealth addresses and Ring Confidential Transactions in 2014. These innovations made it significantly more difficult to track the flow of funds, propelling Monero to the forefront of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.</p><p>ZCash, another major player, introduced zk-SNARKs, a powerful cryptographic technique that allows users to prove the validity of a transaction without revealing any specific details. While this offered strong privacy, it required significant computational resources and a trusted setup&nbsp;process.</p><p>Other projects, such as Dash, PIVX, Verge, and NavCoin, also emerged, each with its unique approach to privacy. Dash, for example, introduced optional privacy features like CoinJoin, while PIVX focused on a combination of privacy and masternode governance.</p> The Regulatory Tightrope <p>Regulators have long eyed privacy coins with suspicion. For years, they’ve been tightening the noose around these anonymous cryptocurrencies. Japan led the charge in 2018 with a blanket ban, followed by Australia and South Korea in 2020. The UAE’s strict crypto rules and the EU’s MiCA regulation further proved&nbsp;hostile.</p><p>Major exchanges have felt the heat. Kraken delisted XMR for European users in 2024, while Binance pulled the plug entirely. OKX and Huobi also succumbed to regulatory pressure, delisting privacy tokens in 2024 and 2022, respectively.</p><p>These regulatory crackdowns have cast a long shadow over the future of privacy coins. As governments worldwide tighten their grip on cryptocurrencies, privacy-focused coins will face an uphill battle. The recent delistings on top exchanges highlight the challenges these coins may&nbsp;face.</p><p>While we may see more clampdowns in more jurisdictions, I believe a sizeable portion of the market will be transferred to decentralized exchanges. Proponents of the privacy ethos will likely look for ways to bypass these hurdles even in restricted jurisdictions. A decentralized approach, driven by a strong community, could help privacy coins thrive in a hostile regulatory environment. By fostering community-led development and promoting decentralized exchanges, privacy coins may be able to circumvent traditional regulatory hurdles.</p><p>I also envisage that privacy coin developers will adapt by exploring innovative solutions. This could involve developing new privacy-enhancing technologies or focusing on specific use cases that align with regulatory frameworks. There are already a few solutions in this regard. For instance, PIVX allows for both SHIELDED and transparent transactions, offering users optional&nbsp;privacy.</p> Give the Dog a Bad Name and Hang&nbsp;Him <p>In one of my <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/money-laundering-facts-fiat-vs-crypto-810a4ad29771">previous articles</a>, I separated facts from myths regarding the use of cryptocurrencies as a tool for money laundering. “Traditional fiat currencies have been the primary vehicle for money laundering for centuries,” not cryptos. However, critics often raise dust over crypto’s potential use in money laundering, difficulties in implementing KYC and AML regulations, and concerns about tax evasion. While these concerns are valid, the upsides of the tech are often downplayed.</p><p>Privacy coins are not just about hiding transactions. They represent a broader movement towards financial sovereignty, protection from economic surveillance, resistance to censorship, and providing financial tools for unbanked populations.</p> Conclusion <p>Privacy coins stand at a critical juncture. They represent not just a technological innovation, but a philosophical stance on financial freedom and individual privacy. As digital surveillance becomes more pervasive, these cryptocurrencies offer a potential counterbalance, ensuring that individuals maintain control over their financial information.</p><p>In general, the future of privacy coins will be shaped by a delicate balance between technological innovation, regulatory adaptation, and societal acceptance.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>What happens when artificial intelligence starts weighing in on our moral decisions? Matt Prewitt is joined by Meaning Alignment Institute co-founder Joe Edelman to explore this thought-provoking territory in examining how AI is already shaping our daily experiences and values through social media algorithms. They explore the tools developed to help individuals negotiate their values and the implications of AI in moral reasoning – venturing into compelling questions about human-AI symbiosis, the nature of meaningful experiences, and whether machines can truly understand what matters to us. For anyone intrigued by the future of human consciousness and decision-making in an AI-integrated world, this discussion opens up fascinating possibilities – and potential pitfalls – we may not have considered.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing">CouchSurfing - Wikipedia</a> | <a href="http://couchsurfing.org">CouchSurfing.org | Website</a>  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day?subtitle=en">Tristan Harris: How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day | TED Talk</a>  <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology | Website</a>  <a href="https://www.meaningalignment.org/">MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE | Website</a>  <a href="https://replika.com/">Replika - AI Girlfriend/Boyfriend</a>  <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/will-ai-improve-exponentially-at-value-judgments/">Will AI Improve Exponentially At Value Judgments? - by Matt Prewitt | RadicalxChange</a>  <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/">Moral Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica">Summa Theologica - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/05/16/when-generative-ai-refuses-to-answer-questions-ai-ethics-and-ai-law-get-deeply-worried/">When Generative AI Refuses To Answer Questions, AI Ethics And AI Law Get Deeply Worried</a> | AI Refusals  <a href="https://time.com/7012865/amanda-askell/">Amanda Askell: The 100 Most Influential People in AI 2024 | TIME</a> | Amanda Askells' work at Anthropic  <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/taylor.htm">Overcoming Epistemology by Charles Taylor</a>  <a href="https://catholicstand.com/god-beauty-symmetry-science/">God, Beauty, and Symmetry in Science - Catholic Stand</a> | Thomas Aquinas on symmetry  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek">Friedrich Hayek - Wikipedia</a> | “Hayekian”  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky - Wikipedia</a> | “AI policy people, especially in this kind Yudkowskyian scene”  <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/lieder_resource.pdf">Resource-rational analysis: Understanding human cognition as the optimal use of limited computational resources</a> | Resource rational (cognitive science term)  <p>Papers &amp; posts mentioned</p>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636">[2404.10636] What are human values, and how do we align AI to them? | Paper by Oliver Klingefjord, Ryan Lowe, Joe Edelman</a>  <a href="https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/model-integrity">Model Integrity - by Joe Edelman and Oliver Klingefjord | Meaning Alignment Institute Substack</a>  <p>Bios:</p><p>Joe Edelman is a philosopher, sociologist, and entrepreneur whose work spans from theoretical philosophy to practical applications in technology and governance.

<p>Fellow Panthers,&nbsp;</p><p>November marked another milestone-filled month for Panther, with significant progress across key areas. Panther completed internal testing for Stage 9 of its testnet and made significant progress in advancing the Canary network, bringing Panther closer to providing infrastructure for real-world transactions. The team also made impactful contributions at DevCon and in the media, showcasing Panther’s innovations. Panther continues to build momentum in its mission to bring privacy and compliance to DeFi. Read on for the full recap below.</p><p>\</p> Stage 9 Internal Testing Complete, Canary Network Prep Underway <p>Panther hit a key milestone in November with the completion of internal testing for Stage 9, the final stage of <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s testnet</a>. This sets the stage for Panther Protocol Foundation’s launch of Panther’s Canary network. The Canary network, which will be run by a Swiss-based foundation, will serve as a critical proving ground, showcasing Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">privacy-enhancing</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/compliance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">compliance-driven capabilities</a>. Simultaneously, Panther contributors continued to work on refining the codebase.</p><p>We would be remiss if we did not thank our community of 3500+ testers, whose feedback has been invaluable. Stay tuned here and on our <a href="http://www.x.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">social media</a> for further details on access to the Canary network as we continue to deliver our transformative vision for DeFi.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Zone Manager documentation and interface development are progressing as the Protocol prepares to support financial service providers on its platform.&nbsp;</p> Panther Ecosystem Update <p>Panther’s thought leadership in DeFi privacy and compliance was fully displayed at <a href="http://devcon.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DevCon</a> 2024, one of the world’s premier Ethereum developer conferences in Bangkok, Thailand.</p><p>During DevCon’s Privacy ftw side event organized by <a href="http://zkmonk.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zkMonk</a> and <a href="https://www.zk-hub.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zkHUB</a>, Panther’s Technical Lead, Igor Markelov delivered his presentation, "Private Data Sharing to Enable Compliance in DeFi." Igor showcased&nbsp; Panther’s cutting-edge innovations, including:</p>  ElGamal encryption&nbsp;  <a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/a-deep-dive-into-secure-multi-party-computation-mpc/">Multi-party computation (MPC)</a>  <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/cryptographic-primitives/zero-knowledge-proofs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zero-Knowledge circuits</a>&nbsp;  <p>These technologies form the backbone of Panther’s ability to facilitate secure, compliant transactions. Igor also spoke about customizable <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/zone-manager?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zone Management</a> rules, designed to help maintain compliance in DeFi operations and offered a sneak peek at the upcoming launch of Panther’s Canary network.</p><p>Panther’s Head of Product, Saif Akhtar, participated in a panel discussion alongside representatives from o1Labs, Rarimo, and Aztec. The panel delved into the practical applications of Zero-Knowledge technology, the increasing demand for privacy solutions, and the growing trust in<a href="https://blog.pantherprotocol.io/zk-rollup-projects-inner-workings-importance-analysis/"> ZK rollups</a> as scalable, privacy-preserving tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding to the conversation, Panther’s Co-Founder Dr. Anish Mohammed highlighted how privacy-enhancing technologies like <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/learn/cryptographic-primitives/zero-knowledge-proofs?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a> empower users with greater control over their data while simultaneously addressing the critical need for compliance in DeFi.&nbsp;</p><p>At the De.Fi World event, Panther took the spotlight with a compelling presentation by Dr. Mohammed. The session focused on compliant privacy in DeFi, offering insightful comparisons of privacy approaches, the role of analytics, and key considerations for <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/ecosystem/ecosystem-operators/compliance-providers?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">AML compliance</a>.</p> Panther in the Media <p>Panther continued to gain momentum with media coverage in November, with prominent features in leading publications and insightful media appearances.</p><p><a href="https://coinpasar.sg/navigating-the-privacy-paradox-in-defi-transparency-vs-confidentiality/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Coinpasar</a> spotlighted Panther in a byline exploring how Panther leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (zkSNARKs) to address the inherent tension between blockchain transparency and user privacy. Similarly, the Metaverse Post published an article, "<a href="https://mpost.io/the-role-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-protecting-user-data-in-defi/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">The Role of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Protecting User Data in DeFi</a>", delving into the importance of confidentiality without compromising blockchain integrity.</p><p>Additionally, Panther was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/InfiniteCrypto?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Infinite Crypto Podcast</a> and <a href="https://www.web3pod.xyz/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Web3 Podcast</a>, with Sam Kamani about privacy technologies, compliance solutions, and the transformative role of Zero-Knowledge technology in DeFi.

With growing recognition from media and thought leaders, Panther is at the forefront of shaping the future of confidential decentralized finance. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held at the end of December.</p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Friday 13th December 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning”. Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>After the deadline for nominations closes, Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community.</p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2025.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2025.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> and <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Committee members currently receive a stipend of $1,725 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).</p>



<p>With the adoption of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>, the Zcash Community Grants Program is in the process of transitioning from ZF to the Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF). </p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>The Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF) is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority. <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/_files/ugd/9ba471_3469edaa00944ed0bf46deb77e5c56eb.pdf">FPF’s conflict of interest policy can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with FPF (to ensure that their status and relationship with FPF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify FPF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the FPF board. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with FPF (to ensure that their status and relationship with FPF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify FPF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>Just as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deco">DECO</a>, DiStefano is named after the football player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Di_St%C3%A9fano">DiStefano</a>, who, while being Argentinian, worked for Spain most of his professional life. It is related to the fact of using something from one place in another place (TLS data to externally attest) (Image partially AI generated).</p>
<p>The Transport Layer Protocol (TLS) is one of the most widespread protocols that secure data in transport over the Internet. Thanks to its widespread deployment, users are assured that their data in transport remains secure and private as the protocol (especially, in its 1.3 version) provides encrypted and authenticated channels between clients and servers on the Internet. Such channels commonly transmit trusted information about users behind clients such as</p>
<p>proofs of age, social security statuses, bank account information and accepted purchase information. While various applications would benefit from learning such data points, doing so raises significant privacy concerns. Exporting such information as private, anonymous credentials is challenging because it is transmitted over an encrypted and authenticated channel. Meanwhile, both legislation (such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">GDPR</a>) and standards bodies (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/">W3C</a>) have made usage of privacy-preserving data credentials a priority. Therefore, it is critical to develop methods that enable users to selectively and consensually export portions of their data. This would allow them to prove specific statements or authenticate that the data originates from a trusted source, such as a particular website, without compromising privacy.</p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, consider that Alice wants to prove to a service that they are over 18 (a website, for example, can request such a proof). Currently, most age verification services require users to upload identification documents containing extensive personal information, raising significant privacy concerns. If Alice chooses not to share their ID, they may be denied access to the service, even though they meet the age requirement. Meanwhile, many websites, such as company payroll systems or DMV portals, already store and serve verified birth dates. Alice could, in theory, share a screenshot of her birth date from one of these sites, but this approach has two major flaws: screenshots are easily forged, and even if their authenticity could somehow be guaranteed, they would reveal unnecessary information, such as Alice’s exact birth date, instead of simply proving that they are over 18. This situation highlights the need for a mechanism that achieves two goals: proving the authenticity of the data (ensuring it is not forged) and proving a specific statement about the data (e.g., that Alice is over 18) without disclosing additional details. Such a solution would enable both proofs of provenance and proofs of statements, which will allow users to access services without compromising their privacy and ensuring trust. These types of proofs can be useful, for example, in anti-fraud checks (and we will talk about this at the end of the post).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore a solution to this problem by leveraging TLS to create both proofs of provenance and proofs of statements. This approach enables users to consensually generate zero-knowledge proofs of their data, allowing them to securely access additional services while preserving their privacy.</p>

 DCTLS protocols 
<p>Designated-Commitment TLS (DCTLS) protocols, also known as three-party handshake (3PH) protocols or ZKTLS, enable modified TLS handshakes that allow specific statements about the data exchanged in a TLS channel to be securely exported to a designated verifier (a trusted party). These protocols secret-share private session data between a client and verifier, and compute the <a href="https://tls13.xargs.org/">handshake and record-layer phases of TLS</a> phases of TLS using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_two-party_computation">two-party computation (2PC)</a>, a type of MPC that allows two parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their respective inputs private. Notable examples of DCTLS protocols include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00938">DECO</a>, <a href="https://old.tlsnotary.org/pagesigner">TLSNotary/PageSigner</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978326">TownCrier</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/964">Garble-then-Prove</a>, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1377">Janus</a> (similar techniques are also used to produce <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/grubbs">zero-knowledge middleboxes</a> for proving that client traffic adheres to corporate browsing policies, for example, and for devising multi-party TLS clients/servers).</p>
<p>Despite their claims of practicality, these protocols face significant barriers to wide-scale adoption.</p>
 
 
<p>Lack of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc8446.txt.pdf">TLS 1.3</a> Support: None of the protocols listed explicitly provide secure support for TLS 1.3, even though it became the dominant version of TLS as of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450057">December 2020</a>. According to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#tls-1-2-vs-tls-1-3-vs-quic">Cloudflare Radar</a>, TLS 1.3 now accounts for 63% of secure network traffic, compared to only 8.7% for TLS 1.2. Support for TLS 1.3 is therefore crucial. Even when TLS 1.3 is supported, existing protocols often lack rigorous security analyses or fail to address efficiency concerns associated with implementing TLS 1.3 ciphersuites and protocol steps in maliciously-secure 2PC.</p>
 
 
<p>Security Limitations: Current security arguments lack flexibility, as they are tied to specific, static protocols, ciphersuites, and 2PC primitives. This rigidity poses risks; for instance, primitives used by DECO have already been shown to <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1621">be</a>  <a href="https://info.fireblocks.com/hubfs/A_Note_on_the_Security_of_GG.pdf">insecure</a>. Moreover, client privacy is frequently overlooked, with protocols exposing the server a client communicates with to the verifier: potentially revealing sensitive browsing history.</p>
 
 
<p>Deployability Challenges: No fully-featured, open-source implementation of a DCTLS protocol exists that combines strong security guarantees with interoperability for common Internet browsing tools. This absence hinders practical adoption and widespread deployment.</p>
 
 
<p>In order to solve all these problems, we introduce DiStefano. But, prior to explaining our protocol, let’s see how DCTLS protocols work.</p>

 DCTLS in detail 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>DCTLS protocols allow a Client to generate commitments to TLS session data communicated with a Server that can be sent to a designated third-party Verifier. They consist of the following phases: 1. A (Verifier-assisted) handshake phase, 2. a (Verfier-assisted) query execution phase, and 3. a commitment phase. Over TLS 1.3 (given an informal description of TLS 1.3 with 1-RTT and with certificate-based authentication), these phases look like this:</p>
<p>Handshake phase. In this phase (as seen below), the Server learns the same secret session parameters as in standard TLS 1.3, while the Client and the Verifier learn shares of the session parameters that only the Client would normally learn: they engage in the core TLS 1.3 protocol using a series of 2PC functionalities, hence, they secret-share session data and arrive to session secret keys that are secret-shared.&nbsp;</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Record Layer-Query Execution phase. At the record layer, encrypted traffic is exchanged between the Client and the Server (as seen below). The Client sends an encrypted query (e.g., an HTTPS request) to the Server with assistance from the Verifier. Since the session secret keys are secret-shared, the Client and Verifier collaboratively compute the encryption of these queries using two-party computation (2PC). Similarly, encrypted responses from the Server (e.g., an HTTPS response) can be decrypted using the same joint procedure. Note that these responses must first be committed to, as discussed in the next phase.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Record Layer-Commitment phase. After the encrypted queries are sent and encrypted responses are received, the Client commits to the session by forwarding the ciphertexts (e.g., the encrypted responses) to the Verifier (as seen in box 3 of Figure 1). In exchange, the Verifier provides the Client with its shares of the session secret keys. This allows the Client to verify the integrity of the Server’s response and, later, prove statements derived from it to the Verifier. For example, using the committed encrypted response now held by the Verifier, the Client can prove in zero-knowledge that a specific statement is true (e.g., that an HTTPS response contains a field representing age, and that the age is greater than 18).</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>As we can see, DCTLS protocols are straightforward: they allow a trusted third party (the Verifier) to participate in the handshake (by performing operations in 2PC), enabling the Verifier to commit to encrypted data. This data can later be used to create zero-knowledge proofs. We require this commitment for zero-knowledge proofs: the data that one intends to prove a statement about must be committed to, ensuring its immutability. However, the Verifier never learns the plaintext data unless the Client chooses to reveal it. The Verifier only holds shares of the full session secret keys, and the encrypted data cannot be decrypted unless the full session secret keys are known.</p>

 DiStefano: Decentralized Infrastructure for Sharing Trusted Encrypted Facts and Nothing More 
<p>While all DCTLS follow a similar approach, with our protocol, DiStefano, we improve upon it by:</p>
 
 
<p>Making it all work with TLS 1.3 as described in the previous section and in detail in our paper.</p>
 
 
<p>Providing a full security model: we provide a modular, standalone security framework that guarantees security in the presence of malicious adversaries.</p>
 
 
<p>Improving privacy guarantees:&nbsp; In the handshake phase, when the Server sends its certificate messages to the Client, relaying those messages to the Verifier for verification would disclose the Client’s browsing history over time. This is because the Server’s certificate contains its identity, which could potentially reveal the Client’s activity. In DiStefano, we aim to prevent this. Instead, we use zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of valid signatures (ZKPVS) for signatures generated during TLS exchanges. In this scheme, one holds a valid signature issued by your keypair, while a verifier holds a set of valid public keys, one of which corresponds to your keypair. The goal is to demonstrate that the signature is valid with respect to this set without disclosing your specific public key. This ensures that the prover’s identity remains private, preserving the Client’s privacy. For this purpose, our <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1595">CDLS</a> scheme can be used with EC-DSA signatures.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
 
 Making AES-GCM be a commitment scheme: To commit to the encrypted data, one could use traditional commitment schemes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">Pedersen Commitments</a>. However, we opted to leverage the existing functionality provided by the TLS 1.3 protocol. This involves adapting AES-GCM (the algorithm supported by TLS 1.3 to encrypt data),&nbsp; to act as a commitment scheme. Since AES-GCM, when used in an AEAD setting, functions as a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/664">non-committing cipher</a>, we introduced modifications to make it committing. Specifically, this was achieved by verifying the tag in relation to the ciphertext. For a comprehensive explanation of our approach, please refer to our paper. 
 
<p>As such, DiStefano is a DCTLS protocol that operates securely within TLS 1.3, offering formal security guarantees and ensuring client privacy. It is also highly efficient, as demonstrated through WAN experiments evaluating its performance in practical scenarios. The results indicate that runtime increases are proportional to the latency introduced, with slight deviations due to circuit preprocessing and GCM share derivation. Circuit preprocessing adds to the runtime but is an offline, amortizable cost. The derivation of GCM shares, reflecting the multi-round trip nature of the protocol, consistently takes less than a second. Even with these factors, the total online costs remain significantly lower than typical TLS handshake timeouts, which are usually configurable between 10 and 20 seconds. Additionally, the impact of increasing latency appears sublinear, suggesting that DiStefano maintains high efficiency and practicality across a variety of browsing scenarios.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>So, what else can be done? Well, DiStefano is a pretty complete protocol that gives you commitments to TLS 1.3 encrypted data, but it does not yet give you the zero-knowledge proofs over that data. Let’s explore that now.</p>

 Zero-knowledge proofs 
<p>The data transmitted over TLS can take various forms, depending on the application. Common formats include HTML for web pages and JSON for APIs, but other formats like XML, binary data, or proprietary protocols can also be transmitted securely over TLS. This means that the data we aim to prove statements about is often structured in these formats. For example, let’s examine a JSON blob containing an age field:</p>
 <code>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "DiStefano Protocol",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"version": "1.0",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"description": "A DCTLS protocol over TLS 1.3.",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"age": 2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;"features": {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"security": "Proven fully secure",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"privacy": "Maintains client privacy",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"efficiency": "Highly efficient"
&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;"performance": {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"runtimeImpact": "Proportional to latency",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"gcmShareDerivationTime": "Less than a second",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"totalOnlineCost": "Below typical TLS handshake timeout"
&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;"latencyImpact": "Sublinear"
}
</code> <p>If this data is transmitted over TLS 1.3 as a Server’s response to a Client’s request, DiStefano can be used to commit to the encrypted data. Once committed, if we want to prove that the field “age” has a value greater than 1 (a proof of a statement), we need to demonstrate the following:</p>
 
 
<p>The data conforms to the JSON context-free grammar: JSON is defined by a formal context-free grammar specifying rules for objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and other components. For example, an object must consist of key-value pairs enclosed in braces {} and separated by commas. Verifying adherence to this grammar ensures the data is valid JSON.</p>
 
 
<p>The field “age” exists at the top level: In the JSON grammar, keys must be strings, and the presence of the “age” key as a direct child of the root object needs to be validated to ensure it is not nested within another object or array.</p>
 
 
<p>The value associated with “age” matches the grammar rule for integers: JSON defines numeric values, including integers and floats. We need to prove that the value of “age” satisfies the grammar rule for integers.</p>
 
 
<p>The value of “age” satisfies a semantic constraint: While grammars handle structural validity, proving that the value of “age” is greater than 1 requires an additional semantic check beyond the grammar rules.</p>
 
 
<p>We are actively working on research to address these challenges. For point 1, for example, we build on the outstanding <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1886.pdf">Reef</a> protocol, extending it to handle context-free grammars. This enables proving that committed JSON data either matches or does not match a given regular expression. For points 3 and 4, we are designing custom zero-knowledge proof systems that allow generating proofs over AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, the two primary ciphersuites supported by TLS 1.3. Expect blog posts and papers on this soon!</p>

 Why is this useful? 
<p>Earlier in this blog post, we discussed how leveraging TLS 1.3 encrypted data to create proofs of provenance and proofs of statements can be valuable for allowing users to access additional services. However, this is just one example of its potential.</p>
<p>These types of proofs can also be useful in anti-fraud checks. For instance, a user could prove in zero-knowledge that they have an account with one of several authorized banks (without revealing which bank it is). This kind of proof could serve as a signal that the user is not a bot, enabling them to access services while preserving their privacy and preventing them from being falsely flagged as a bot. One can also use these proofs to verify “real” events by producing statements that confirm the origin and trustworthiness of data, helping to demonstrate that it was not generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, it is important to note that DCTLS protocols could become actively harmful tools for monitoring or censoring client traffic in certain applications, especially in automated systems without human involvement. We would like to emphasize that deployment of tools such as DiStefano must be considered carefully in such contexts.</p>

 Interested in trying our protocol? 
<p>If you are interested in trying our protocol, we implemented <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/distefano">a full prototype</a> of DiStefano in C++. It is built directly over BoringSSL, so it can be integrated easily over Chromium-based browsers. In fact, one of our future works is integrating this implementation directly on the Brave browser so we could leverage this protocol to detect fraud behaviour (detect bots, for example) and attest humanity without degrading usability.</p>
<p>If you are further interested in reading our research, you can read <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1063">our paper</a>. Or you can find us at the <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/">NDSS2025</a> Symposium, where the paper will be presented.</p>

<p>Today we are proud to unveil <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">SILK staking</a> — an opportunity to earn meaningful yield in the form of&nbsp;SILK.</p><blockquote>Combining inflation &amp; volatility resistance with a safe yield opportunity, SILK is leveling up as the world’s most powerful stablecoin.</blockquote><p>SILK has outperformed USD by nearly 19% since April 2023. Combining this outperformance with 10%+ staking yield at launch, SILK empowers stablecoins to enter into a new era where the yield earned is meaningful.</p><blockquote>No longer are you stuck in the trap of needing to have your DeFi yields have to outpace inflation.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap">Buy SILK</a></blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">Stake SILK</a></blockquote><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake</a><p>Recently, we revealed our plans for <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-goes-omnichain-expanding-access-to-silk-and-secure-defi-8ad38f5dfaa9">Shade and SILK to go omnichain</a>. SILK staking is part of the first step of giving SILK a yield bearing homebase for its omnichain journey.</p><p>In addition to SILK staking, Shade Protocol will be aiming to soon launch dSILK — a liquid yield bearing version of SILK. This version of SILK will be the bedrock of the SILK economy, combining inflation resistance an earnings product all into one liquid token that be used to send / spend / trade / lend / and&nbsp;more.</p><p>In summary, dSILK and SILK staking takes SILK to the next level — unlocking the next stage of liquidity growth and adoption.</p> Staking Rewards <p>Initial SILK staking campaigns will start conservative, with plans for a larger and more aggressive roll out as we approach the launch of ShadeX — the official Shade Protocol encrypted money market. SILK staking features instant unbonding, ensuring seamless entry and exit from the savings opportunity. The initial campaign for SILK staking will go for 30 days, with additional reward campaigns to be started in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>SILK staking rewards come from interest fees charged on SILK borrowers. SILK staking serves as a growth mechanism that positively generates more of the following:</p><p>- More SILK supply<br>- More interest fees<br>- More liquidations<br>- More trading fees<br>- Higher SILK Earn yield <br>- More SILK&nbsp;buyers</p><p>You can learn more about the game theory of growing a stablecoin by listening to the video&nbsp;above.</p> Conclusion <p>In conclusion, the unveiling of SILK staking and the upcoming launch of ShadeX and dSILK mark significant milestones in Shade Protocol’s journey towards revolutionizing decentralized finance. Our push to become the most secure omnichain private DeFi is stronger than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Our focus on privacy, ease of use, and continuous improvement through continued iterative upgrades, Shade Protocol is not only shaping the future of DeFi but also empowering individuals to reclaim control over their finances and data. As the community eagerly anticipates the release of ShadeX and our omnichain expansion, Shade Protocol remains dedicated to its mission of building an unstoppable, decentralized financial ecosystem for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Website: <a href="http://app.shadeprotocol.io/">app.shadeprotocol.io</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol">https://twitter.com/Shade_Protocol</a></p>

<p>Bitcoin’s Taproot update paved the way for a new &amp; exciting era for Bitcoin, as it expanded its use case far beyond that of an immutable ledger. However, Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and, more recently, Runes, have limited functionality compared to what DeFi is capable of, on other smart contract blockchains. BitcoinOS envisions a revolutionary Bitcoin economy that stems from truly programmable tokens, unlocking staking, governance and many other use cases. Using BitSNARK and Grail, BitcoinOS enables Bitcoin “rollups”, which act as execution environments that use BTC as gas fee and inherit security from the L1. The missing link was always a trustless bridge between Bitcoin L1 and any potential L2. And Grail Bridge achieved just that - using zero knowledge cryptography, BTC could be transferred to other chains without relying on other custodians’ trust assumptions. In that sense, Bitcoin block #853626 is historically meaningful as it contains the first-ever onchain verification of a zero knowledge proof, on Bitcoin. A truly programmable smart contract operating system on Bitcoin was no longer a mere concept…it became a reality through BitcoinOS.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Yago's background  The effect of Trump’s election on the crypto industry  The goal behind BitcoinOS  The history of Bitcoin’s programmability  Verifying ZK proofs on Bitcoin  Taproot  Ordinals  BitSNARK, Grail bridge and Merkle Mesh  BitcoinOS modularity and sequencing  An impending (r)evolution of the industry  Bitcoin vs. Ethereum L2 landscape  Bringing Bitcoin liquidity to Cardano  BitcoinOS roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a>Edan Yago on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/BTC_OS">Bitcoin OS on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

 NymVPN stable release &amp; NYM buyback before&nbsp;launch <p>Dear friends and fellow freedom fighters,</p><p>We’re in the final push to the launch of NymVPN to the world in January 2025! But now’s no time for publicity, just hard facts and tasks. Getting to launch means hitting crucial milestones, and testers and stakers play a big part in the&nbsp;success.</p><p>November marked the first milestone with the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-v2024-11-is-here-6186d49e3c8d">stable release of NymVPN</a>. This update improves network security and stability for users, but also lays the foundation for user payments being unlinkable to their use of the&nbsp;app.</p><p>The Nym network has had a major upgrade with the Magura release resulting in measurable improvements to reliability. The release begins the process of culling outdated nodes and ensuring equitable rewarding.</p><p>In preparation for launch, staking on nodes is crucial for the health of the network. So if you’re wondering which nodes you should stake, here’s a <a href="https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">list of top performing Nym nodes</a> who are currently in the official Nym Delegations Program. Staking NYM on them will go a long way to improving network performance while also ensuring a good&nbsp;APY.</p><p>To bootstrap the Nym treasury and improve network performance ahead of launch, Nym is conducting a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">token buyback</a> of $1 million USD in NYM. As payments for NymVPN begin to roll in, there will be a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5">perpetual NYM buyback</a> organically linked to the demand for and usage of the app. The goal of Nym tokenomics is two-fold: the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-v2024-11-is-here-6186d49e3c8d">value of NYM</a> will be linked to paid usage of the app, and the increase of users will improve the privacy of&nbsp;all.</p><p>The next major NymVPN release is scheduled for December to introduce zk-nym credentials and beta payments. With this coming release, the full infrastructure of NymVPN will be in place before being rigorously tested for launch over the holidays. Want to help the team prepare for it? Test, stake, mix packets, and take your seat onboard with&nbsp;us.</p><p>2025 is the year of an internet free of surveillance for&nbsp;all.</p><p>Nym Core</p> In the&nbsp;media <p>CNBC: “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/11/13/chelsea-manning-censorship-still-a-dominant-threat.html">Chelsea Manning: Censorship still a dominant threat</a>” (live interview)</p><p>PCMag: “<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/vpn/155163/chelsea-manning-vpns-and-tor-arent-enough-for-digital-privacy">Worried about digital privacy?

Great products, afterall, are built in phases. NymVPN 2024.11 includes:</p>  Improved user experience: A streamlined sign-up / sign-in flow allows your single anonymous access code to be used to connect up to 10&nbsp;devices.  Anonymous access: The revamped login system prepares the way for zk-nyms which will allow you to pay for NymVPN without ever being linked to your use of the&nbsp;app.  Security updates and bug fixes: General improvements make for better app performance and security following an external security&nbsp;audit.  Improved connectivity: A new state machine significantly enhances the stability of network connections.  <p>This app version is currently compatible with <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/macos">MacOS</a>, <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/linux">Linux</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">iOS</a>. Versions for Android and Windows will soon follow, so stay in touch on socials for announcements!</p><p>Remember, NymVPN Beta is still free for everyone to test until launch in January 2025, so <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">get your anonymous access code&nbsp;today</a>!</p> NymVPN marketing <p>The Nym marketing team is gearing up for the January launch campaign. Discussions with privacy-focused tech companies and blockchains are in the works, and an affiliate marketing campaign to get NymVPN before the eyes of over 10 millions of eyes worldwide in January is well underway. Expect a big marketing push as the New Year arrives when the app is ready for the general&nbsp;public.</p> Nym rebrand <p>The Nym rebrand is in its final stages, and there are big things on the stove for the New Year! At the beginning of January, you can look forward to some treats: a new visual identity for Nym, a freshly stylized experience of the NymVPN app, and a unified nym.com domain! Look out for Nym’s New Year’s Resolutions for a sneak&nbsp;peak!</p> The Nym&nbsp;network  Magura network&nbsp;update <p>November’s Magura network release improves the reliability of the Nym network and updates Nym tokenomics. And the results are noticeable already with measurable improvements on reliability.</p><p>The Magura release includes the roll-out of “naive rewarding” as an interim step in the token economics powering the network before it goes to fully paid access. And it includes the completion of project smoosh, combining gateway and mixnode functionality into a single Nym node&nbsp;binary.</p> Staking <p>The Magura update has also begun the process of culling non-performing and outdated nodes. As a staker, you should now check your nodes to make sure they are still eligible for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>When in doubt, stake on Nym nodes that are in the official Delegations Program (DP) because they are required to meet the latest requirements! You can find the DP program wallet and list of top quality nodes&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">here</a>.</p> Explorer <p>In the wake of Magura, Nym explorers are getting a major revamp. The official Nym network explorer remains <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">here</a>. The explorer currently shows both upgraded Nym nodes as well as legacy gateways and mixnodes to enable a smooth transition to the revamped&nbsp;network.</p><p>Operators and stakers can look forward to an Explorer V2 launching very soon with additional staking and operator features!</p> Important changes for operators <p>Magura includes five main changes that operators need to be aware&nbsp;of:</p>  NYM reward pool is now distributed across 5 layers of nodes to include entry and exit gateways as well as three layers of mix&nbsp;nodes.  Nym nodes are now multi-functional. Operators now simply run a Nym node and then enable gateway and mix node&nbsp;modes.  Project smoosh is complete. This means that operators simply run Nym nodes and the mixnet contract now only “sees” Nym nodes. Operators will have to run up to date software to be included in the active set and gateways will have to get stake for the first time in order to be selected to the active&nbsp;set.  Node selection algorithm now includes a configuration score to determine if a node is included in the active set: Selection = config score * total stake * performance ^ 20. This is to cull any outdated nodes from the set and make sure the network is running up to date software.  Operators now must agree to operator <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> to confirm legally that you do not gather logs on&nbsp;users.

<p>Ever felt like the internet is spying on you? You searched for a pair of shoes, and suddenly every ad was for a sneaker. That’s targeted advertising, but that’s not what this post is entirely&nbsp;about.</p><p>In early November, the South Korean Personal Information Protection Commission levied a $15 million fine on Meta for illicitly collecting and sharing sensitive user data. The four-year investigation revealed that the tech giant had gathered personal information, including political views, sexual orientation, and religious beliefs, from approximately 980,000 Facebook users without explicit consent. This data was subsequently shared with over 4,000 advertisers.</p><p>While the Meta scandal highlights the pervasive nature of digital surveillance, it’s important to recognize that financial privacy is also under threat. Traditional banking systems, though seemingly private, are subject to extensive regulatory oversight. Every transaction, no matter how small, is recorded and can be accessed by <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/government-surveillance-drives-encrypted-messaging-app-dev-out-of-australia-7c94a5d56c32">government agencies</a>. This level of surveillance raises questions about the extent to which financial privacy can truly be protected in the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</p> The Data&nbsp;Economy <p>The digital economy thrives on data. User data is the lifeblood of many tech companies, enabling them to personalize ads, recommend products, and refine their services. However, this data-driven approach raises serious privacy implications. When personal information is collected and analyzed without explicit consent, it can lead to targeted advertising, identity theft, and even social manipulation.</p><p>In the financial space, cyberattacks and data breaches are on the rise, exposing sensitive financial information to malicious actors. To put things in perspective, a staggering 75% of financial services organizations have fallen victim to at least one data breach in the past five years. It is also an open secret that governments may use data collected by financial institutions to monitor citizens’ economic activities.</p> Cryptocurrency: A Double-Edged Sword <p>Cryptocurrencies, often touted as a bastion of financial privacy, are not immune to surveillance. While legacy blockchain technology offers a transparent and immutable ledger, it also exposes transaction data to public scrutiny. Although pseudonymous, blockchain analysis tools can be used to track the flow of funds and identify individuals behind certain transactions.</p><p>This is where privacy coins like PIVX and others shine. PIVX, in particular, stands out as a leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency, offering a comprehensive suite of privacy features such as zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>In an era where personal information is constantly being collected and analyzed, these cryptocurrencies offer a much-needed solution for individuals seeking to maintain control over their online presence.</p><p>PIVX.

 Stable release prepares the way to full&nbsp;launch <p>The latest stable version of NymVPN v2024.11 is now released for MacOS, Linux, and iOS, with Android to be available early next&nbsp;week.</p><p>This app release follows last week’s major Magura network update and improves app performance, security, and connectivity. This is a big technical boost ahead of the launch of zk-nyms &amp; beta payments in December 2024 and the full commercial launch of NymVPN in January&nbsp;2025.</p><p>NymVPN v2024.11 includes a streamlined log in flow and major network security&nbsp;fixes.</p> Compatibility <p>NymVPN v2024.11 is currently released&nbsp;for:</p>  MacOS  Linux  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">iOS</a> (currently not yet available in Apple Store France, but can be <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/0vmRJNrL">downloaded here</a>)  <p>The Android release will follow early next week once bugs are properly addressed.</p> Magura network&nbsp;release <p>The Nym network underwent a significant upgrade last week to prepare for NymVPN v2024.11. This includes some breaking changes for operators. But most important for NymVPN users is that now all Nym nodes are configured to function as both mix nodes and gateways for clients and to receive equal rewards. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Read more</a> on what this means for the Nym tokenomics powering the privacy network at the foundation of&nbsp;NymVPN.</p> Account sign-up / sign-in&nbsp;flow <p>There is now a new, streamlined system for signing up for NymVPN and logging into the app from multiple&nbsp;devices.</p>  Create account on the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">nymvpn.com</a> with a recovery phrase, and make sure to securely save&nbsp;it!  Use your recovery phrase to log into NymVPN on MacOS, Linux, mobile Android (coming next week), or iOS. Windows will be coming next&nbsp;month  You can then add (up to 10) additional devices by logging in with the same recovery&nbsp;phrase  <p>* Note that fair usage is now enforced from the centralized API based on the anonymous credential. Users can view their account plan fair usage&nbsp;summary.</p> Fixes following security&nbsp;audit <p>Since the July security audit conducted by Cure 53, the Nym team has been working on addressing all the identified bugs and network leaks identified in the report. This release addresses issues related to the authentication with gateways (STS) and session key generation. The Nym SDK has been upgraded to fix these issues in the NymVPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>Stay tuned for a full report on these fixes in the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/trust-center">Nym Trust&nbsp;Center</a>.</p> State Machine <p>A state machine is an important VPN component for maintaining reliable network connections. State machines have now been integrated into WireGuard, daemon, VPNlib, and account controller. This will lead to a more seamless user experience in switching between NymVPN modes and connecting with gateways.</p> Next stop: zk-nyms, beta payments, and plugging all&nbsp;leaks <p>The next release of NymVPN is scheduled for 10–15 December 2024 and will introduce beta payments with zk-nyms for fully unlinkable traffic through NymVPN, as well as major leak&nbsp;fixes.</p> zk-nyms issuance and&nbsp;sending <p>Zk-nyms are the foundation of anonymous access with NymVPN: they ensure that you can pay for access to the Nym network with full anonymity, even from Nym&nbsp;itself!</p><p>When you pay for a traditional, centralized VPN service, your usage of the app, and even your traffic records if they are kept, can be directly linked to your identity through your payment&nbsp;records.</p><p>Nym’s novel solution is a zero-knowledge access credential, whose issuance system is currently being piloted into the NymVPN app. Keep in mind that the real value of zk-nyms comes with unlinking your payment records for your usage of the networks. This means that when NymVPN payments go live next month, users can rest assured that their personal information won’t be compromised.</p> DNS and IPv6&nbsp;leaks <p>Currently, all leaks while connected with NymVPN are fixed. The Nym dev team is continuing its work in plugging all leaks that occur prior to connecting with the NymVPN app. Nym remains committed to not releasing a full commercial version of the app until all these risks are fully addressed.</p><p>Remember, the success of NymVPN depends a lot on our dedicated community of testers.

If you’re excited about the next generation of the internet, check out the show: <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/hrr_h-XC">https://link.chtbl.com/hrr_h-XC</a></p><p>We've heard a lot about the premise and the promise of prediction markets for a long time, but they finally hit the main stage with the most recent election. So what worked (and didn't) this time? Are they really better than pollsters, is polling dead?&nbsp;</p><p>So in this conversation, we tease apart the hype from the reality of prediction markets, from the recent election to market foundations... going more deeply into the how, why, and where these markets work. We also discuss the design challenges and opportunities (including implications for builders throughout). And we also cover other information aggregation mechanisms -- from peer prediction to others -- given that prediction markets are part of a broader category of information-elicitation and information-aggregation mechanisms.&nbsp;<br><br>Where do domain experts, superforecasters, pollsters, and journalists come in (and out)? Where do (and don't) blockchain and crypto technologies come in -- and what specific features (decentralization, transparency, real-time, open source, etc.) matter most, and in what contexts?&nbsp; Finally, we discuss applications for prediction and decision markets -- things we could do right away to in the near-future to sci-fi -- touching on trends like futarchy, AI entering the market, DeSci, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our special expert guests are Alex Taborrok, professor of economics at George Mason University and Chair in Economics at the Mercatus Center; and Scott Duke Kominers, research partner at a16z crypto, and professor at Harvard Business School&nbsp; -- both in conversation with Sonal Chokshi.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder: None of the following should be taken as business, investment, legal, or tax advice; please see a16z.com/disclosures for more important information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:<br>(from links to research mentioned to more on the topics discussed)</p>  <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">The Use of Knowledge in Society</a> by Friedrich Hayek (American Economic Review, 1945)  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eberem/everything_is_priced_in/">Everything is priced in</a> by rsd99 (r/wallstreetbets, 2019)  <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/ideafutures.html">Idea Futures (aka prediction markets, information markets)</a> by Robin Hanson (1996)  <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/auctions/paper">Auctions: The Social Construction of Value</a>&nbsp; by Charles Smith  <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/2002%20AER%20Morris%20and%20Shin.pdf">Social value of public information</a> by Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (American Economic Review, December 2002)  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1516179112">Using prediction markets to estimate the reproducibility of scientific research</a> by Anna Dreber, Thomas Pfeiffer, Johan Almenberg, Siri Isaksson, Brad Wilson, Yiling Chen, Brian Nosek, and Magnus Johannesson (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (November 2015)  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21054">A solution to the single-question crowd wisdom problem</a> by Dražen Prelec, Sebastian Seung, and John McCoy (Nature, January 2017)  <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/Targeting_Entrepreneurs_AER2022_64933cef-316a-437f-8ca4-885d870b2ba1.pdf">Targeting high ability entrepreneurs using community information: Mechanism design in the field</a> by Reshmaan Hussam, Natalia Rigol, and Benjamin Roth (American Economic Review, March 2022)  <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/ms020408.pdf">Information aggregation mechanisms: concept, design, and implementation for a sales forecasting problem</a> by Charles Plott and Kay-Yut Chen, Hewlett Packard Laboratories (March 2002)  <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/if-i-had-a-millhtml">If I had a million</a> [on deciding to dump the CEO or not] by Robin Hanson (2008)  <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">Futarchy: Vote values, but bet beliefs</a> by Robin Hanson (2013)  <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html">From prediction markets to info finance</a> by Vitalik Buterin (November 2024)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/">Composability is innovation</a> by Linda Xie (June 2021)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/composability-is-to-software-as-compounding-interest-is-to-finance/">Composability is to software as compounding interest is to finance</a> by Chris Dixon (October 2021)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/daos/">resources &amp; research on DAOs</a>, a16z crypto  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text

  Centered on on-chain growth, BAT Roadmap 3.0 introduces disintermediation, expanded blockchain integrations, and a creator growth program to elevate BAT utility across Web3 and beyond.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The focus for BAT Roadmap 3.0 is on-chain growth. Within the Brave Rewards and Brave Creators ecosystems, this means disintermediating the way BAT flows through the platform, expanding self-custody options for payments and contributions, and providing users with new avenues to earn and utilize BAT. Beyond Brave, our focus will be to promote BAT growth and adoption in the broader attention economy, across all blockchains that can support BAT. This means providing even more opportunities for projects, dApps, and creators to integrate BAT utility and grow with the Brave and BAT userbase.</p>
<p>Useful <a>roadmaps</a> provide general direction, while also being flexible enough to anticipate unforeseen challenges. As we iterate and find market fit, it is expected that some roadmap items may become less of a focus over time, while others are emphasized.</p>

 BAT in Brave Rewards 
<p>In line with BAT Roadmap 3.0, we aim to release Brave Rewards 3.0 in the first quarter of 2025, an upgraded Brave Rewards experience.</p>
<p>With Brave Rewards 3.0, we aim to include:</p>

 New ways to earn rewards 
 
 Draws where users can receive larger BAT amounts, earnings multipliers, and other bonuses 
 Rewards for completing on-chain quests 
 Rewards for completing surveys 
 

 New self-custody options 
<p>Expand self-custody payout options to support a wider range of blockchains and Layer 2 networks.</p>

 Redesign and UX overhaul&nbsp; 
<p>Rewards 3.0 will include a totally refreshed design and user experience. This new design implements a modular framework, making it easier to:</p>
 
 Showcase BAT utility cases (dApps, shopping, etc.) 
 Compose new Brave Ads experiences and earning opportunities 
 Integrate Pay with BAT where appropriate within Rewards UX 
 Improve Brave Creators discovery and better connect users with creators 
 

 Rewards Offer Wall 
 
 Introduce a new Rewards Offer Wall with exclusive benefits for Brave Rewards users. The Offer Wall will include a combination of both dynamic, locally-matched offers, and persistent partner deals.&nbsp; 
 Integrate the Brave Ads system to work in tandem with the Offer Wall. For example, use Brave Ads’s local machine learning algorithms to show notifications whenever an offer on the Offer Wall is particularly relevant to a user, is unlocked, or in response to a series of actions the user takes. 
 

 Disintermediation 
 
 Continue to develop and publish work on <a>Boomerang</a>, our decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable incentive protocol 
 Find and work with blockchains and smart contract platforms that can support the implementation of Boomerang’s smart contracts&nbsp; 
 

 BAT in E-commerce 
 
 Pay with BAT for Brave Products like <a>Brave Premium</a> (Brave VPN, Talk, Leo, etc.) 
 Pay with BAT for <a href="https://store.brave.com">Brave Merch Store</a> items 
 Add support for BAT on major crypto payment rails 
 

 BAT in Brave Creators 

 Expand supported platforms 
 
 Significantly increase the number of social platforms available for creators to register their accounts/channels with Brave Creators, including Rumble, Odyssey, and more. This allows creators to collect BAT and other on-chain crypto contributions across a wider range of platforms. 
 Partner with Web3 creator platforms to integrate BAT support, along with other utility incentives. 
 

 Expand blockchain and Layer 2 support for contributions 
 
 Enable creators to link on-chain addresses from more blockchains and Layer 2 networks to their sites and channels, particularly those that support BAT. 
 Add support for Web3 domain names. 
 

 On-chain subscriptions 
<p>Allow users to set up scheduled, on-chain subscriptions to Brave creators.</p>

 Creator Growth Program 
<p>The Creator Growth Program aims to use Brave Ads to grow a creator audience and revenue through collaborations with the Brave &amp; BAT community. It will provide creators with special access to Brave partners, including leading edge AI and Web3 services and tools.</p>

 BAT in AI 
<p>Research and develop BAT utility cases in AI. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_%28machine_learning%29">Attention</a> is both a term of machine learning art and a real human factor in generative AI, so we will experiment with possible roles for BAT in <a>Brave Leo</a>, beyond inclusion in the imminent pay-with-crypto premium option.</p>

 BAT Community 

 BAT Ambassadors Program 
 
 Launch Brave Ads Self-Serve referral program exclusive to BAT Ambassadors. 
 Promote multichain BAT adoption with Ambassador-led workshops.&nbsp; 
 Drive BAT adoption in new regions through content localization and culturally relevant initiatives led by local Ambassadors. 
 

 Partnerships 
 
 Collaborate with Web3 brands and platforms to amplify community-driven content and BAT utility. 
 Partner with creators &amp; KOLs for BAT-themed activations. 
 Host exclusive events with existing Web3 partners for BAT holders. 
 

 Programs 
 
 BAT x Adam Ape NFT program: explore bearer utility program for NFT holders. Potential examples include exclusive access, discounts on Brave Premium products and BAT/Brave merch,&nbsp; etc. 
 Incentivize translation and localization educational BAT content. 
 

 Content and Collaboration 
 
 Broaden BAT Community ECHO NFT magazine’s reach through creator partnerships, promoting BAT adoption with trend-focused content and additional issues available for BAT holders.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the upcoming <a href="https://zfnd.org/zconvi/">ZconVI</a>, a virtual gathering of Zcash enthusiasts and experts, scheduled to take place from Tuesday, March 4 to Friday, March 7, 2025. This four-day event promises to be an engaging platform for learning, collaboration, and innovation within the Zcash community.</p>



 Event Overview 



<p>ZconVI will be a fully virtual event, allowing participants from around the globe to join without the constraints of travel. The event will showcase how we can achieve Synergy Through Decentralization, highlighting the collaborative efforts of multiple organizations in planning and executing the event content. However, it is important to note that the sessions themselves are not restricted by any specific theme, providing a broad canvas for diverse topics and discussions.</p>



 Collaborative Approach 



<p>The conference structure is designed to foster collaboration among key organizations within the Zcash ecosystem:</p>



 
 Day 1 (Tuesday, March 4): Zcash Foundation (ZF) will curate the content, setting the tone for the conference with insightful sessions and discussions. 



 Day 2 (Wednesday, March 5): Electric Coin Company (ECC) will take charge of planning, bringing their expertise and vision to the forefront. 



 Day 3 (Thursday, March 6): Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) will organize the day’s content. Notably, they are encouraged to explore topics beyond their direct funding activities. 



 Day 4 (Friday, March 7): ZecHub will conclude the event with a day filled with innovative ideas and community-driven discussions. 
 



<p>Each day will feature a co-curated panel session. These panels are a collaborative effort among all partner organizations.</p>



<p>ZF is proud to continue to support <a href="https://www.zkav.club/">Zk AV Club</a> by awarding them a grant for ZconVI. Zk AV Club, under Ryan Taylor’s leadership, will have complete creative freedom to empower communities and amplify their individual voices. For each day of ZconVI, alongside the official event programming, Zk AV Club will be hosting an interactive live podcast. ZF will be working with a separate production company to livestream the event, which will further free up Zk AV Club’s time so they can do what they do best!&nbsp;</p>



 Logistics and Coordination 



<p>Zcash Foundation will handle all logistical aspects of ZconVI. This includes managing audiovisual needs, registration processes, attendee communication, graphic design for event materials, and more. The Foundation will again utilize the well-received Whova platform, and update the app to maximize opportunities for community engagement throughout the conference.</p>



<p>Each participating organization will have a liaison working closely with the Foundation to ensure that all necessary information for their planned sessions is communicated effectively.</p>



 Request for Proposals 



<p>ZconVI is set to be an unmissable event for anyone interested in the future of privacy technology and decentralized systems. Contribute to the diverse lineup of sessions and panels curated by leading organizations in the Zcash ecosystem. We invite you to <a href="https://forms.gle/Q74f38ZDYwky2ogD6">submit an RFP</a> outlining how your presentation will move a project, conversation or idea forward for the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



 Stay Tuned 



<p>Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking virtual conference as we explore the synergy of decentralization! Attendee registration will open in February 2025 and be free of charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please check <a href="https://zfnd.org/zconvi/">Zcash Foundation’s website</a> for answers to frequently asked questions and ongoing updates. Additionally, we will post updates on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash Forum</a> and <a href="http://@zcashfoundation">Twitter/X</a> as planning progresses.</p>

<p>There has been a growing interest in crypto-based derivative products such as perpetual futures, options, futures markets, and contracts since 2019. You may be shocked to learn that monthly futures trading volumes on centralized exchanges have not gone below the <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/futures/volume-of-bitcoin-futures-monthly">$1 trillion mark</a> since the beginning of 2024, often outpacing spot trading&nbsp;volumes.</p><p>Derivative products allow investors to speculate on the upward and downward price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies, without direct ownership. As a result, they offer greater flexibility and potential for higher returns compared to traditional spot&nbsp;trading.</p><p>Following PIVX’s recent perpetual <a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-takes-flight-on-weex-perpetual-contracts-now-live-f1ecb782a50d">listing</a> on WEEX and an upcoming listing on XT.com, it is definitely a perfect time to learn about perpetual contracts, aka perps. This beginner’s guide explores the world of perps, how they work, and their pros and&nbsp;cons.</p> What Is a Perpetual Contract? <p>Let’s say you believe PIVX is going to the moon. Instead of buying and holding PIVX directly, you could use a PIVX perpetual contract to amplify your position. This contract enables you to bet on whether PIVX’s price will go up or down without actually owning the&nbsp;coins.</p><p>· Bullish on PIVX: If you think PIVX will rise in value, you can take a long position on a PIVX perpetual contract. This means you’re betting that the price will increase.</p><p>· Bearish on PIVX: If you think PIVX will decrease in value, you can take a short position. This means you’re betting that the price will&nbsp;fall.</p><p>Unlike traditional contracts, perps do not have an expiration date, meaning you can hold your position for as long as you want, regardless of market fluctuations.</p><p>However, there’s a catch: a “funding rate.” This rate adjusts the contract price to keep it aligned with the market price. If you hold a position for too long, you might have to pay or receive this funding rate, which can impact your overall profit or&nbsp;loss.</p><p>I must also warn you that although perpetual contracts offer leverage, they also come with significant risks. Market fluctuations can lead to substantial losses if not carefully managed.</p> How Does a Perpetual Contract&nbsp;Work? <p>Let’s use this simple example to explain how a perp contract&nbsp;works.</p>  Trading Pair: PIVX/USDT  Position: Long (expecting the price of PIVX to increase)  Entry price:&nbsp;$0.22  Collateral/Margin: $100  Leverage: 10x (your position is magnified by a factor of&nbsp;10)  Funding rate: 0.01% (a periodic fee charged to traders every 8 hours to align the contract price with the current market&nbsp;price).  <p>In our hypothetical scenario, the trader goes long on PIVX, believing the price will increase. He deposits a collateral (margin) of $100 and uses a 10x leverage to control a larger position of&nbsp;$1,000.</p><p>The trader enters the PIVX/USD perpetual contract at a price of $0.22. To keep the contract price aligned with the actual PIVX price, a periodic fee (funding rate) is applied. When the perpetual price is higher than spot, longs pay shorts, and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>Assuming the price of PIVX moves by 20% from $0.22 to $0.262, the trader would make a profit of $200 upon closing their position. On the flip side, the trader also risks liquidation and losing the $100 margin if the price of PIVX falls below a certain threshold.</p> Pros of Trading Perpetual Contracts <p>· No Expiry Concerns: Unlike traditional futures, you don’t need to worry about rolling over positions or contract expiration dates. This makes position management much&nbsp;simpler.</p><p>· Leverage Opportunities: Most exchanges offer leverage on perpetual contracts, allowing you to open larger positions with less capital. However, remember that leverage is a double-edged sword that amplifies both gains and&nbsp;losses.</p><p>· Easy Price Discovery: The funding rate mechanism ensures that perpetual contract prices stay close to the spot market, making it easier to understand the current market&nbsp;value.</p><p>· Flexibility: You can go both long or short easily, allowing you to profit in both rising and falling&nbsp;markets.</p> Cons of Trading Perpetual Contracts <p>· Liquidation Risk: When trading with leverage, your position can be liquidated if the market moves against you beyond your margin requirements. Always use stop-loss orders and manage your position size carefully.</p><p>· Funding Rate Costs: Regular funding rate payments can impact your profitability, especially during periods of high market volatility. Monitor funding rates before opening positions.</p><p>· Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Combined with leverage, this can lead to significant losses if positions aren’t properly&nbsp;managed.</p> Best Practices <p>Do not be swayed by the potential to 10x or even 50x your investment. Perp trading carries a high-risk/high-reward ratio. As a beginner, start with small position sizes. As a rule of thumb, practice on testnet or paper trading platforms before attempting the real deal. And even when you do, use minimal leverage (1x-2x) until you master the&nbsp;ropes.</p><p>Keep track of your funding rates, carefully monitor your leverage levels, always use stop-loss orders, and never risk more than 1–2% of your trading capital on a single&nbsp;trade.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>You’ve probably heard it a thousand times: “Cryptocurrency is a haven for criminals.” Every time a high-profile hack or illicit transaction makes headlines, the chorus of critics grows louder, painting digital assets as a tool for the infamous. But is this narrative accurate, or is it simply a case of fear-mongering?</p><p>While it’s undeniable that cryptocurrencies have been used for illicit activities, the reality is far more nuanced. Traditional fiat currencies have been the primary vehicle for money laundering for centuries. From drug cartels to corrupt officials, criminals have exploited the anonymity and ease of movement offered by physical&nbsp;cash.</p> Money Laundering: A Timeless&nbsp;Crime <p>Money laundering is the process of disguising the illicit origins of funds. It has been around for centuries and historically, organized crime used Laundromat businesses to blur the unlawful sources of its cash. For instance, proceeds from gambling and illicit drug trades were often channeled to retail businesses such as hotels and restaurants.</p><p>By combining these illegal earnings with genuine business revenue, the total amount could be reported as legitimate income. This technique, known as layering, effectively disguises the origin of the dirty money, making it appear as legitimate business profits. Once laundered, the funds can be used freely without fear of detection by law enforcement.</p><p>Traditionally, criminals use methods such as smurfing (breaking large sums into smaller deposits below reporting thresholds), shell companies, cash couriers, and trade-based laundering. On the crypto side, malicious actors use mixing services, OTC trading, and chain&nbsp;hopping.</p> 8 Shocking Money Laundering Facts   The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that between 2% and 5% of the global GDP is laundered annually. This translates to an estimate of between $800 billion and $2 trillion&nbsp;yearly.  A staggering $300 billion is laundered annually in the US, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. In 2022, the median loss per case surged to $304,417, with 1,001 cases documented.  As of 2022, Russian oligarchs had stashed away a staggering $1 trillion in illicit funds in offshore havens. The “Russian Laundromat” scandal exposed a network of 19 banks that facilitated the laundering of a staggering $20.8 billion between 2011 and&nbsp;2014.  Some of the largest money laundering cases involved traditional financial institutions. In 2010, Wachovia was fined a hefty $160 million for facilitating the laundering of over $380 billion for Mexican drug cartels over several years. The bank was also found to have physically transported substantial amounts of cash for these drug cartels through its bulk currency transport service.  The global amount of cryptocurrency laundered in 2023 decreased by 29.5% to US$22.2 billion (S$29.9 billion), down from US$31.5 billion in&nbsp;2022.  The 2016 Bitfinex hack resulted in the theft of 120,000 Bitcoin ($70 million at the time). This cybercrime, one of the largest in crypto history, led to the subsequent arrest of a couple accused of laundering a significant portion of the stolen funds. Their elaborate scheme involved complex cryptocurrency transactions to obscure the illicit activity.  2021 witnessed a major surge in NFT-related money laundering, with criminal activities totaling $1.377 million, a 231% increase from the start of the&nbsp;year.  In 2019, criminal transactions involving Bitcoin totaled $2.8 billion, representing just 0.9% of US money laundering and 0.3% worldwide.   Fiat is Still&nbsp;King <p>Despite the rise of cryptocurrencies, traditional fiat currencies remain the primary tool for money launderers. The anonymity and ease of physical cash transactions make them an attractive option for criminals to conceal the origins of illicit&nbsp;funds.</p><p>While cryptocurrencies have gained notoriety for their potential use in illicit activities, their transparency and traceability, especially on public blockchains, can make them a less desirable choice for sophisticated money launderers. Traditional methods, such as smurfing, structuring, and cash couriers, continue to be widely used and are often more difficult to&nbsp;detect.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy.

 Magura network update and readying latest release of&nbsp;NymVPN <p>Nym’s major network update (Magura) went live last Tuesday, setting the stage for what will become a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">novel form of Nym tokenomics</a>. With payments live, usage of NymVPN will be linked with NYM buy-orders which in turn will be rewarded to Nym node operators providing privacy protections for&nbsp;users.</p><p>After some delays as a result of network instability following the Magura release, the release of the latest NymVPN app is now scheduled for next&nbsp;week.</p><p>Below is everything you need to know about these two important releases. Here’s the full <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nymvpn-roadmap-through-2024">timeline</a> for NymVPN finishing out 2024. Don’t forget, this is all in lead up to the two big&nbsp;things:</p>  December 2024: Early bird access to the robust NymVPN app with payments!  January 2025: The official launch of NymVPN to the world, at a symbolic time when it needs a real paradigm shift in online&nbsp;privacy  <p>Remember, NymVPN Beta is still open and free to use, so <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">sign up today</a> and instantly receive a free 30-day access voucher. Nym needs your testing, testing,&nbsp;testing!</p> Network <p>The Nym network underwent a major update with the release of Magura v2024.13. This release prepares the network for the latest stable release of NymVPN next week as well as the foundational tokenomics for node operators.</p> What changes with&nbsp;Magura?   Operation smoosh is complete: Now all Nym nodes will function as both mix nodes and entry/exit gateways.  Rewards distribution: Rewards will be distributed equally across all three layers: entry gateways, mix nodes, and exit gateways.  Removing under-performing nodes: Nodes are now required to run the latest Nym binaries and to agree to the node <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> committing importantly to <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nyms-zero-knowledge-network">no-log’s policies</a>. This will increase the overall performance of the Nym network for clients. Nodes not meeting these conditions will not be eligible to be part of the active&nbsp;set.  <p>Read about all the changes to <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Nym operator tokenomics here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3G1pJqvO2VM?si=9QBbkfldnycyD0_C">watch the recent Node Operator Town Hall</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> Patch for mainnet instability <p>While the Magura release worked stably in sandbox, the mainnet release led to some unexpected network instability. The dev team has now worked through the issues and released a Magura patch today which should begin to stabilize connectivity once&nbsp;again.</p><p>Huge thanks to the operator community for being active and responsive!</p> Note for NYM&nbsp;stakers <p>If you’re staking on Nym nodes, please stay tuned for guidance next week on restaking your tokens following this week’s network&nbsp;changes.</p> Changes to explorers <p>The release of Magura means that current explorers will soon be replaced. For the time being, please refer to <a href="https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/">harbourmaster</a> for node and network information.</p> NymVPN  NymVPN v2024.11 coming next&nbsp;week <p>Due to the network issues following the Magura release, the latest stable release of the NymVPN app, originally scheduled for Nov. 21, has been postponed until next week while the dev team implements needed fixes. Nym remains committed to delivering the highest quality technology to our community.</p><p>This delay will not affect the next release and launch of payments on 12 December 2024 as&nbsp;promised</p> What to expect from NymVPN&nbsp;v2024.11 <p>Here are some of the important things to expect from the latest NymVPN&nbsp;release:</p>  A streamlined sign-up/sign-in flow  Network and connection stability thanks to state machine implementations across&nbsp;apps  The launch of the zk-nym credential system ahead of payments in&nbsp;December  Security fixes as a result of the July 2024 security&nbsp;audit  <p>Stay tuned for the NymVPN v2024.11 release announcement next week for compatible devices and confirmed changes.</p><p>Until next week comrades!

<p>November 21, 2024 — Today, we’re excited to announce the latest addition to Brave Search: chat mode for Answer with AI. This new feature offers the option to ask follow-up questions from the basis of an initial query to Brave Search.</p>
<p>It’s available today for all <a href="https://search.brave.com">Brave Search</a> users around the world.</p>

 Building on the foundation of “Answer with AI” 
<p><a>Earlier this year</a>, we introduced “Answer with AI” in Brave Search, becoming the only large-scale, real-time answer engine focused on privacy and free from Big Tech dependencies. Since its launch, usage has surged, with “Answer with AI” now generating more than 11 million answers daily. These AI-powered summaries appear at the top of the search results page whenever a question-like query is detected, offering users quick, concise information.</p>

    
    Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>Question-like queries deliver helpful summaries sourcing information from across the Web.</p>

 Combining the best of both worlds 
<p>As generative AI and chat interfaces become increasingly popular, we’ve observed that users rely on different tools for different needs:</p>
 
 
<p>Search engines excel at scouring the web to retrieve images, links, and information based on a single query. However, they’re limited in allowing follow-up questions or maintaining context, so each new query essentially starts from scratch.</p>
 
 
<p>Chat applications, by contrast, facilitate conversational interactions, which are great for exploring topics through related questions and maintaining context. However, they’re not optimized for broad web searches; getting relevant search-like results often requires toggling a setting or crafting the query in a particular way.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave Search bridges this gap by adapting the experience based on the nature of each query, eliminating the need for users to choose between chat-first or search-first approaches. Starting today, when a query is recognized as a question, Brave Search provides a summary with a chat bar (answers can also be triggered manually by clicking the AI icon to the right of the search magnifying glass icon). Engaging with this chat bar opens a chat experience, allowing users to explore the topic in more depth.</p>
<p>This experience is powered by a combination of open and internal LLMs, plus Brave Search results. This allows Brave Search to ground responses in real-time search results, significantly reducing the chance of AI hallucinations.</p>

    
    Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>Asking a follow up question expands the initial answer into a chat experience, offering sources along the way to highlight the origin of the information surfaced with each new question.</p>
<p>Side-by-side, it’s clear how Brave Search offers the best of both worlds, whether the user starts with search-like or chat-like query:</p>
<p>Brave vs. Google on a traditional search query</p>


    
    


    



      
      
    
<p>Brave vs. ChatGPT on a complex chat query</p>

<p>*Chats are ephemeral by default and expire within six hours. An option to save chats to Brave’s Leo AI assistant is coming soon.</p>

 Privacy by default 
<p>The new chat feature has all the same privacy protections of Brave Search and its Answer with AI feature. Brave Search does not profile you or store your queries. The same is true when using chat mode in Answer with AI: these conversations are ephemeral, meaning they’re not persisted or stored. Your conversations with Answer with AI remain safe and private.</p>

 How to try it 
<p>All Brave Search users, regardless of what browser they’re using to access the Web, can take advantage of the new chat feature.</p>
<p>If Brave Search is already <a href="https://search.brave.com">set as your browser’s default search engine</a>, simply start typing in your browser’s address bar. If Brave Search isn’t your default search, you can visit <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a> in any browser. Once you enter a query, you’ll see an Answer with AI summary right at the top of the results page for most queries. From here you can simply ask a follow-up question.</p>
<p>And while we strive to offer follow-up chat to everyone for free, reasonable usage limits apply.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 About Brave Search 
<p>Brave Search is the fastest growing independent search engine since Bing. Unlike <a>Big Tech</a> search engines, Brave Search does not profile its users; unlike supposedly alternative engines, Brave Search serves results from a truly independent index of the Web. This means Brave Search can offer both industry-leading privacy and an effective counter to the bias and censorship prevalent in Big Tech’s personalization.</p>
<p>Brave Search continues to reach new all-time highs, serving more than 36 million queries per day (and more than 1 billion queries each month). It’s the default search engine for most new <a>Brave browser</a> users, which now has over 70 million users worldwide.</p>

<p>This post describes work by Ralph Ankele, Sofia Celi, Ralph Giles and Hamed Haddadi.</p>

 Enabling verifiable advertisement interaction and reward computation with privacy-preserving cryptography 
<p>In today’s data-driven world, digital interactions are continually monitored. Many online platforms use data-driven incentive schemes to reward users for engaging with content, like watching ads or participating in surveys. However, these schemes often come with a catch: they may collect and store personal data to track engagement. This presents a problem because users are essentially sacrificing their privacy for small rewards, leaving their data vulnerable to misuse.</p>
<p>Privacy-preserving incentive schemes offer a solution by allowing users to receive rewards without exposing their personal information. Brave Rewards, for example, is designed to reward users for viewing ads while keeping their data private. The system respects user privacy by ensuring that ad engagement data stays on their device, never shared or stored externally. However, as demand for verifiable, decentralized systems grows, enhancing this model to provide stronger guarantees of privacy and reward accuracy is critical.</p>

 Privacy-Preserving Incentive Protocols 
<p>Privacy-preserving incentive schemes are becoming essential as digital platforms increasingly seek ways to reward users for engagement without compromising their personal information. These schemes rely on cryptographic methods to ensure that users can verify rewards and interactions without exposing sensitive data. The primary goal is to create an ecosystem where users maintain anonymity while still benefiting from their engagement.</p>
<p>The Boomerang protocol builds upon the following research works: The <a href="https://petsymposium.org/2016/files/papers/Black-Box_Accumulation__Collecting_Incentives_in_a_Privacy-Preserving_Way.pdf">Black-Box Accumulator (BBA)</a> scheme works by “accumulating” tokens without directly associating them with the user, creating a layer of privacy around interactions. <a href="https://homepage.rub.de/andy.rupp/papers/bbap_full_paper.pdf">BBA+</a>, an improved version of BBA that optimizes cryptographic proofs, prevents double spending, and supports negative point collection, making it more efficient. Building on these foundations, <a href="https://petsymposium.org/popets/2020/popets-2020-0010.pdf">Black-Box Wallets (BBW)</a> is a privacy-preserving payment solution tailored for constrained devices. Another noteworthy protocol in the privacy-preserving incentive landscape is <a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/2018/files/papers/issue3/popets-2018-0026.pdf">Privacy Pass</a>. Originally designed as an anti-bot mechanism, Privacy Pass can be used as a versatile tool for privacy-preserving rewards.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards currently uses Privacy Pass as a key component of its system, enabling users to earn rewards in a privacy-respecting way. For example, when users engage with Brave Ads or perform certain actions (such as viewing an ad or clicking on one), Privacy Pass generates cryptographic tokens (not to be confused with BATs) to validate these interactions without revealing specific details about the user’s identity or browsing habits.</p>

 The Boomerang Protocol explained 
<p>The Boomerang protocol specifies a novel decentralized privacy-preserving incentive protocol to securely and privately store user interactions within an incentive system. The protocol leverages cryptographic methods to transparently compute rewards for users, ensuring verifiability while preserving their privacy.</p>
<p>The protocol defines four components that are interacting with each other:</p>
 
 
<p>Client: This is the Brave browser with Brave Rewards enabled. The client can be on any platform, either desktop or mobile. This actor is who interacts with the advertisements, and gets rewarded in return for interacting with the ads.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Issuer: This is the provider of the incentive system. This actor verifies the correct computations of the client, and also initiates the rewards payment for the client. For instance, Brave can be an issuer for the Boomerang incentive system.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Advertiser: These are individual advertisers that promote their content, that are shown to clients that have Brave Rewards enabled within their Brave browser. Clients can interact with those advertisements and get rewarded for doing so.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>L1 Blockchain: This can be any blockchain that offers smart contracts, and implements the Boomerang protocol. This actor publicly and transparently verifies the correctness of the rewards computation and issues the payment to the user.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>They interact as illustrated below:</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Let’s consider an example, to see how Boomerang works in detail. The User, let’s call him Joe in our example, no longer wants to be left out when looking at advertisements while browsing the web. Moreover, Joe wants to see privacy-respecting advertisements and therefore enables Brave Rewards in his Brave Browser. After enabling Brave Rewards, a token is initialized by the Client he is using, either the desktop Brave browser, or on his mobile device. The issuer of the incentive system, in that case Brave, is sent a Proof of Issuance, to verify that everything was correctly initiated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, Joe is browsing the web as he normally does, interacting with some advertisements along the way. In the background, the advertisement interaction is stored on Joe’s client, and a Proof of Token Update of the regularly updated interaction state is shared in zero-knowledge with the Issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After interacting with advertisements for a while, and collecting reward points, Joe decides to ask to get rewarded for his interactions. His client sends a request for reward computation, and the Issuer creates a Reward Proof, specifying how much Joe will get paid for interacting with the incentive system. This Reward Proof is then sent to a L1 Blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The L1 Blockchain runs a smart contract and publicly verifies in a transparent way that the rewards computation has been done correctly, and the proof is valid. Finally, the smart contract issues payment of the reward to Joe. And that’s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that is how the Boomerang protocol works. All the proofs mentioned above are cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs, that enable a Prover to prove the correctness of a statement, without the Verifier learning anything about the statement. Moreover, the individual advertisement interactions are collected in an unlinkable way using blinding and unblinding techniques, meaning they cannot be linked together. Finally, as the smart contract that verifies the rewards computation is public and transparent, the User can verify that the computations of the Issuer have been done correctly. This is what makes the Boomerang protocol a decentralized privacy-preserving verifiable incentive system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Boomerang Protocol extended 
<p>The Boomerang protocol can be split into three procedures/sub-protocols. These are:</p>
 
 
<p>Issuance: This procedure initializes the token,</p>
 
 
<p>Collection: This procedure updates the token with the advertisement interactions of the user,</p>
 
 
<p>Spending/Verification: This procedure redeems the collected points and creates a rewards proof that can be verified on a L1 blockchain.</p>
 
 
<p>We will provide details about each of the procedures next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Issuance Procedure 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The aim of this procedure is to jointly generate tokens, between the User and Issuer, that the User commits to and the Issuer can blindly sign. Boomerang leverages <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-46766-1_9.pdf">Pedersen commitments</a> for the User to commit to the advertisement interactions. Moreover, we leverage the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/298.pdf">Blind Signatures with attributes (ACL) scheme</a> so the Issuer can blindly sign the tokens. After a User verifies the blind signature, they then build a cryptographic accumulator called a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/756">CurveTree</a> and make the root of the tree public.</p>

 Collection Procedure 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The Collection procedure consists of adding positive points to the token, representing individual interactions with advertisements, in an unlinkable manner. The correctness of the token update is ensured by several zero-knowledge proofs based on <a href="https://www.cs.au.dk/~ivan/Sigma.pdf">Sigma protocols</a>.The Issuer can verify the correctness of those proofs and blindly sign the tokens. In return, the User verifies the blind signature and rebuilds the accumulator.</p>

 Spending/Verification Procedure 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The Spending/Verification procedure works similarly to the Collection procedure. The exception is that instead of adding positive points, this procedure will add negative points (i.e. the amount of points that should be the reward) to the token. Additionally to updating the tokens, the Issuer creates the Reward proof, where we leverage range proofs from the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf">Bulletproof</a> zero-knowledge proofs. This Reward proof can then be verified in a smart contract on a L1 blockchain in a transparent and public verifiable manner.</p>

 Demo Time 
<p>To illustrate further how the Boomerang protocol works, let’s put it in practice. We have implemented a simple proof of concept implementation in Rust which is available at: <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/Boomerang">https://github.com/brave-experiments/Boomerang</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After cloning the git repository you can run the demo by first building using</p>
 <code>cargo  build
</code> <p>Next, you can run a server instance, simulating the Issuer by running</p>
 <code>cargo  run  --example  server
</code> <p>Clients can be simulated by running a client instance with</p>
 <code>cargo  run  --example  client
</code> <p>The end to end demo will start up a server instance, and one client instance. Then it will go over all the three procedures of the Boomerang protocol, as explained above. Initially, the Issuance procedure will be called, that initializes the token. Next, the Collection procedure is called, which updates the token with some advertisement interactions. Finally, the SpendVerify procedure is called, which initiates a reward calculation. For the purpose of simply showcasing the proof of concept, the reward proof is verified by the client instead of being sent to a L1 blockchain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The output of the server instance should look like this</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The output of the client instance looks like this</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Conclusion 
<p>Boomerang is a novel decentralized privacy-preserving verifiable incentive protocol. The protocol leverages cryptographic methods to transparently compute rewards for users, ensuring verifiability while preserving their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more detailed technical description of the protocol can be found in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01353">technical report</a>.

  Partnering with Rox: Every Seller Needs an Agent Swarm  <p>Ishan, Chris, Avanika, Diogo, Shriram and their team are combining GTM and AI expertise to build a single source of truth for enterprise sales.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>

Team Rox.



 
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of enterprise sales, the most successful teams aren’t just selling—they’re orchestrating complex, data-driven relationships with their most valuable accounts. Yet despite the proliferation of sales tools, account executives at leading companies still spend countless hours manually gathering intelligence, tracking customer signals, and managing workflows across disconnected systems. That’s why we’re excited to announce our partnership with <a href="https://www.rox.com/">Rox</a>, leading their seed round with participation from GV and General Catalyst and now joining this new Series A, to bring the power of AI agents to enterprise sales teams.</p>



<p>Rox is reimagining how modern enterprise sales teams work by introducing what some call an “Agentic CRM”—though that description only scratches the surface. Rather than replacing existing systems, Rox seamlessly integrates with platforms such as Salesforce, Zendesk and ERPs to transform company data into an intelligent agent swarm that autonomously monitors, engages and manages customer relationships. Each agent can be equipped with capabilities like finding recent news, analyzing sentiment and identifying engagement opportunities—all powered by sophisticated AI that understands the nuances of B2B relationships. This enables the Rox platform to quickly become a single source of truth for its customers.</p>



<p>What sets Rox apart is its laser focus on serious enterprise sellers doing account-based selling. This isn’t a tool for small sales teams—it’s purpose-built for organizations with sophisticated sales motions targeting their largest and most strategic accounts. The platform’s warehouse-native architecture ensures it can handle enterprise-scale data while maintaining the flexibility needed for complex sales workflows.</p>



<p>The founding team brings together a rare combination of GTM expertise, company-building skill and technical brilliance. Founder Ishan Mukherjee formerly built Pixie into a beloved observability platform before getting acquired into New Relic. At New Relic he applied the observability DNA to leading growth efforts including the self-serve business, PLG, global marketing and inside sales. Chris Ré and Avanika Narayan have pioneered industry-leading research in data preparation with advanced AI. Fun fact: Avanika was formerly an intern at Sequoia and we can personally testify that her brilliance is only matched by her work ethic. The dream team is completed with growth expert Diogo Ribeiro and infrastructure engineering dynamo Shriram Sridharan who have built and scaled GTM and AI systems at companies including AWS, Confluent and ThousandEyes (part of Cisco). This team’s deep understanding of both enterprise sales challenges and cutting-edge AI has enabled them to create something truly unique: a warehouse-native system of workflow built specifically for customer-facing representatives.</p>



<p>The results speak for themselves. In private beta, Rox has already helped 35+ revenue teams at leading B2B organizations including Ramp, MongoDB, Confluent, OpenAI and Redis transform their sales operations. Account executives using Rox are reclaiming more than eight hours per week while increasing customer activity by more than 35%. Several enterprise customers have seen their investment pay off twofold in sales-accepted pipeline, leading them to expand their deployments. Our team at Sequoia has seen the benefits firsthand—Rox is now integrated into our own internal CMS. And with the launch of their public beta, the platform is now available for all enterprise teams to start using for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI continues to reshape how we work, we believe Rox represents the future of enterprise sales. Their team of 15 builders (and growing quickly—they’re <a href="https://www.rox.com/company#join-us">hiring</a>!) is rapidly expanding the platform’s capabilities while maintaining the high-touch support that sophisticated sales organizations demand. We at Sequoia are proud to partner with Ishan, Chris, Avanika, Diogo, Shriram and the entire team as they help the world’s best revenue teams sell more, smarter. The future of intelligent enterprise sales is here, and it’s being built at Rox.</p>

 November Development Update: Modular Architecture and New Empe Issuer&nbsp;Demo <p>TL;DR: The November update features a modular architecture with standalone Issuer and Verifier services for easy integration. The Empe Issuer Demo highlights use cases like passwordless login and secure data sharing, making it simpler for clients to adopt and scale Empeiria’s solution.</p><p>User experience and real-world utility are at the core of our mission. This is why, in this latest development update, we focus on making system integration smoother and more flexible than ever, and demonstrate real-world use cases through our latest <a href="https://issuer-demo.empe.io/">Empe Issuer&nbsp;Demo</a>.</p><p>This update highlights both the technical enhancements in our architecture and practical implementations of our solutions. Whether you’re a technical expert or new to the field, you’ll gain insights into how our tools can benefit your own projects and be applied in your everyday&nbsp;life.</p> Technical Architecture Update  Overview <p>Our restructured architecture emphasizes modularity and ease of deployment, making integration with client systems as seamless as possible. We’ve split the system into distinct, independent microservices that handle key roles, like verification and issuance. This approach allows us to provide a plug-and-play experience, ensuring minimal disruption for clients who want to adopt our&nbsp;system.</p>Empeiria End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure Overview Key Components and Service Breakdown <p>1. Issuer Service&nbsp;(IS)</p><p>The Issuer Service is a self-contained component responsible for managing verifiable credential issuance. It’s designed to be easy to deploy independently and interact directly with the user’s wallet for issuing verifiable credentials. This isolation allows clients to integrate verifiable credential issuance capabilities without overhauling their existing&nbsp;systems.</p><p>2. Verifier Service&nbsp;(VS)</p><p>Similarly, the Verifier Service is an independent, deployable service focused solely on verifiable credential verification. When a verification request is initiated, the Verifier Service communicates with the Wallet for Verifiable Presentation (VP) requests and resolves DIDs through the <a href="https://medium.com/@Empeiria-web3/empeiria-releases-end-to-end-verifiable-data-infrastructure-evdi-testnet-20d6a5d34a43">Empeiria Blockchain</a>. By isolating verification functions into a standalone service, clients can easily plug our verification component into their environments.</p><p>3. Client-Server (User’s Own&nbsp;System)</p><p>A unique aspect of our architecture is that the Client-Server and Application Logic are assumed to be part of the client’s own system. This means that users deploying our solution will manage their own Client-Server and Application Logic, which can interact with our Verifier and Issuer Services as required. We provide a client-side component that facilitates communication with the Verifier Service, making integration straightforward and minimally invasive. Our goal here is to offer a component that can be easily incorporated into the client’s infrastructure, connecting their environment with our verification and issuance services in a plug-and-play manner.</p><p>4. Empe Blockchain (DID Document Repository)</p><p>The Empe Blockchain serves as a decentralized repository for DID documents, supporting trustless DID resolution for verifiable credential verification. This integration aligns with our commitment to Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles, allowing client systems to verify DIDs without relying on a centralized authority.</p> Why does this&nbsp;matter? <p>These improvements simplify the integration process, enabling faster adoption and smoother transitions for clients. By breaking down our system into modular microservices, we make it easier for organizations to adopt and scale without major disruptions to their existing workflows.</p><p>• Modularity and Plug-and-Play: By providing the Verifier and Issuer as standalone services, we enable clients to deploy only what they need, keeping integration simple and scalable.</p><p>• Minimal Invasiveness: Since the Client-Server and Application Logic are entirely managed by the user, our solution integrates with a client’s existing infrastructure seamlessly. Our components are designed to be added as independent plugins, enhancing the client’s system without disrupting it.</p>  Security and Flexibility: By isolating the verification and issuance processes, we enhance security and provide flexible deployment options. Each service operates independently, ensuring clients can scale and update components as&nbsp;needed.   New Empe Issuer&nbsp;Demo  Overview <p>To illustrate how our architecture supports real-world use cases, we’ve created a demo that shows various use cases our system can support. This demo helps potential clients envision practical ways to leverage our services in verifiable credential-based workflows, providing value in fields like identity management, event access, secure data sharing, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>The new <a href="http://issuer-demo.empe.io/">Empe Issuer Demo</a> complements the <a href="https://empe.io/wallet/">Empe DID Wallet</a>. Powered by <a href="https://medium.com/@Empeiria-web3/empeiria-releases-end-to-end-verifiable-data-infrastructure-evdi-testnet-20d6a5d34a43">Empe Blockchain</a>, it is a fast and secure way to experience the practical benefits of our solutions in real-life scenarios.</p><p>Download the Empe DID Wallet from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/empe-wallet/id6468363115">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.empe.wallet&amp;hl=en">Google Play Store</a> and use it on the <a href="http://issuer-demo.empe.io/">Empe Issuer website</a> to explore the following use&nbsp;cases.</p> Use Cases <p>1. Passwordless Login with Empe DID&nbsp;Wallet</p><p>Users can log in to an example web service by simply proving ownership of their <a href="https://medium.com/@Empeiria-web3/deep-dives-decentralized-identifiers-dids-b1b723c954f1">Decentralized Identifier (DID)</a> through the Empe DID Wallet. This feature is an easy add-on for clients who want to replace traditional passwords with secure, passwordless authentication, simplifying the user experience.</p><p>2. Proof of Purchase Verifiable Credential</p><p>In this example, the Issuer Service issues a “proof of purchase” verifiable credential, such as a ticket for an event, directly to the user’s Wallet. This shows how our solution can streamline ticketing and proof-based verifiable credential issuance, enabling organizations to manage access more efficiently.</p><p>3. Conditional Verifiable Credential Flow (Proof of Attendance)</p><p>This flow requires a “proof of purchase” verifiable credential to be presented before issuing a “proof of attendance” verifiable credential. The conditional logic illustrates how our system can enable progressive access control, where one verifiable credential serves as a prerequisite for another, allowing clients to create step-by-step verification processes.</p><p>4. Birth Certificate Form Verifiable Credential</p><p>Here, we demonstrate a more complex form-based verifiable credential issuance, suitable for official documents like birth certificates. By completing a detailed form, users can receive a birth certificate credential, showing how our system handles structured data securely. This use case is particularly relevant for government and healthcare organizations where such verifiable credentials are&nbsp;needed.</p><p>5. Data Sharing&nbsp;Flow</p><p>This flow demonstrates how verifiable credential data can be shared with trusted entities by a user. In this scenario the user is requested to provide certain data (Birth Certificate Verifiable Credential), and upon confirming in their wallet app, it’s securely transferred to a requestor (verifier) service. This functionality is valuable in scenarios where credential data needs to be shared safely between&nbsp;systems.</p> Why does this&nbsp;matter? <p>The new <a href="https://issuer-demo.empe.io/">Empe Issuer Demo</a> highlights the utility and flexibility of our solution. From secure logins to proof of purchase, conditional access, and complex verifiable credential management, our system adapts to diverse&nbsp;needs.</p><p>By prioritizing modular services and seamless integration, we empower clients across industries to implement our <a href="https://empe.io/technology/">End-to-End Verifiable Data Infrastructure (EVDI)</a> for a variety of applications, while the new Empe Issuer Demo showcases real-life utility of our solutions.</p><p>These updates represent a significant step toward a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly verifiable data ecosystem. Your continued support and feedback remain vital, and we deeply value your involvement as we advance together.</p><p>Follow Empeiria on <a href="https://twitter.com/empe_io">X</a>, or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/empe-web3/">LinkedIn</a> for the latest news &amp; updates.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the 31st post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Anton Lazarev (Senior Adblock Research Engineer), Stephen Heaps (Senior Software Engineer, iOS), and Pete Snyder (Principal Privacy Researcher). This post was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (Lead for Privacy Engineering).</p>
<p>Starting with version 1.73 on all platforms, Brave is significantly improving its adblocking capabilities by adding support for procedural cosmetic filtering of page elements. This means that Brave will block more ads, break fewer websites, and be more precise with blocking intrusive page elements.</p>
<p>Brave already offers best-in-class ad and <a>tracker</a> blocking. We block privacy-harmful network requests to trackers, which prevents ad companies and data brokers from following you around the Web. This also has the nice side effect of boosting performance and making the Web less cluttered. Sometimes, however, blocking <a>third-party ads</a> will cause websites to break visually: there’s blank space where the ad would’ve been. Plus, in some cases, it’s not possible to block ads via network request blocking because the ad content is mixed in with the website’s content.</p>
<p>To get around this, Brave does <a>cosmetic filtering</a> of unwanted page elements, where we hide page elements using CSS selectors. In the following example, we can find and block the ad element by targeting elements using CSS classes “post” and “ad”.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Not all elements can be hidden by CSS selectors. CSS is declarative, meaning it controls the appearance and layout of a page based on the page’s structure rather than content. This makes it harder for us to tell the difference between an ad and other page content when an ad is made to look similar to the rest of the page. In the following example, the CSS class name for the element that contains a friend’s social media post (that the user wants to see) is the same as the CSS class name for a promoted ad element (that the user does not want to see). CSS alone cannot block the ad without also hiding other posts, which would effectively break the website. Additionally, in cases where the website’s CSS class attributes are auto-generated, non-distinctive, and constantly changing, matching on CSS causes frequent breakage.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Procedural (as opposed to declarative) cosmetic filtering overcomes this by letting us describe how to target an element to hide. Procedural filtering lets us define conditions like “block list elements containing the text BUY THIS PRODUCT”. This allows for fine-grained matching on page elements: we can target elements containing specific words, meeting a minimum text length, or with a particular HTML ancestor. All in all, this significantly expands the kind of unwanted content we can block on the Web.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>As a reminder, Brave blocks third-party ads and trackers by default. We also offer an optional <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022806212-How-do-I-use-Shields-while-browsing#h_01HXSZ8JPGXHQV47D36QXBB3DV">Aggressive blocking mode</a> that blocks all ads, even <a>first-party</a>. We expect procedural filtering to be especially impactful in Aggressive mode.</p>
<p>Procedural filtering is a <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/16935">long-awaited feature</a> that was technically challenging to pull off in a performant way. We’re excited to have you see the benefits!</p>

 Progressing from free Beta network to fair usage and a market-ready Nym&nbsp;network <p>NymVPN is about to launch. This will be the first commercial application to run on the Nym network, taking the network from its current free and experimental phase to a fully fledged, market-ready, and secure traffic routing network for the age of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">NYM token buy-back</a> is currently trialing the mechanics of a perpetual buyback mechanism to be provided by NymVPN subscriptions.</p><p>To get there, Nym’s tokenomics will be going through some major upgrades over the next three months. This article provides an overview of upcoming changes to Nym tokenomics and contains important information for node operators, stakers, and those of you who have been following Nym’s evolution over the past couple of&nbsp;years.</p> Snapshot of changes to Nym tokenomics <p>Nym has so far been free to use and nodes have been bootstrapped with rewards from a mixmining pool. With the launch of NymVPN app the network is entering into paid phase and rewards will be correlated to actual network usage. How will this&nbsp;work?</p><p>User subscriptions will trigger NYM token buy-orders, which are then used to reward operators, stakers, and the Nym team for running and maintaining the network software, creating a flywheel effect that benefits the whole ecosystem. This closes the loop in the virtuous cycle of Nym token economics.</p><p>To get there, Nym token economics has to go through a series of changes, the first being “naive rewarding” to update the reward algorithm. This is scheduled to happen in the next 24 hours with the Magura&nbsp;release.</p><p>Stakers and operators have to take action to continue to earn rewards. Breaking changes to APIs can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4903">here</a>.</p><p>For a full presentation of the changes and what they mean for operators, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3G1pJqvO2VM?si=9QBbkfldnycyD0_C">watch the recent Node Operator Town&nbsp;Hall</a>.</p> Immediate changes: Naive rewarding <p>The Magura release will be happening in the next 24 hours. This is a major network release that will update Nym token economics and likely have effects on operator and staker&nbsp;rewards.</p> Effects for&nbsp;stakers <p>To maintain a high level of staking rewards and contribute to a performative network, we encourage all stakers&nbsp;to:</p>  Review the nodes to which you are staking at the end of the week to check if they have upgraded. We expect there to be a number of passive and outdated nodes which will be removed from the reward set, so check to make sure you are not delegating to a “dead”&nbsp;node!  If necessary, move your stake to new nodes that have upgraded, have a high performance and config score, and can serve the functions of both mix nodes and gateways.  We encourage stakers to support nodes in the Delegations program in particular as these have gone through a rigorous vetting process. Find the full list&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">here</a>.  If in doubt, ask in <a href="https://t.me/+ij-6sxGT6XM2ZTU6">community channels</a> to understand if a node&nbsp;*:    is running the latest&nbsp;software  has a good config&nbsp;score  has a good performance score  agreed to operator Terms &amp; Conditions  <p>* All nodes participating in the Nym Delegations Program meet these criteria, and all nodes delegated to by the Nym Treasury wallet are Delegations Program participants.</p> Effects for operators <p>Many of our more active operators will be well prepared for the upcoming changes already after having attended the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3G1pJqvO2VM?si=9QBbkfldnycyD0_C">Operator Town Hall</a> a couple of weeks&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Here is a summary of the main changes that will happen as part of the Magura&nbsp;release:</p>  The 2% emissions from the mixmining pool will now be distributed across 5 layers of active nodes rather than 3. This is to ensure that gateways are rewarded algorithmically rather than only via grants. The aim is to encourage more nodes to run in gateway mode and enable more gateway options for end-users.  Action: Completion of project smoosh requires that operators upgrade to run the Nym node binary. This means operators will be running a single binary for either gateway or mix node mode. Gateways will have to get stake for the first time in order to be selected to the active&nbsp;set.  A configuration score is now included in the node selection algorithm to determine if a node is included in the active set: Selection = config score * total stake * performance ^ 20. This is to cull any outdated nodes from the set and make sure the network is running up to date software.  All node operators will have to do smart contract migration from legacy modes to Nym Node to receive any rewards (to be done via Nym&nbsp;wallet).  Action: Operators have to agree to operator Terms &amp; Conditions to confirm legally that they do not gather logs on&nbsp;users.  <p>The effect of these changes are expected to be a more performant network and better spread of gateway options for users of the Nym network. And it is the next step towards the fully fledged virtuous cycle of Nym tokenomics!</p> Nym’s vision: Fair usage, fair&nbsp;rewards <p>The end goal of Nym token economics is to have a virtuous cycle flywheel in which increasing adoption leads to a scaling of the network and rewards. Currently, stakers and node operators are rewarded from the mixmining pool, which is bootstrapping rewards while the network is free to use. With the network entering a paid version, rewards can soon become tied to real world&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Fair usage and fair rewards simply means that users will be paying for network services and that payments will enter the node reward pool with a percentage going towards topping up operator and staker rewards. But there is a lot more happening under the hood to make sure&nbsp;that:</p>  nodes are rewarded based on actual usage of their&nbsp;services  measurement of actual usage does not deanonymize a&nbsp;user!  <p>The Nym R&amp;D and dev teams have been very busy this past year to flesh out this scheme, combining zero-knowledge cryptography, evolving the coconut credential scheme into “e-cash” and now finally the zk-nym credential scheme. Zk-nyms ensure that a user’s payment is entirely de-linked from their network usage. For a full breakdown of the virtuous cycle enabled by zk-nyms, read more&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5]">here</a>.</p><p>For stakers and operators, the end goal is to have a rapidly scalable network, with no limits on the number of gateways. Rewards will be based on tickets gathered by gateways andrepresenting real usage. Nodes will be multi-functional. They will continuously have the chance to earn dVPN rewards as both entry and exit gateways. And they will compete with each other every epoch for the chance to earn additional rewards by getting into the active set of the Nym’s noise generating mixnet as either gateways or mixnodes.</p> Preview of fair usage, fair rewarding  Timeline overview <p>Here’s a breakdown of what to expect from the Nym node roadmap each month into&nbsp;2025.</p> Mid-November   Release (Magura): The release will include gateways in the reward algorithm, with mixmining emissions divided across not just mixnodes, but also gateways. We expect this release to result in a slight decrease in mix node rewards due to more layers being rewarded, but with more chances for active set selection as old nodes will be&nbsp;removed.  Staker action: Review delegations and restake if necessary.  Operator action: Operators will at this point have to run up-to-date software, aka “smooshed” Nym nodes. They will also have to agree to operator T&amp;Cs in order to be selected for the active set. Configuration scores will become part of the selection algorithm: config score * total stake * performance ^20  Team action: Onboard service grantees to the Delegations Program.   End of&nbsp;November   Release (Crunch): The release will include an IPv6 listener for gateways and allow operators to run a node in all modes (entry, exit gateway, and mix node, with all exit gateway-enabled nodes also serving as dVPN&nbsp;nodes).  Operator action: Enable your Nym node to run in all&nbsp;modes.  Team action: A new service grants program will the expand number and coverage of gateways.   December   NymVPN early bird&nbsp;launch  New network explorer&nbsp;release  Staker action: Use the explorer to explore nodes and fine-tune your staking for maximum network performance and staker&nbsp;rewards.   2025   Release: Fair network usage, fair rewarding. This is the fully-fledged paid version of the network. Rewards will be based on tickets gathered from usage, with rewards matching real world network usage. The mixmining pool will continue to bootstrap rewards as usage&nbsp;grows.  <p>So if you’re a node operator: upgrade, review, restake, and get ready for the future of&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>And if you’re curious about Nym, sign up for NymVPN today for <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">a 30-day free&nbsp;trial</a>!</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Nym’s virtuous token cycle: Next step, Magura</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Picture this: a sudden knock on your door. Not just any knock, but one from law enforcement. No warning, no warrant. This was the shocking experience of a Session employee in late 2023. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) arrived unannounced at the home of an employee of the encrypted messaging app, a stark reminder of the potential erosion of privacy&nbsp;rights.</p><p>The police interrogation went beyond general questions about the app and company. They delved into the employee’s personal involvement with Session, specifically focusing on a particular user. Although the nature of the investigation remains shrouded in secrecy, the AFP acknowledged the use of Session by individuals involved in serious&nbsp;crimes.</p><p>Prior to this unexpected home visit, Session employees had already faced multiple contacts from the AFP and Victoria Police, including unsolicited messages, letters, and phone&nbsp;calls.</p><p>Session is an open-source decentralized messaging app. Developed in Australia in 2018, the platform prioritizes user privacy and operates under the motto “Send messages, not metadata.” Users are allowed to send anonymous messages using 66-character account IDs instead of traditional verification methods like email or phone&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>To enhance security, Session leverages a decentralized onion-routing network similar to Tor, ensuring that no single server can track the origin or destination of messages.</p><p>Following the incident, the messaging app announced its decision to leave Australia for Switzerland last month. The move was likely fueled by Australia’s July 2024 <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-07/Basic-Online-Safety-Expectations-regulatory-guidance-July-2024.pdf">amendments</a> to the Basic Online Safety Expectations. Under the new rules, online service providers are required to collect “a phone number, email address, or other identifier” when users create an&nbsp;account.</p> Is Privacy a&nbsp;Mirage? <p>While we may believe we are safeguarding our personal information, the truth is far more complex. Governments worldwide possess sophisticated tools to monitor online activity. From mass surveillance programs to targeted investigations, our digital footprints are constantly tracked and analyzed. Furthermore, tech giants amass vast amounts of personal data, often without explicit consent. This data is used to tailor advertisements, improve algorithms, and even influence our behavior. Cybercriminals can exploit system vulnerabilities to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, and medical&nbsp;records.</p><p>In my opinion, the notion of complete privacy in the digital age is a myth. While we can take steps to protect our information, such as using strong passwords, avoiding public Wi-Fi, and being mindful of what we share online, it’s clear that our digital lives are constantly under scrutiny.</p><p>PIVX.

<p>This is the thirtieth post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Stephen Heaps (Senior Software Engineer, iOS), Jacob Sikorski (iOS Privacy Engineer) and Agustín Ruiz (DesignOps Lead), and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (Lead for Privacy Engineering).</p>
<p>Starting with iOS version 1.71, Brave is rolling out a way to quickly delete browsing data that sites can use to identify you across visits. It’s called Shred.</p>



    


    



<p>Shred lets you instantly erase data a site might have stored on your device. Unlike similar features in other mobile browsers, Shred lets you delete data for a particular site with a single tap. This means you won’t be forcibly logged out of all your favorite websites every time you erase data, and you won’t have to maintain a list of site-by-site exceptions.</p>
<p>While other browsers are trying to catch up with Brave’s industry-leading protections against third-party tracking, few are talking about the risks of first-party tracking—that is, of websites tracking you across sessions. This kind of tracking allows sites to monitor how often you visit, limit access to content (e.g. with messages like “you have 5 articles left this month”), and share first-party data about you with their partners (e.g. via server-side tracking). Shred disrupts this kind of tracking by letting you clear site-specific data, and preventing companies from building detailed profiles or tracking your interactions with them over time.</p>

 How to use Shred 

 Shred data now 
<p>You can immediately Shred a site in three different ways:</p>
 
 Long-press the tabs button 
 Tap the Shred button in the tabs tray 
 Select the new Shred option in Shields 
 
<p>


    


    



      
      
    



    


    



      
      
    



    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Shred works on a per-site basis, since that is the privacy boundary for cookies and storage. When you Shred a site, all tabs open to that site are closed, and locally stored data for that site is erased.</p>

 Automatically shred 
<p>Auto Shred lets you automatically delete data for specific sites, so you don’t have to remember to clear data from specific sites. To do so:</p>
 
 Open Shields. 
 Tap Advanced Controls. 
 Tap Shred Site Data. 
 
<p>You can configure Auto Shred to happen when all tabs for a site are closed, or on browser restart. Auto Shredding on Site Tabs Closed means that whenever you close the last tab for a site, Brave will automatically Shred that site’s data.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>You can also set Auto Shred to happen for all sites:</p>
 
 Open Settings. 
 Tap Shields &amp; Privacy. 
 Tap Auto Shred.&nbsp; 
 



    


    



      
      
    
<p>The Auto Shred feature for iOS works like the <a>“Forget me when I close this site”</a> feature on Desktop and Android. When Shred becomes available on Desktop and Android, it will replace the “Forget me when I close this site” feature.</p>

 What data does Shred delete? 
<p>Shredding <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/blob/4bfe3aa4ee68cca47b8b0c2ea2714fdae6e038fb/ios/brave-ios/Sources/Brave/Frontend/Browser/TabManager.swift#L889-L935">deletes both data</a> explicitly stored by the site (e.g. cookies and local storage) and implicit data (e.g. network-related caches). To make sure Shred clears as much data as possible, Shred will also clear local data stored using so-called <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/26199">private WebKit APIs</a>.</p>

 Looking ahead 
<p>While Brave for iOS leads in privacy among iOS browsers, it still lags behind the privacy protections offered by Brave on Android and Desktop. Shredding clears virtually all site data but <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/41900">some limited types</a> of data are beyond our reach due to platform limitations imposed by Apple.</p>
<p>We’re working to bring the Shred feature to Android and Desktop for a consistent experience across platforms. We want our users to browse the Web safely and comfortably, free from intrusive ads and tracking, with privacy controls that work for them. Privacy should be easy by default—and maybe even fun.</p>

 Showcasing how Nym is more than a VPN to the&nbsp;world <p>It meant many overnight flights for the Nym core team, but we managed to do it all in one week: from DevCon in Bangkok to Web Summit in Lisbon, Nym showcased the upcoming launch of NymVPN and its underlying community and&nbsp;network.</p><p>The crowds couldn’t be more different, but the appeal was the same: the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/more-than-a-vpn">world needs something more than what traditional VPNs</a> are offering. We need more access to information, more control of our data, more privacy in what we do and who we communicate with&nbsp;online.</p><p>So here’s a roundup of what the Nym team has been doing to make all of that possible.</p> DevCon 2024 (Bangkok) <p>The Nym team was in full force at DevCon for what turned out to be a pretty incredible event. Here’s a look at what happened over four days of presentations and discussions.</p> Sunday: Digital sovereignty <p>Nym’s Simon Toth chaired a panel on “Decentralized data in a surveillance economy: A path to data sovereignty” at the Decentralized Data Summit&nbsp;2024.</p> Monday: Women In&nbsp;Tech <p>Yana Matrosova presented NymVPN on “Sovereign tools by Women in Web3Privacy” at Logos “Parallel Society” and moderated a panel on “Privacy with backdoors or without?” at Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress.</p><p>The opening talk was delivered by Harry Halpin and Chelsea Manning via&nbsp;video.</p> Tuesday: From the cypherpunks to the noise-generating mixnets <p>Harry Halpin delivered a Lightning Talk on “Why VPNs are a scam and what to do about it,” introducing Nym’s noise-generating mixnet as a novel solution to AI surveillance and data tracking. <a href="https://app.devcon.org/schedule/TRMC3L">Check out the&nbsp;video</a>.</p><p>Harry Halpin and Max Hampshire delivered the final talk at the Cypherpunk Congress on “The history and philosophy of cypherpunk,” with almost a 1000 people in attendance! It was truly an honor to speak to so many curious about the tradition at the foundation of Nym. Watch the <a href="https://app.devcon.org/schedule/8JVYCQ">full video&nbsp;here</a>!</p> Wednesday: Collective security <p>Yana Matrosova presented “NymVPN and the Nym Squad League” at Women In Web3Privacy “Privacy Tools” side event. Multiple topics were discussed, including decentralization, zk, privacy, and cypherpunk values. Every person needs to take care of their own privacy themselves, Yana argued, because no-one is coming to save&nbsp;us!</p><p>Max Hampshire gave a Lightning Talk on “From Packets to Privacy: Understanding and evolving network security.” You can watch the <a href="https://app.devcon.org/schedule/XYRFXT">full talk&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Web Summit 2024&nbsp;(Lisbon) <p>Harry and Chelsea hopped over to Portgual right away to attend Web&nbsp;Summit.</p> Panel discussion with Harry and&nbsp;Chelsea <p>Harry and Chlesea presented “More than a VPN: Defeating AI surveillance with Noise-Generating Mixnets” on a panel to show the architectural weaknesses of all existing VPNs and how NymVPN can do&nbsp;more.</p> Press conference: Protecting data against surveillance <p>Harry and Chelsea followed up with a press conference for journalists on what to expect for threats to privacy and protections after the US elections, especially with the rise of authoritarianisms and censorship to information worldwide.</p><p>The events season is coming to a close, but right before a big opening: NymVPN will be released next month with live payments! Stay tuned through Nym’s <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/weekly-progress-report-november-15-dev-update-7150dd1b9ff0">weekly dev updates</a> on the progress of the&nbsp;launch.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-from-east-to-west-devcon-and-web-summit-2024-fc0f5db20504">Nym from East to West: DevCon and Web Summit 2024</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Preparing for latest release of NymVPN and breaking network changes next&nbsp;week <p>The Nym team had big successes in showcasing NymVPN to the world at <a href="https://devcon.org/en/">DevCon</a> in Bangkok and <a href="https://websummit.com/">Web Summit</a> in Lisbon this week! And behind the scenes, the dev team has been buckling down to prepare the new network and app releases coming next week. Don’t forget, this is all in lead up to the two big&nbsp;things:</p>  December 2024: Early bird access to the robust NymVPN app with payments!  January 2025: The official launch of NymVPN to the world, at a symbolic time when it needs a real paradigm shift in online&nbsp;privacy  <p>Here’s the full <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nymvpn-roadmap-through-2024">timeline</a> for NymVPN finishing out 2024.

The next NymVPN app release is scheduled for Thursday, 21 November following the Magura network release on Monday, 18 November.</p> NymVPN in Apple&nbsp;Store <p>NymVPN is now <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">available in Apple&nbsp;Store</a>!</p> Network <p>The team has been steadfastly preparing for the latest Magura network release. This will include some breaking changes, so node operators take&nbsp;note!</p> Magura release coming&nbsp;Monday <p>The next network release “Magura” is scheduled for Monday, 18 November. This release will contain several breaking changes, including changes to the reward scheme to include gateways in the reward algorithm.</p> All operators must&nbsp;update! <p>All operators will need to run the latest Nym node binaries, enabling them to function in either mix node or gateway mode. On Monday, this will be v2024.13&nbsp;Magura.</p><p>All operators will also need to have agreed to the <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> in which they agree to not gather logs. Read more on <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nyms-zero-knowledge-network">Nym’s zero-knowledge network</a> design that takes trust out of the equation for&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order for the Nym network to meet clients needs, all nodes need to be up to scratch. Nodes that do not meet these two conditions will be removed from the&nbsp;network.</p> Changes to operator&nbsp;rewards <p>The Nym reward pool will be divided across five layers of nodes rather than three to include gateway functions in the reward algorithm.

The patch improves connection reliability between dVPN clients and gateways. It fixes timeouts on the authenticator registration so connections with gateways that have updated to this patch version should now be more&nbsp;stable.</p><p>Until next week comrades!

<p>PIVX Takes Flight on WEEX: Perpetual Contracts Now&nbsp;Live!</p><p>PIVX has announced the listing of its perpetual contract on WEEX. Buckle up PIVians, you can now 20x your positions on the PIVX-USDT pairs on a leading cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p>The listing, which happened on November 12, is already gaining significant traction on WEEX. The trading pair has seen a volume of nearly $500,000 in less than twelve hours after going&nbsp;live.</p><p>Unlike traditional futures contracts with a set expiry date, perpetual contracts are a type of derivative that allows you to speculate on the future price of an asset (in this case, PIVX) without a fixed settlement date. This means you can hold the position for as long as you want, making adjustments as market conditions change.</p> The Power of&nbsp;Leverage <p>Now, the exciting part is leverage. Perpetual contracts let you trade with borrowed capital, amplifying your potential gains (and losses). For example, with 5x leverage, a 10% move in the price of PIVX translates to a 50% gain (or loss) on your initial investment.</p> Caution: High Risk, High&nbsp;Reward <p>While leverage can magnify profits, it comes with a significant downside: magnified losses. If the market moves against you, your losses will be amplified by the leverage&nbsp;factor.</p> Trading PIVX with Leverage on&nbsp;WEEX <p>Ready to explore PIVX perpetual contracts on WEEX? Head over to <a href="https://www.weex.com/futures/PIVX-USDT">https://www.weex.com/futures/PIVX-USDT</a> to start trading. But remember, leverage trading carries high risk. Always proceed cautiously, understand the risks involved, and only trade with what you can afford to&nbsp;lose.</p><p>PIVX. Your Rights. Your Privacy. Your Choice.<br>To stay on top of PIVX news please visit PIVX.org and Discord.PIVX.org.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/pivx/pivx-takes-flight-on-weex-perpetual-contracts-now-live-f1ecb782a50d">PIVX Takes Flight on WEEX: Perpetual Contracts Now Live!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/pivx">PIVX</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Today, we’re excited to reveal the next phase of Shade Protocol’s growth: a roadmap for omnichain expansion that will bring our native stablecoin (SILK) and our Secure DeFi products to even more ecosystems across&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Shade Protocol launched in 2022 with a bold vision: build the most secure and inclusive on-chain economy. We’ve already achieved over $1B+ in trading volume across over 1 million trades, as well as millions of minted and circulating SILK. And we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>We are about to experience the most critical years for decentralized finance. And we believe Shade’s core pillars will make its products the most liquid and sustainable over the long&nbsp;term:</p>  Secure and Trustable: over 87% of consumers refuse to use online platforms if they believe their data may be at risk. The future of decentralized finance must be both secure and privacy-preserving in order to build a foundation of trust and lasting adoption.  Private and Auditable: regulatory frameworks continue to expand and mature. While they demand transparency for public goods, they also mandate privacy for individuals. Shade’s unique decryption primitives empower individuals to remain compliant while protecting their individual privacy and on-chain activity.  Stable and Diverse: as global volatility and connectivity continues to expand, the need for a diversified stablecoin — secured by SOV commodities such as bitcoin &amp; gold in addition to sovereign currencies — is obvious for both on-chain commerce and DeFi. SILK is uniquely positioned to solve this liquidity profile gap in the omnichain economy.  <p>In the post below, we’ll expand on these pillars, reveal what’s being built, and explain how you can join and participate in the Shade on-chain economy immediately.</p> Expanding Liquidity Across the Omnichain <p>On-chain economies are best measured by their liquidity. Because that liquidity can come from anywhere, Shade must be everywhere as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Shade Protocol already includes a number of products we consider to be “omnichain”, including SILK (which is fully collateralized by a basket of different omnichain assets, currencies, and commodities) and our yield-bearing liquid staking derivatives stkd-SCRT and dSHD. These liquid staking derivatives are highly capital efficient, making them attractive assets to spread across the omnichain.</p><p>In this new growth phase for Shade Protocol, we will continue to expand&nbsp;via:</p>  Expansion of outposts: by cross-deploying Shade protocol applications on more L1s and L2s — especially those with native security features like FHE, ZK, and MPC — we will expand access and unlock new primitives that build on our extensive experience developing secure DeFi applications.  Expansion of bridges: we will be expanding both our IBC connections and our bridge support for external ecosystems — including Solana and ETH L2s — in order to maximize access to both SHD and&nbsp;SILK.  Expansion of products: we will launch the ShadeX money market, driving additional steady demand for SILK. Additionally, we will pursue improvements to UX and connectivity to these products.  Expansion of SILK &amp; SHD on external liquidity venues: we will seek to support SILK &amp; SHD pools on as many L1s, L2s, and cross-chain protocols as possible, supporting the launch of money markets and collateralized stablecoin integrations.  Expansion of SILK FinTech integrations: a strong on-chain economy should support real world utility. More and more Fintech companies are entering into the onchain economy (such as Stripe). Demand for stablecoins to connect DeFi to daily commerce is an increasingly large use case. Part of our current FinTech expansion plans involves exploration of an acquisition / merger with a FinTech x DeFi&nbsp;product.   Instant Entry: Introducing “The&nbsp;Button” <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">The Button</a><p>One of the biggest challenges facing users of on-chain economies is simply knowing where to begin. How do you bridge into a new economy? How do you get support? How do you easily provide liquidity or mint&nbsp;assets?</p><p>If it isn’t dead simple to enter Shade’s on-chain economy, Shade won’t grow. If users can’t easily mint SILK or access products like the Shade DEX or money market, Shade won’t grow. That’s why UX has always been a huge focus in our ecosystem, which has powered our innovations around viewing keys and query permits as well as powerful analytics and auditing&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Now we are introducing a new innovation: <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">“The&nbsp;Button.”</a></p><p>The biggest complaint from prospective users who embrace Shade’s vision is that it is still too challenging to enter the on-chain economy. How do they get SHD and begin contributing to pools or minting SILK? How do they instantly become part of the community and movement?</p><p>When you hit The Button, users have the opportunity to buy SHD with zero slippage and 0 trading fees (minimum $1k size) with a 24 hour waiting period for claiming the&nbsp;SHD.</p><p>After using The Button, users will have the opportunity to join an exclusive chat with other Button&nbsp;users!</p><p>The following are supported assets of The&nbsp;Button:</p>  USDC.nbl  USDC.axl  wETH.axl  ATOM  SCRT  <p>We expect more assets to be added over&nbsp;time!</p><p>After a user presses The Button, the protocol re-routes the deposited purchase amount and buys SHD on ShadeSwap, ensuring that direct buy pressure is applied to SHD. The Button is a powerful feature that ensures that large buyers of SHD can enter without paying large amounts on slippage and trading&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Here’s the catch: The Button can only be pushed a limited number of times!<br> <br>There is currently only 20k SHD available for purchase for each of the above listed assets. That’s a limited amount of slippage-free liquidity.</p><p>This initial liquidity will not be refilled before November&nbsp;17.</p><p>Use The Button → <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade</a></p> SHD Yield Opportunities <p>After purchasing SHD using The Button, there are a variety of DeFi opportunities for SHD tokenholders to engage&nbsp;with:</p><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake</a><p>Stake your SHD with a 7 day unbonding period, empowering you to passively earn ~8% APY (instantly claimable yield). The more fees accrued on the Shade app, the higher the staking APY, yielding greater than 20% yield during peak activity&nbsp;weeks.</p><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/staking-derivatives/stake?input=secret153wu605vvp934xhd4k9dtd640zsep5jkesstdm">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/staking-derivatives/stake?input=secret153wu605vvp934xhd4k9dtd640zsep5jkesstdm</a><p>As an alternative to traditional SHD staking, you can also mint dSHD — an autocompounding SHD liquid staking token that empowers you to passively earn staking yield while also putting the LST to work in Shade DeFi and&nbsp;beyond.</p><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/pools">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/pools</a><p>Liquidity provide on the SILK/SHD pool, earning ~21.4% APR in SHD rewards for staking your liquidity token. The dSHD / USDC.nbl pool is currently yielding 110%, another excellent opportunity to put your SHD to&nbsp;work.</p> Shade &lt;&gt; Fintech&nbsp;Thesis <p>Permissionless and cheap transfer of stablecoins directly into commerce is a massive growing market for crypto. This market is <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/emerging-payments/cbdcs-stablecoins-research-report/">projected to grow by 612%</a> by&nbsp;2031.</p><p>For nearly a decade, crypto yield was sequestered and isolated from real world purchases — forcing users to bridge back to crypto exchanges, back to banks, to finally be able to make purchases “using” crypto. This UX was fractured, expensive, and not Web3&nbsp;native.</p><p>We believe that Shade is uniquely positioned with both its privacy posture and SILK to aggressively integrate with payment rails to drive the adoption of Shade’s products. Users from around the world are in desperate need of a diversified reserve currency (i.e. SILK) to reduce their sovereign currency&nbsp;risk.</p> So Why Shade? Why&nbsp;SILK? <p>There are many on-chain economies today. In the coming years, we project there to be countless more. The key question is: which ones will be sustainable, and which ones can truly create lasting value for end&nbsp;users?</p><p>We already mentioned the core pillars that underlie development work for Shade: secure and trustable, private and auditable, stable and diverse. All of these pillars support sustainability.</p><p>One of our scarcer beliefs — compared to other on-chain economies — is our belief in data security. True adoption of DeFi hinges on robust data security measures. To attract billions in liquidity, both institutions and individuals will expect their onchain positions and asset movements to be encrypted by default, but auditable as needed. At Shade, we believe that in the near future the total transparency of blockchain will be looked at with suspicion in the same way that a lack of data security would be viewed within our traditional financial markets.</p><p>Another belief we have is in innovation through diversity. This doesn’t just mean a diversity of products built for a diverse set of global users. It also informs the approach behind SILK and its diversified collateral base. As on-chain economies grow, we all benefit from more experimentation with different compositions and use cases for stablecoins. We see tremendous synergies between SILK, dollar-backed stablecoins, other sovereign stablecoins, and commodities like BTC and&nbsp;metals.</p><p>Our mission is to integrate all of these beliefs into a seamless, omnichain economy that is secured by diverse assets and that powers off-chain and on-chain global commerce. While we are incredibly early in this mission, the years we’ve already spent developing these protocols, economic approaches, and beliefs gives us confidence that the Shade community is better positioned than any other to work towards and achieve this&nbsp;goal.</p><p>We have many announcements, partnerships, and products yet to be revealed, but if our mission and approach excite you, today the ask is simple: join&nbsp;us.</p><p>Join the Shade community: <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p><p>Hit The Button: <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade</a></p>

  Building the Future: Meet the 2024 Sequoia Open Source Fellows  <p>From one celebrated UC Berkeley lab come two groundbreaking projects: vLLM and Chatbot Arena.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published November 11, 2024
  



 
<p>It was the summer of 2022, and a team of Ph.D. researchers in UC Berkeley’s newly launched Sky Computing Lab had a problem. They’d been working to make large deep-learning models more efficient, by distributing work across GPUs. But when they set up a demo of their new framework, performance was an immediate—and serious—issue.</p>



<p>“It was ridiculously slow,” remembers Zhuohan Li, a member of the project team and a veteran of RISElab, the renowned Sky Lab predecessor that had birthed Databricks and Anyscale. “We realized memory management was going to be a big bottleneck for serving these models—and we wanted to take a deeper look.”</p>



<p>So over the next couple of months, Li and fellow researcher Woosuk Kwon dug in, and eventually developed a promising algorithm inspired by classical virtual memory and paging techniques that they dubbed “PagedAttention.” Then on November 30, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Interest in LLMs, and in their project, exploded.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a flood of new models was coming from tech companies and research institutions, each of them needing to run on increasingly scarce GPUs—and Li and Kwon’s idea could be the unlock that made that easy. Eventually, they teamed up with labmate and former Anyscale engineer Simon Mo to host the first meetup for their open-source project, now known as <a href="https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html">vLLM</a>.</p>



vLLM contributors Woosuk Kwon, Zhuohan Li and Simon Mo.



<p>“I’d been increasingly excited about it, but after that meetup, I was even more excited,” Mo said. “Everybody had so many questions, so much enthusiasm.” It was an early illustration of a principle that Sky Lab leader and Databricks co-founder Ion Stoica had long impressed upon his advisees: community is key.</p>



<p>“An open source project is not just about the code,” Stoica says. “In every one I’ve been part of, building a strong community was extremely important to success.”</p>



 



<p>Among vLLM’s earliest adopters was a new model called Vicuna, from another group of researchers within the Sky Lab—including Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Hao Zhang and Wei-Lin Chiang, and advised by Stoica and Joseph Gonzalez. Chiang had previously collaborated with Kwon on SkyPilot, a framework for running LLMs, AI and batch jobs in the cloud. But since the release of ChatGPT he, too, had shifted focus, fascinated by the possibility of building an open-source LLM.</p>



<p>The result, Vicuna, had launched in March 2023. It was based on Meta’s LLaMA, but with an innovative twist: the researchers had trained it in part on data from ShareGPT, a Chrome plug-in for sharing ChatGPT conversations, making it particularly useful for chatbot applications.</p>



<p>“It started out as just a fun project, and we were surprised to see how well it worked,” Chiang says. “We wanted to share it with everyone.” The group quickly bought a domain, lmsys.org, where they could publish a blog post and run a demo of their new chatbot. Within two weeks, they had millions of visitors—but with the excitement came criticism, as well.</p>



<p>“People questioned the idea that our model was actually better, and as researchers, we wanted a scientific way to convince them,” Chiang recalls. “How do you actually evaluate between models?”</p>



<p>At a time when new LLM releases were coming out on a weekly if not daily basis, it was a critical question not just for Vicuna, but for anyone building—or building on top of—a model. To help answer it, Zheng, Sheng, Chiang and their teammates enlisted yet another fellow Berkeley researcher: theoretical statistician Anastasios Angelopoulos.<br>“The fundamental problems attracted me, and it was very clearly important—the impact was there,” Angelopoulos remembers. As the group explored what a platform for benchmarking and evaluation could look like, he worked to add statistical rigor. In May, they launched their new project, <a href="https://lmarena.ai/">Chatbot Arena</a>, where users could compare Vicuna alongside other open models—and in May, they rolled out a live leaderboard, with rankings informed by crowdsourced preference data, from real users putting the models to work.</p>



Angelopoulos, Chiang, Stoica and the Chatbot Arena team.



<p>Today, Chatbot Arena is the de facto standard for evaluating model performance, with more than one million monthly users—and every time a new model comes out, industry leaders including Sam Altman, Jeff Dean and others point to their evaluations on Chatbot Arena. Almost all major model providers—including OpenAI, Google, Meta and xAI—periodically share variants of models with the Chatbot Arena team before they’re released, so the data can inform their development processes.</p>



<p>Like their colleagues building vLLM, Chiang and Angelopoulos credit the lab’s emphasis on community for much of their project’s success. “Since I’ve been involved, it’s been a continual effort to keep building that trust,” Angelopoulos says. Earlier this year, the Chatbot Arena team published policy documentation outlining their methodology—and their motivations. Because the project does not monetize its data, instead relying on free credits and donations, “we knew people might be skeptical about our incentives,” Angelopoulos acknowledges. “So we wanted to be very clear that our only incentive is to do the best possible science. We just want the truth.”</p>



 



<p>The vLLM community, meanwhile, has been navigating its own rapid growth. Since releasing its open-source library in June 2023, it’s racked up an impressive 28,000 stars on GitHub, and is used by developers in many top tech companies. This year, Nvidia, AWS, Cloudflare and the gaming company Roblox—which uses vLLM for translation and child safety monitoring—have all hosted meetups. “Whenever we find out that an app I already have on my iPhone is powered by vLLM, that’s very rewarding,” says Kwon. “The more we meet real users, the more confident we are that we are doing something right.”</p>



<p>But as for any successful open-source project, growth has been a double-edged sword; each new model or hardware release requires a time-consuming—and expensive—sprint by Li, Kwon, Mo and vLLM contributors. “Quality is absolutely critical to this project’s success, so we need robust testing for every change—especially with this many people contributing,” Mo says. At $10 per test, across a variety of GPUs, academic funding and even grants and donations quickly become unsustainable.</p>



<p>In fact, Stoica says, funding pressure on open source projects is “at least an order of magnitude higher” in the age of LLMs. “You have multiple kinds of GPUs, you have all of these other accelerators. And there’s also a difference in scale,” he explains. “10 years ago, most of the funding for a new startup would go to adding people. Today, it’s going to infrastructure.”</p>



<p>But this, again, is where community comes in. Sequoia partner Lauren Reeder says by the spring of 2024, she’d heard from multiple portfolio companies singing the praises of vLLM—it was saving their engineering teams a lot of time and effort. So Reeder reached out on X, and Mo invited her to visit the lab.</p>



<p>“I met Simon, Woosuk and Zhuohan, and they explained some of the dynamics around testing and cost, and the community. That’s what stood out to me most—a lot of open source projects are run by one person, kind of carrying the world on their shoulders,” she says. “But this was absolutely community-run, with nearly 80% of the contributions coming from outside the lab.”</p>



<p>The previous year, Reeder and fellow partner Bogomil Balkansky had headed up the launch of Sequoia’s <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/oss">Open-Source Fellowship</a>. There were no strings attached, and no expectation of starting a business—just support for projects that were key to the success of the firm’s portfolio and many other companies. Reeder thought vLLM was a perfect fit, and Li, Kwon and Mo became Sequoia open-source fellows.</p>



 



<p>The Chatbot Arena team, too, has navigated their projects’ popularity with duct tape and sheer force of will. While free credits paid for the LLM calls and hosting, the team desperately needed help with technical tasks, such as updating the Chatbot Arena UI to work with multi-modal models. Their work often kept them up until 4 a.m.; “we simply didn’t have enough hands on deck,” Angelopoulos says. But they were hesitant to take any support beyond free credits from model providers, for fear of jeopardizing their independence.</p>



<p>Once again, word of mouth reached Reeder, who now knew the dense talent in Sky Lab firsthand—and had seen founders repeatedly refer to Chatbot Arena as their litmus test for choosing between models. She, Balkansky and the rest of Sequoia’s partners were open to adding a second fellowship for 2024, and after a call for applications, had hundreds to choose from. But Chiang and Angelopoulos stood out.</p>



<p>“The fact that Chatbot Arena was committed to being fundamentally neutral was actually really important to us,” she says. “Versus other projects that may be widely used but have more commercial incentives, we felt like with this one, our support could really have an impact.”</p>



<p>Chiang and Angelopoulos became fellows in August, and say the funding has indeed freed them up to check crucial to-dos off their list. As always, they’re taking a user-first approach to using their newfound resources: through a recent partnership with a red-teaming community, for example, they’re exploring the relationship between controllability and potential safety concerns across different models.</p>



<p>Li, Kwon and Mo, too, have quickly put Sequoia’s support to use on their CI bills, and are currently rearchitecting vLLM to reduce and prevent the technical debt that often plagues fast-growing systems. Their primary goals, Mo says, remain usability and performance: “We want to build the easiest to use, most efficient, fastest inference engine in the world.” And their community is stepping up in kind; while 90% of contributions came from Berkeley as recently as last fall, that number is now just 25%.</p>



<p>For vLLM and Chatbot Arena alike, the rise of multimodal models looms large, as both teams undertake updates to accommodate images, video and code. Chiang and Angelopoulos recently partnered with Wayne Chi and Valerie Chen at Carnegie Mellon University, who built a VSCode extension called Copilot Arena that allows users to tab back and forth between completion models—and allows the platform to collect preference data about which models are best on coding auto-completion tasks. “That’s something we know the community cares a lot about,” says Angelopoulos. “We think it could be huge.”</p>



<p>Reeder says the progress vLLM and Chatbot Arena have made is just the beginning—for the projects, but also from the open source community at large. “Something we’ve noticed this year is that much of the innovation on the infrastructure stack is coming from open source—that’s one of the reasons we decided to expand the fellowship,” she says. “These projects have the support of the community. Everyone is jumping in and trying to help, in a way we haven’t seen in a long time.</p>



<p>“We’re excited to see how they continue pushing things forward. Open source is really building the future.”</p>

Protocols love using points methodology as they get TVL stat boosts and usage boosts on their protocol (short term) without needing to immediately pay users for these capital commitments / sacrifices. Users have been willing to take these risks, as long as the methodology will reward them for their efforts. Some protocols have tried to reward both social engagement and capital engagement. But inevitably, the cost of capital is significantly higher than the cost of rewarding engagement — creating an imbalance that leaves engagement focused users on an island, their activity feeling undervalued compared to large tokenholders.</p><p>Anyone can like or retweet or interact with a telegram chat. These small gestures are sacrifices of focus and energy (still a cost, but a distinctly different kind of cost from capital). We believe these engaged offchain users have been grossly undervalued within protocol reward mechanisms.</p><p>Our theory of engagement is focused on giving rewards that push community status as a meaningful form of reward comboed with direct financial reward. Too much of reliance on one type of reward without the other makes the community either too financial in nature or potentially too disincentivized to elicit meaningful outcomes.</p><p>Naturally, both strong social ties and ethos can help boost the strength and meaningfulness of participating in a community, but the fundamental building blocks of a crypto community is the balance between social ties and financial incentive.</p><p>Point ecosystems (unfortunately) are almost purely financial by nature, hurting the odds of creating a truly sticky social community. The inability of point programs tied to capital commitments to generate sticky community makes perfect sense because the scale of sacrifice and scale of rewards is so large that the value derived by being part of the community is so far downstream that the social ties are not sticky enough (nor earned enough) to retain these mercenary users.</p><p>eSHD takes an alternative approach — attempting to value the engaged community members, regardless of their SHD holdings.</p><p>We want want to attempt this experiment of eSHD to see how far we can push the limits of a social token (that has real value) who’s supply comes into circulation purely via engagement. In this model, dilution of eSHD tokenholders is in favor of those who engage most recently.</p> Who We&nbsp;Are <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-spartan-ethos-introduction-7b37b3df160d">Meet The&nbsp;Spartans</a><p>The origin of the Shade Spartans and eSHD tokenholders is a simple tale — to be a staunch advocate of privacy and freedom inevitably puts you in the crosshairs of those who see our claims to digital sovereignty as a threat to their power. There are those who believe people must be protected at every turn. That security should be prioritized above the human experiment of individualism and experimentation. The powers at be are leaving an entire generation chained to the burden of malicious (not all) regulation. Disdainful pen &amp; paper, stale and unromantic. Uninspired dead documents that stifle human ingenuity, and at worse, diminish&nbsp;it.</p><p>We Spartans.</p><p>We few, we chose&nbsp;few.</p><p>Pushed to the brink, night near&nbsp;extinct.</p><p>In the arena of the digital and physical world we lay it all on the line. We deeply value our dignity. We stake our future on the truth that there is no greater love than this: that a Shade Spartan would lay his security and freedom on the line to protect the future rights of his&nbsp;enemies.</p><p>You see, Spartans fight for the rights of those who oppress us. We fight to remove the chains from those that seek to place us in&nbsp;chains.</p><p>This is what it takes to be a city on a hill — a light in the darkness.</p><p>This is what it takes to have the moral high&nbsp;ground.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-spartan-ethos-introduction-7b37b3df160d">https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-spartan-ethos-introduction-7b37b3df160d</a></blockquote> Summary <p>Be part of the revolution with Shade Protocol’s newest initiative, the eSHD engagement token.
