			 WXX (BEP20) Crowd Sale with Reward Incentive Program 		 
				 
				 
				 
							 Objective <p>Starting Monday, December 16th(1pm PDT/8pm UTC), to encourage early participation in the launch of the WXX (BEP20) token<br>(contract address: <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x0109d6994093539245Aa820B9c98405b0648f0B4">https://bscscan.com/token/0x0109d6994093539245Aa820B9c98405b0648f0B4</a>) on the <a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">CrowdSwap Website</a>, the xx Foundation is creating an xx rewards program that will reward participants that purchase WXX(BEP20) in the “Crowd Sale” pool on crowdswap.org.</p><p>Proceeds from the sales pool will only be used to create&nbsp; liquidity pools, first on CrowdSwap and then later on Pancake Swap.</p><p>At the end of the “Crowd Sale” campaign, participants will be able to connect multichain wallets, such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, etc, through a secure web-based app that the xx Foundation will produce. Using this app, participants can submit their native XX addresses and verify their purchased WXX(BEP20) balances by signing a message in the webapp.&nbsp;</p><p>Verified participants will receive Incentive Award XX coins directly in their registered native XX accounts.</p><p>The sales pool will consist of 2,000,000 WXX (BEP20). The reward incentive program will allocate 1 million XX coins for the rewards distribution pool.&nbsp;</p><p>Note: To ensure compliance, the program is not available to U.S.-based participants.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Detailed Program Terms 		 
				 
				 
				 
							 1. Purchase WXX (BEP20) Tokens via CrowdSwap “Crowd Sale” web application. 
 
 Platform Access: Users will access the Crowd Sale via (<a href="https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity">https://app.crowdswap.org/opportunity</a>), where they will see the WXX(BEP20) Crowd Sale opportunity. Any major cryptocurrencies may be used to purchase WXX via Crowdswap’s built in swapping mechanism. Proceeds will convert to USDT via the Crowdswap platform. 
 Native XX Account Address Submission: Before users can receive any of the XX incentive rewards they will also be required to submit their XX account address (non-exchange) or create a new one if they don’t already have one. This will be done via a web application being created by the xx Foundation development team.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Note: Access link to the verification web app is TBA prior to the end of the crowdsale (Feb 14th 2025).</p>
 2. Web-based Wallet Verification<br> Once available, participants will use the verification web app in this way: 
 
 Connection: Users will connect their wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) to the web app. It will detect and confirm the account used to purchase WXX (BEP20) on CrowdSwap. 
 Verification: Participants will sign a message from their wallet, allowing the platform to verify their WXX balance on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and how long it was held. This signed message verifies eligibility without relying on a centralized tracking system. 
 Incentive&nbsp; Reward Eligibility: Verified balances will determine the user’s eligibility for a reward of XX coins into their native xx account, based on a tiered reward system linked to their WXX purchase amounts. 
 
 3. Incentive Award Holding Period Requirement 
 
 Holding Period: Participants must hold their purchased WXX (BEP20) tokens in their account for 28 days to qualify for the incentive reward. 
 Verification: The 28-day holding period will be confirmed via a signed wallet message, ensuring manual or automated verification of the balance. 
 
 4. Reward Pool Distribution 
 
 Total Reward Pool: 1 million native XX tokens will be allocated for the reward incentive. 
 Dynamic Tiered Reward Structure:
 
 Base Incentive Award: 5% 
 Incremental Incentive Award: Increases by 0.1% per 1,000 WXX purchased, capped at 20% for purchases of 150,000 WXX or more. 
 Example:
 
 1,000 WXX: 5.10% Incentive Award 
 5,000 WXX: 5.50% Incentive Award 
 50,000 WXX: 10.00% Incentive Award 
 150,000 WXX or more: 20% Incentive Award (capped) 
 
 
 
 
 
 5. Volume-Based Multiplier Incentive 
 
 Full Purchase Incentive Award: If the 2 million WXX pool is fully sold, all participants will receive an additional 1.4x multiplier on their original Incentive Award. 
 Example After Multiplier:
 
 5,000 WXX Purchase: Original Incentive Award of 5.50%, increased to 7.7% with the multiplier. 
 50,000 WXX Purchase: Original Incentive Award of 10%, increased to 14% with the multiplier. 
 
 
 
 6. Lockup and Vesting Period for Incentive Awards 
 
 Initial Lockup: All rewards will be subject to a 9-month lockup period, during which the coins cannot be transferred or sold. 
 Vesting Options for Additional Incentive Awards:
 
 Participants can also choose from three linear vesting periods to commence once the initial 9 month lock expires:
 
 3-month vesting: Additional 5% Incentive Award 
 6-month vesting: Additional 10% Incentive Award 
 12-month vesting: Additional 20% Incentive Award 
 
 
 Example: A participant with an initial 5,000 XX Incentive Award choosing a 12-month vesting period will receive an additional 1,000 XX coins spread over the vesting period. 
 
 
 
 7. Automatic Reward Distribution 
 
 Post Verification: After the 28-day holding period and verification via the web app, eligible participants will receive their XX coin Incentive Awards directly into their native XX accounts. Reward distribution will occur randomly within 1–2 weeks, adding an additional layer of privacy and preventing predictability in token transfers. 
 
 8. Privacy Protection via xx Network 
 
 Privacy Measures: All user interactions with the web app—including wallet connections and message signatures—will be routed through the xx network using xxRPC. This ensures that personal metadata remains private and secure. 
 						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Legal Disclaimer 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Participants should be aware that the xx rewards may be subject to taxation, depending on local regulations. The xx Foundation recommends that participants consult a tax advisor to understand any tax obligations associated with receiving XX coins. This program does not constitute investment advice, nor does it guarantee any specific return or profit.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Excluded Participants 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>To comply with applicable securities regulations and international law, participation in the program will not be open to all. Access to the program webpage and web app will be restricted for users located in the United States, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, United States Minor Outlying Islands, Virgin Islands, North Korea, Cuba, and Iran.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Summary of Participant Steps
 		 
				 
				 
				 
							 
 Purchase WXX on CrowdSwap: Participants acquire WXX (BEP20) tokens through the CrowdSwap “Crowd Sale” pool. 
 Hold Tokens for 28 Days: WXX tokens must remain in the participant’s account for 28 days, once received, to qualify for incentive rewards. 
 Connect Wallet and Submit Native XX Account Address: Participants connect to the web app, submit their native XX account address, and sign a message to verify their WXX balance. 
 Choose Vesting Period: After the 9-month lockup, participants will select a vesting schedule to receive additional Incentive Awards. 
 Receive Rewards: Verified XX coin Incentive Awards are distributed automatically to participants’ native XX accounts after the program concludes.

       Ask Not Wen Moon–Ask Why Moon         
	By Michelle Bailhe	 



Published December 12, 2024
        Why crypto/web3 is happening and why it matters.       



 
<p>2021 was a banner year for crypto: hundreds of projects launched, thousands of new developers and over 100m new users <a href="https://crypto.com/images/202107_DataReport_OnChain_Market_Sizing.pdf">entered the space</a>, total crypto market cap increased by <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">a trillion USD</a>, DeFi total value locked 4x’d to <a href="https://defillama.com/">~$250B</a>, NFT sales <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/03/18/figma-ceo-dylan-field-talks-cryptopunks-nft-beeple-metaverse/?sh=78454c865a1d">broke records</a> and garnered an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrNOYudaMAc">SNL feature</a>, pleasrDAO <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html">rescued the Wu Tang Clan</a> album, <a href="https://www.constitutiondao.com/">ConstitutionDAO</a> almost bought the constitution, and more.</p>



<p>Yet, we still hear the same questions from people new to the space: WTH is happening in crypto? Is it a currency or investment or a new internet? What are the hot new tokens and NFTs? Wen Moon?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The better question is actually: Why Moon? Why is crypto/web3 happening? Why now? Beyond the token market caps that tend to put $$ in people’s eyes, why does it matter?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While arguably a Sisyphean task, we tried to answer these questions in a few pages. This will feel simplistic to anyone deep in the space, but our hope is that by providing a broad overview of crypto in its historical context and a decent mental model for the ecosystem, more people—users, developers, operators, and founders—will dive in. We also hope it sheds some light on why Sequoia has conviction that crypto is one of the most important platform shifts of our time.</p>



 Why crypto is happening and why it matters (the 30,000 foot view) 



<p>Money is about trust. Many people on our planet enjoy trust in their money and financial systems. We trust our central banks not to devalue our currency overnight. We trust our governments to avoid hyperinflation so our money retains purchasing power. We trust banks to secure our money and not loan it recklessly, and private companies to help us safely use our money for commerce and other financial services. We pay for the privilege of this trust in taxes and fees to financial services companies (a multi-trillion dollar industry).&nbsp; This foundation of trust has been an essential bedrock of our economic progress over the last few centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, many do not enjoy this level of trust in their financial systems, if they can access them at all. This is true even in some of the most prosperous and populous countries. Recent events, especially the Great Financial Crisis of ‘08-09, eroded trust even in the US. Global monetary stimulus in response to COVID has many questioning again whether their trust is well‐placed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is unlikely a coincidence that the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper </a>which ignited the crypto industry was published October 31, 2008, just six weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed in the Great Financial Crisis. Titled “Bitcoin: A Peer‐to‐Peer Electronic Cash System,” it described the solution to a holy‐grail problem in cryptography: using a distributed network to validate the authenticity of a digital file. This introduced a new phenomenon on the Internet: verifiable scarcity, and enabled the direct transfer of value online without intermediaries. To exchange Bitcoin, all we need is internet access and trust in Bitcoin’s open source code. Just as billions now trust the Internet for the global free exchange of information, <a href="https://crypto.com/images/202107_DataReport_OnChain_Market_Sizing.pdf">220M</a> and counting now trust a blockchain for the global free exchange of value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Viewed in historical context, “internet money” can be seen as a natural evolution of our financial system. The history of money is a story of progressive abstraction for the sake of convenience (barter economy to metal coins to paper money etc.) Today, most of the money flying around the world is already digital, and we true up the paper as an afterthought as we once did with gold. But we pay a great cost for the inefficiencies of this analog system with its fragmented jurisdictions, myriad intermediaries, and long settlement delays. Why wouldn’t we move to internet-native money movement rails? Isn’t this the next step in a journey arguably started by <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/paypal/">PayPal</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/stripe/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/companies/square/">Square</a> and others?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While it seems Bitcoin was intended to solve a payments problem, inventions rarely go as their inventors planned. As demand for Bitcoin grew, its price and transaction fees increased, making it more useful for many as an investment vehicle (or store of value) than a payment mechanism (medium of exchange). Most interestingly, new inventors built on the concepts of Bitcoin in new ways. Ethereum’s contribution was using a distributed ledger not just for currency but for computation.</p>



<p>Blockchains as decentralized computing platforms captured developers’ imaginations. Their aims are wide‐ranging but can be roughly characterized as trying to bring about better money and a better internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Better money: money free from arbitrary monetary policy, censorship and surveillance, and financial systems that are more trustworthy, accessible, efficient and cheaper&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Better internet: applications in which users own their data, rather than rent access from a given platform, creators are better rewarded, and communities govern them; digital goods (NFTs) that are more liquid, portable across platforms, better suited to manage digital rights 
 



<p>While these are the goals, we still have a long way to go. Some point to crypto’s shortcomings as evidence the entire effort is a scam, but this misses the point. Historically, when technological innovation has led to financial innovation ahead of regulation, we have seen world-changing innovation, then mania, fraud, a crash, a regulatory framework and then a slow build toward lasting value (see: early stock markets of 1600s Amsterdam). Crypto appears no different. There are tokens of dubious quality. There are pockets of over-hype. But as with all other technology revolutions, there will also be enduring companies created in this time.</p>



 The Great Transformation 



<p>Crypto will transform value on the Internet, and in doing so, the Internet itself. Blockchains will rewrite the way we own, sell, buy, trade, exchange and reward. As software saturates our world, crypto (software money) will saturate money—and everything we do with it. Blockchain’s inherent properties—instant value transfer, verifiable scarcity, and user‐ownership—could restructure trillions of market cap across payments, finance, gaming, content, social networks and more.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Digital currencies are fundamentally useful to 220M people and counting, whether as capped‐supply inflation hedges, censorship‐resistant stores of value, borderless mediums of exchange and/or investment vehicles. This has created a new asset class.&nbsp; 



 This new asset class is creating a market for financial services, both centralized and decentralized (DeFi). As with any asset class, owners want to be able to buy, hold, sell, trade, lend, hedge, swap, fractionalize, insure and more. With crypto, they also want to do it freely across borders and time zones, 24/7. This is likely to be expansionary to current financial systems, creating more consumer choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 The rise of crypto necessitates a new crypto stack. From core infrastructure to developer tools, some of the traditional stack will translate and some won’t. Custody, nodes, fiat&lt;&gt;crypto on/off ramps and both on and off-chain data are just a few areas of the emerging crypto stack. In this era, value may accrue to new layers. In traditional software, more value accrued to the application layer (Google ~$2T market cap, TCP/IP/SMTP arguably $0) whereas in crypto, core protocols are monetizable via tokens (BTC+ETH ~$2T market cap vs. crypto apps ~$200B so far).&nbsp; 



 Blockchains enable more than digital assets—they also enable digital goods (NFTs) and decentralized applications (web3). While these areas are exploding in trading volumes, user interest and developer energy, they are still in their earliest innings. Web3 holds tremendous potential to use blockchains to reshape internet services around principles of user ownership, creator rewards, and community governance (e.g., DAOs).&nbsp; 



 However, regulatory frameworks are still being clarified, so founders will need to thoughtfully navigate uncharted waters.&nbsp; 
 



 Mental Model for Crypto&nbsp; 



<p>It can be helpful to organize crypto along two dimensions: space and time.</p>



<p>Space: Below is a map of the crypto ecosystem. It’s organized like a typical stack from hardware at the bottom to applications at the top, with the infrastructure to build and access it on the right. Before you get out your pitchforks, we know this is imperfect. Crypto doesn’t fit neatly into little boxes. Many of these categories overlap and crypto is constantly changing. But, it’s not a terrible starting point. We welcome input from the community.&nbsp;</p>
 







 
<p>We’ll share our deep dives into each of these areas in future posts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Time: Here is a framework for when certain areas of opportunity may mature, inspired by a typical new technology adoption S-curve. This is again imperfect—building is happening simultaneously, phases are overlapping and interact in feedback loops. This is also not a replay of every local maxima and minima over the past decade. Instead, this is an attempt to zoom way out and imagine how we might move from millions to billions of crypto users.</p>



 
 Phase 1: Isolation. Crypto as an island, disconnected from the non‐crypto world. Core protocols are built out (think TCP/IP for internet, and layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana for crypto). Protocols are inextricable from their native coins. A variety of coins creates demand for exchanges and additional financial services. Most incumbents lack the tech and regulatory appetite to serve this demand, allowing crypto‐natives to fill the void. Crypto‐native analogs of every financial service arise roughly in their historical order: currency, foreign exchange, lending, derivatives, insurance, options, ETFs, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Phase 2: Connectivity. Bridging the crypto and non‐crypto worlds. The non‐crypto world sees value in crypto and builds/buys the infrastructure to access it. Custody/wallets, crypto&lt;&gt;fiat on/off ramps, data feeds, blockchain‐specific infrastructure and developer tools grow exponentially in this time. New use cases from NFT art communities to gaming to web3 social networks draw in new users. As the mass-market starts to engage in crypto, competitive pressure dramatically simplifies the user experience and lowers barriers to access. The number of users and developers with access to crypto increases by 10-100x over this next decade. We’d argue we are just starting Phase 2. 
 



 
 Phase 3: Maturation. Fusion of crypto and non‐crypto worlds so they are no longer distinct. Like mobile, once crypto access is sufficiently ubiquitous, applications will have the foundation they need to reach their full potential. They will cross the chasm from crypto‐niche to commonplace. To be clear, founders are already building across consumer finance, DeFi, NFT, web3 and more, but only a few hundred million people and institutions have the tools to access them. As access spreads, applications will see an order of magnitude increase in user engagement.&nbsp; 
 



 Looking Forward 



<p>Crypto is still in its early innings. Though it is rife with volatility, it’s also ripe with innovation. To dismiss crypto as purely speculative is to ignore the history that every financial innovation has had its misusers and to miss the tremendous potential crypto holds to create better financial systems. To dismiss crypto as too slow, expensive, or confusing to ever be useful is like dismissing the Internet in its dial-up phase. While criticisms of crypto’s user experience, cost, speed or environmental impact are all valid, these aren’t doomsday signals for the movement—they are opportunities to build. The bottom line is: billions of people want a better financial system and a better internet and a new generation of developers is motivated to build that for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In early November 2023, hundreds of developers from around the world filed into an auditorium in the heart of downtown San Francisco. It was OpenAI’s inaugural DevDay, an event where—à la WWDC—the company would preview its latest technology and discuss the future of AI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the keynote address, Romain Huet, head of developer experience at OpenAI, took the stage to introduce the company’s latest tool: a voice-enabled intelligent assistant. To pull back the curtain on the assistant’s underlying function calls, Huet pulled up his terminal log.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The terminal, an interface for using text commands to interact directly with a computer, is a 50-year-old staple of software engineering, beloved for its precision and efficiency while simultaneously hated for its extreme user-unfriendliness. Most people recognize the terminal from movies: a bare-bones user interface with a black screen and green text where hackers frantically type in commands.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the terminal that Huet displayed before the DevDay audience looked markedly different. It featured an IDE-like experience for editing commands, one-click sharing of terminal outputs with teammates, and an interface that allows users to interact with the terminal in natural language for coding and troubleshooting. As Huet demonstrated the inner workings of OpenAI’s new product, the terminal on display looked different from a traditional terminal because it was different: The command line interface powering OpenAI’s assistant was a terminal called Warp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Warp, founded by Zach Lloyd in June 2020, is a terminal reimagined for the modern developer. Today, as engineers race to build AI products, the terminal is proving essential due to its ability to navigate large volumes of data, automate batch processing and quickly execute scripts. Warp’s terminal checks these boxes while introducing new AI-based features that promote usability, collaboration and productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The notion, however, that Warp would be embraced by developers at OpenAI, among other companies including Atlassian, Cisco, Netflix and Salesforce, was never a given. A mere two years ago, the idea of reinventing something as sacrosanct in software engineering as the terminal flew in the face of accepted wisdom.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>In the summer of 2021, a post appeared on Hacker News titled “<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27834649">Warp: Fast, Rust-based terminal</a>.” It announced the beta launch of the app and invited developers to sign up and try it.&nbsp; Within minutes, the post began racking up comments—some intrigued, others skeptical.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Criticisms boiled down to concerns over trust and security. Traditional computer terminals don’t require logins; if users entered passwords into Warp, would the company sell their data for profit? Would they make themselves liable to potential data breaches? There was also the ideological argument: Why should they pay for something new when its original version was free? And there was a sense of pride among those who understood the terminal’s eccentricities (and had memorized its arcane commands). To them, part of the appeal of the terminal was its difficulty of use; becoming skilled at using it was a rite of passage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of CEOs run away from this sort of experience because it’s unpleasant to have people telling you your idea is dumb,” says Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia. “One thing about Zach is that he’s a CEO who believes enough in the value of what he’s building that he is comfortable being yelled at on the internet.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s own experience had also taught him that skeptics of technology innovations aren’t always right. At Google, he’d been tasked with reimagining a software staple almost as foundational as the terminal—the spreadsheet—over fierce protests from Excel purists. The resulting product, Google Sheets, is now used by <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/google-workspace-stats">about a billion</a> people per month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The internet could yell as much as it pleased. Lloyd wasn’t deterred.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Lloyd’s interest in computer science began in college. He was drawn to software’s ability to make convoluted tasks faster and pulled his first all-nighter building a program that could find every word on a Boggle board. But Lloyd frequently encountered software for developers that was difficult to use, whether it had a steep learning curve or a nonintuitive design. “It drove me nuts,” he says. “It was like trying to get the shrink wrap off of the puzzle box before you can solve it. I wanted to actually solve the puzzle, not spend all my time trying to open the box.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite his interest in coding, following college graduation Lloyd let his curiosity guide him, testing the waters of a range of disciplines. He worked at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab, earned a master’s in philosophy, and even did a year of law school at Yale. “It took me longer than most people to figure out what I wanted to spend my life doing,” Lloyd says, “but I think there was value in being exposed to different fields and different ways of thinking.” It was in law school that Lloyd realized he missed building technology. He had an urge to create tools that were useful for people, and so he returned to engineering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2007, Lloyd was hired by Google to work on one of its newest products: Google Sheets. “I used to tell my friends I was working on Sheets, and none of them had heard of it,” Lloyd says. “When I would explain it, they would say, ‘Oh, Google has an Excel.’”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The general opinion was that Excel—a decades-old, tried-and-true program—was irreplaceable. Why would anyone switch to a new spreadsheet software? But Excel had its shortcomings. The app was local, meaning if users wanted to collaborate on a spreadsheet, they had to export their work, email it to a teammate to edit, and hope that in the back-and-forth, versions weren’t lost and work wasn’t duplicated. Lloyd’s team saw an opportunity. What if they could offer a familiar experience but in the cloud, allowing for seamless, real-time collaboration?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This undertaking came with immense technical challenges: recreating an on-prem program in the cloud, building real-time collaborative functions, and engineering the product in such a way that people could easily transfer their spreadsheets from Excel to Google Sheets and immediately continue their work. “We were trying to push forward innovation on document editing but had this everlasting tension where people have all these existing Microsoft Office files that we had to support,” Lloyd says, “and so transforming this technology in a way that would actually benefit people and not slow them down was very hard.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his time at Google, Lloyd says he grew both as an engineer and a leader, learning to manage a team that grew in the following years from five people to more than 100. By the time Lloyd left in 2014, Sheets had hundreds of millions of users. “Everyone I knew, every start-up, was using Google Sheets,” he says. “By then, no one was referring to the product as Google’s version of Excel. People knew it as Google Sheets.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was perhaps the most valuable insight Lloyd took from his time at Google: Some products are built as solutions to urgent, <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/pmf-framework/">“hair-on-fire”</a> problems. Others are built because someone is willing to question the status quo and decide it isn’t good enough. Some supposed “hard facts” are merely “hard problems” waiting to be solved. The experience of upending an accepted status quo was enticing, and Lloyd would go on to look for other supposed “hard facts” to turn on their heads.</p>
 







 
<p>In 2016, Lloyd cofounded a startup called SelfMade, which helps businesses succeed on social media. Leading his own company offered Lloyd a new set of lessons. At Google, he had been in a structured work setting, where there was always another rung of the ladder to climb and a clear path to get there. At a startup, there was no safety net and no definitive next step. Lloyd was happy to discover that he thrived in this strategic, competitive environment. But over time, something began to gnaw at him, a growing feeling that SelfMade wasn’t the right company for him. In 2019, he stepped down as its CTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd spent the next few months reflecting on his experience at SelfMade, working to understand why it hadn’t been the right fit for him as a founder. “This might sound obvious, but I realized it’s really important to me to be working on a problem that I care deeply about,” Lloyd says. “SelfMade helped people with social media, and I don’t really use social media. It was a tech-enabled company, but the product was people’s labor. Building software is what I loved to do, so I wanted to work at a company where the software was the product.”</p>



<p>As Lloyd considered what he should do next, he thought back to the ethos that drove the development of Google Sheets: How do you build software that challenges a hard fact and makes peoples’ lives easier? More personal to Lloyd, how could you make developers’ lives easier? He considered the foundational tools of software development. And then it dawned on him that there was one that had never been improved: the terminal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the average user relies on graphic user interfaces (GUIs) to communicate with computers, the terminal, which employs a command line interface (CLI), is an integral part of developers’ workflows and often the most efficient path to building software. While GUIs are great for certain tasks, there’s a class of developer tasks that are much better done in the command line. “A command line is more flexible than a GUI,” says Lloyd. “It allows developers to automate their own work. Most of the internet is actually just running command line apps. They are also the easiest to write—you just need to take text in and output text, no need to design anything with pixels.” Not only is working in the terminal faster, it is more memory efficient and offers higher precision and control over an operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet this critical tool, essentially unchanged since it first shipped in 1969, is also notoriously cumbersome. Engineers must be versed in the terminal’s library of complicated, esoteric commands and must use them precisely; one wrong character could brick your computer. What’s more, those working in the terminal can only access projects locally, making the development process a solo undertaking with little room for collaboration. “The terminal is truly archaic,”&nbsp; Lloyd says. “I thought, What if I could take this old school basic interface of just text in and text out and really improve it?” This was the genesis of Warp.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Lloyd’s takeaways from his time at SelfMade was the necessity of prioritizing product-market fit over growth. SelfMade had dedicated resources to expansion before it had a high level of user engagement and retention. Lloyd knew that with Warp, he would need to take incremental, intentional steps to build his business and make sure he had created something users would find invaluable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s first step was convincing his former colleague at Google, Shikhiu Ing, to come on board as a founding designer. They put together a prototype of Warp, which Lloyd knew would be critical in communicating his vision. “It’s just night and day when someone can actually see how your product will work. Once we showed it to people, they got it. That was huge for us.” Having Ing on board was also the social proof Lloyd needed that Warp was a good idea. “Once you get one smart person to sign on, it becomes marginally easier to get the next, and the next.” They hired two more talented engineers willing to take a risk on Warp, Michelle Lim and Aloke Desai, and got to work building the product.</p>



<p>It took six months, working tirelessly through the pandemic, for them to create a version of Warp they were happy with. Similar to Google Sheets taking on the incumbent Excel, Lloyd and his team had to balance the new with the familiar. “The real technical challenge with Warp was trying to innovate while making sure that the terminal that we’re building actually still works with people’s existing scripts and muscle memory,” Lloyd says. “We could have built something where we totally reimagined it and no one would have ever used it because none of their existing stuff worked.” At one point, struggling to match the terminal’s performance speed, the team decided to scrap Warp’s system entirely and rewrite it from scratch in Rust, a lower-level programming language popular with infrastructure engineers. The switch, while tedious, ensured Warp would offer terminal users the speed they were accustomed to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As for new elements, in Warp developers now have a modern IDE inside the familiar terminal. Warp allows teammates to share terminal commands and notebooks directly in their product by syncing them to the cloud. Warp also allows teammates to collaborate on the same terminal session in real time—similar to the multiplayer experience in Google Docs or Figma—so they can fight fires or debug issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s next step was determining if there was an audience for Warp. Would the developer community even want it? To find out, in July of 2021, he published the article announcing the beta launch of Warp to Hacker News.&nbsp;</p>



 



<p>Lloyd describes the critical feedback within the stream of comments on the Hacker News post as “painful—but it wasn’t going to kill the company.” As it turned out, those who were intrigued by the app far outnumbered the skeptics. Less than 24 hours after posting on Hacker News, over 10,000 developers had signed up to try it.</p>



<p>Over the next year, Warp iterated its product in beta with small groups of users. Lloyd solicited feedback, made adjustments, and in April 2022, the application—originally for MacOS—became available to the public. Within days, its user base grew to tens of thousands. In 2023, the company introduced Warp AI, an LLM-powered sidebar where users can ask questions if they need help remembering a command, fixing an error or tackling the next step in their workflow. In February 2024, Warp was officially released for Linux.</p>



<p>Lloyd’s hunch back in 2020, on the cusp of the LLM era, that an updated terminal would prove useful for developers, couldn’t have been more prescient. “Large language models are essentially command-line interfaces,” Lloyd told <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90907013/warp-terminal-command-line">FastCompany</a>, “and the terminal, the thing that we’re working on, is kind of the ideal way to interface with them.” As AI changes how code is written and software is consumed, the terminal is the most direct way to interface with AI—not just via chat but as a way of asking AI to do tasks for you. It’s a natural interface for launching AI agents (hence Warp’s June 2024 release of “Agent Mode,” which allows users to ask AI to directly accomplish tasks in the terminal).</p>



<p>Today, Warp has grown its user base to hundreds of thousands of developers. The company now has paying customers, both individuals and enterprises—proof of Lloyd’s vision that people will pay for AI development tools, even those that have traditionally been free utilities, when it helps ship better software more efficiently. His strategy is to strengthen Warp’s collaborative and intelligence features so that developers increasingly want to use Warp as a team—a tactic similar to Dropbox, Slack and Figma. “Monetization comes from companies wanting to pay to have their developers be more efficient and productive and working better together,” Lloyd says. “So our user growth is from the bottom up, but the revenue is like a B2B, enterprise or small team revenue model based on collaboration, intelligence and features that are for companies.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lloyd’s long term goal is for Warp to help developers with a wider set of workflows, all available in one integrated app. Users will be able to log in to Warp and access not just a better terminal but improved versions of a range of tools, from code editing to DevOps and developer environment management. “Any place a developer is spending their time on a keyboard, Warp will be there,” Lloyd says.</p>

 Zk-nym infrastructure in place, and apps are live across all platforms <p>Nym promised a complete version of NymVPN by the end of 2024. And we are pleased to announce: the latest stable version of NymVPN v2024.12 will be released today, 12 December, for all major platforms, including Android and&nbsp;Windows.</p><p>The release enables zero-knowledge accounts, based on zk-nym anonymous credentials, across all apps to ensure that when users pay for a NymVPN, their personal information can never be linked to their usage of the app. Unlike any other VPN provider, this cutting-edge zero-knowledge technology prevents Nym Technologies from snitching on its&nbsp;users.</p><p>The next step is to turn payments on for users. However, NymVPN will still be <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">free for anyone to use</a> until early next year! So don’t miss your chance to get free zero-knowledge credentials for the world’s most anonymous network before commercial launch.</p><p>The release of the NymVPN app comes just in time for the winding down of the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">NYM token buyback</a>. Over the past month, the company has been buying back NYM tokens, taking advantage of a historically low price point. This was a trial of what will become a continuous buyback mechanism once the NymVPN app requires subscription payments in January. This payment functionality will be demoed for institutions like venture capital firms next week and then the larger community for wider testing. Thus, over the next month we can expect the testing to continue to cause NYM token purchases using the algorithms designed during the&nbsp;buyback.</p><p>NymVPN v2024.12 also includes improved performance and security following the implementation of better state-based error-handling in November. Expect better and more stable connections, especially when switching between&nbsp;modes.</p><p>NymVPN will continue to be rigorously tested over the holidays to stabilize the app for commercial launch in January 2025. While beta payments are going live in the coming days, remember that NymVPN remains free to use. So <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">sign up today</a> to get one month free and help Nym test the world’s most anonymous network.</p> Compatibility <p>NymVPN v2024.11 is currently released&nbsp;for:</p>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/macos">MacOS</a>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/linux">Linux</a>  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/ios">iOS</a> (available in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">Apple&nbsp;Store</a>)  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/android">Android</a> (available in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nymtech.nymvpn&amp;hl=en">Play Store</a>, and F-Droid coming&nbsp;soon)  <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/windows">Windows</a> (beta)   New NymVPN&nbsp;apps  Android <p>The Android mobile app is now available in Google Play and will be available in F-droid in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Windows <p>The Fast Mode with WireGuard has been successfully enabled on the Windows app which can now be used in beta. Note that this is the first Windows release, so expect bugs and help the dev team by <a href="https://support.nymvpn.com/hc/en-us/categories/24316023997713-Troubleshooting">reporting them&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Zk-nyms <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/zk-nyms-are-here-a-major-milestone-towards-a-market-ready-mixnet-a3470c9ab10a">Zk-nyms (zero-knowledge access credentials)</a> are the foundation of anonymous access with NymVPN: they ensure that you can access the Nym network with full anonymity, even from Nym itself! The infrastructure for zk-nyms is now in place and will begin issuance next week with the launch of beta payments.*</p><p>* For users still using an old ticketbook / credential, zk-nyms may not be active until a new credential is&nbsp;issued.</p> Account sign-up / sign-in&nbsp;flow <p>After the November release, there is a streamlined system for signing up for NymVPN and logging into the app from multiple&nbsp;devices.</p>  Create account on the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">nymvpn.com</a> with a recovery&nbsp;phrase  You will receive a free single month subscription of zk-nyms “ticket book” fair usage allowance (30 days/250gb) * on&nbsp;sign-up  Use your recovery phrase to log into NymVPN on MacOS, Linux, mobile Android, or iOS (Windows coming next&nbsp;month)  You can then add (up to 10) additional devices by logging in with the same recovery&nbsp;phrase  <p>* Note that fair usage is now enforced from the centralized API based on the anonymous credential. Users can view their account plan fair usage&nbsp;summary.</p> DNS and ipv6&nbsp;leaks <p>Currently, all leaks while connected with NymVPN are fixed. The Nym dev team is continuing its work in plugging all leaks that occur prior to connecting with the NymVPN app. Nym remains committed to not releasing a full commercial version of the app until all these risks are fully addressed.</p> Crunch <p>The Nym network is also undergoing a major update to prepare the way for Nym tokenomics in which the value of the token is linked to the real usage of the NymVPN app. Payments for NymVPN subscriptions will trigger NYM buy orders, anonymizing the access of users while also creating a flywheel effect for the NYM&nbsp;token.</p><p>With crunch, operators will be able to choose the mode in which their node functions (as a gateway or mix node). There is also the inclusion of a new Network Monitor and mechanisms to remove outdated nodes to improve network performance.</p> Next stops: Beta payments and commercial launch  Beta payments &amp; zk-nym&nbsp;issuance <p>The payment flow is in its final testing phase and will be made live early next week. Beta payments will include debit and credit cards (through Stripe), NYM, and BTC. These payments will be linked with zk-nym issuance on new credentials.</p><p>Note: The payment system is for beta testing purposes to trial the payment flow before commercial launch. NymVPN remains free to use for everyone.</p> Commercial launch <p>The commercial launch of NymVPN is scheduled for January 2025. The reason why the Nym team decided to hold the launch in 2025 is to maximize the marketing opportunities after the holiday season. This will ensure that the app gets into the hands of as many users as possible.</p> Conclusion <p>A full, stable, and leak-free NymVPN app for general use is just the beginning. In 2025 the app will be launched to market. This will be the beginning of Nym’s <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5">novel experiment in tokenomics</a> in which the value of the token is linked to the concrete use of the NymVPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>And for app users, expect a lot of exciting upgrades as NymVPN comes into its own: kill switch and autoconnect features to prevent all leaks at the source, censorship resistance technology to permit access to blocked content, and post-quantum cryptography to protect your data against the AI and quantum computers of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>2025 will be a big&nbsp;year!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-app-live-with-zero-knowledge-accounts-1aeb044dbadf">NymVPN app live with zero-knowledge accounts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Polynomials are quintessential in machine learning for establishing relationships between outputs and inputs. However, there is also a field in cryptography which could not be made possible without polynomials - zero-knowledge technology. In zero-knowledge proof systems, computations are often represented as arithmetic circuits, and these circuits are translated into polynomials. This process is crucial for generating proofs that can demonstrate the correctness of computations without revealing the underlying data. The involved complexity explains the massive adoption hurdle for zk rollups compared to optimistic ones. Succinct aims to simplify the use of zero-knowledge proofs by providing a zkVM (SP1) that allows code written in languages like Rust to be proven in a privacy-preserving way. By doing so, it aims to lower the barrier to implementing zk-rollups and increase their adoption.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Uma’s background and her interest in zero knowledge tech  How Succinct’s story began  ZK light clients  ZK circuits  SP1 and the RISC-V instruction set  The prover network  Use cases  ZK rollups and commoditizing ZKPs  Incentivizing provers  Succinct’s business model  Supported blockchain applications  Bottlenecks in ZK adoption  Succinct metrics  SP1’s competitive advantage and future roadmap  The real world impact of verifiability  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a href="https://x.com/pumatheuma">Uma Roy on X</a>  <a href="https://x.com/SuccinctLabs">Succinct on X</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.1.0">Zebra 2.1.0</a>. This release includes some necessary updates post-NU6 activation.</p>



<p>We are now verifying that V5 transactions in the mempool have the correct consensus branch ID before returning a transaction ID, which would indicate a successful insertion in the mempool, even though they would be eventually rejected by the block consensus checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, Zebra also now returns an error when trying to submit transactions that would eventually fail some consensus checks (e.g. double spends) but would also return a transaction ID indicating success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The release also bumps Zebra’s initial minimum protocol version such that this release of Zebra will always reject connections with peers advertising a network protocol version below 170,120 on Mainnet and 170,110 on Testnet. Prior to this change, these connections would have been accepted until Zebra’s chain state reaches the NU6 activation height. While this is standard procedure in Zebra after a Zcash network upgrade, this change to the minimum protocol version is classified as a breaking change in Zebra.</p>



<p>In addition, the <code>getblock</code> RPC method has been updated to return some additional information such as the block height (even if you provide a block hash) and other fields as supported by the <code>getblockheader</code> RPC call.</p>



<p>You can see a full copy of the included changes in the <a href="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zebra/releases/tag/v2.1.0">v2.1.0 Release Notes</a> on GitHub.</p>

       AI in 2025: Building Blocks Firmly in Place        
Published December 9, 2024


 
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 


 
	 
        2024 was AI’s primordial soup year. In 2025, AI’s foundations are solidifying.         
Published December 9, 2024


 
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/david-cahn/">David Cahn</a>	 


 
	 
  



 
<p>Last January, we compared ChatGPT to AI’s “Big Bang” and predicted that 2024 would be AI’s “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2024/">primordial soup</a>” year. The AI ecosystem was abounding with new ideas and potential energy. It was a ripe moment for new entrepreneurs. “There is much potential in the air, and yet it is still amorphous,” we wrote at the time. “Vision is required to convert it into something real, tangible and, ultimately, impactful.”</p>



<p>Today, the AI ecosystem has hardened. There are now five “finalists” in the <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">race for biggest model</a>. Nvidia’s highly anticipated Blackwell chip is shipping <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-will-reportedly-start-blackwell-server-deliveries-in-early-december-the-first-servers-will-go-to-microsoft">this month</a>. Data centers, many of which were planned in early 2024, are entering full-on <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-data-center-buildout/">build mode</a>. TSMC is building new fab capacity and Broadcom is working on custom AI chips: the entire <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/the-ai-supply-chain-tug-of-war/">supply chain</a> has shifted into high gear. In every industry from healthcare to law to insurance, new AI initiatives are kicking off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If 2024 was the primordial soup year for AI, the building blocks are now firmly in place. AI’s potential is now congealing into something real and tangible—embodied by physical data centers that are rising up all across America from Salem, PA to Round Rock, TX to Mount Pleasant, WI. If 2024 was about new ideas abounding, 2025 will be about sifting through those ideas to see which really work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Below, we offer three predictions for the year ahead:</p>



 1. LLM providers have evolved distinct superpowers—this should lead to incremental differentiation and a contested pecking order in 2025 



<p>In 2024, the big model race was all about reaching parity with GPT-4. Five companies achieved this objective (or got close enough) and thus became “finalists:” Microsoft/OpenAI, Amazon/Anthropic, Google, Meta and xAI. Others dropped out of the race, most notably, Inflection, Adept and Character.</p>



<p>To get to GPT-4 quality, these companies ran roughly the same playbook: Collect as much data as possible, train on as many GPUs as possible and refine the pre-training/post-training architecture to maximize performance. With talent moving fluidly across organizations in 2024, few trade secrets remain.</p>



<p>As each player prepares for the next round of LLM scaling—which will likely involve another <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/zuckerberg-says-meta-will-need-10x-more-computing-power-to-train-llama-4-than-llama-3/">10x increase</a> in compute scale—the labs are evolving differentiated superpowers. They have “chosen their weapons,” so to speak, for the battle ahead. In 2025, these distinct strategies should lead to disparate outcomes, with some players pulling ahead and others falling behind.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Google – Vertical Integration: Google’s advantage going into 2025 is vertical integration. Google is the only player with its own first-class chips: TPUs have a chance to give NVDA GPUs a run for their money in 2025. Google also builds its own data centers, trains its own models and has a very strong internal research team. Unlike Microsoft and Amazon, which have partnered with OpenAI and Anthropic, respectively, Google is going for the prize by owning every part of the value chain. 
 



 
 OpenAI – Brand: We’ve seen a handful of surveys on unaided awareness of ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. Gemini, and it’s not close. OpenAI has the strongest brand in AI, bar none. This has resulted in the strongest revenue engine among the big AI players, with OpenAI reportedly north of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html">$3.6B</a> in revenue. If success in AI ends up hinging on consumer mindshare and enterprise distribution, OpenAI may continue to widen the gap between itself and rivals.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Anthropic – Talent: 2024 saw a big exodus of research talent from OpenAI, paired with inflows to Anthropic. With Jon Schulman, Durk Kingma and Jan Leike all leaving OpenAI for Anthropic in 2024, Anthropic has been gaining mindshare with research talent. The company also made some big executive hires, adding Instagram co-founder Mike Kreiger as Chief Product Officer. With GPT-3 inventor Dario Amodei at the helm, Anthropic has carved out its position as a favored destination for AI scientists.&nbsp; 
 



 
 xAI – Data Center Construction: We wrote in our piece on “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/steel-servers-and-power/">Steel, Servers, and Power</a>” about the importance of data center construction to the next phase of the AI race. With xAI bringing on their 100k GPU Colossus cluster <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/09/27/2024/elon-musks-new-memphis-data-center-hits-an-ai-milestone-with-nvidia-chips">in record time</a>, the company is now the pace setter for data center scaling. The next milestone for xAI and its rivals will be a 200k cluster and then a 300k cluster. If it ends up being true that “scale is all you need,” xAI is well-positioned to continue its rapid ascent.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Meta – Open Source: Meta, which already has strong distribution advantages through Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, has chosen to go all-in on open source. Meta is the only big player in the pack taking this approach. Meta’s Llama models have ardent fans and the closed-source vs. open-source debate continues to rage on. If frontier advancements start to slow down, Meta will be well-positioned to leverage its open-source models for rapid dissemination of these capabilities. 
 



<p>In the big model race, rigorous execution lies ahead. The competitive landscape and posture of each of the players has solidified. In 2025, we will see which of these strategies prove prescient—and which prove ill-fated.</p>



 2. AI Search is emerging as a killer app—in 2025, it will proliferate 



<p>Ever since ChatGPT came out, we’ve all been on the hunt for AI’s killer use case. What persistent new user behaviors will stand the test of time?</p>



<p>In 2024, many different applications were tested from AI girlfriends to AI rental assistants to voice agents and AI accountants.</p>



<p>One use case that we think will proliferate in 2025 is AI as a search engine. Perplexity has been on a tear since its launch, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/perplexity-search-ai-google.html">reaching 10M monthly active users</a>. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Search in October, an expansion of its existing search-like capabilities. The Wall Street Journal ran a piece recently headlined “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/googling-is-for-old-people-thats-a-problem-for-google-5188a6ed">Googling is for Old People</a>.” Ironically, this challenge to Google comes just as the company is mired in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24302415/doj-google-search-antitrust-remedies-chrome-android">anti-trust litigation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI search is a powerful re-invention of a technology that rapidly became the internet’s killer app. Internet search is a navigational technology based on indexing the web. AI search is an informational technology based on LLMs that can read and semantically understand knowledge. For white collar workers, this will be a huge boon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AI search may fragment what is currently a monolithic market. It’s possible to imagine a world where every profession has its own specialized AI search engine—analysts and investors now default to Perplexity, lawyers will use platforms like Harvey, and doctors will use solutions like OpenEvidence. Along these lines, one can think of Midjourney as search over the “pixelverse,” Github Copilot as search over the “codeverse,” and Glean as search over the “documentverse.” Unlike in traditional search, AI search can go much deeper semantically, and is therefore an order of magnitude more powerful, resulting in significant incremental productivity gains.</p>



<p>The text response as a product surface area is deeper than first meets the eye. Not all text responses are created equal. We think LLMs allow for real product differentiation across multiple dimensions, and that founders will build unique product experiences around these capabilities, targeted at specific customer audiences:</p>



 
 Intent Extraction: Tightly matching the response to the user’s intent becomes easier with domain specialization. For example, a doctor and patient asking the same question will want to see different types of responses. 



 Proprietary Data: Unique datasets like case law for lawyers, financial data for analysts or weather data for insurance underwriters will be important in white collar domains. Getting the answer right is table stakes in a business context.&nbsp; 



 Formatting: How results are presented to the user, for example how verbose or concise the response is, use of bullets, use of multi-modal content, reference to sources. Accountants tend to digest information differently than journalists, for example.&nbsp; 



 Interface Design: Code search needs to live in the IDE. Accounting policy search needs to live in your accounting SaaS platform. Semantic search benefits from context around the user’s existing workflow and data. Different domains will require different interfaces. 
 



<p>New domain-specific AI search engines will map themselves as tightly as possible onto the “theory of mind” of their target personas. Doctors, lawyers and accountants don’t think alike. As we become experts in a given domain, our patterns for extracting knowledge and making decisions begin to diverge. Doctors confront medical literature, lawyers confront case law, investors confront earnings reports. The way we dissect, analyze and make decisions on this knowledge is different in each domain.</p>



<p>There is likely to be a bifurcation between consumer and enterprise. In our capacity as consumers, we all have roughly the same needs, hence the smashing product-market fit of ChatGPT. However, in our capacity as professionals, we have different needs. It is fairly straightforward to imagine that every knowledge worker will have at least two AI search engines they use daily—one for work and one for everything else.</p>



 3. ROI will remain problematic and CapEx will begin to stabilize in 2025 



<p>We’ve written about <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/follow-the-gpus-perspective/">AI’s $200B question</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">AI’s $600B question</a>, which explore the tremendous capital expenditure coming out of the Big Tech companies, and the lack of commensurate end-user revenue to derive a payback for these cash outlays.</p>



<p>Going into 2024, the Big Tech companies were nervous about AI being a threat to their oligopoly in the cloud business. As we wrote in the “<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/">Game Theory of AI CapEx</a>,” these companies felt they had no choice but to spend aggressively to ensure their continued dominance in an AI future. If they didn’t spend, others would, and they’d fall behind.</p>



<p>Entering 2025, the picture has changed dramatically. Big Tech companies have their arms locked firmly around the AI revolution. Not only do they control the vast majority of the data centers that power AI, but they own significant equity stakes in the big model companies, and they are among the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/06/ai-craze-getting-funded-by-tech-giants-distorting-traditional-vcs.html">largest backers</a> of new AI startups.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Big Tech feeling more confident, we think 2025 will be a stabilization year for AI CapEx. If 2024 was a scramble to sign deals for land and power, 2025 will be an execution year. Shovels are in the ground, and these companies will be focused on completing their new projects on-time and on-budget. They will then need to sell this installed capacity to customers and work with enterprises to help them achieve success with their new AI capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After roughly doubling CapEx levels since pre-ChatGPT, we may see some normalization in 2025. The latest CapEx figures released in Q3 suggest that the trendline is already starting to stabilize inside of Microsoft and Google. Amazon and Meta are still ramping, but may reach steady state in early 2025. (While Meta looks flat in the chart below, the company has issued guidance for increased CapEx in Q4).</p>



Source: Earnings transcripts, public filings



<p>Oligopolistic dynamics are likely to set-in as well. Each of the Big Tech companies follows their rivals closely. If it looks like the industry is on a glide path to a “new normal,” that may be welcome news for all. It would provide further support for a new equilibrium in 2025 vs. continued ratcheting of spend.</p>



<p>As new data center capacity comes online in 2025, AI compute prices should continue their epic decline. This is great news for startups and should incentivize net-new innovation. As we’ve pointed out in the past, startups are primarily consumers of compute vs. producers of compute, and so they benefit from overbuilding. The Big Tech companies are effectively creating a subsidy that will accrue to the entire AI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Many comparisons have been made between the Clouds and the railroad oligopoly of the Gilded Age. If data centers are indeed the rails of the digital economy, then the new AI rails will be securely in place by the end of 2025. The question remains what freight will ride on those rails, and how we can leverage this new technology to create value for customers and end-users.</p>



<p>Here’s to a year of leveraging AI’s building blocks to create incredible new capabilities that will change people’s lives.</p>

<p>What happens when artificial intelligence starts weighing in on our moral decisions? Matt Prewitt is joined by Meaning Alignment Institute co-founder Joe Edelman to explore this thought-provoking territory in examining how AI is already shaping our daily experiences and values through social media algorithms. They explore the tools developed to help individuals negotiate their values and the implications of AI in moral reasoning – venturing into compelling questions about human-AI symbiosis, the nature of meaningful experiences, and whether machines can truly understand what matters to us. For anyone intrigued by the future of human consciousness and decision-making in an AI-integrated world, this discussion opens up fascinating possibilities – and potential pitfalls – we may not have considered.</p><p>Links &amp; References:&nbsp;</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchSurfing">CouchSurfing - Wikipedia</a> | <a href="http://couchsurfing.org">CouchSurfing.org | Website</a>  <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/tristan_harris_how_a_handful_of_tech_companies_control_billions_of_minds_every_day?subtitle=en">Tristan Harris: How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day | TED Talk</a>  <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Center for Humane Technology | Website</a>  <a href="https://www.meaningalignment.org/">MEANING ALIGNMENT INSTITUTE | Website</a>  <a href="https://replika.com/">Replika - AI Girlfriend/Boyfriend</a>  <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/will-ai-improve-exponentially-at-value-judgments/">Will AI Improve Exponentially At Value Judgments? - by Matt Prewitt | RadicalxChange</a>  <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/">Moral Realism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_Theologica">Summa Theologica - Wikipedia</a>  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanceeliot/2023/05/16/when-generative-ai-refuses-to-answer-questions-ai-ethics-and-ai-law-get-deeply-worried/">When Generative AI Refuses To Answer Questions, AI Ethics And AI Law Get Deeply Worried</a> | AI Refusals  <a href="https://time.com/7012865/amanda-askell/">Amanda Askell: The 100 Most Influential People in AI 2024 | TIME</a> | Amanda Askells' work at Anthropic  <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/taylor.htm">Overcoming Epistemology by Charles Taylor</a>  <a href="https://catholicstand.com/god-beauty-symmetry-science/">God, Beauty, and Symmetry in Science - Catholic Stand</a> | Thomas Aquinas on symmetry  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek">Friedrich Hayek - Wikipedia</a> | “Hayekian”  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky - Wikipedia</a> | “AI policy people, especially in this kind Yudkowskyian scene”  <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/lieder_resource.pdf">Resource-rational analysis: Understanding human cognition as the optimal use of limited computational resources</a> | Resource rational (cognitive science term)  <p>Papers &amp; posts mentioned</p>  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636">[2404.10636] What are human values, and how do we align AI to them? | Paper by Oliver Klingefjord, Ryan Lowe, Joe Edelman</a>  <a href="https://meaningalignment.substack.com/p/model-integrity">Model Integrity - by Joe Edelman and Oliver Klingefjord | Meaning Alignment Institute Substack</a>  <p>Bios:</p><p>Joe Edelman is a philosopher, sociologist, and entrepreneur whose work spans from theoretical philosophy to practical applications in technology and governance.

<p>Fellow Panthers,&nbsp;</p><p>November marked another milestone-filled month for Panther, with significant progress across key areas. Panther completed internal testing for Stage 9 of its testnet and made significant progress in advancing the Canary network, bringing Panther closer to providing infrastructure for real-world transactions. The team also made impactful contributions at DevCon and in the media, showcasing Panther’s innovations. Panther continues to build momentum in its mission to bring privacy and compliance to DeFi. Read on for the full recap below.</p><p>\</p> Stage 9 Internal Testing Complete, Canary Network Prep Underway <p>Panther hit a key milestone in November with the completion of internal testing for Stage 9, the final stage of <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/testnet?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">Panther’s testnet</a>. This sets the stage for Panther Protocol Foundation’s launch of Panther’s Canary network. The Canary network, which will be run by a Swiss-based foundation, will serve as a critical proving ground, showcasing Panther’s <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/panther-core/shielded-pool?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">privacy-enhancing</a> and <a href="https://docs.pantherprotocol.io/docs/panther-core/compliance?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">compliance-driven capabilities</a>. Simultaneously, Panther contributors continued to work on refining the codebase.</p><p>We would be remiss if we did not thank our community of 3500+ testers, whose feedback has been invaluable. Stay tuned here and on our <a href="http://www.x.com/zkpanther?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">social media</a> for further details on access to the Canary network as we continue to deliver our transformative vision for DeFi.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Zone Manager documentation and interface development are progressing as the Protocol prepares to support financial service providers on its platform.&nbsp;</p> Panther Ecosystem Update <p>Panther’s thought leadership in DeFi privacy and compliance was fully displayed at <a href="http://devcon.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">DevCon</a> 2024, one of the world’s premier Ethereum developer conferences in Bangkok, Thailand.</p><p>During DevCon’s Privacy ftw side event organized by <a href="http://zkmonk.org/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zkMonk</a> and <a href="https://www.zk-hub.io/?ref=blog.pantherprotocol.io">zkHUB</a>, Panther’s Technical Lead, Igor Markelov delivered his presentation, "Private Data Sharing to Enable Compliance in DeFi."

<p>The <a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a> (ZCG) program funds independent teams to perform major ongoing development (or other work) that benefits the Zcash ecosystem. Grants are chosen by a five-person committee whose members are elected by the<a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"> Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>. </p>



<p>Three of the current members’ terms are expiring at the end of this year (Amber O’Hearn, Michael Harms and Jason McGee). Therefore, we are inviting nominations for an election to be held at the end of December.</p>



 How to Stand for Election to the Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) Committee 



<p>Anyone can stand for election to the ZCG committee. Existing members may stand for re-election, and there are no term limits. </p>



<p>Candidates should submit a forum post (ideally five paragraphs or less) in the&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/governance/zcg-elections/38">ZCG Elections category of the Zcash Community Forum</a>, announcing their candidacy, and outlining why they believe they should be elected to the ZCG Committee. Community members will have an opportunity to ask candidates questions directly by replying to their individual posts.</p>



<p>The deadline for nominations is 09:00 UTC on Friday 13th December 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We cannot prevent anyone from talking about their candidacy in other media, but we encourage candidates to use the forum threads as their primary method of “campaigning”. Doing so will make it easier for Zcash community members to interact with and assess candidates.</p>



<p>After the deadline for nominations closes, Zcash Foundation will host a community call, during which the candidates will have an opportunity to introduce themselves, and answer questions from the Zcash community.</p>



<p>After the community call, ZF will open a Helios poll of <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">ZCAP</a> to select three candidates to join the ZCG Committee. The poll will close at 09:00 UTC on 1st January 2025.&nbsp;As with previous polls, the election will be decided by approval voting. The three candidates with the most approval votes will become the new ZCG Committee members. They will serve a one-year term, ending on 31st December 2025.</p>



<p>Prospective candidates should beaware of the Conflict of Interest policy (see below). </p>



 About the Zcash Community Grants Committee 



<p>The largest slice of the&nbsp;<a href="https://zfnd.org/how-the-zcash-foundation-is-funded/">Zcash Dev Fund</a>&nbsp;is earmarked for major grants “<a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">to fund independent teams entering the Zcash ecosystem, to perform major ongoing development work (or other word) for the public good of the Zcash ecosystem</a>”. While the funds are administered and disbursed by the Zcash Foundation (ZF), applications for major grants are subject to approval by a five-seat Major Grant Review Committee, which is elected by the <a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/"></a><a href="https://zfnd.org/zcap/">Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP)</a>.</p>



<p>The Committee reviews, assesses and approves or rejects grant applications. Committee members currently meet for brainstorming sessions every week, with formal committee meetings held every two weeks.</p>



<p>The first Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view">September 2020</a>, and adopted the moniker Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG). The second Committee was elected in&nbsp;<a href="https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/2d0787fc-61de-11ec-8619-8ee85a8a1b8a/view">December 2021</a>, and re-branded itself&nbsp;<a href="https://zcashcommunitygrants.org/">Zcash Community Grants</a>&nbsp;(ZCG).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Committee is responsible for reviewing, assessing and approving or rejecting grant applications, in accordance with the strictures and guidelines set forth in <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1014#mg-slice-major-grants">ZIP 1014</a> and <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>. Currently, formal Committee meetings are held every two weeks, and the Committee meets informally for brainstorming sessions on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Committee members currently receive a stipend of $1,725 per calendar month (paid as shielded ZEC).</p>



<p>With the adoption of <a href="https://zips.z.cash/zip-1015">ZIP 1015</a>, the Zcash Community Grants Program is in the process of transitioning from ZF to the Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF). </p>



 Conflict of Interest Policy 



<p>The Financial Privacy Foundation (FPF) is subject to rules regarding private benefit and inurement, and is obligated to have an appropriate policy and processes in place to ensure that actual and potential conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed appropriately, in order to avoid the appearance or actuality of private benefit to individuals who are in a position of substantial authority. <a href="https://www.financialprivacyfoundation.org/_files/ugd/9ba471_3469edaa00944ed0bf46deb77e5c56eb.pdf">FPF’s conflict of interest policy can be found here</a>.</p>



<p>Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members are required to complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with FPF (to ensure that their status and relationship with FPF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify FPF of any new actual or potential conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure.</p>



<p>The following policies also apply in relation to ZCG Committee members and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest:</p>



 
 Serving ZCG Committee members, and entities in which a serving ZCG Committee member is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest, are ineligible to submit a new grant application to ZCG. 



 A person who has submitted a grant application (or who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that has submitted a grant application) on which the ZCG Committee has not yet rendered a decision is ineligible to serve as a ZCG Committee member (unless the grant application is withdrawn). 



 A person who is a current grant recipient (or a person who is an officer or director or otherwise has a financial interest in an entity that is a current grant recipient) is eligible to serve on the ZCG Committee so long as the decision to accept their grant application was made before they began serving as a member of the ZCG Committee. 



 Milestone payout decisions that relate to a serving ZCG Committee member’s grant (or a grant awarded to an entity in which a serving ZCG Committee member has a financial interest) will be taken by the FPF board. 



 Before taking their seat on ZCG Committee, newly-elected Committee members will be required to complete a conflict of interest questionnaire, and sign an independent contractor agreement with FPF (to ensure that their status and relationship with FPF is clearly-defined). Additionally, serving ZCG Committee members are required to notify FPF of any new conflicts of interest that develop or emerge during their tenure. 
 



<p></p>



<p>If prospective candidates have any questions about the role, they should post them to the Zcash Community Forums.</p>

<p>Joint work with Sebastian Angel (University of Pennsylvania), Sofía Celi (Brave), Alex Davidson (NOVA LINCS &amp; DI, FCT, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa), Hamed Haddadi (Brave Software &amp; Imperial College London), Shai Levin (University of Auckland), Elizabeth Margolin (University of Pennsylvania), Gonçalo Pestana (Hashmatter), Joe Rowell (Royal Holloway, University of London), Jess Woods (University of Pennsylvania). This post was written by Brave’s Security Researcher, Sofía Celi.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Just as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deco">DECO</a>, DiStefano is named after the football player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Di_St%C3%A9fano">DiStefano</a>, who, while being Argentinian, worked for Spain most of his professional life. It is related to the fact of using something from one place in another place (TLS data to externally attest) (Image partially AI generated).</p>
<p>The Transport Layer Protocol (TLS) is one of the most widespread protocols that secure data in transport over the Internet. Thanks to its widespread deployment, users are assured that their data in transport remains secure and private as the protocol (especially, in its 1.3 version) provides encrypted and authenticated channels between clients and servers on the Internet. Such channels commonly transmit trusted information about users behind clients such as</p>
<p>proofs of age, social security statuses, bank account information and accepted purchase information. While various applications would benefit from learning such data points, doing so raises significant privacy concerns. Exporting such information as private, anonymous credentials is challenging because it is transmitted over an encrypted and authenticated channel. Meanwhile, both legislation (such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-20-gdpr/">GDPR</a>) and standards bodies (such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2022/REC-did-core-20220719/">W3C</a>) have made usage of privacy-preserving data credentials a priority. Therefore, it is critical to develop methods that enable users to selectively and consensually export portions of their data. This would allow them to prove specific statements or authenticate that the data originates from a trusted source, such as a particular website, without compromising privacy.</p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, consider that Alice wants to prove to a service that they are over 18 (a website, for example, can request such a proof). Currently, most age verification services require users to upload identification documents containing extensive personal information, raising significant privacy concerns. If Alice chooses not to share their ID, they may be denied access to the service, even though they meet the age requirement. Meanwhile, many websites, such as company payroll systems or DMV portals, already store and serve verified birth dates. Alice could, in theory, share a screenshot of her birth date from one of these sites, but this approach has two major flaws: screenshots are easily forged, and even if their authenticity could somehow be guaranteed, they would reveal unnecessary information, such as Alice’s exact birth date, instead of simply proving that they are over 18. This situation highlights the need for a mechanism that achieves two goals: proving the authenticity of the data (ensuring it is not forged) and proving a specific statement about the data (e.g., that Alice is over 18) without disclosing additional details. Such a solution would enable both proofs of provenance and proofs of statements, which will allow users to access services without compromising their privacy and ensuring trust. These types of proofs can be useful, for example, in anti-fraud checks (and we will talk about this at the end of the post).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore a solution to this problem by leveraging TLS to create both proofs of provenance and proofs of statements. This approach enables users to consensually generate zero-knowledge proofs of their data, allowing them to securely access additional services while preserving their privacy.</p>

 DCTLS protocols 
<p>Designated-Commitment TLS (DCTLS) protocols, also known as three-party handshake (3PH) protocols or ZKTLS, enable modified TLS handshakes that allow specific statements about the data exchanged in a TLS channel to be securely exported to a designated verifier (a trusted party). These protocols secret-share private session data between a client and verifier, and compute the <a href="https://tls13.xargs.org/">handshake and record-layer phases of TLS</a> phases of TLS using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_two-party_computation">two-party computation (2PC)</a>, a type of MPC that allows two parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their respective inputs private. Notable examples of DCTLS protocols include <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00938">DECO</a>, <a href="https://old.tlsnotary.org/pagesigner">TLSNotary/PageSigner</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978326">TownCrier</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/964">Garble-then-Prove</a>, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1377">Janus</a> (similar techniques are also used to produce <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/grubbs">zero-knowledge middleboxes</a> for proving that client traffic adheres to corporate browsing policies, for example, and for devising multi-party TLS clients/servers).</p>
<p>Despite their claims of practicality, these protocols face significant barriers to wide-scale adoption.</p>
 
 
<p>Lack of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/pdfrfc/rfc8446.txt.pdf">TLS 1.3</a> Support: None of the protocols listed explicitly provide secure support for TLS 1.3, even though it became the dominant version of TLS as of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442381.3450057">December 2020</a>. According to <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#tls-1-2-vs-tls-1-3-vs-quic">Cloudflare Radar</a>, TLS 1.3 now accounts for 63% of secure network traffic, compared to only 8.7% for TLS 1.2. Support for TLS 1.3 is therefore crucial. Even when TLS 1.3 is supported, existing protocols often lack rigorous security analyses or fail to address efficiency concerns associated with implementing TLS 1.3 ciphersuites and protocol steps in maliciously-secure 2PC.</p>
 
 
<p>Security Limitations: Current security arguments lack flexibility, as they are tied to specific, static protocols, ciphersuites, and 2PC primitives. This rigidity poses risks; for instance, primitives used by DECO have already been shown to <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1621">be</a>  <a href="https://info.fireblocks.com/hubfs/A_Note_on_the_Security_of_GG.pdf">insecure</a>. Moreover, client privacy is frequently overlooked, with protocols exposing the server a client communicates with to the verifier: potentially revealing sensitive browsing history.</p>
 
 
<p>Deployability Challenges: No fully-featured, open-source implementation of a DCTLS protocol exists that combines strong security guarantees with interoperability for common Internet browsing tools. This absence hinders practical adoption and widespread deployment.</p>
 
 
<p>In order to solve all these problems, we introduce DiStefano. But, prior to explaining our protocol, let’s see how DCTLS protocols work.</p>

 DCTLS in detail 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>DCTLS protocols allow a Client to generate commitments to TLS session data communicated with a Server that can be sent to a designated third-party Verifier. They consist of the following phases: 1. A (Verifier-assisted) handshake phase, 2. a (Verfier-assisted) query execution phase, and 3. a commitment phase. Over TLS 1.3 (given an informal description of TLS 1.3 with 1-RTT and with certificate-based authentication), these phases look like this:</p>
<p>Handshake phase. In this phase (as seen below), the Server learns the same secret session parameters as in standard TLS 1.3, while the Client and the Verifier learn shares of the session parameters that only the Client would normally learn: they engage in the core TLS 1.3 protocol using a series of 2PC functionalities, hence, they secret-share session data and arrive to session secret keys that are secret-shared.&nbsp;</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Record Layer-Query Execution phase. At the record layer, encrypted traffic is exchanged between the Client and the Server (as seen below). The Client sends an encrypted query (e.g., an HTTPS request) to the Server with assistance from the Verifier. Since the session secret keys are secret-shared, the Client and Verifier collaboratively compute the encryption of these queries using two-party computation (2PC). Similarly, encrypted responses from the Server (e.g., an HTTPS response) can be decrypted using the same joint procedure. Note that these responses must first be committed to, as discussed in the next phase.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Record Layer-Commitment phase. After the encrypted queries are sent and encrypted responses are received, the Client commits to the session by forwarding the ciphertexts (e.g., the encrypted responses) to the Verifier (as seen in box 3 of Figure 1). In exchange, the Verifier provides the Client with its shares of the session secret keys. This allows the Client to verify the integrity of the Server’s response and, later, prove statements derived from it to the Verifier. For example, using the committed encrypted response now held by the Verifier, the Client can prove in zero-knowledge that a specific statement is true (e.g., that an HTTPS response contains a field representing age, and that the age is greater than 18).</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>As we can see, DCTLS protocols are straightforward: they allow a trusted third party (the Verifier) to participate in the handshake (by performing operations in 2PC), enabling the Verifier to commit to encrypted data. This data can later be used to create zero-knowledge proofs. We require this commitment for zero-knowledge proofs: the data that one intends to prove a statement about must be committed to, ensuring its immutability. However, the Verifier never learns the plaintext data unless the Client chooses to reveal it. The Verifier only holds shares of the full session secret keys, and the encrypted data cannot be decrypted unless the full session secret keys are known.</p>

 DiStefano: Decentralized Infrastructure for Sharing Trusted Encrypted Facts and Nothing More 
<p>While all DCTLS follow a similar approach, with our protocol, DiStefano, we improve upon it by:</p>
 
 
<p>Making it all work with TLS 1.3 as described in the previous section and in detail in our paper.</p>
 
 
<p>Providing a full security model: we provide a modular, standalone security framework that guarantees security in the presence of malicious adversaries.</p>
 
 
<p>Improving privacy guarantees:&nbsp; In the handshake phase, when the Server sends its certificate messages to the Client, relaying those messages to the Verifier for verification would disclose the Client’s browsing history over time. This is because the Server’s certificate contains its identity, which could potentially reveal the Client’s activity. In DiStefano, we aim to prevent this. Instead, we use zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of valid signatures (ZKPVS) for signatures generated during TLS exchanges. In this scheme, one holds a valid signature issued by your keypair, while a verifier holds a set of valid public keys, one of which corresponds to your keypair. The goal is to demonstrate that the signature is valid with respect to this set without disclosing your specific public key. This ensures that the prover’s identity remains private, preserving the Client’s privacy. For this purpose, our <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1595">CDLS</a> scheme can be used with EC-DSA signatures.</p>
 
 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
 
 Making AES-GCM be a commitment scheme: To commit to the encrypted data, one could use traditional commitment schemes such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme">Pedersen Commitments</a>. However, we opted to leverage the existing functionality provided by the TLS 1.3 protocol. This involves adapting AES-GCM (the algorithm supported by TLS 1.3 to encrypt data),&nbsp; to act as a commitment scheme. Since AES-GCM, when used in an AEAD setting, functions as a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/664">non-committing cipher</a>, we introduced modifications to make it committing. Specifically, this was achieved by verifying the tag in relation to the ciphertext. For a comprehensive explanation of our approach, please refer to our paper. 
 
<p>As such, DiStefano is a DCTLS protocol that operates securely within TLS 1.3, offering formal security guarantees and ensuring client privacy. It is also highly efficient, as demonstrated through WAN experiments evaluating its performance in practical scenarios. The results indicate that runtime increases are proportional to the latency introduced, with slight deviations due to circuit preprocessing and GCM share derivation. Circuit preprocessing adds to the runtime but is an offline, amortizable cost. The derivation of GCM shares, reflecting the multi-round trip nature of the protocol, consistently takes less than a second. Even with these factors, the total online costs remain significantly lower than typical TLS handshake timeouts, which are usually configurable between 10 and 20 seconds. Additionally, the impact of increasing latency appears sublinear, suggesting that DiStefano maintains high efficiency and practicality across a variety of browsing scenarios.</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>So, what else can be done? Well, DiStefano is a pretty complete protocol that gives you commitments to TLS 1.3 encrypted data, but it does not yet give you the zero-knowledge proofs over that data. Let’s explore that now.</p>

 Zero-knowledge proofs 
<p>The data transmitted over TLS can take various forms, depending on the application. Common formats include HTML for web pages and JSON for APIs, but other formats like XML, binary data, or proprietary protocols can also be transmitted securely over TLS. This means that the data we aim to prove statements about is often structured in these formats. For example, let’s examine a JSON blob containing an age field:</p>
 <code>{
&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "DiStefano Protocol",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"version": "1.0",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"description": "A DCTLS protocol over TLS 1.3.",
&nbsp;&nbsp;"age": 2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;"features": {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"security": "Proven fully secure",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"privacy": "Maintains client privacy",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"efficiency": "Highly efficient"
&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;"performance": {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"runtimeImpact": "Proportional to latency",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"gcmShareDerivationTime": "Less than a second",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"totalOnlineCost": "Below typical TLS handshake timeout"
&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;"latencyImpact": "Sublinear"
}
</code> <p>If this data is transmitted over TLS 1.3 as a Server’s response to a Client’s request, DiStefano can be used to commit to the encrypted data. Once committed, if we want to prove that the field “age” has a value greater than 1 (a proof of a statement), we need to demonstrate the following:</p>
 
 
<p>The data conforms to the JSON context-free grammar: JSON is defined by a formal context-free grammar specifying rules for objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and other components. For example, an object must consist of key-value pairs enclosed in braces {} and separated by commas. Verifying adherence to this grammar ensures the data is valid JSON.</p>
 
 
<p>The field “age” exists at the top level: In the JSON grammar, keys must be strings, and the presence of the “age” key as a direct child of the root object needs to be validated to ensure it is not nested within another object or array.</p>
 
 
<p>The value associated with “age” matches the grammar rule for integers: JSON defines numeric values, including integers and floats. We need to prove that the value of “age” satisfies the grammar rule for integers.</p>
 
 
<p>The value of “age” satisfies a semantic constraint: While grammars handle structural validity, proving that the value of “age” is greater than 1 requires an additional semantic check beyond the grammar rules.</p>
 
 
<p>We are actively working on research to address these challenges. For point 1, for example, we build on the outstanding <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1886.pdf">Reef</a> protocol, extending it to handle context-free grammars. This enables proving that committed JSON data either matches or does not match a given regular expression. For points 3 and 4, we are designing custom zero-knowledge proof systems that allow generating proofs over AES-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305, the two primary ciphersuites supported by TLS 1.3. Expect blog posts and papers on this soon!</p>

 Why is this useful? 
<p>Earlier in this blog post, we discussed how leveraging TLS 1.3 encrypted data to create proofs of provenance and proofs of statements can be valuable for allowing users to access additional services. However, this is just one example of its potential.</p>
<p>These types of proofs can also be useful in anti-fraud checks. For instance, a user could prove in zero-knowledge that they have an account with one of several authorized banks (without revealing which bank it is). This kind of proof could serve as a signal that the user is not a bot, enabling them to access services while preserving their privacy and preventing them from being falsely flagged as a bot. One can also use these proofs to verify “real” events by producing statements that confirm the origin and trustworthiness of data, helping to demonstrate that it was not generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, it is important to note that DCTLS protocols could become actively harmful tools for monitoring or censoring client traffic in certain applications, especially in automated systems without human involvement. We would like to emphasize that deployment of tools such as DiStefano must be considered carefully in such contexts.</p>

 Interested in trying our protocol? 
<p>If you are interested in trying our protocol, we implemented <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/distefano">a full prototype</a> of DiStefano in C++. It is built directly over BoringSSL, so it can be integrated easily over Chromium-based browsers. In fact, one of our future works is integrating this implementation directly on the Brave browser so we could leverage this protocol to detect fraud behaviour (detect bots, for example) and attest humanity without degrading usability.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s Taproot update paved the way for a new &amp; exciting era for Bitcoin, as it expanded its use case far beyond that of an immutable ledger. However, Ordinals, BRC-20 tokens and, more recently, Runes, have limited functionality compared to what DeFi is capable of, on other smart contract blockchains. BitcoinOS envisions a revolutionary Bitcoin economy that stems from truly programmable tokens, unlocking staking, governance and many other use cases. Using BitSNARK and Grail, BitcoinOS enables Bitcoin “rollups”, which act as execution environments that use BTC as gas fee and inherit security from the L1. The missing link was always a trustless bridge between Bitcoin L1 and any potential L2. And Grail Bridge achieved just that - using zero knowledge cryptography, BTC could be transferred to other chains without relying on other custodians’ trust assumptions. In that sense, Bitcoin block #853626 is historically meaningful as it contains the first-ever onchain verification of a zero knowledge proof, on Bitcoin. A truly programmable smart contract operating system on Bitcoin was no longer a mere concept…it became a reality through BitcoinOS.</p><p>Topics covered in this episode:</p>  Yago's background  The effect of Trump’s election on the crypto industry  The goal behind BitcoinOS  The history of Bitcoin’s programmability  Verifying ZK proofs on Bitcoin  Taproot  Ordinals  BitSNARK, Grail bridge and Merkle Mesh  BitcoinOS modularity and sequencing  An impending (r)evolution of the industry  Bitcoin vs. Ethereum L2 landscape  Bringing Bitcoin liquidity to Cardano  BitcoinOS roadmap  <p>Episode links:</p>  <a>Edan Yago on Twitter</a>  <a href="https://x.com/BTC_OS">Bitcoin OS on Twitter</a>  <p>Sponsors:</p>  Gnosis: Gnosis builds decentralized infrastructure for the Ethereum ecosystem, since 2015.

 NymVPN stable release &amp; NYM buyback before&nbsp;launch <p>Dear friends and fellow freedom fighters,</p><p>We’re in the final push to the launch of NymVPN to the world in January 2025! But now’s no time for publicity, just hard facts and tasks. Getting to launch means hitting crucial milestones, and testers and stakers play a big part in the&nbsp;success.</p><p>November marked the first milestone with the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-v2024-11-is-here-6186d49e3c8d">stable release of NymVPN</a>. This update improves network security and stability for users, but also lays the foundation for user payments being unlinkable to their use of the&nbsp;app.</p><p>The Nym network has had a major upgrade with the Magura release resulting in measurable improvements to reliability. The release begins the process of culling outdated nodes and ensuring equitable rewarding.</p><p>In preparation for launch, staking on nodes is crucial for the health of the network. So if you’re wondering which nodes you should stake, here’s a <a href="https://explorer.nym.spectredao.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">list of top performing Nym nodes</a> who are currently in the official Nym Delegations Program. Staking NYM on them will go a long way to improving network performance while also ensuring a good&nbsp;APY.</p><p>To bootstrap the Nym treasury and improve network performance ahead of launch, Nym is conducting a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">token buyback</a> of $1 million USD in NYM. As payments for NymVPN begin to roll in, there will be a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5">perpetual NYM buyback</a> organically linked to the demand for and usage of the app. The goal of Nym tokenomics is two-fold: the <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nymvpn-v2024-11-is-here-6186d49e3c8d">value of NYM</a> will be linked to paid usage of the app, and the increase of users will improve the privacy of&nbsp;all.</p><p>The next major NymVPN release is scheduled for December to introduce zk-nym credentials and beta payments. With this coming release, the full infrastructure of NymVPN will be in place before being rigorously tested for launch over the holidays. Want to help the team prepare for it?

Great products, afterall, are built in phases. NymVPN 2024.11 includes:</p>  Improved user experience: A streamlined sign-up / sign-in flow allows your single anonymous access code to be used to connect up to 10&nbsp;devices.  Anonymous access: The revamped login system prepares the way for zk-nyms which will allow you to pay for NymVPN without ever being linked to your use of the&nbsp;app.  Security updates and bug fixes: General improvements make for better app performance and security following an external security&nbsp;audit.  Improved connectivity: A new state machine significantly enhances the stability of network connections.  <p>This app version is currently compatible with <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/macos">MacOS</a>, <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/download/linux">Linux</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">iOS</a>.

Discussions with privacy-focused tech companies and blockchains are in the works, and an affiliate marketing campaign to get NymVPN before the eyes of over 10 millions of eyes worldwide in January is well underway. Expect a big marketing push as the New Year arrives when the app is ready for the general&nbsp;public.</p> Nym rebrand <p>The Nym rebrand is in its final stages, and there are big things on the stove for the New Year! At the beginning of January, you can look forward to some treats: a new visual identity for Nym, a freshly stylized experience of the NymVPN app, and a unified nym.com domain! Look out for Nym’s New Year’s Resolutions for a sneak&nbsp;peak!</p> The Nym&nbsp;network  Magura network&nbsp;update <p>November’s Magura network release improves the reliability of the Nym network and updates Nym tokenomics. And the results are noticeable already with measurable improvements on reliability.</p><p>The Magura release includes the roll-out of “naive rewarding” as an interim step in the token economics powering the network before it goes to fully paid access. And it includes the completion of project smoosh, combining gateway and mixnode functionality into a single Nym node&nbsp;binary.</p> Staking <p>The Magura update has also begun the process of culling non-performing and outdated nodes. As a staker, you should now check your nodes to make sure they are still eligible for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>When in doubt, stake on Nym nodes that are in the official Delegations Program (DP) because they are required to meet the latest requirements! You can find the DP program wallet and list of top quality nodes&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">here</a>.</p> Explorer <p>In the wake of Magura, Nym explorers are getting a major revamp. The official Nym network explorer remains <a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/">here</a>. The explorer currently shows both upgraded Nym nodes as well as legacy gateways and mixnodes to enable a smooth transition to the revamped&nbsp;network.</p><p>Operators and stakers can look forward to an Explorer V2 launching very soon with additional staking and operator features!</p> Important changes for operators <p>Magura includes five main changes that operators need to be aware&nbsp;of:</p>  NYM reward pool is now distributed across 5 layers of nodes to include entry and exit gateways as well as three layers of mix&nbsp;nodes.  Nym nodes are now multi-functional. Operators now simply run a Nym node and then enable gateway and mix node&nbsp;modes.  Project smoosh is complete. This means that operators simply run Nym nodes and the mixnet contract now only “sees” Nym nodes. Operators will have to run up to date software to be included in the active set and gateways will have to get stake for the first time in order to be selected to the active&nbsp;set.  Node selection algorithm now includes a configuration score to determine if a node is included in the active set: Selection = config score * total stake * performance ^ 20. This is to cull any outdated nodes from the set and make sure the network is running up to date software.  Operators now must agree to operator <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> to confirm legally that you do not gather logs on&nbsp;users.

But most important for NymVPN users is that now all Nym nodes are configured to function as both mix nodes and gateways for clients and to receive equal rewards. <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Read more</a> on what this means for the Nym tokenomics powering the privacy network at the foundation of&nbsp;NymVPN.</p> Account sign-up / sign-in&nbsp;flow <p>There is now a new, streamlined system for signing up for NymVPN and logging into the app from multiple&nbsp;devices.</p>  Create account on the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">nymvpn.com</a> with a recovery phrase, and make sure to securely save&nbsp;it!  Use your recovery phrase to log into NymVPN on MacOS, Linux, mobile Android (coming next week), or iOS. Windows will be coming next&nbsp;month  You can then add (up to 10) additional devices by logging in with the same recovery&nbsp;phrase  <p>* Note that fair usage is now enforced from the centralized API based on the anonymous credential. Users can view their account plan fair usage&nbsp;summary.</p> Fixes following security&nbsp;audit <p>Since the July security audit conducted by Cure 53, the Nym team has been working on addressing all the identified bugs and network leaks identified in the report. This release addresses issues related to the authentication with gateways (STS) and session key generation. The Nym SDK has been upgraded to fix these issues in the NymVPN&nbsp;app.</p><p>Stay tuned for a full report on these fixes in the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/trust-center">Nym Trust&nbsp;Center</a>.</p> State Machine <p>A state machine is an important VPN component for maintaining reliable network connections. State machines have now been integrated into WireGuard, daemon, VPNlib, and account controller. This will lead to a more seamless user experience in switching between NymVPN modes and connecting with gateways.</p> Next stop: zk-nyms, beta payments, and plugging all&nbsp;leaks <p>The next release of NymVPN is scheduled for 10–15 December 2024 and will introduce beta payments with zk-nyms for fully unlinkable traffic through NymVPN, as well as major leak&nbsp;fixes.</p> zk-nyms issuance and&nbsp;sending <p>Zk-nyms are the foundation of anonymous access with NymVPN: they ensure that you can pay for access to the Nym network with full anonymity, even from Nym&nbsp;itself!</p><p>When you pay for a traditional, centralized VPN service, your usage of the app, and even your traffic records if they are kept, can be directly linked to your identity through your payment&nbsp;records.</p><p>Nym’s novel solution is a zero-knowledge access credential, whose issuance system is currently being piloted into the NymVPN app. Keep in mind that the real value of zk-nyms comes with unlinking your payment records for your usage of the networks. This means that when NymVPN payments go live next month, users can rest assured that their personal information won’t be compromised.</p> DNS and IPv6&nbsp;leaks <p>Currently, all leaks while connected with NymVPN are fixed. The Nym dev team is continuing its work in plugging all leaks that occur prior to connecting with the NymVPN app. Nym remains committed to not releasing a full commercial version of the app until all these risks are fully addressed.</p><p>Remember, the success of NymVPN depends a lot on our dedicated community of testers.

If you’re excited about the next generation of the internet, check out the show: <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/hrr_h-XC">https://link.chtbl.com/hrr_h-XC</a></p><p>We've heard a lot about the premise and the promise of prediction markets for a long time, but they finally hit the main stage with the most recent election. So what worked (and didn't) this time? Are they really better than pollsters, is polling dead?&nbsp;</p><p>So in this conversation, we tease apart the hype from the reality of prediction markets, from the recent election to market foundations... going more deeply into the how, why, and where these markets work. We also discuss the design challenges and opportunities (including implications for builders throughout). And we also cover other information aggregation mechanisms -- from peer prediction to others -- given that prediction markets are part of a broader category of information-elicitation and information-aggregation mechanisms.&nbsp;<br><br>Where do domain experts, superforecasters, pollsters, and journalists come in (and out)? Where do (and don't) blockchain and crypto technologies come in -- and what specific features (decentralization, transparency, real-time, open source, etc.) matter most, and in what contexts?&nbsp; Finally, we discuss applications for prediction and decision markets -- things we could do right away to in the near-future to sci-fi -- touching on trends like futarchy, AI entering the market, DeSci, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our special expert guests are Alex Taborrok, professor of economics at George Mason University and Chair in Economics at the Mercatus Center; and Scott Duke Kominers, research partner at a16z crypto, and professor at Harvard Business School&nbsp; -- both in conversation with Sonal Chokshi.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder: None of the following should be taken as business, investment, legal, or tax advice; please see a16z.com/disclosures for more important information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resources:<br>(from links to research mentioned to more on the topics discussed)</p>  <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html">The Use of Knowledge in Society</a> by Friedrich Hayek (American Economic Review, 1945)  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eberem/everything_is_priced_in/">Everything is priced in</a> by rsd99 (r/wallstreetbets, 2019)  <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/ideafutures.html">Idea Futures (aka prediction markets, information markets)</a> by Robin Hanson (1996)  <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/books/auctions/paper">Auctions: The Social Construction of Value</a>&nbsp; by Charles Smith  <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/2002%20AER%20Morris%20and%20Shin.pdf">Social value of public information</a> by Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin (American Economic Review, December 2002)  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1516179112">Using prediction markets to estimate the reproducibility of scientific research</a> by Anna Dreber, Thomas Pfeiffer, Johan Almenberg, Siri Isaksson, Brad Wilson, Yiling Chen, Brian Nosek, and Magnus Johannesson (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (November 2015)  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21054">A solution to the single-question crowd wisdom problem</a> by Dražen Prelec, Sebastian Seung, and John McCoy (Nature, January 2017)  <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/Targeting_Entrepreneurs_AER2022_64933cef-316a-437f-8ca4-885d870b2ba1.pdf">Targeting high ability entrepreneurs using community information: Mechanism design in the field</a> by Reshmaan Hussam, Natalia Rigol, and Benjamin Roth (American Economic Review, March 2022)  <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/ms020408.pdf">Information aggregation mechanisms: concept, design, and implementation for a sales forecasting problem</a> by Charles Plott and Kay-Yut Chen, Hewlett Packard Laboratories (March 2002)  <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/if-i-had-a-millhtml">If I had a million</a> [on deciding to dump the CEO or not] by Robin Hanson (2008)  <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html">Futarchy: Vote values, but bet beliefs</a> by Robin Hanson (2013)  <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/11/09/infofinance.html">From prediction markets to info finance</a> by Vitalik Buterin (November 2024)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/">Composability is innovation</a> by Linda Xie (June 2021)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/composability-is-to-software-as-compounding-interest-is-to-finance/">Composability is to software as compounding interest is to finance</a> by Chris Dixon (October 2021)  <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/tags/daos/">resources &amp; research on DAOs</a>, a16z crypto  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stay Updated:&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you think: <a href="https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z">https://ratethispodcast.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/a16z">https://twitter.com/a16z</a></p><p>Find a16z on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z">https://www.linkedin.com/company/a16z</a></p><p>Subscribe on your favorite podcast app: <a href="https://a16z.simplecast.com/">https://a16z.simplecast.com/</a></p><p>Follow our host: <a href="https://twitter.com/stephsmithio">https://twitter.com/stephsmithio</a></p><p>Please note that the content here is for informational purposes only; should NOT be taken as legal, business, tax, or investment advice or be used to evaluate any investment or security; and is not directed at any investors or potential investors in any a16z fund. a16z and its affiliates may maintain investments in the companies discussed.

After its launch vYIELD, VRSC and scrvUSD can be converted freely with each other through the vYIELD’s AMM (automated market maker) function.  Verus DeFi is MEV-resistant with low conversion fees (max. 0.05%.)<a href="http://docs.verus.io/sendcurrency">docs.verus.io</a>  vYIELD’s initial supply is 100,000. After the preconversion period has ended the supply is distributed to the users that preconverted. After that the supply becomes dynamic (burning vYIELD when converting back to VRSC or scrvUSD, and minting vYIELD when depositing VRSC or scrvUSD into its reserves.)  Preconversion is possible until 5 December 2024.

<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  Centered on on-chain growth, BAT Roadmap 3.0 introduces disintermediation, expanded blockchain integrations, and a creator growth program to elevate BAT utility across Web3 and beyond.

 -->
<div class='wrap'>

<p>The focus for BAT Roadmap 3.0 is on-chain growth. Within the Brave Rewards and Brave Creators ecosystems, this means disintermediating the way BAT flows through the platform, expanding self-custody options for payments and contributions, and providing users with new avenues to earn and utilize BAT. Beyond Brave, our focus will be to promote BAT growth and adoption in the broader attention economy, across all blockchains that can support BAT. This means providing even more opportunities for projects, dApps, and creators to integrate BAT utility and grow with the Brave and BAT userbase.</p>
<p>Useful <a>roadmaps</a> provide general direction, while also being flexible enough to anticipate unforeseen challenges. As we iterate and find market fit, it is expected that some roadmap items may become less of a focus over time, while others are emphasized.</p>

 BAT in Brave Rewards 
<p>In line with BAT Roadmap 3.0, we aim to release Brave Rewards 3.0 in the first quarter of 2025, an upgraded Brave Rewards experience.</p>
<p>With Brave Rewards 3.0, we aim to include:</p>

 New ways to earn rewards 
 
 Draws where users can receive larger BAT amounts, earnings multipliers, and other bonuses 
 Rewards for completing on-chain quests 
 Rewards for completing surveys 
 

 New self-custody options 
<p>Expand self-custody payout options to support a wider range of blockchains and Layer 2 networks.</p>

 Redesign and UX overhaul&nbsp; 
<p>Rewards 3.0 will include a totally refreshed design and user experience. This new design implements a modular framework, making it easier to:</p>
 
 Showcase BAT utility cases (dApps, shopping, etc.) 
 Compose new Brave Ads experiences and earning opportunities 
 Integrate Pay with BAT where appropriate within Rewards UX 
 Improve Brave Creators discovery and better connect users with creators 
 

 Rewards Offer Wall 
 
 Introduce a new Rewards Offer Wall with exclusive benefits for Brave Rewards users. The Offer Wall will include a combination of both dynamic, locally-matched offers, and persistent partner deals.&nbsp; 
 Integrate the Brave Ads system to work in tandem with the Offer Wall. For example, use Brave Ads’s local machine learning algorithms to show notifications whenever an offer on the Offer Wall is particularly relevant to a user, is unlocked, or in response to a series of actions the user takes. 
 

 Disintermediation 
 
 Continue to develop and publish work on <a>Boomerang</a>, our decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable incentive protocol 
 Find and work with blockchains and smart contract platforms that can support the implementation of Boomerang’s smart contracts&nbsp; 
 

 BAT in E-commerce 
 
 Pay with BAT for Brave Products like <a>Brave Premium</a> (Brave VPN, Talk, Leo, etc.) 
 Pay with BAT for <a href="https://store.brave.com">Brave Merch Store</a> items 
 Add support for BAT on major crypto payment rails 
 

 BAT in Brave Creators 

 Expand supported platforms 
 
 Significantly increase the number of social platforms available for creators to register their accounts/channels with Brave Creators, including Rumble, Odyssey, and more. This allows creators to collect BAT and other on-chain crypto contributions across a wider range of platforms. 
 Partner with Web3 creator platforms to integrate BAT support, along with other utility incentives. 
 

 Expand blockchain and Layer 2 support for contributions 
 
 Enable creators to link on-chain addresses from more blockchains and Layer 2 networks to their sites and channels, particularly those that support BAT. 
 Add support for Web3 domain names. 
 

 On-chain subscriptions 
<p>Allow users to set up scheduled, on-chain subscriptions to Brave creators.</p>

 Creator Growth Program 
<p>The Creator Growth Program aims to use Brave Ads to grow a creator audience and revenue through collaborations with the Brave &amp; BAT community. It will provide creators with special access to Brave partners, including leading edge AI and Web3 services and tools.</p>

 BAT in AI 
<p>Research and develop BAT utility cases in AI. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_%28machine_learning%29">Attention</a> is both a term of machine learning art and a real human factor in generative AI, so we will experiment with possible roles for BAT in <a>Brave Leo</a>, beyond inclusion in the imminent pay-with-crypto premium option.</p>

 BAT Community 

 BAT Ambassadors Program 
 
 Launch Brave Ads Self-Serve referral program exclusive to BAT Ambassadors. 
 Promote multichain BAT adoption with Ambassador-led workshops.&nbsp; 
 Drive BAT adoption in new regions through content localization and culturally relevant initiatives led by local Ambassadors. 
 

 Partnerships 
 
 Collaborate with Web3 brands and platforms to amplify community-driven content and BAT utility. 
 Partner with creators &amp; KOLs for BAT-themed activations. 
 Host exclusive events with existing Web3 partners for BAT holders. 
 

 Programs 
 
 BAT x Adam Ape NFT program: explore bearer utility program for NFT holders. Potential examples include exclusive access, discounts on Brave Premium products and BAT/Brave merch,&nbsp; etc. 
 Incentivize translation and localization educational BAT content. 
 

 Content and Collaboration 
 
 Broaden BAT Community ECHO NFT magazine’s reach through creator partnerships, promoting BAT adoption with trend-focused content and additional issues available for BAT holders. 
 Spotlight BAT-enabled Brave Creators to highlight success stories and on-chain journeys. 
 

 Collaborate with us

<p>The Zcash Foundation is pleased to announce the upcoming <a href="https://zfnd.org/zconvi/">ZconVI</a>, a virtual gathering of Zcash enthusiasts and experts, scheduled to take place from Tuesday, March 4 to Friday, March 7, 2025. This four-day event promises to be an engaging platform for learning, collaboration, and innovation within the Zcash community.</p>



 Event Overview 



<p>ZconVI will be a fully virtual event, allowing participants from around the globe to join without the constraints of travel. The event will showcase how we can achieve Synergy Through Decentralization, highlighting the collaborative efforts of multiple organizations in planning and executing the event content. However, it is important to note that the sessions themselves are not restricted by any specific theme, providing a broad canvas for diverse topics and discussions.</p>



 Collaborative Approach 



<p>The conference structure is designed to foster collaboration among key organizations within the Zcash ecosystem:</p>



 
 Day 1 (Tuesday, March 4): Zcash Foundation (ZF) will curate the content, setting the tone for the conference with insightful sessions and discussions. 



 Day 2 (Wednesday, March 5): Electric Coin Company (ECC) will take charge of planning, bringing their expertise and vision to the forefront. 



 Day 3 (Thursday, March 6): Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) will organize the day’s content. Notably, they are encouraged to explore topics beyond their direct funding activities. 



 Day 4 (Friday, March 7): ZecHub will conclude the event with a day filled with innovative ideas and community-driven discussions. 
 



<p>Each day will feature a co-curated panel session. These panels are a collaborative effort among all partner organizations.</p>



<p>ZF is proud to continue to support <a href="https://www.zkav.club/">Zk AV Club</a> by awarding them a grant for ZconVI. Zk AV Club, under Ryan Taylor’s leadership, will have complete creative freedom to empower communities and amplify their individual voices. For each day of ZconVI, alongside the official event programming, Zk AV Club will be hosting an interactive live podcast. ZF will be working with a separate production company to livestream the event, which will further free up Zk AV Club’s time so they can do what they do best!&nbsp;</p>



 Logistics and Coordination 



<p>Zcash Foundation will handle all logistical aspects of ZconVI. This includes managing audiovisual needs, registration processes, attendee communication, graphic design for event materials, and more. The Foundation will again utilize the well-received Whova platform, and update the app to maximize opportunities for community engagement throughout the conference.</p>



<p>Each participating organization will have a liaison working closely with the Foundation to ensure that all necessary information for their planned sessions is communicated effectively.</p>



 Request for Proposals 



<p>ZconVI is set to be an unmissable event for anyone interested in the future of privacy technology and decentralized systems. Contribute to the diverse lineup of sessions and panels curated by leading organizations in the Zcash ecosystem. We invite you to <a href="https://forms.gle/Q74f38ZDYwky2ogD6">submit an RFP</a> outlining how your presentation will move a project, conversation or idea forward for the Zcash ecosystem.</p>



 Stay Tuned 



<p>Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking virtual conference as we explore the synergy of decentralization! Attendee registration will open in February 2025 and be free of charge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please check <a href="https://zfnd.org/zconvi/">Zcash Foundation’s website</a> for answers to frequently asked questions and ongoing updates. Additionally, we will post updates on the <a href="https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/">Zcash Forum</a> and <a href="http://@zcashfoundation">Twitter/X</a> as planning progresses.</p>

 Magura network update and readying latest release of&nbsp;NymVPN <p>Nym’s major network update (Magura) went live last Tuesday, setting the stage for what will become a <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">novel form of Nym tokenomics</a>. With payments live, usage of NymVPN will be linked with NYM buy-orders which in turn will be rewarded to Nym node operators providing privacy protections for&nbsp;users.</p><p>After some delays as a result of network instability following the Magura release, the release of the latest NymVPN app is now scheduled for next&nbsp;week.</p><p>Below is everything you need to know about these two important releases. Here’s the full <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nymvpn-roadmap-through-2024">timeline</a> for NymVPN finishing out 2024. Don’t forget, this is all in lead up to the two big&nbsp;things:</p>  December 2024: Early bird access to the robust NymVPN app with payments!  January 2025: The official launch of NymVPN to the world, at a symbolic time when it needs a real paradigm shift in online&nbsp;privacy  <p>Remember, NymVPN Beta is still open and free to use, so <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">sign up today</a> and instantly receive a free 30-day access voucher. Nym needs your testing, testing,&nbsp;testing!</p> Network <p>The Nym network underwent a major update with the release of Magura v2024.13. This release prepares the network for the latest stable release of NymVPN next week as well as the foundational tokenomics for node operators.</p> What changes with&nbsp;Magura?   Operation smoosh is complete: Now all Nym nodes will function as both mix nodes and entry/exit gateways.  Rewards distribution: Rewards will be distributed equally across all three layers: entry gateways, mix nodes, and exit gateways.  Removing under-performing nodes: Nodes are now required to run the latest Nym binaries and to agree to the node <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> committing importantly to <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nyms-zero-knowledge-network">no-log’s policies</a>. This will increase the overall performance of the Nym network for clients. Nodes not meeting these conditions will not be eligible to be part of the active&nbsp;set.  <p>Read about all the changes to <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Nym operator tokenomics here</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3G1pJqvO2VM?si=9QBbkfldnycyD0_C">watch the recent Node Operator Town Hall</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p> Patch for mainnet instability <p>While the Magura release worked stably in sandbox, the mainnet release led to some unexpected network instability. The dev team has now worked through the issues and released a Magura patch today which should begin to stabilize connectivity once&nbsp;again.</p><p>Huge thanks to the operator community for being active and responsive!</p> Note for NYM&nbsp;stakers <p>If you’re staking on Nym nodes, please stay tuned for guidance next week on restaking your tokens following this week’s network&nbsp;changes.</p> Changes to explorers <p>The release of Magura means that current explorers will soon be replaced. For the time being, please refer to <a href="https://harbourmaster.nymtech.net/">harbourmaster</a> for node and network information.</p> NymVPN  NymVPN v2024.11 coming next&nbsp;week <p>Due to the network issues following the Magura release, the latest stable release of the NymVPN app, originally scheduled for Nov. 21, has been postponed until next week while the dev team implements needed fixes. Nym remains committed to delivering the highest quality technology to our community.</p><p>This delay will not affect the next release and launch of payments on 12 December 2024 as&nbsp;promised</p> What to expect from NymVPN&nbsp;v2024.11 <p>Here are some of the important things to expect from the latest NymVPN&nbsp;release:</p>  A streamlined sign-up/sign-in flow  Network and connection stability thanks to state machine implementations across&nbsp;apps  The launch of the zk-nym credential system ahead of payments in&nbsp;December  Security fixes as a result of the July 2024 security&nbsp;audit  <p>Stay tuned for the NymVPN v2024.11 release announcement next week for compatible devices and confirmed changes.</p><p>Until next week comrades!

<p>November 21, 2024 — Today, we’re excited to announce the latest addition to Brave Search: chat mode for Answer with AI. This new feature offers the option to ask follow-up questions from the basis of an initial query to Brave Search.</p>
<p>It’s available today for all <a href="https://search.brave.com">Brave Search</a> users around the world.</p>

 Building on the foundation of “Answer with AI” 
<p><a>Earlier this year</a>, we introduced “Answer with AI” in Brave Search, becoming the only large-scale, real-time answer engine focused on privacy and free from Big Tech dependencies. Since its launch, usage has surged, with “Answer with AI” now generating more than 11 million answers daily. These AI-powered summaries appear at the top of the search results page whenever a question-like query is detected, offering users quick, concise information.</p>

    
    Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>Question-like queries deliver helpful summaries sourcing information from across the Web.</p>

 Combining the best of both worlds 
<p>As generative AI and chat interfaces become increasingly popular, we’ve observed that users rely on different tools for different needs:</p>
 
 
<p>Search engines excel at scouring the web to retrieve images, links, and information based on a single query. However, they’re limited in allowing follow-up questions or maintaining context, so each new query essentially starts from scratch.</p>
 
 
<p>Chat applications, by contrast, facilitate conversational interactions, which are great for exploring topics through related questions and maintaining context. However, they’re not optimized for broad web searches; getting relevant search-like results often requires toggling a setting or crafting the query in a particular way.</p>
 
 
<p>Brave Search bridges this gap by adapting the experience based on the nature of each query, eliminating the need for users to choose between chat-first or search-first approaches. Starting today, when a query is recognized as a question, Brave Search provides a summary with a chat bar (answers can also be triggered manually by clicking the AI icon to the right of the search magnifying glass icon). Engaging with this chat bar opens a chat experience, allowing users to explore the topic in more depth.</p>
<p>This experience is powered by a combination of open and internal LLMs, plus Brave Search results. This allows Brave Search to ground responses in real-time search results, significantly reducing the chance of AI hallucinations.</p>

    
    Your browser does not support the video tag.

<p>Asking a follow up question expands the initial answer into a chat experience, offering sources along the way to highlight the origin of the information surfaced with each new question.</p>
<p>Side-by-side, it’s clear how Brave Search offers the best of both worlds, whether the user starts with search-like or chat-like query:</p>

<p>*Chats are ephemeral by default and expire within six hours. An option to save chats to Brave’s Leo AI assistant is coming soon.</p>

 Privacy by default 
<p>The new chat feature has all the same privacy protections of Brave Search and its Answer with AI feature. Brave Search does not profile you or store your queries. The same is true when using chat mode in Answer with AI: these conversations are ephemeral, meaning they’re not persisted or stored. Your conversations with Answer with AI remain safe and private.</p>

 How to try it 
<p>All Brave Search users, regardless of what browser they’re using to access the Web, can take advantage of the new chat feature.</p>
<p>If Brave Search is already <a href="https://search.brave.com">set as your browser’s default search engine</a>, simply start typing in your browser’s address bar. If Brave Search isn’t your default search, you can visit <a href="https://search.brave.com">search.brave.com</a> in any browser. Once you enter a query, you’ll see an Answer with AI summary right at the top of the results page for most queries. From here you can simply ask a follow-up question.</p>
<p>And while we strive to offer follow-up chat to everyone for free, reasonable usage limits apply.</p>


    


    

 
     
        
        
        
        
     
 

 About Brave Search 
<p>Brave Search is the fastest growing independent search engine since Bing. Unlike <a>Big Tech</a> search engines, Brave Search does not profile its users; unlike supposedly alternative engines, Brave Search serves results from a truly independent index of the Web. This means Brave Search can offer both industry-leading privacy and an effective counter to the bias and censorship prevalent in Big Tech’s personalization.</p>
<p>Brave Search continues to reach new all-time highs, serving more than 36 million queries per day (and more than 1 billion queries each month). It’s the default search engine for most new <a>Brave browser</a> users, which now has over 70 million users worldwide.</p>

  Brave Research introduces Boomerang, a privacy-preserving protocol that decentralizes Brave Rewards while enabling verifiable ad interactions. Users can earn rewards anonymously through cryptographic proofs.

<p>This post describes work by Ralph Ankele, Sofia Celi, Ralph Giles and Hamed Haddadi.</p>

 Enabling verifiable advertisement interaction and reward computation with privacy-preserving cryptography 
<p>In today’s data-driven world, digital interactions are continually monitored. Many online platforms use data-driven incentive schemes to reward users for engaging with content, like watching ads or participating in surveys. However, these schemes often come with a catch: they may collect and store personal data to track engagement. This presents a problem because users are essentially sacrificing their privacy for small rewards, leaving their data vulnerable to misuse.</p>
<p>Privacy-preserving incentive schemes offer a solution by allowing users to receive rewards without exposing their personal information. Brave Rewards, for example, is designed to reward users for viewing ads while keeping their data private. The system respects user privacy by ensuring that ad engagement data stays on their device, never shared or stored externally. However, as demand for verifiable, decentralized systems grows, enhancing this model to provide stronger guarantees of privacy and reward accuracy is critical.</p>

 Privacy-Preserving Incentive Protocols 
<p>Privacy-preserving incentive schemes are becoming essential as digital platforms increasingly seek ways to reward users for engagement without compromising their personal information. These schemes rely on cryptographic methods to ensure that users can verify rewards and interactions without exposing sensitive data. The primary goal is to create an ecosystem where users maintain anonymity while still benefiting from their engagement.</p>
<p>The Boomerang protocol builds upon the following research works: The <a href="https://petsymposium.org/2016/files/papers/Black-Box_Accumulation__Collecting_Incentives_in_a_Privacy-Preserving_Way.pdf">Black-Box Accumulator (BBA)</a> scheme works by “accumulating” tokens without directly associating them with the user, creating a layer of privacy around interactions. <a href="https://homepage.rub.de/andy.rupp/papers/bbap_full_paper.pdf">BBA+</a>, an improved version of BBA that optimizes cryptographic proofs, prevents double spending, and supports negative point collection, making it more efficient. Building on these foundations, <a href="https://petsymposium.org/popets/2020/popets-2020-0010.pdf">Black-Box Wallets (BBW)</a> is a privacy-preserving payment solution tailored for constrained devices. Another noteworthy protocol in the privacy-preserving incentive landscape is <a href="https://www.petsymposium.org/2018/files/papers/issue3/popets-2018-0026.pdf">Privacy Pass</a>. Originally designed as an anti-bot mechanism, Privacy Pass can be used as a versatile tool for privacy-preserving rewards.</p>
<p>Brave Rewards currently uses Privacy Pass as a key component of its system, enabling users to earn rewards in a privacy-respecting way. For example, when users engage with Brave Ads or perform certain actions (such as viewing an ad or clicking on one), Privacy Pass generates cryptographic tokens (not to be confused with BATs) to validate these interactions without revealing specific details about the user’s identity or browsing habits.</p>

 The Boomerang Protocol explained 
<p>The Boomerang protocol specifies a novel decentralized privacy-preserving incentive protocol to securely and privately store user interactions within an incentive system. The protocol leverages cryptographic methods to transparently compute rewards for users, ensuring verifiability while preserving their privacy.</p>
<p>The protocol defines four components that are interacting with each other:</p>
 
 
<p>Client: This is the Brave browser with Brave Rewards enabled. The client can be on any platform, either desktop or mobile. This actor is who interacts with the advertisements, and gets rewarded in return for interacting with the ads.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Issuer: This is the provider of the incentive system. This actor verifies the correct computations of the client, and also initiates the rewards payment for the client. For instance, Brave can be an issuer for the Boomerang incentive system.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Advertiser: These are individual advertisers that promote their content, that are shown to clients that have Brave Rewards enabled within their Brave browser. Clients can interact with those advertisements and get rewarded for doing so.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>L1 Blockchain: This can be any blockchain that offers smart contracts, and implements the Boomerang protocol. This actor publicly and transparently verifies the correctness of the rewards computation and issues the payment to the user.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>They interact as illustrated below:</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>Let’s consider an example, to see how Boomerang works in detail. The User, let’s call him Joe in our example, no longer wants to be left out when looking at advertisements while browsing the web. Moreover, Joe wants to see privacy-respecting advertisements and therefore enables Brave Rewards in his Brave Browser. After enabling Brave Rewards, a token is initialized by the Client he is using, either the desktop Brave browser, or on his mobile device. The issuer of the incentive system, in that case Brave, is sent a Proof of Issuance, to verify that everything was correctly initiated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, Joe is browsing the web as he normally does, interacting with some advertisements along the way. In the background, the advertisement interaction is stored on Joe’s client, and a Proof of Token Update of the regularly updated interaction state is shared in zero-knowledge with the Issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After interacting with advertisements for a while, and collecting reward points, Joe decides to ask to get rewarded for his interactions. His client sends a request for reward computation, and the Issuer creates a Reward Proof, specifying how much Joe will get paid for interacting with the incentive system. This Reward Proof is then sent to a L1 Blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The L1 Blockchain runs a smart contract and publicly verifies in a transparent way that the rewards computation has been done correctly, and the proof is valid. Finally, the smart contract issues payment of the reward to Joe. And that’s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a nutshell, that is how the Boomerang protocol works. All the proofs mentioned above are cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs, that enable a Prover to prove the correctness of a statement, without the Verifier learning anything about the statement. Moreover, the individual advertisement interactions are collected in an unlinkable way using blinding and unblinding techniques, meaning they cannot be linked together. Finally, as the smart contract that verifies the rewards computation is public and transparent, the User can verify that the computations of the Issuer have been done correctly. This is what makes the Boomerang protocol a decentralized privacy-preserving verifiable incentive system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Boomerang Protocol extended 
<p>The Boomerang protocol can be split into three procedures/sub-protocols. These are:</p>
 
 
<p>Issuance: This procedure initializes the token,</p>
 
 
<p>Collection: This procedure updates the token with the advertisement interactions of the user,</p>
 
 
<p>Spending/Verification: This procedure redeems the collected points and creates a rewards proof that can be verified on a L1 blockchain.</p>
 
 
<p>We will provide details about each of the procedures next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Issuance Procedure 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The aim of this procedure is to jointly generate tokens, between the User and Issuer, that the User commits to and the Issuer can blindly sign. Boomerang leverages <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-46766-1_9.pdf">Pedersen commitments</a> for the User to commit to the advertisement interactions. Moreover, we leverage the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/298.pdf">Blind Signatures with attributes (ACL) scheme</a> so the Issuer can blindly sign the tokens. After a User verifies the blind signature, they then build a cryptographic accumulator called a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/756">CurveTree</a> and make the root of the tree public.</p>

 Collection Procedure 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The Collection procedure consists of adding positive points to the token, representing individual interactions with advertisements, in an unlinkable manner. The correctness of the token update is ensured by several zero-knowledge proofs based on <a href="https://www.cs.au.dk/~ivan/Sigma.pdf">Sigma protocols</a>.The Issuer can verify the correctness of those proofs and blindly sign the tokens. In return, the User verifies the blind signature and rebuilds the accumulator.</p>

 Spending/Verification Procedure 


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The Spending/Verification procedure works similarly to the Collection procedure. The exception is that instead of adding positive points, this procedure will add negative points (i.e. the amount of points that should be the reward) to the token. Additionally to updating the tokens, the Issuer creates the Reward proof, where we leverage range proofs from the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1066.pdf">Bulletproof</a> zero-knowledge proofs. This Reward proof can then be verified in a smart contract on a L1 blockchain in a transparent and public verifiable manner.</p>

 Demo Time 
<p>To illustrate further how the Boomerang protocol works, let’s put it in practice. We have implemented a simple proof of concept implementation in Rust which is available at: <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/Boomerang">https://github.com/brave-experiments/Boomerang</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After cloning the git repository you can run the demo by first building using</p>
 <code>cargo  build
</code> <p>Next, you can run a server instance, simulating the Issuer by running</p>
 <code>cargo  run  --example  server
</code> <p>Clients can be simulated by running a client instance with</p>
 <code>cargo  run  --example  client
</code> <p>The end to end demo will start up a server instance, and one client instance. Then it will go over all the three procedures of the Boomerang protocol, as explained above. Initially, the Issuance procedure will be called, that initializes the token. Next, the Collection procedure is called, which updates the token with some advertisement interactions. Finally, the SpendVerify procedure is called, which initiates a reward calculation. For the purpose of simply showcasing the proof of concept, the reward proof is verified by the client instead of being sent to a L1 blockchain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The output of the server instance should look like this</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    
<p>The output of the client instance looks like this</p>


    
    

    


    



      
      
    

 Conclusion 
<p>Boomerang is a novel decentralized privacy-preserving verifiable incentive protocol. The protocol leverages cryptographic methods to transparently compute rewards for users, ensuring verifiability while preserving their privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more detailed technical description of the protocol can be found in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01353">technical report</a>. A demo implementation is further available at: <a href="https://github.com/brave-experiments/Boomerang">https://github.com/brave-experiments/Boomerang</a></p>

  Partnering with Rox: Every Seller Needs an Agent Swarm  <p>Ishan, Chris, Avanika, Diogo, Shriram and their team are combining GTM and AI expertise to build a single source of truth for enterprise sales.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/konstantine-buhler/">Konstantine Buhler</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/josephine-chen/">Josephine Chen</a>	 



Published November 19, 2024
  



Team Rox.



 
<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of enterprise sales, the most successful teams aren’t just selling—they’re orchestrating complex, data-driven relationships with their most valuable accounts. Yet despite the proliferation of sales tools, account executives at leading companies still spend countless hours manually gathering intelligence, tracking customer signals, and managing workflows across disconnected systems. That’s why we’re excited to announce our partnership with <a href="https://www.rox.com/">Rox</a>, leading their seed round with participation from GV and General Catalyst and now joining this new Series A, to bring the power of AI agents to enterprise sales teams.</p>



<p>Rox is reimagining how modern enterprise sales teams work by introducing what some call an “Agentic CRM”—though that description only scratches the surface. Rather than replacing existing systems, Rox seamlessly integrates with platforms such as Salesforce, Zendesk and ERPs to transform company data into an intelligent agent swarm that autonomously monitors, engages and manages customer relationships. Each agent can be equipped with capabilities like finding recent news, analyzing sentiment and identifying engagement opportunities—all powered by sophisticated AI that understands the nuances of B2B relationships. This enables the Rox platform to quickly become a single source of truth for its customers.</p>



<p>What sets Rox apart is its laser focus on serious enterprise sellers doing account-based selling. This isn’t a tool for small sales teams—it’s purpose-built for organizations with sophisticated sales motions targeting their largest and most strategic accounts. The platform’s warehouse-native architecture ensures it can handle enterprise-scale data while maintaining the flexibility needed for complex sales workflows.</p>



<p>The founding team brings together a rare combination of GTM expertise, company-building skill and technical brilliance. Founder Ishan Mukherjee formerly built Pixie into a beloved observability platform before getting acquired into New Relic. At New Relic he applied the observability DNA to leading growth efforts including the self-serve business, PLG, global marketing and inside sales. Chris Ré and Avanika Narayan have pioneered industry-leading research in data preparation with advanced AI. Fun fact: Avanika was formerly an intern at Sequoia and we can personally testify that her brilliance is only matched by her work ethic. The dream team is completed with growth expert Diogo Ribeiro and infrastructure engineering dynamo Shriram Sridharan who have built and scaled GTM and AI systems at companies including AWS, Confluent and ThousandEyes (part of Cisco). This team’s deep understanding of both enterprise sales challenges and cutting-edge AI has enabled them to create something truly unique: a warehouse-native system of workflow built specifically for customer-facing representatives.</p>



<p>The results speak for themselves. In private beta, Rox has already helped 35+ revenue teams at leading B2B organizations including Ramp, MongoDB, Confluent, OpenAI and Redis transform their sales operations. Account executives using Rox are reclaiming more than eight hours per week while increasing customer activity by more than 35%. Several enterprise customers have seen their investment pay off twofold in sales-accepted pipeline, leading them to expand their deployments. Our team at Sequoia has seen the benefits firsthand—Rox is now integrated into our own internal CMS. And with the launch of their public beta, the platform is now available for all enterprise teams to start using for free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As AI continues to reshape how we work, we believe Rox represents the future of enterprise sales. Their team of 15 builders (and growing quickly—they’re <a href="https://www.rox.com/company#join-us">hiring</a>!) is rapidly expanding the platform’s capabilities while maintaining the high-touch support that sophisticated sales organizations demand. We at Sequoia are proud to partner with Ishan, Chris, Avanika, Diogo, Shriram and the entire team as they help the world’s best revenue teams sell more, smarter. The future of intelligent enterprise sales is here, and it’s being built at Rox.</p>

  Starting with version 1.73, Brave is significantly improving its adblocking capabilities by adding support for procedural cosmetic filtering of page elements.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the 31st post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Anton Lazarev (Senior Adblock Research Engineer), Stephen Heaps (Senior Software Engineer, iOS), and Pete Snyder (Principal Privacy Researcher). This post was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (Lead for Privacy Engineering).</p>
<p>Starting with version 1.73 on all platforms, Brave is significantly improving its adblocking capabilities by adding support for procedural cosmetic filtering of page elements. This means that Brave will block more ads, break fewer websites, and be more precise with blocking intrusive page elements.</p>
<p>Brave already offers best-in-class ad and <a>tracker</a> blocking. We block privacy-harmful network requests to trackers, which prevents ad companies and data brokers from following you around the Web. This also has the nice side effect of boosting performance and making the Web less cluttered. Sometimes, however, blocking <a>third-party ads</a> will cause websites to break visually: there’s blank space where the ad would’ve been. Plus, in some cases, it’s not possible to block ads via network request blocking because the ad content is mixed in with the website’s content.</p>
<p>To get around this, Brave does <a>cosmetic filtering</a> of unwanted page elements, where we hide page elements using CSS selectors. In the following example, we can find and block the ad element by targeting elements using CSS classes “post” and “ad”.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Not all elements can be hidden by CSS selectors. CSS is declarative, meaning it controls the appearance and layout of a page based on the page’s structure rather than content. This makes it harder for us to tell the difference between an ad and other page content when an ad is made to look similar to the rest of the page. In the following example, the CSS class name for the element that contains a friend’s social media post (that the user wants to see) is the same as the CSS class name for a promoted ad element (that the user does not want to see). CSS alone cannot block the ad without also hiding other posts, which would effectively break the website. Additionally, in cases where the website’s CSS class attributes are auto-generated, non-distinctive, and constantly changing, matching on CSS causes frequent breakage.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>Procedural (as opposed to declarative) cosmetic filtering overcomes this by letting us describe how to target an element to hide. Procedural filtering lets us define conditions like “block list elements containing the text BUY THIS PRODUCT”. This allows for fine-grained matching on page elements: we can target elements containing specific words, meeting a minimum text length, or with a particular HTML ancestor. All in all, this significantly expands the kind of unwanted content we can block on the Web.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>As a reminder, Brave blocks third-party ads and trackers by default. We also offer an optional <a href="https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022806212-How-do-I-use-Shields-while-browsing#h_01HXSZ8JPGXHQV47D36QXBB3DV">Aggressive blocking mode</a> that blocks all ads, even <a>first-party</a>. We expect procedural filtering to be especially impactful in Aggressive mode.</p>
<p>Procedural filtering is a <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/16935">long-awaited feature</a> that was technically challenging to pull off in a performant way. We’re excited to have you see the benefits!</p>

 Progressing from free Beta network to fair usage and a market-ready Nym&nbsp;network <p>NymVPN is about to launch. This will be the first commercial application to run on the Nym network, taking the network from its current free and experimental phase to a fully fledged, market-ready, and secure traffic routing network for the age of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-token-buyback-33e3ec88c4dc">NYM token buy-back</a> is currently trialing the mechanics of a perpetual buyback mechanism to be provided by NymVPN subscriptions.</p><p>To get there, Nym’s tokenomics will be going through some major upgrades over the next three months. This article provides an overview of upcoming changes to Nym tokenomics and contains important information for node operators, stakers, and those of you who have been following Nym’s evolution over the past couple of&nbsp;years.</p> Snapshot of changes to Nym tokenomics <p>Nym has so far been free to use and nodes have been bootstrapped with rewards from a mixmining pool. With the launch of NymVPN app the network is entering into paid phase and rewards will be correlated to actual network usage. How will this&nbsp;work?</p><p>User subscriptions will trigger NYM token buy-orders, which are then used to reward operators, stakers, and the Nym team for running and maintaining the network software, creating a flywheel effect that benefits the whole ecosystem. This closes the loop in the virtuous cycle of Nym token economics.</p><p>To get there, Nym token economics has to go through a series of changes, the first being “naive rewarding” to update the reward algorithm. This is scheduled to happen in the next 24 hours with the Magura&nbsp;release.</p><p>Stakers and operators have to take action to continue to earn rewards. Breaking changes to APIs can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nymtech/nym/pull/4903">here</a>.</p><p>For a full presentation of the changes and what they mean for operators, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3G1pJqvO2VM?si=9QBbkfldnycyD0_C">watch the recent Node Operator Town&nbsp;Hall</a>.</p> Immediate changes: Naive rewarding <p>The Magura release will be happening in the next 24 hours. This is a major network release that will update Nym token economics and likely have effects on operator and staker&nbsp;rewards.</p> Effects for&nbsp;stakers <p>To maintain a high level of staking rewards and contribute to a performative network, we encourage all stakers&nbsp;to:</p>  Review the nodes to which you are staking at the end of the week to check if they have upgraded. We expect there to be a number of passive and outdated nodes which will be removed from the reward set, so check to make sure you are not delegating to a “dead”&nbsp;node!  If necessary, move your stake to new nodes that have upgraded, have a high performance and config score, and can serve the functions of both mix nodes and gateways.  We encourage stakers to support nodes in the Delegations program in particular as these have gone through a rigorous vetting process. Find the full list&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.nymtech.net/account/n1rnxpdpx3kldygsklfft0gech7fhfcux4zst5lw">here</a>.  If in doubt, ask in <a href="https://t.me/+ij-6sxGT6XM2ZTU6">community channels</a> to understand if a node&nbsp;*:    is running the latest&nbsp;software  has a good config&nbsp;score  has a good performance score  agreed to operator Terms &amp; Conditions  <p>* All nodes participating in the Nym Delegations Program meet these criteria, and all nodes delegated to by the Nym Treasury wallet are Delegations Program participants.</p> Effects for operators <p>Many of our more active operators will be well prepared for the upcoming changes already after having attended the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3G1pJqvO2VM?si=9QBbkfldnycyD0_C">Operator Town Hall</a> a couple of weeks&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Here is a summary of the main changes that will happen as part of the Magura&nbsp;release:</p>  The 2% emissions from the mixmining pool will now be distributed across 5 layers of active nodes rather than 3. This is to ensure that gateways are rewarded algorithmically rather than only via grants. The aim is to encourage more nodes to run in gateway mode and enable more gateway options for end-users.  Action: Completion of project smoosh requires that operators upgrade to run the Nym node binary. This means operators will be running a single binary for either gateway or mix node mode. Gateways will have to get stake for the first time in order to be selected to the active&nbsp;set.  A configuration score is now included in the node selection algorithm to determine if a node is included in the active set: Selection = config score * total stake * performance ^ 20. This is to cull any outdated nodes from the set and make sure the network is running up to date software.  All node operators will have to do smart contract migration from legacy modes to Nym Node to receive any rewards (to be done via Nym&nbsp;wallet).  Action: Operators have to agree to operator Terms &amp; Conditions to confirm legally that they do not gather logs on&nbsp;users.  <p>The effect of these changes are expected to be a more performant network and better spread of gateway options for users of the Nym network. And it is the next step towards the fully fledged virtuous cycle of Nym tokenomics!</p> Nym’s vision: Fair usage, fair&nbsp;rewards <p>The end goal of Nym token economics is to have a virtuous cycle flywheel in which increasing adoption leads to a scaling of the network and rewards. Currently, stakers and node operators are rewarded from the mixmining pool, which is bootstrapping rewards while the network is free to use. With the network entering a paid version, rewards can soon become tied to real world&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Fair usage and fair rewards simply means that users will be paying for network services and that payments will enter the node reward pool with a percentage going towards topping up operator and staker rewards. But there is a lot more happening under the hood to make sure&nbsp;that:</p>  nodes are rewarded based on actual usage of their&nbsp;services  measurement of actual usage does not deanonymize a&nbsp;user!  <p>The Nym R&amp;D and dev teams have been very busy this past year to flesh out this scheme, combining zero-knowledge cryptography, evolving the coconut credential scheme into “e-cash” and now finally the zk-nym credential scheme. Zk-nyms ensure that a user’s payment is entirely de-linked from their network usage. For a full breakdown of the virtuous cycle enabled by zk-nyms, read more&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/the-nym-token-flow-powering-the-worlds-most-private-network-48c15db379c5]">here</a>.</p><p>For stakers and operators, the end goal is to have a rapidly scalable network, with no limits on the number of gateways. Rewards will be based on tickets gathered by gateways andrepresenting real usage. Nodes will be multi-functional. They will continuously have the chance to earn dVPN rewards as both entry and exit gateways. And they will compete with each other every epoch for the chance to earn additional rewards by getting into the active set of the Nym’s noise generating mixnet as either gateways or mixnodes.</p> Preview of fair usage, fair rewarding  Timeline overview <p>Here’s a breakdown of what to expect from the Nym node roadmap each month into&nbsp;2025.</p> Mid-November   Release (Magura): The release will include gateways in the reward algorithm, with mixmining emissions divided across not just mixnodes, but also gateways. We expect this release to result in a slight decrease in mix node rewards due to more layers being rewarded, but with more chances for active set selection as old nodes will be&nbsp;removed.  Staker action: Review delegations and restake if necessary.  Operator action: Operators will at this point have to run up-to-date software, aka “smooshed” Nym nodes. They will also have to agree to operator T&amp;Cs in order to be selected for the active set. Configuration scores will become part of the selection algorithm: config score * total stake * performance ^20  Team action: Onboard service grantees to the Delegations Program.   End of&nbsp;November   Release (Crunch): The release will include an IPv6 listener for gateways and allow operators to run a node in all modes (entry, exit gateway, and mix node, with all exit gateway-enabled nodes also serving as dVPN&nbsp;nodes).  Operator action: Enable your Nym node to run in all&nbsp;modes.  Team action: A new service grants program will the expand number and coverage of gateways.   December   NymVPN early bird&nbsp;launch  New network explorer&nbsp;release  Staker action: Use the explorer to explore nodes and fine-tune your staking for maximum network performance and staker&nbsp;rewards.   2025   Release: Fair network usage, fair rewarding. This is the fully-fledged paid version of the network. Rewards will be based on tickets gathered from usage, with rewards matching real world network usage. The mixmining pool will continue to bootstrap rewards as usage&nbsp;grows.  <p>So if you’re a node operator: upgrade, review, restake, and get ready for the future of&nbsp;Nym.</p><p>And if you’re curious about Nym, sign up for NymVPN today for <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">a 30-day free&nbsp;trial</a>!</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-virtuous-token-cycle-next-step-magura-fc5eb3fd2941">Nym’s virtuous token cycle: Next step, Magura</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Starting with iOS version 1.71, Brave is rolling out a way to quickly delete browsing data that sites can use to identify you across visits. It's called Shred.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>This is the thirtieth post in an <a>ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Stephen Heaps (Senior Software Engineer, iOS), Jacob Sikorski (iOS Privacy Engineer) and Agustín Ruiz (DesignOps Lead), and was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (Lead for Privacy Engineering).</p>
<p>Starting with iOS version 1.71, Brave is rolling out a way to quickly delete browsing data that sites can use to identify you across visits. It’s called Shred.</p>



    


    



<p>Shred lets you instantly erase data a site might have stored on your device. Unlike similar features in other mobile browsers, Shred lets you delete data for a particular site with a single tap. This means you won’t be forcibly logged out of all your favorite websites every time you erase data, and you won’t have to maintain a list of site-by-site exceptions.</p>
<p>While other browsers are trying to catch up with Brave’s industry-leading protections against third-party tracking, few are talking about the risks of first-party tracking—that is, of websites tracking you across sessions. This kind of tracking allows sites to monitor how often you visit, limit access to content (e.g. with messages like “you have 5 articles left this month”), and share first-party data about you with their partners (e.g. via server-side tracking). Shred disrupts this kind of tracking by letting you clear site-specific data, and preventing companies from building detailed profiles or tracking your interactions with them over time.</p>

 How to use Shred 

 Shred data now 
<p>You can immediately Shred a site in three different ways:</p>
 
 Long-press the tabs button 
 Tap the Shred button in the tabs tray 
 Select the new Shred option in Shields 
 
<p>


    


    



      
      
    



    


    



      
      
    



    


    



      
      
    </p>
<p>Shred works on a per-site basis, since that is the privacy boundary for cookies and storage. When you Shred a site, all tabs open to that site are closed, and locally stored data for that site is erased.</p>

 Automatically shred 
<p>Auto Shred lets you automatically delete data for specific sites, so you don’t have to remember to clear data from specific sites. To do so:</p>
 
 Open Shields. 
 Tap Advanced Controls. 
 Tap Shred Site Data. 
 
<p>You can configure Auto Shred to happen when all tabs for a site are closed, or on browser restart. Auto Shredding on Site Tabs Closed means that whenever you close the last tab for a site, Brave will automatically Shred that site’s data.</p>



    


    



      
      
    
<p>You can also set Auto Shred to happen for all sites:</p>
 
 Open Settings. 
 Tap Shields &amp; Privacy. 
 Tap Auto Shred.&nbsp; 
 



    


    



      
      
    
<p>The Auto Shred feature for iOS works like the <a>“Forget me when I close this site”</a> feature on Desktop and Android. When Shred becomes available on Desktop and Android, it will replace the “Forget me when I close this site” feature.</p>

 What data does Shred delete? 
<p>Shredding <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/blob/4bfe3aa4ee68cca47b8b0c2ea2714fdae6e038fb/ios/brave-ios/Sources/Brave/Frontend/Browser/TabManager.swift#L889-L935">deletes both data</a> explicitly stored by the site (e.g. cookies and local storage) and implicit data (e.g. network-related caches). To make sure Shred clears as much data as possible, Shred will also clear local data stored using so-called <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/26199">private WebKit APIs</a>.</p>

 Looking ahead 
<p>While Brave for iOS leads in privacy among iOS browsers, it still lags behind the privacy protections offered by Brave on Android and Desktop. Shredding clears virtually all site data but <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/41900">some limited types</a> of data are beyond our reach due to platform limitations imposed by Apple.</p>
<p>We’re working to bring the Shred feature to Android and Desktop for a consistent experience across platforms. We want our users to browse the Web safely and comfortably, free from intrusive ads and tracking, with privacy controls that work for them. Privacy should be easy by default—and maybe even fun.</p>

 Showcasing how Nym is more than a VPN to the&nbsp;world <p>It meant many overnight flights for the Nym core team, but we managed to do it all in one week: from DevCon in Bangkok to Web Summit in Lisbon, Nym showcased the upcoming launch of NymVPN and its underlying community and&nbsp;network.</p><p>The crowds couldn’t be more different, but the appeal was the same: the <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/more-than-a-vpn">world needs something more than what traditional VPNs</a> are offering. We need more access to information, more control of our data, more privacy in what we do and who we communicate with&nbsp;online.</p><p>So here’s a roundup of what the Nym team has been doing to make all of that possible.</p> DevCon 2024 (Bangkok) <p>The Nym team was in full force at DevCon for what turned out to be a pretty incredible event. Here’s a look at what happened over four days of presentations and discussions.</p> Sunday: Digital sovereignty <p>Nym’s Simon Toth chaired a panel on “Decentralized data in a surveillance economy: A path to data sovereignty” at the Decentralized Data Summit&nbsp;2024.</p> Monday: Women In&nbsp;Tech <p>Yana Matrosova presented NymVPN on “Sovereign tools by Women in Web3Privacy” at Logos “Parallel Society” and moderated a panel on “Privacy with backdoors or without?” at Ethereum Cypherpunk Congress.</p><p>The opening talk was delivered by Harry Halpin and Chelsea Manning via&nbsp;video.</p> Tuesday: From the cypherpunks to the noise-generating mixnets <p>Harry Halpin delivered a Lightning Talk on “Why VPNs are a scam and what to do about it,” introducing Nym’s noise-generating mixnet as a novel solution to AI surveillance and data tracking. <a href="https://app.devcon.org/schedule/TRMC3L">Check out the&nbsp;video</a>.</p><p>Harry Halpin and Max Hampshire delivered the final talk at the Cypherpunk Congress on “The history and philosophy of cypherpunk,” with almost a 1000 people in attendance! It was truly an honor to speak to so many curious about the tradition at the foundation of Nym. Watch the <a href="https://app.devcon.org/schedule/8JVYCQ">full video&nbsp;here</a>!</p> Wednesday: Collective security <p>Yana Matrosova presented “NymVPN and the Nym Squad League” at Women In Web3Privacy “Privacy Tools” side event. Multiple topics were discussed, including decentralization, zk, privacy, and cypherpunk values. Every person needs to take care of their own privacy themselves, Yana argued, because no-one is coming to save&nbsp;us!</p><p>Max Hampshire gave a Lightning Talk on “From Packets to Privacy: Understanding and evolving network security.” You can watch the <a href="https://app.devcon.org/schedule/XYRFXT">full talk&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Web Summit 2024&nbsp;(Lisbon) <p>Harry and Chelsea hopped over to Portgual right away to attend Web&nbsp;Summit.</p> Panel discussion with Harry and&nbsp;Chelsea <p>Harry and Chlesea presented “More than a VPN: Defeating AI surveillance with Noise-Generating Mixnets” on a panel to show the architectural weaknesses of all existing VPNs and how NymVPN can do&nbsp;more.</p> Press conference: Protecting data against surveillance <p>Harry and Chelsea followed up with a press conference for journalists on what to expect for threats to privacy and protections after the US elections, especially with the rise of authoritarianisms and censorship to information worldwide.</p><p>The events season is coming to a close, but right before a big opening: NymVPN will be released next month with live payments! Stay tuned through Nym’s <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/weekly-progress-report-november-15-dev-update-7150dd1b9ff0">weekly dev updates</a> on the progress of the&nbsp;launch.</p> Join the Nym Community <p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/nym">Discord</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtech"> Telegram</a> //<a href="https://matrix.to/#/#general:nymtech.chat"> Element</a> //<a href="https://twitter.com/nymproject">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p> Privacy loves&nbsp;company <p><a href="https://t.me/nymchan">English</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymchina"> 中文</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_Russian"> Русский</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYM_turkey"> Türkçe</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymtechvn"> Tiếng Việt</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymjapanese"> 日本</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymfrench"> Française</a> //<a href="https://t.me/NYMSPANISH"> Español</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymportuguese"> Português</a> //<a href="https://t.me/nymkorea">&nbsp;한국인</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.nymtech.net/nym-from-east-to-west-devcon-and-web-summit-2024-fc0f5db20504">Nym from East to West: DevCon and Web Summit 2024</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.nymtech.net">nymtech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Preparing for latest release of NymVPN and breaking network changes next&nbsp;week <p>The Nym team had big successes in showcasing NymVPN to the world at <a href="https://devcon.org/en/">DevCon</a> in Bangkok and <a href="https://websummit.com/">Web Summit</a> in Lisbon this week! And behind the scenes, the dev team has been buckling down to prepare the new network and app releases coming next week. Don’t forget, this is all in lead up to the two big&nbsp;things:</p>  December 2024: Early bird access to the robust NymVPN app with payments!  January 2025: The official launch of NymVPN to the world, at a symbolic time when it needs a real paradigm shift in online&nbsp;privacy  <p>Here’s the full <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nymvpn-roadmap-through-2024">timeline</a> for NymVPN finishing out 2024. Stay tuned for details next week on the launch of zk-nym credentials, the newest releases, and some breaking changes for node operators.</p><p>Remember, NymVPN Beta is still open and free to use, so <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en">sign up today</a> and instantly receive a free 30-day access voucher.

The next NymVPN app release is scheduled for Thursday, 21 November following the Magura network release on Monday, 18 November.</p> NymVPN in Apple&nbsp;Store <p>NymVPN is now <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nymvpn-fast-secure-vpn/id6471254143">available in Apple&nbsp;Store</a>!</p> Network <p>The team has been steadfastly preparing for the latest Magura network release. This will include some breaking changes, so node operators take&nbsp;note!</p> Magura release coming&nbsp;Monday <p>The next network release “Magura” is scheduled for Monday, 18 November. This release will contain several breaking changes, including changes to the reward scheme to include gateways in the reward algorithm.</p> All operators must&nbsp;update! <p>All operators will need to run the latest Nym node binaries, enabling them to function in either mix node or gateway mode. On Monday, this will be v2024.13&nbsp;Magura.</p><p>All operators will also need to have agreed to the <a href="https://nymtech.net/terms-and-conditions/operators/v1.0.0">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> in which they agree to not gather logs. Read more on <a href="https://nymvpn.com/en/blog/nyms-zero-knowledge-network">Nym’s zero-knowledge network</a> design that takes trust out of the equation for&nbsp;users.</p><p>In order for the Nym network to meet clients needs, all nodes need to be up to scratch. Nodes that do not meet these two conditions will be removed from the&nbsp;network.</p> Changes to operator&nbsp;rewards <p>The Nym reward pool will be divided across five layers of nodes rather than three to include gateway functions in the reward algorithm.

The patch improves connection reliability between dVPN clients and gateways. It fixes timeouts on the authenticator registration so connections with gateways that have updated to this patch version should now be more&nbsp;stable.</p><p>Until next week comrades!

<p>Today, we’re excited to reveal the next phase of Shade Protocol’s growth: a roadmap for omnichain expansion that will bring our native stablecoin (SILK) and our Secure DeFi products to even more ecosystems across&nbsp;web3.</p><p>Shade Protocol launched in 2022 with a bold vision: build the most secure and inclusive on-chain economy. We’ve already achieved over $1B+ in trading volume across over 1 million trades, as well as millions of minted and circulating SILK. And we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>We are about to experience the most critical years for decentralized finance. And we believe Shade’s core pillars will make its products the most liquid and sustainable over the long&nbsp;term:</p>  Secure and Trustable: over 87% of consumers refuse to use online platforms if they believe their data may be at risk. The future of decentralized finance must be both secure and privacy-preserving in order to build a foundation of trust and lasting adoption.  Private and Auditable: regulatory frameworks continue to expand and mature. While they demand transparency for public goods, they also mandate privacy for individuals. Shade’s unique decryption primitives empower individuals to remain compliant while protecting their individual privacy and on-chain activity.  Stable and Diverse: as global volatility and connectivity continues to expand, the need for a diversified stablecoin — secured by SOV commodities such as bitcoin &amp; gold in addition to sovereign currencies — is obvious for both on-chain commerce and DeFi. SILK is uniquely positioned to solve this liquidity profile gap in the omnichain economy.  <p>In the post below, we’ll expand on these pillars, reveal what’s being built, and explain how you can join and participate in the Shade on-chain economy immediately.</p> Expanding Liquidity Across the Omnichain <p>On-chain economies are best measured by their liquidity. Because that liquidity can come from anywhere, Shade must be everywhere as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Shade Protocol already includes a number of products we consider to be “omnichain”, including SILK (which is fully collateralized by a basket of different omnichain assets, currencies, and commodities) and our yield-bearing liquid staking derivatives stkd-SCRT and dSHD. These liquid staking derivatives are highly capital efficient, making them attractive assets to spread across the omnichain.</p><p>In this new growth phase for Shade Protocol, we will continue to expand&nbsp;via:</p>  Expansion of outposts: by cross-deploying Shade protocol applications on more L1s and L2s — especially those with native security features like FHE, ZK, and MPC — we will expand access and unlock new primitives that build on our extensive experience developing secure DeFi applications.  Expansion of bridges: we will be expanding both our IBC connections and our bridge support for external ecosystems — including Solana and ETH L2s — in order to maximize access to both SHD and&nbsp;SILK.  Expansion of products: we will launch the ShadeX money market, driving additional steady demand for SILK. Additionally, we will pursue improvements to UX and connectivity to these products.  Expansion of SILK &amp; SHD on external liquidity venues: we will seek to support SILK &amp; SHD pools on as many L1s, L2s, and cross-chain protocols as possible, supporting the launch of money markets and collateralized stablecoin integrations.  Expansion of SILK FinTech integrations: a strong on-chain economy should support real world utility. More and more Fintech companies are entering into the onchain economy (such as Stripe). Demand for stablecoins to connect DeFi to daily commerce is an increasingly large use case. Part of our current FinTech expansion plans involves exploration of an acquisition / merger with a FinTech x DeFi&nbsp;product.   Instant Entry: Introducing “The&nbsp;Button” <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">The Button</a><p>One of the biggest challenges facing users of on-chain economies is simply knowing where to begin. How do you bridge into a new economy? How do you get support? How do you easily provide liquidity or mint&nbsp;assets?</p><p>If it isn’t dead simple to enter Shade’s on-chain economy, Shade won’t grow. If users can’t easily mint SILK or access products like the Shade DEX or money market, Shade won’t grow. That’s why UX has always been a huge focus in our ecosystem, which has powered our innovations around viewing keys and query permits as well as powerful analytics and auditing&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Now we are introducing a new innovation: <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">“The&nbsp;Button.”</a></p><p>The biggest complaint from prospective users who embrace Shade’s vision is that it is still too challenging to enter the on-chain economy. How do they get SHD and begin contributing to pools or minting SILK? How do they instantly become part of the community and movement?</p><p>When you hit The Button, users have the opportunity to buy SHD with zero slippage and 0 trading fees (minimum $1k size) with a 24 hour waiting period for claiming the&nbsp;SHD.</p><p>After using The Button, users will have the opportunity to join an exclusive chat with other Button&nbsp;users!</p><p>The following are supported assets of The&nbsp;Button:</p>  USDC.nbl  USDC.axl  wETH.axl  ATOM  SCRT  <p>We expect more assets to be added over&nbsp;time!</p><p>After a user presses The Button, the protocol re-routes the deposited purchase amount and buys SHD on ShadeSwap, ensuring that direct buy pressure is applied to SHD. The Button is a powerful feature that ensures that large buyers of SHD can enter without paying large amounts on slippage and trading&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Here’s the catch: The Button can only be pushed a limited number of times!<br> <br>There is currently only 20k SHD available for purchase for each of the above listed assets. That’s a limited amount of slippage-free liquidity.</p><p>This initial liquidity will not be refilled before November&nbsp;17.</p><p>Use The Button → <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade</a></p> SHD Yield Opportunities <p>After purchasing SHD using The Button, there are a variety of DeFi opportunities for SHD tokenholders to engage&nbsp;with:</p><a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/stake</a><p>Stake your SHD with a 7 day unbonding period, empowering you to passively earn ~8% APY (instantly claimable yield).

This market is <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/research/fintech-payments/emerging-payments/cbdcs-stablecoins-research-report/">projected to grow by 612%</a> by&nbsp;2031.</p><p>For nearly a decade, crypto yield was sequestered and isolated from real world purchases — forcing users to bridge back to crypto exchanges, back to banks, to finally be able to make purchases “using” crypto. This UX was fractured, expensive, and not Web3&nbsp;native.</p><p>We believe that Shade is uniquely positioned with both its privacy posture and SILK to aggressively integrate with payment rails to drive the adoption of Shade’s products. Users from around the world are in desperate need of a diversified reserve currency (i.e. SILK) to reduce their sovereign currency&nbsp;risk.</p> So Why Shade? Why&nbsp;SILK? <p>There are many on-chain economies today. In the coming years, we project there to be countless more. The key question is: which ones will be sustainable, and which ones can truly create lasting value for end&nbsp;users?</p><p>We already mentioned the core pillars that underlie development work for Shade: secure and trustable, private and auditable, stable and diverse. All of these pillars support sustainability.</p><p>One of our scarcer beliefs — compared to other on-chain economies — is our belief in data security. True adoption of DeFi hinges on robust data security measures. To attract billions in liquidity, both institutions and individuals will expect their onchain positions and asset movements to be encrypted by default, but auditable as needed. At Shade, we believe that in the near future the total transparency of blockchain will be looked at with suspicion in the same way that a lack of data security would be viewed within our traditional financial markets.</p><p>Another belief we have is in innovation through diversity. This doesn’t just mean a diversity of products built for a diverse set of global users. It also informs the approach behind SILK and its diversified collateral base. As on-chain economies grow, we all benefit from more experimentation with different compositions and use cases for stablecoins. We see tremendous synergies between SILK, dollar-backed stablecoins, other sovereign stablecoins, and commodities like BTC and&nbsp;metals.</p><p>Our mission is to integrate all of these beliefs into a seamless, omnichain economy that is secured by diverse assets and that powers off-chain and on-chain global commerce. While we are incredibly early in this mission, the years we’ve already spent developing these protocols, economic approaches, and beliefs gives us confidence that the Shade community is better positioned than any other to work towards and achieve this&nbsp;goal.</p><p>We have many announcements, partnerships, and products yet to be revealed, but if our mission and approach excite you, today the ask is simple: join&nbsp;us.</p><p>Join the Shade community: <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p><p>Hit The Button: <a href="https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade">https://app.shadeprotocol.io/swap/buy-shade</a></p>

  Building the Future: Meet the 2024 Sequoia Open Source Fellows  <p>From one celebrated UC Berkeley lab come two groundbreaking projects: vLLM and Chatbot Arena.</p>   
	By <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/bogomil-balkansky/">Bogomil Balkansky</a> and <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/lauren-reeder/">Lauren Reeder</a>	 



Published November 11, 2024
  



 
<p>It was the summer of 2022, and a team of Ph.D. researchers in UC Berkeley’s newly launched Sky Computing Lab had a problem. They’d been working to make large deep-learning models more efficient, by distributing work across GPUs. But when they set up a demo of their new framework, performance was an immediate—and serious—issue.</p>



<p>“It was ridiculously slow,” remembers Zhuohan Li, a member of the project team and a veteran of RISElab, the renowned Sky Lab predecessor that had birthed Databricks and Anyscale. “We realized memory management was going to be a big bottleneck for serving these models—and we wanted to take a deeper look.”</p>



<p>So over the next couple of months, Li and fellow researcher Woosuk Kwon dug in, and eventually developed a promising algorithm inspired by classical virtual memory and paging techniques that they dubbed “PagedAttention.” Then on November 30, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Interest in LLMs, and in their project, exploded.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a flood of new models was coming from tech companies and research institutions, each of them needing to run on increasingly scarce GPUs—and Li and Kwon’s idea could be the unlock that made that easy. Eventually, they teamed up with labmate and former Anyscale engineer Simon Mo to host the first meetup for their open-source project, now known as <a href="https://blog.vllm.ai/2023/06/20/vllm.html">vLLM</a>.</p>



vLLM contributors Woosuk Kwon, Zhuohan Li and Simon Mo.



<p>“I’d been increasingly excited about it, but after that meetup, I was even more excited,” Mo said. “Everybody had so many questions, so much enthusiasm.” It was an early illustration of a principle that Sky Lab leader and Databricks co-founder Ion Stoica had long impressed upon his advisees: community is key.</p>



<p>“An open source project is not just about the code,” Stoica says. “In every one I’ve been part of, building a strong community was extremely important to success.”</p>



 



<p>Among vLLM’s earliest adopters was a new model called Vicuna, from another group of researchers within the Sky Lab—including Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Hao Zhang and Wei-Lin Chiang, and advised by Stoica and Joseph Gonzalez. Chiang had previously collaborated with Kwon on SkyPilot, a framework for running LLMs, AI and batch jobs in the cloud. But since the release of ChatGPT he, too, had shifted focus, fascinated by the possibility of building an open-source LLM.</p>



<p>The result, Vicuna, had launched in March 2023. It was based on Meta’s LLaMA, but with an innovative twist: the researchers had trained it in part on data from ShareGPT, a Chrome plug-in for sharing ChatGPT conversations, making it particularly useful for chatbot applications.</p>



<p>“It started out as just a fun project, and we were surprised to see how well it worked,” Chiang says. “We wanted to share it with everyone.” The group quickly bought a domain, lmsys.org, where they could publish a blog post and run a demo of their new chatbot. Within two weeks, they had millions of visitors—but with the excitement came criticism, as well.</p>



<p>“People questioned the idea that our model was actually better, and as researchers, we wanted a scientific way to convince them,” Chiang recalls. “How do you actually evaluate between models?”</p>



<p>At a time when new LLM releases were coming out on a weekly if not daily basis, it was a critical question not just for Vicuna, but for anyone building—or building on top of—a model. To help answer it, Zheng, Sheng, Chiang and their teammates enlisted yet another fellow Berkeley researcher: theoretical statistician Anastasios Angelopoulos.<br>“The fundamental problems attracted me, and it was very clearly important—the impact was there,” Angelopoulos remembers. As the group explored what a platform for benchmarking and evaluation could look like, he worked to add statistical rigor. In May, they launched their new project, <a href="https://lmarena.ai/">Chatbot Arena</a>, where users could compare Vicuna alongside other open models—and in May, they rolled out a live leaderboard, with rankings informed by crowdsourced preference data, from real users putting the models to work.</p>



Angelopoulos, Chiang, Stoica and the Chatbot Arena team.



<p>Today, Chatbot Arena is the de facto standard for evaluating model performance, with more than one million monthly users—and every time a new model comes out, industry leaders including Sam Altman, Jeff Dean and others point to their evaluations on Chatbot Arena. Almost all major model providers—including OpenAI, Google, Meta and xAI—periodically share variants of models with the Chatbot Arena team before they’re released, so the data can inform their development processes.</p>



<p>Like their colleagues building vLLM, Chiang and Angelopoulos credit the lab’s emphasis on community for much of their project’s success. “Since I’ve been involved, it’s been a continual effort to keep building that trust,” Angelopoulos says. Earlier this year, the Chatbot Arena team published policy documentation outlining their methodology—and their motivations. Because the project does not monetize its data, instead relying on free credits and donations, “we knew people might be skeptical about our incentives,” Angelopoulos acknowledges. “So we wanted to be very clear that our only incentive is to do the best possible science. We just want the truth.”</p>



 



<p>The vLLM community, meanwhile, has been navigating its own rapid growth. Since releasing its open-source library in June 2023, it’s racked up an impressive 28,000 stars on GitHub, and is used by developers in many top tech companies. This year, Nvidia, AWS, Cloudflare and the gaming company Roblox—which uses vLLM for translation and child safety monitoring—have all hosted meetups. “Whenever we find out that an app I already have on my iPhone is powered by vLLM, that’s very rewarding,” says Kwon. “The more we meet real users, the more confident we are that we are doing something right.”</p>



<p>But as for any successful open-source project, growth has been a double-edged sword; each new model or hardware release requires a time-consuming—and expensive—sprint by Li, Kwon, Mo and vLLM contributors. “Quality is absolutely critical to this project’s success, so we need robust testing for every change—especially with this many people contributing,” Mo says. At $10 per test, across a variety of GPUs, academic funding and even grants and donations quickly become unsustainable.</p>



<p>In fact, Stoica says, funding pressure on open source projects is “at least an order of magnitude higher” in the age of LLMs. “You have multiple kinds of GPUs, you have all of these other accelerators. And there’s also a difference in scale,” he explains. “10 years ago, most of the funding for a new startup would go to adding people. Today, it’s going to infrastructure.”</p>



<p>But this, again, is where community comes in. Sequoia partner Lauren Reeder says by the spring of 2024, she’d heard from multiple portfolio companies singing the praises of vLLM—it was saving their engineering teams a lot of time and effort. So Reeder reached out on X, and Mo invited her to visit the lab.</p>



<p>“I met Simon, Woosuk and Zhuohan, and they explained some of the dynamics around testing and cost, and the community. That’s what stood out to me most—a lot of open source projects are run by one person, kind of carrying the world on their shoulders,” she says. “But this was absolutely community-run, with nearly 80% of the contributions coming from outside the lab.”</p>



<p>The previous year, Reeder and fellow partner Bogomil Balkansky had headed up the launch of Sequoia’s <a href="https://sequoiacap.com/oss">Open-Source Fellowship</a>. There were no strings attached, and no expectation of starting a business—just support for projects that were key to the success of the firm’s portfolio and many other companies. Reeder thought vLLM was a perfect fit, and Li, Kwon and Mo became Sequoia open-source fellows.</p>



 



<p>The Chatbot Arena team, too, has navigated their projects’ popularity with duct tape and sheer force of will. While free credits paid for the LLM calls and hosting, the team desperately needed help with technical tasks, such as updating the Chatbot Arena UI to work with multi-modal models. Their work often kept them up until 4 a.m.; “we simply didn’t have enough hands on deck,” Angelopoulos says. But they were hesitant to take any support beyond free credits from model providers, for fear of jeopardizing their independence.</p>



<p>Once again, word of mouth reached Reeder, who now knew the dense talent in Sky Lab firsthand—and had seen founders repeatedly refer to Chatbot Arena as their litmus test for choosing between models. She, Balkansky and the rest of Sequoia’s partners were open to adding a second fellowship for 2024, and after a call for applications, had hundreds to choose from. But Chiang and Angelopoulos stood out.</p>



<p>“The fact that Chatbot Arena was committed to being fundamentally neutral was actually really important to us,” she says. “Versus other projects that may be widely used but have more commercial incentives, we felt like with this one, our support could really have an impact.”</p>



<p>Chiang and Angelopoulos became fellows in August, and say the funding has indeed freed them up to check crucial to-dos off their list. As always, they’re taking a user-first approach to using their newfound resources: through a recent partnership with a red-teaming community, for example, they’re exploring the relationship between controllability and potential safety concerns across different models.</p>



<p>Li, Kwon and Mo, too, have quickly put Sequoia’s support to use on their CI bills, and are currently rearchitecting vLLM to reduce and prevent the technical debt that often plagues fast-growing systems. Their primary goals, Mo says, remain usability and performance: “We want to build the easiest to use, most efficient, fastest inference engine in the world.” And their community is stepping up in kind; while 90% of contributions came from Berkeley as recently as last fall, that number is now just 25%.</p>



<p>For vLLM and Chatbot Arena alike, the rise of multimodal models looms large, as both teams undertake updates to accommodate images, video and code. Chiang and Angelopoulos recently partnered with Wayne Chi and Valerie Chen at Carnegie Mellon University, who built a VSCode extension called Copilot Arena that allows users to tab back and forth between completion models—and allows the platform to collect preference data about which models are best on coding auto-completion tasks. “That’s something we know the community cares a lot about,” says Angelopoulos. “We think it could be huge.”</p>



<p>Reeder says the progress vLLM and Chatbot Arena have made is just the beginning—for the projects, but also from the open source community at large. “Something we’ve noticed this year is that much of the innovation on the infrastructure stack is coming from open source—that’s one of the reasons we decided to expand the fellowship,” she says. “These projects have the support of the community. Everyone is jumping in and trying to help, in a way we haven’t seen in a long time.</p>



<p>“We’re excited to see how they continue pushing things forward. Open source is really building the future.”</p>

<p>Are you tired of the same old point systems and DeFi capital commitments? Do you long for a more enjoyable and social way to engage with your favorite crypto projects?</p><blockquote>Look no further! Introducing eSHD, the ultimate engagement token that’s set to redefine the crypto landscape.</blockquote><p>Unlike traditional points systems, eSHD doesn’t require you to put capital at risk or lock up assets. Instead, you can earn eSHD simply by engaging with social media posts, completing challenges, and participating in various activities. This innovative approach to token distribution is designed to create a sense of community and reward users for their energy and enthusiasm around a token economy that can also be redeemed for meaningful rewards.</p><p>Unlike point ecosystems that ask users to risk capital, eSHD takes the opposite approach.</p><p>No capital locked up to earn&nbsp;eSHD.</p><p>No meme token tied to a liquidity pool.</p><blockquote>All while giving eSHD the opportunity to convert into meaningful SHD rewards among many possible rewards, powered by YOUR engagement.</blockquote><a href="https://zealy.io/cw/eshade/invite/8LMky9UlARIy-szAI28IR">https://zealy.io/cw/eshade/invite/8LMky9UlARIy-szAI28IR</a><p>One way to participate is&nbsp;through:</p><blockquote><a href="https://zealy.io/cw/eshade/invite/8LMky9UlARIy-szAI28IR">https://zealy.io/cw/eshade/invite/8LMky9UlARIy-szAI28IR</a></blockquote><p>Zealy offers easy quests that help you earn eSHD through quick and fun activities. You can also earn eSHD through other platforms like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter. Each quest you complete earns you points, and you can see where you rank against other people. Our top questers will take home eSHD which will be redeemable for a variety of onchain and offchain&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Join Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/ShadeProtocol">https://t.me/ShadeProtocol</a></p> Redeeming eSHD <p>eSHD can be redeemed in some of the following ways:</p><p>(1) “eDrops” — campaigns where users can redeem their eSHD for SHD using Shade Bonds. These drops are first come, first serve, with limited capacity, rewarding users who actively track and engage with eDrops. &amp;&nbsp;eSHD</p> The first of MANY eDrops will be on November 28th with $1,250 worth of SHD up for grabs to be redeemed for using&nbsp;eSHD. <blockquote>There will also be an eSHD for eSHD engagement lock bond— empowering eSHD holders to lock up their tokenized engagement for more&nbsp;eSHD.</blockquote><p>(2) eSHD leaderboard competition — unlock NFTs, titles, earn exclusive randomized drops, and gain access to in person events / apparel / alpha based on your leaderboard standings</p><p>(3) Exclusive gated telegram rooms. Level up and traverse the ladder of checkpoints.</p><p>(4) eSHD Clans — pick a DAO and compete with other eSHD clans to engage and grow Shade Protocol the best.

Protocols love using points methodology as they get TVL stat boosts and usage boosts on their protocol (short term) without needing to immediately pay users for these capital commitments / sacrifices. Users have been willing to take these risks, as long as the methodology will reward them for their efforts. Some protocols have tried to reward both social engagement and capital engagement. But inevitably, the cost of capital is significantly higher than the cost of rewarding engagement — creating an imbalance that leaves engagement focused users on an island, their activity feeling undervalued compared to large tokenholders.</p><p>Anyone can like or retweet or interact with a telegram chat. These small gestures are sacrifices of focus and energy (still a cost, but a distinctly different kind of cost from capital). We believe these engaged offchain users have been grossly undervalued within protocol reward mechanisms.</p><p>Our theory of engagement is focused on giving rewards that push community status as a meaningful form of reward comboed with direct financial reward. Too much of reliance on one type of reward without the other makes the community either too financial in nature or potentially too disincentivized to elicit meaningful outcomes.</p><p>Naturally, both strong social ties and ethos can help boost the strength and meaningfulness of participating in a community, but the fundamental building blocks of a crypto community is the balance between social ties and financial incentive.</p><p>Point ecosystems (unfortunately) are almost purely financial by nature, hurting the odds of creating a truly sticky social community. The inability of point programs tied to capital commitments to generate sticky community makes perfect sense because the scale of sacrifice and scale of rewards is so large that the value derived by being part of the community is so far downstream that the social ties are not sticky enough (nor earned enough) to retain these mercenary users.</p><p>eSHD takes an alternative approach — attempting to value the engaged community members, regardless of their SHD holdings.</p><p>We want want to attempt this experiment of eSHD to see how far we can push the limits of a social token (that has real value) who’s supply comes into circulation purely via engagement. In this model, dilution of eSHD tokenholders is in favor of those who engage most recently.</p> Who We&nbsp;Are <a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-spartan-ethos-introduction-7b37b3df160d">Meet The&nbsp;Spartans</a><p>The origin of the Shade Spartans and eSHD tokenholders is a simple tale — to be a staunch advocate of privacy and freedom inevitably puts you in the crosshairs of those who see our claims to digital sovereignty as a threat to their power. There are those who believe people must be protected at every turn. That security should be prioritized above the human experiment of individualism and experimentation. The powers at be are leaving an entire generation chained to the burden of malicious (not all) regulation. Disdainful pen &amp; paper, stale and unromantic. Uninspired dead documents that stifle human ingenuity, and at worse, diminish&nbsp;it.</p><p>We Spartans.</p><p>We few, we chose&nbsp;few.</p><p>Pushed to the brink, night near&nbsp;extinct.</p><p>In the arena of the digital and physical world we lay it all on the line. We deeply value our dignity. We stake our future on the truth that there is no greater love than this: that a Shade Spartan would lay his security and freedom on the line to protect the future rights of his&nbsp;enemies.</p><p>You see, Spartans fight for the rights of those who oppress us. We fight to remove the chains from those that seek to place us in&nbsp;chains.</p><p>This is what it takes to be a city on a hill — a light in the darkness.</p><p>This is what it takes to have the moral high&nbsp;ground.</p><blockquote><a href="https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-spartan-ethos-introduction-7b37b3df160d">https://medium.com/@shadeprotocoldevs/shade-spartan-ethos-introduction-7b37b3df160d</a></blockquote> Summary <p>Be part of the revolution with Shade Protocol’s newest initiative, the eSHD engagement token.
