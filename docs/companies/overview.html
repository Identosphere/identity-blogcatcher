Let's talk about IO in Urbit. I won't say much about how events and effects are processed by the runtime; it suffices to note that the runtime is a normal Unix program which (1) listens for various events, (2) passes them to Arvo (Urbit OS), and (3) processes the effects produced by Arvo. Instead, I’ll focus on how IO works from the perspective of Hoon programs, like Arvo or apps running on Arvo. But first, let's review IO paradigms in other languages.
All examples are in a made-up language,'>Input and Output in Hoon</a>

Security and Continuity
In 2018, when we launched the Urbit ID contracts (also called ‘Azimuth’), we committed to yearly infrastructure goals for 2019 and 2020. This wasn’t an informal commitment — it’s part of the contracts that were published to the blockchain, which you can read here. At the end of each year, we ratify our accomplishment of these goals with a galaxy vote.
Since the year is coming close to an end, and this year’s vote is on the horizon, it’s time for an update on our progress'>Security and Continuity</a>

We’ve all been exposed to social logins. Social logins allow users like you and me to access websites or create accounts on websites by using existing social account credentials that we’ve already created with Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and many others. The idea behind the use of social logins is to simplify the sign-in and registration processes to provide seamlessness and convenience compared to having to create a brand-new, stand-alone account to register with a specific website.'>Social Logins: The Other Side of The Coin</a>

Last night I woke with a start, sweating heavily. I dreamed that Facebook had contacted me to ask if they could sell Amazon some of the data I shared to create an account along with some behavioral insights from my activity throughout the years on Mark Zuckerberg’s platform. Yes, some of the data because I was actually given the choice of how I wanted to monetize my personal and digital activity information. That felt so empowering. Then reality hit me rather hard.
