Bogoshipo强势上线Ardor，探索链游NFT全新玩法 NFT持续出圈

WeChat: 近期币安宣布将推出官方NFT平台，这条消息再次引爆NFT市场，毫无疑问，今年是NFT出圈元年，我们看到了他越来越多的可能性，NFT在艺术品上链、被当成具有防伪标志的门票、资产上链、票据服务、游戏等方面均可以创造巨大的价值。

NFT即非同质化代币，是一种被称为区块链的数字账本上的数据单位，每个代币可以代表一个独特的数字项目，代币不能互换。设想一下，一个图片，一个gif，一段音乐，或者一个证书。都可以转化为NFT保存、收藏、甚至交易，这在以前是根本没有办法完成的，这便是NFT的魅力所在。

APOP+POS：Jelurida在JAVA开发峰会展示技术创新

WeChat: 4月22日，Jelurida联合创始人兼架构师Lior 与核心开发Sergi共同出席了JAVA全球开发峰会，并在会上分别向来宾讲解了桥牌冠军（Bridge Champ）和Ardor公链的技术细节。

在演示中，Lior认为Jelurida的区块链产品非常完整，因此我们将注意力转向了在线休闲游戏市场，由于新冠疫情，每个人都困在家里，这也为使用采矿和功能性代币的通证经济创造了巨大的机会。

这就是我们开发桥牌冠军（Bridge Champ）项目的原因，大家都知道桥牌是一个复杂的游戏，需要很高的游戏经验，风险管理和聪明的策略。
