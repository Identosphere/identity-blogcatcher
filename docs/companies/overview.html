&nbsp; 
Bij het accepteren van nieuwe klanten voor financiële diensten worden vaak nog papieren documenten gebruikt, wat inefficiënt, foutgevoelig en fraudegevoelig is. De oplossing ligt in documentloos accepteren, waarbij gegevens rechtstreeks uit betrouwbare digitale bronnen worden gehaald. Deze methode verhoogt de efficiëntie, vermindert de kans op fraude en waarborgt de privacy van consumenten beter.In aflev'>Hoe documentloos accepteren de standaard wordt: in gesprek met Gert Vasse</a>

Digitale identificatie is iets waar de overheid al jaren over nadenkt. Ze wil burgers meer regie geven over persoonsgegevens die de overheid van hen heeft opgeslagen. Hiervoor werd het programma ‘Regie op Gegevens’ opgericht. Dit bestond al voordat Ockto het daglicht zag.
