Between April 16th and 17th, an exploiter initiated a series of malicious transactions targeting the Ethereum-based decentralized stablecoin protocol Beanstalk Farms. The exploiter stole various cryptoassets from the platform, including BEAN – the protocol’s native stablecoin. The attacker was able to obtain just under 25,000 Ether (ETH), which is worth $76 million. In total, the protocol is believed to have lost $182 million.'>$76 Million Stolen from Beanstalk Farms DeFi Stablecoin Protocol</a>
