The RevOps Tightrope: When "Just Connect It" Becomes a Breach Vector 
If you're in Revenue Operations, Marketing Ops, or Sales Ops, your core mandate is velocity. Every week, someone needs to integrate a new tool: "Can we connect Drift to Salesforce?" "Can we push this data into HubSpot?" "Can you just give marketing API access?" You approve the OAuth tokens, you connect the "trusted" apps, and you enable the business to move fast. You assume the security team has your back.'>The Salesforce Breach Is Every RevOps Leader’s Nightmare: How to Secure Connected Apps</a>

The call comes in at 4:55 PM on a Friday. It’s the CFO, and she’s frantic. She’s locked out of her account, needs to approve payroll, and her flight is boarding in ten minutes. She can’t remember the name of her first pet, and the code sent to her phone isn’t working. The pressure is immense. What does your help desk agent do?

 New sanctions target the Prince Group Transnational Criminal Organization, for its involvement in online scams such as pig butchering. 
 Elliptic has identified crypto wallets associated with the newly-sanctioned entities, which have received transactions worth billions of dollars. 
 Prince Group chairman Chen Zhi was also indicted in a U.S. court today, and has had $15 billion in Bitcoin seized. These bitcoins were previously "stolen" from a Chinese bitcoin mining business.
