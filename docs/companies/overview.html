Waarom zakelijke kredietverleners achterblijven met digitalisering 
De zakelijke kredietmarkt loopt achter met digitalisering, zeker in vergelijking met de consumentenmarkt. Bij een hypotheek- of consumptief kredietaanvraag kunnen particulieren moeiteloos hun financiële gegevens delen via DigiD, iDIN, PSD2 en andere brondatavormen. Veel zakelijke kredietverleners werken daarentegen nog met handmatige en foutgevoelige procedures op basis van documenten en PDF-bestanden.'>Hoe brondata de aanvraag van zakelijke kredieten versnelt</a>
