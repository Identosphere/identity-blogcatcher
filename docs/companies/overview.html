Daarbij brengen strikte regelgeving en hoge compliance-eisen unieke uitdagingen met zich mee.

Attackers continually refine their methods to compromise user identities and gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems. One particularly insidious threat is Evilginx, a phishing framework designed to bypass traditional multi-factor authentication (MFA) by operating as an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) — sometimes known as man-in-the-middle (MitM) — proxy.
