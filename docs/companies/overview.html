Building things, even Calm™ things, makes noise. George Nakashima’s wooden furniture evokes peace, but its construction still begins with a chainsaw. We mention this because we’re firing up our newest power tool.

In spite of the many challenges presented over the last year, it was a resoundingly good one for Urbit.

I'm pleased to report they confirmed the cryptographic soundness of the protocol, namely that &quot;a ship must have possession of their own valid Urbit key in order to authenticate as that ship and to send valid Ames messages.

Let's talk about IO in Urbit. I won't say much about how events and effects are processed by the runtime; it suffices to note that the runtime is a normal Unix program which (1) listens for various events, (2) passes them to Arvo (Urbit OS), and (3) processes the effects produced by Arvo. Instead, I’ll focus on how IO works from the perspective of Hoon programs, like Arvo or apps running on Arvo. But first, let's review IO paradigms in other languages.
