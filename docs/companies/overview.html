Het Know Your Customer-programma (KYC) brengt voor financieel dienstverleners veel eisen met zich mee. Zo moet je ervoor zorgen dat&nbsp; je gegevens verwijdert die vanuit AVG niet toegestaan zijn en moet je een goede audit trail bijhouden. Naast KYC moet ook de Customer Due Dilligence (CDD) op orde zijn. Dat maakt processen al snel complex, foutgevoelig en kostbaar.

Cyberattacks continue to increase at an alarming rate, and many security breaches can be traced back to an authentication issue. Whether a password or a password plus an additional authentication factor, attackers are adept at bypassing them at scale. For example, over 100 million multi-factor authentication (MFA) attacks were recorded in Q1 2022, whereas such attacks were virtually non-existent in 2019.&nbsp;'>The State of Passwordless Security 2023: Report Recap</a>

Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2022. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with over eight million records breached in the field in Q3 of 2022.'>Top 12 Financial Services Cybersecurity Regulations to Know in 2023</a>

Customer identity and access management (CIAM) is a major cybersecurity component of any company that maintains customer accounts. Online fraud and authentication attack attempts have grown significantly in the past several years, with attackers increasingly turning their attention to customers rather than companies.
