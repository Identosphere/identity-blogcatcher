In spite of the many challenges presented over the last year, it was a resoundingly good one for Urbit.
It seems like a long time ago now that the folks at Tlon rolled out OS1 (now called Landscape), just as the pandemic forced everyone into their homes throughout the world. At the time, Urbit is for Communities&'>2020 -> 2021</a>

Let's talk about IO in Urbit. I won't say much about how events and effects are processed by the runtime; it suffices to note that the runtime is a normal Unix program which (1) listens for various events, (2) passes them to Arvo (Urbit OS), and (3) processes the effects produced by Arvo. Instead, I’ll focus on how IO works from the perspective of Hoon programs, like Arvo or apps running on Arvo. But first, let's review IO paradigms in other languages.
