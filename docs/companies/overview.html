Meer duidelijkheid, werkbare proportionaliteit-eisen en een gelijkwaardig speelveld voor alle partijen. Dat is wat er verwacht en gehoopt wordt van de aankomende Consumer Credit Directive 2 (CCD2). Deze Europese richtlijn verbreedt de scope van partijen die onder toezicht vallen en brengt veranderingen met zich mee voor kredietverstrekkers.

De consumptief kredietmarkt staat aan de vooravond van een belangrijke verandering met de aangescherpte Consumer Credit Directive 2 (CCD2). Deze nieuwe Europese richtlijn zal impact hebben op de manier waarop kredietverstrekkers opereren en nieuwe partijen onder toezicht brengen die daar nu nog buiten vallen. De CCD2 heeft als doel de consumentenbescherming te versterken en een gelijk speelveld te creëren voor kredietaanbieders in Europa.'>CCD2 komt eraan: Dit is waar kredietverstrekkers mee te maken krijgen</a>

A few weeks ago, Microsoft issued its first Secure Future Initiative Progress Report. Launched in November 2023, the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) is Microsoft’s acknowledgement that it needs to drastically improve its cloud security posture and make cybersecurity its top priority. The company has dedicated a substantial chunk of its engineering workforce to the effort ”to address the increasing scale, speed, and sophistication of cyberattacks.” In line with this mandate, a key area of'>Microsoft’s SFI Offers a Blueprint for Identity Security</a>

Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2023. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with 84% of finance organizations hit by a cyberattack going on to experience at least one breach.'>Top 15 Cybersecurity Regulations for Financial Services in 2024</a>
