Identity verification has traditionally played an important but limited role in the world of identity and access management (IAM). To establish someone’s identity, you need to prove that they are who they say they are, linking&nbsp; their digital identity to their real-world identity. For employees, this verification typically occurs during onboarding; for customers, it happens when they open a new account. Once validated, they receive credentials, are granted appropriate authorizations'>Identity Evolved: The Rise of Multi-Factor Verification</a>
