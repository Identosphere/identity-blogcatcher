Voor verhuurders is woonfraude een groeiend probleem. Uit een recent NOS-artikel blijkt dat er 200 meldingen van woonfraude per jaar zijn bij de Fraudehelpdesk en dat dat nog maar het topje van de ijsberg is. Verhuurders en andere gedupeerden ervaren daar veel nadeel van: qua kosten, verloren tijd en gedoe. Maar wat kun je doen om woonfraude te voorkomen?

Als verhuurder wil je snel én uitvoerig screenen of een huurder geschikt is. Zo kun je inschatten of iemand de huur kan betalen, voorkom je fraude en doorzie je risico’s op overlast. Maar een huurderscheck is een tijdrovend proces voor zowel woningcorporaties als kandidaat-huurders. Er komen allerlei documenten bij kijken die de huurder ook nog op een specifieke manier moet aanleveren.
