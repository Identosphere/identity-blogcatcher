With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the FBI has issued a public warning — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials?
