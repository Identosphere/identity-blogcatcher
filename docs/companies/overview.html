Java is born in May. So is JavaScript (but it&#8217;s called Mocha).


Microsoft releases Windows 95 in August.


JavaScript, as it&#8217;s known today, first appeared on this day, December 4th.


Wow! It&#8217;s so crazy to look back and see so many influential software releases happen in such a short period.


Congrats to both JavaScript and Java for doing so well over the last 25 years!
