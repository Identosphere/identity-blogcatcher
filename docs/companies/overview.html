The recent, numerous high-profile attacks targeting identity processes, like those by the Lapsus$ group, underscore the need for strong identity security. New research by the Identity Defined Security Alliance found that 90% of organizations had an identity-related incident in the past year with two-thirds of those suffering direct business impact as a result.

Authentication security remains a significant vulnerability in most organizations' security posture. Even individuals without technical expertise can easily acquire and employ pre-made hacking tools. Microsoft, for instance, fends off an astonishing 1,000 authentication attacks a second. Furthermore, the dark web is flooded with over 24 billion username and password pairs available for purchase, perpetuating the constant onslaught of these malicious activities.'>What Is Adaptive Authentication?</a>
