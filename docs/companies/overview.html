Identity and access management (IAM) is a crucial security component and a business enabler for the modern enterprise — but it’s clear that current systems are falling short on both fronts. Enterprises remain rife with legacy systems, technology silos, and manual and disconnected processes that were never intended to cope with today’s complex identity environment. New threat vectors, often aided by generative AI, exploit the gaps in this patchwork of systems, with increasingly alarming'>Analyst Perspective: Toward Converged Identity Assurance</a>

With employee identity risk and fraud on the rise — to the point that the FBI has issued a public warning — it’s crucial to ensure that employees are who they say they are. Is the person you interviewed the same person you actually hired? Is the person logging in a legitimate employee? Is the person requesting a credential reset in fact the owner of those credentials? Robust identity proofing helps you answer those questions.&nbsp;'>Best Practices for Identity Proofing in the Workplace</a>
