Identity security is at a crossroads. As digital transformation accelerates, organizations are increasingly vulnerable to identity-focused attacks, which are now the primary entry point for cybercriminals. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into the attacker’s arsenal ups the stakes even higher.

Bij het accepteren van nieuwe klanten voor financiële diensten worden vaak nog papieren documenten gebruikt, wat inefficiënt, foutgevoelig en fraudegevoelig is. De oplossing ligt in documentloos accepteren, waarbij gegevens rechtstreeks uit betrouwbare digitale bronnen worden gehaald. Deze methode verhoogt de efficiëntie, vermindert de kans op fraude en waarborgt de privacy van consumenten beter.In afleve'>Hoe documentloos accepteren de standaard wordt: in gesprek met Gert Vasse</a>
