In today's modern work environment, effective management of user identities and access is crucial for securing enterprise applications, systems, and data. As organizations increasingly deploy cloud-based services and resources, managing access has become complex and necessary. As a helpdesk engineer, it’s my responsibility to manage and track access requests from end users. To streamline this process and ensure secure access, I recently deployed an approval-as-code tool, which automates'>Using "Approval-as-Code" in Access Management</a>

What Are the FTC MFA Requirements?&nbsp; 
In October 2021, the FTC announced that it was updating the Safeguards Rule. The Safeguards Rule took effect in 2003 as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and aims to protect U.S.-based consumers from data breaches, cyberattacks and their resultant effects, such as fraud and identity theft.'>Are You Ready for the FTC MFA Requirements?</a>

In discussions of identity and access management (IAM), you sometimes find terms used interchangeably, when they actually describe very different processes. While this may not matter in casual conversation, recognizing and solving security issues relies on effective labeling. One of the most common of these mislabeled processes is when people discuss identification vs. authentication.&nbsp;'>Identification vs. Authentication: What’s the Difference?</a>

Open banking is een vrijwel onuitputtelijk onderwerp van speculaties en voorspellingen gebleken. Nu PSD2 de weg heeft vrijgemaakt voor Europa om deel te nemen aan de open-banking-revolutie, zullen we in 2023 mogelijk het eerste concrete bewijs zien van een disruptie op de markt. Daarom belooft 2023 een spannend jaar te worden voor zowel voorstanders als sceptici.'>Een vooruitblik op open banking in Nederland in 2023 </a>
