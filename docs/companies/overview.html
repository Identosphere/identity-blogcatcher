In this post, we’re going to show you how to secure a fast and SQL-y app!

First we will need some authentication, which is how we identify
who the user is. We’ll use Okta for this.

Next, we’ll want to perform authorization, which controls what the user can do in our application. We’ll be using Oso for that, which is a batteries-included library for authorization.
