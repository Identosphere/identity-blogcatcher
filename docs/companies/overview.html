As enterprises shift from on-premises to cloud systems, hybrid cloud solutions have become essential for optimizing performance, scalability, and user ease. However, risks arise when poorly configured environments connect to the cloud. A compromised Microsoft Active Directory can fully compromise a synchronized Microsoft Entra ID tenant, undermining the integrity and trust of connected services.'>Key Takeaways From Horizon3.ai’s Analysis of an Entra ID Compromise</a>

Identity security is at a crossroads. As digital transformation accelerates, organizations are increasingly vulnerable to identity-focused attacks, which are now the primary entry point for cybercriminals. The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into the attacker’s arsenal ups the stakes even higher. Cybercriminals recently stole $25 million from a multinational finance firm in a single stroke by impersonating executives using deepfake video and audio.&nbsp;'>What’s the State of Identity Assurance Today?
