<p>A new study from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/03/17/public-more-likely-to-see-facial-recognition-use-by-police-as-good-rather-than-bad-for-society/">Pew Research Center</a> illuminates a complex picture of how the American public views the use of facial recognition by police. The study is the result of a poll of 10,260 adults in November of 2021.</p>



<p>One striking result is the indication that a plurality of Americans agree that widespread use of facial recognition by police is a good idea. Forty-six percent were in support, while 27 percent said that it would be a bad idea, and 27 percent said they weren’t sure.</p>



<p>Age appears to be an important factor in such beliefs, with a majority of respondents over 50 agreeing that such use of facial recognition is a good idea. Of those under 30, 42 percent said it’s a bad idea, compared to 35 percent in favor.</p>



<p>Political affiliation, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to be a major factor; 25 percent of respondents who lean Republican and 30 percent of respondents who lean Democrat called the police use of facial recognition a bad idea, while 48 percent and 43 percent, respectively, thought otherwise.</p>



<p>A majority, meanwhile, don’t think the widespread use of facial recognition would do much to prevent crime. About 57 percent said they would expect crime rates to stay the same, though 33 percent would expect a decrease in crime.</p>



<p>Asked about some of the specific benefits and risks entailed in widespread use of facial recognition by police, respondents appeared ambivalent. On the one hand, solid majorities indicated that they believe it would help the police to find more missing persons (78 percent) and solve crimes more quickly and efficiently (74 percent); but a majority of 66 percent believe that it would also lead to a discriminatory level of surveillance of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, and 53 percent believe it will lead to more false arrests.</p>



<p>The survey also detected some nuanced perspectives on the tension between surveillance and privacy. About six in 10 respondents felt that it’s acceptable to use facial recognition to scan crowds as they enter large venues such as concerts and even to scan crowds in public protests, but even more respondents – 68 percent – said that it wouldn’t be acceptable to scan people as they simply walk down the street.</p>



<p>The complexity and ambivalence of many of the responses to Pew’s survey further illustrate that how police should use facial recognition technology is very much <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/five-flashpoints-that-are-shaping-course-facial-recognition-debate-030401/">a live debate</a>, with various legal battles and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/virginia-plans-relax-police-facial-recognition-ban-021401/">legislative changes</a> unfolding across the country. And given that it appears the issue hasn’t yet sorted through America’s partisan filter, the debate may still be in its earliest stages.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jumio.com/">Jumio</a> is looking to raise its profile in the Middle East. To that end, the company has established a dedicated Middle Eastern solutions portfolio, and asked Arshad Sheikh to spearhead its expansion efforts as the new Sales Leader for the entire Middle East, Turkey and North Africa (METNA) region.</p>



  



<p>Sheikh brings more than 20 years of sales and cybersecurity to his new position, gathered over the course of a career that includes prior stops at VMWare, Barracuda Networks, and TrendMicro, amongst several others. He will be expected to build relationships with new and existing clients throughout the Middle East and North Africa, though Sheikh himself will be based in Dubai.</p>



<p>For its part, Jumio is hoping to appeal to businesses that are looking to advance their digital transformations. The company noted that organizations in the METNA region are expected to invest more than $58 billion in digital transformation by 2025, a figure that accounts for just under half of the area’s total information technology spend. By the same token, more than 80 percent of payment providers in the region believe that they need to offer better digital services to customers to keep pace with the rate of innovation.</p>



<p>In that regard, Sheikh will try to highlight <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-enhances-risk-screening-capabilities-kyx-platform-102604/">Jumio’s KYX Platform</a> in his dealings with potential clients. Jumio KYX is designed for user onboarding and authentication, giving banks and other businesses a way to register new users remotely in a way that is compliant with the latest Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations. The platform utilizes both face and document recognition, and guards against spoofing with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-iproov-liveness-detection-040807/">iProov’s liveness detection tech</a>.</p>



<p>“Most industries in the region have been swept up in the need to digitally transform their businesses,” said Jumio CRO Dean Hickman-Smith. “Jumio’s end-to-end orchestration platform, aided by our extensive partner network, will massively simplify the journey and deliver successful business outcomes across all key industry sectors.”</p>



<p>Jumio KYX went home with two prizes at the recent <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/jumio-kyx-nets-two-cybersecurity-awards-503031/">2022 Cyber Security Global Excellence Awards</a>. The company previously provided biometric onboarding services for <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/jumio-bank-abc-identity-verification-806192/">Bahrain’s Bank ABC</a> in 2019, though that deal predates the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/jumio-unveils-new-kyx-identity-verification-solution-091704/">debut of Jumio KYX</a>.</p>

<p>Canada is opening its doors to Ukrainians who have been displaced following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of their country. To that end, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has created a new Canada-Ukraine Authorization for Emergency Travel (CUAET) program that waives most immigration requirements and allows Ukrainian citizens to apply for temporary residency in Canada.</p>



  



<p>Those interested in taking advantage of the program can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/steps-apply-visitor-visa.html">apply for a Canadian visitor visa online</a>, though they will need to make a trip to visa application centre (VAC) to submit biometric face and fingerprint data to complete the process. Canada is currently not operating any VACs in Ukraine, though it maintains a network of VACs throughout Europe, and is devoting more staff and resources to VACs in neighboring countries to increase capacity. IRCC is anticipating particularly high demand at its VACs in Chisinau,&nbsp;Warsaw, Vienna, and&nbsp;Bucharest, located in Moldova, Poland, Austria, and Romania, respectively.</p>



<p>IRCC stressed that CUAET is a temporary residency program rather than a refugee program, and will issue temporary visas that are good for a three-year term. However, IRCC is taking other steps to make the transition as smooth as possible. Most notably, the organization is waiving all of its application and processing fees, and will try to turn over CUAET applications within 14 days. Ukrainians are also invited to apply for an open work permit when they apply for their visa, which will allow them to work in Canada for the duration of their stay. Children can enroll in school as soon as they arrive, while those at the post-secondary level can apply for a study permit once they arrive in Canada.</p>



<p>Canada is waiving its COVID-19 vaccination requirements for CUAET applications, though all travelers are still expected to complete a COVID-19 test and quarantine if necessary. The program is open to all Ukrainian citizens, and to any immediate family members, regardless of nationality. Canada will issue single journey travel documents on a case-by-case basis to those that do not have a valid passport, while Canadian businesses are invited to post employment opportunities on a <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3476567-1&amp;h=701687251&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jobbank.gc.ca%2FJobsforUkraine&amp;a=Job+Bank%27s+Jobs+for+Ukraine+webpage">Jobs for Ukraine webpage</a>.</p>



<p>The government of Canada <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-screening-requirements-take-effect-canada-507315/">made biometric data collection mandatory</a> for visitors from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in 2018, and then <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canada-expands-collection-visitors-biometrics-601025/">extended the program</a> to the Asia Pacific region and the Americas in 2019. The IRCC has since issued a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/border-agencys-rfi-shows-contrast-between-canadian-american-approaches-071303/">Request for Information</a> to kick off its search for a new biometric identification system that can better protect people’s civil liberties, while the Canadian Borders Services Agency has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/canadas-border-agency-create-biometric-identity-office-061102/">solicited proposals</a> for a new Office of Biometrics and Identity Management.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aware.com/">Aware</a> is looking to grow its business through a new strategic partnership with <a href="https://miracl.com/">MIRACL</a>. The partnership will start out as a mutual reseller arrangement, though Aware suggested that the deal will eventually pave the way for the joint development of new products.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Aware has already invested $2.5 million in loan stock from Omlis Limited, which is MIRACL’s parent company. MIRACL itself is a developer of streamlined authentication software that delivers multi-factor authentication with a single identity verification step. Aware, meanwhile, is best known for its portfolio of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-pushes-knomi-contactless-access-control-applications-081807/">biometric authentication solutions</a>.</p>



<p>Under the terms of the new arrangement, MIRACL and Aware can each market the other’s products to their client networks, and integrate those products with the solutions in their own portfolios. Aware expressed particular interest in MIRACL’s risk management capabilities, and indicated that MIRACL’s flexible software will make it easier for clients to integrate Aware’s authentication solutions into their existing security infrastructure.</p>



<p>MIRACL, on the other hand, will now be able to offer secure biometric authentication to its customers. The arrangement increases the number of <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fido-promotes-passwordless-authentication-with-user-experience-guidelines-062403/">passwordless authentication options</a> in MIRACL’s portfolio, and should help mitigate the threat of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/forgerock-breaches-involving-passwords-shot-up-450-percent-061401/">ransomware and data breaches</a>.</p>



<p>“With MFA that incorporates biometrics, organizations can now have unprecedented protection and user privacy without the risks or frustrations of other approaches,” said Aware President and CEO Bob Eckel. “This technology we now have available is an important and effective tool against these sorts of attacks.”</p>



<p>“Ransomware attacks&nbsp;have increased&nbsp;more than 150 percent between the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period the previous year,” added MIRACL CEO Rob Griffin. “We expect the market to be very receptive to the addition of Aware biometrics to our authentication offerings and look forward to a strong and mutually beneficial partnership.”</p>



<p>Aware recently acquired Fortress Identity, and revealed that its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/awares-upward-trajectory-continues-in-q4-update-503073/">annual revenues were up 49 percent</a> in its 2021 year-end report. The company’s Knomi authentication solution is the recipient of a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/awares-knomi-solution-picks-up-2022-big-innovation-award-011207/">BIG Innovation Award</a>. It also hinted that a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/aware-teases-new-authentication-solution-mwc-barcelona-022807/">new solution is in the works</a> during an appearance at MWC Barcelona. &nbsp;</p>

 Iris ID’s iT100 solution combines iris and face biometrics for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/labor-management-iris-id-biometric-tech-success-712093/">convenient and trustworthy time and attendance applications.</a> 



<p>With ISC West is taking place this week, some of the biggest names in biometrics are heading to Las Vegas for the biggest security industry show in the world. And one of the most notable among them that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iris-id-bringing-new-biometric-terminals-isc-west-031501/">will be in attendance</a> is <a href="https://www.irisid.com/">Iris ID</a>. The biometrics pioneer has a long track record providing iris and face scanning solutions to clients across various sectors, and this year will place a strong focus on border control and air travel applications at ISC West, given the capabilities of its new<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iris-id-airport-applications-for-biometric-scanners-501173/"> iCAM D2000 and IrisBar biometric readers</a>.</p>



<p>Naturally, these topics were part of a recent conversation between Iris ID VP Mohammed Murad and FindBiometrics Editor in Chief Peter Counter. But the Iris ID team’s expertise is broad, and Murad offered his insights on a number of other key topics, including the impact of COVID-19 on the biometrics industry, the importance of multi-factor authentication and interoperability, and the critical discourse around privacy and educating the public – with the latter being ‘the biggest challenge’ that the biometrics industry faces. Read the full interview below for insights from one of the industry’s leading experts.</p>



 Read the full interview with Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: 



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: We just published our <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/face-biometrics-privacy-and-finance-download-the-19th-annual-findbiometrics-year-in-review-report/">Year in Review survey results</a>. This was the 19th year that we’ve done it and they’re showing that touchless biometrics are continuing to gain in popularity. So my first question is: how has the growing demand for contactless technology affected Iris ID’s business, and are organizations more interested in iris biometrics now than they were before COVID-19?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: That’s an interesting question. Of course, COVID-19 throws a curve ball into the contact and contactless biometric business. However, since 2015 and 2016, we’ve seen a regular uptick in the demand for contactless solutions as the biometric technology needs were growing into many areas and many people were starting to interact with devices. Operations people were thinking about how to implement solutions that would be faster, more accurate, touchless, and able to accommodate a large population of users. We are seeing a continuous rise since that period. We see that reflected in our business and the presence in different enterprises with our solutions. But COVID 19 changed the conversation from, “Hey, I want to adopt the new technology,” to, “Hey, I have to adopt the new technology because I want to protect my user population. We don’t want everybody to be touching the same thing.”</p>



<p>At the same time, we want to provide a secure environment with accurate solutions. So that conversation really accelerated the adoption of technology. And we’ve seen that from 2020 into ’21. We entered into other vertical markets and focused on vertical applications, where the touchless solution fits, such as time and attendance. So, we definitely see increased demand for the technology, and we see that it’s not going away. Now the conversation is starting to go more into how to drive contactless technology growth.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: Just to expand on this point while we’re on the topic: we’re two years into the pandemic and the biometrics industry has seen a lot of changes as a result. It’s really accelerated the digital transformation trends that we were seeing throughout all parts of society in 2020. And, it kind of gave a boost to all different parts of the industry. We have the touchless and contactless part that we just talked about. There’s also the ID verification boom, and identity has really become a core aspect of digital life. What is your opinion on the opportunities and the challenges that are facing biometrics at this point in the pandemic specifically?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: The most important challenges that biometric technology faces are unrelated to the pandemic. The biggest challenge we face is consumer, supplier, and legislative education – all these entities need to be educated on the value of biometrics and how to use it, when to use it, where to use it. These questions need to be answered for them. And what I see moving forward is the education of how to use biometrics, not what biometrics technology is, by now everybody knows that. We are carrying biometric devices in our pocket, and every day we unlock our phones using our faces or fingers. So, I believe the biggest challenge that our industry has today is the how: how are we going to educate the market, and the entities who are writing the legislation so it’s not going to hurt the technology, but instead allow us to build solutions that are going to enhance the applications for biometrics solutions.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: The need for that type of education is a massive challenge, and our Year in Review results support that. Would you say the role of privacy plays a large part in that education as well?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: Absolutely. The education piece around privacy is so important because we need to be able to tell the consumer that using biometrics protects your privacy, it does not invade your privacy. That’s why the use of biometrics, and the dos and don’ts of biometrics needs to be part of that education. We want the consumer feeling comfortable saying, “Yes, this is really the tool and technology that will allow me to protect my privacy.”</p>



<p>For example, if my medical records are protected by biometrics, only I have access to them or the party that I authorize to view. If that sort of education and thought process is built into the educational message, it will enable the growth of the biometrics industry in many different applications.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: Iris ID recently launched the LightHouse iCAM D2000 and the IrisBar iBar600, both of which are geared toward the travel industry. What makes contactless identification technology so appealing to the travel sector, and why are your solutions well-suited to airports and other high-throughput environments?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: I’m glad you mentioned high-throughput, because those two technologies are not just designed for travel. They fit very nicely in travel applications like passenger processing to deliver a frictionless consumer experience, but the idea behind those solutions is that we can enable any application that requires high throughput to work at a distance for image acquisition. That allows integration into legacy or future solutions. Take, for example, a kiosk application. IrisBar is designed with a small footprint, so it fits into any ATM, ticketing, guest registration, or hotel check-in kiosk.</p>



<p>The idea is that we built the technology for a frictionless experience and the immediate use case is going to be travel. Right now, the travel industry is very hungry for non-contact, high throughput solutions that are fast and accurate. However, the solution is designed to be applied to many vertical applications. We are seeing that we have customers who are thinking about building our technology into registration kiosks in hospitals and throughout the healthcare sector. We have customers who are considering building it into enterprise access control solutions. They said, “We have a lot of doors where we are going to use your other products, but we have some areas where we need to address high throughput, and we still want non-contact tech that can process authorized personnel quickly with no lines.” So both products are designed for high throughput applications. They can easily fit into legacy kiosk applications, also accommodate very commonly used applications, like access control, aviation, and the transportation sector.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: I really love to hear about technology like that, which obviously has an immediate place in an industry, but is ready to expand. We see a lot of biometrics specifically like this in travel and hospitality, but biometric ATMs are on the rise too and having a contactless biometric modality there is amazing when it comes to public perception, and addressing the “how” of the education you were talking about earlier. Do you see this as something that will help boost the adoption rate of biometric technologies, particularly iris?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: Absolutely. I believe any technology that is easy to use will allow us to expand the consumer base. I’ll give you a perfect example. The CLEAR lanes at the airport use Iris ID technology to identify individuals. The adoption of that solution is great because it’s easy to use and the consumer understands the direct benefits. A recent report stated 70 percent of travelers are willing to give their biometrics to enhance their travel experience. When that sort of data comes along you know that biometrics has truly arrived.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: Many of your solutions, including the two we’ve been speaking about, support both face and iris recognition as a fused biometric. What’s the advantage of combining modalities this way, and should more organizations be trying to switch to a multifactor authentication standard if they want to improve their security?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: Let’s first respond to the topic of multifactor authentication. Many organizations are looking at the requirements for security and identification, which may require multifactor authentication. The idea is that the higher the security need, the more factors need to apply. We’ve been doing this for a long time; we use PIN, card, and iris – either all three together, or iris as the first factor with the addition of card or PIN. So that’s already there. The bigger question is about multimodal. We always inform our customers that it costs a lot of money to onboard an employee or a citizen for an ID card, so we recommend collecting all the modalities at one time. Bringing people back to re-enroll is expensive.</p>



<p>If the application is forensic in nature, as part of some investigation, you’re not going to use iris and you’re not going to be able to use face, because those two modalities aren’t left behind. But we do leave behind fingerprints, so you use fingerprint biometrics for the investigation. If you are an enterprise and you need to perform employee background checks, those databases have been around for a very long time and are associated with the fingerprint modality. We are seeing a growth in iris databases as well at the FBI so very soon you will see use of iris in background checks.&nbsp; So, it is always advisable that, if you are going through the painstaking exercise of onboarding an individual, you collect all modalities. That way you future-proof the solution. Then, if at any time you want to use a particular modality to identify, you don’t need to think about, “Oh, I need to bring people back – ouch.”</p>



<p>We are in the business of building cameras to acquire an iris image and building software to be able to create a template from that iris image and match it. So, while we have the camera, why don’t we build the optical path allowing us to take the face picture as well? &nbsp;Since we introduced the capture of the face and iris from same device our customers are starting to use our device for face and iris capture and store the iris data for future use if not currently required.&nbsp;It saves time and money.</p>



<p>Our new LightHouse and IrisBar technologies allow you to capture both the face and iris image at the same distance, with the same quality from a single device. Then we went a step further. We built algorithms that allow us to take both of those biometrics in a high throughput environment and raise the level of accuracy by fusing the two modalities. So, I can now be far more confident in getting the results back. These are fused biometrics, so I don’t need to worry about, “Did I capture the highest quality face?” or, “Did I capture the highest quality iris?” I took both. I fused them together and my confidence level in the results is increased.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: It’s the perfect realization of the biometrics mantra “security and convenience.” You’re doing as much as possible in a single moment, collecting the data and then increasing performance and security by orders of magnitude. You mentioned earlier that we might talk a little bit about time and attendance. Your technology is compatible with a number of different third-party time keeping and access control platforms, as well as with other biometric software providers like Aware. Why is interoperability so important with your products?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: Interoperability is our absolute goal. We want to make sure that if you have purchased a product from us, or any third party, that you are able to acquire an image – &nbsp;as long as they support the ISO standards. Interoperability is very important to us, and for the growth of the technologies.</p>



<p>You referenced Aware. Middleware vendors build solutions for identity management and identity authentication with biometrics. Their goal is to work with vendors so they can be absolutely sure that they are following all the standards, so their solution and application is interoperable. So, customers’ systems are future-proof. If they needed to ever move from system X to system Y they don’t need to go through the re-enrollment process, which is, as we discussed earlier, is very expensive.</p>



<p>Interoperability is the key for successful solutions in the IT world. It enables two systems to talk to one another. As long as they’re talking in a similar language, they will be able to exchange data and communicate. In the biometric world, interoperability is the core basis. All our products produce images compliant to the ISO standards.</p>



<p>The other question you asked about was the third-party application. We can’t be the final solution. Our goal is to build an ecosystem around our technology, not a solution. That means these third parties are building apps that can execute on our device, and those devices become just like your telephone. You put the app on it, and it fits in a particular vertical market so that a customer can be comfortable saying, “Oh, I can buy this app that runs on this device.” &nbsp;It’s a purpose-build for vertical markets.</p>



<p>Dell makes a Windows-compatible computer and millions of applications that run on the operating system. We took the same approach but on Android. Our vision is to establish an ecosystem of applications that can be supported on our device. And we are seeing that now. The iT100 is about 16 or 17 months in the market, and we have a half dozen to a dozen apps providers focusing on vertical market applications. These apps are very successful, and it gives them an upper hand because now they can customize an app to fit a particular need of their customer rather than just providing them a generic time clock for managing their workforce. A time clock can become a real information provider to the end customer, user, or consumer. If they want to know how many vacation hours they have left, the information can be pushed down to the device upon their request and all that is protected by their biometrics – only accessible when they are in front of the device and they’re requesting it after they’re authenticated.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: To touch on another hot area: government agencies are increasing their use of contactless biometrics and iris recognition specifically. Why are iris biometrics appealing more to law enforcement and to agencies that run national ID programs?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: Let’s address law enforcement, first. The FBI, for example, has the biggest criminal database out there. For the last several years they were working on increasing efficiency by applying multimodal biometric technologies. If an officer is booking a person, the officer can now get all of the person’s biometrics at the same time (face finger and iris). And the benefit of iris is speed and accuracy. If they wanted to search those records, they’ll be able to send that information to the central database and be able to find those records quickly without waiting for hours while holding an individual.</p>



<p>On the other side, with national ID, you are looking at identifying people in large countries with millions or billions of people. You need technologies that will allow you to scale up. That means you’re not only dealing with applications that only support a one-to-one verification format. You want technologies that will be able to support one-to-many. And ‘many’ in this case could be millions or billions. You want to have a comfort level that you’re going to hit that accuracy mark, and the confidence level that the results you are getting are six-nines (99.9999 percent) in accuracy.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: We talked a lot already at the beginning of this interview about the challenges in our industry, but I’m wondering, from your perspective, what are the big opportunities that face biometrics in 2022?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: I think the biggest opportunity is figuring out how we are going to insert biometric technology into mainstream applications. The success of any technology depends on how quickly people adopt that solution. And that has been the challenge for biometric technology, the adoption into mainstream. We see that changing now, as we just mentioned earlier, with 70 percent of people willing to share their biometrics for better travel experiences. In that scenario it’s the service, it’s the speed of how they can go from the curb to their gate. With biometrics, the whole process becomes easy. The challenge is finding where and how can we insert this technology to make it easy for people to use, so they realize that biometrics technology enhances protection of their privacy, rather than invades it. If this message resonates with the consumer, we will see the opportunity for growth is tremendous.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: Finally, one last question. What can we expect from Iris ID in the coming year?</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: Very soon we’re going to be talking about the advancements that we are making in the algorithms for matching, counter measures, and acquisition of images. Lots of good stuff is happening, and you will see some new announcements towards the middle of this year on new product lines as well. We’re very excited for 2022 and beyond.</p>



<p>Peter Counter, Editor in Chief, FindBiometrics: Thank you, Mohammed, for joining me today. Always a pleasure to catch-up.</p>



<p>Mohammed Murad, Vice President, Iris ID: It’s always fantastic to work with you guys and talk about the industry, where it’s going, where we are going, and where we think we need to be to make sure that biometric solutions are part of mainstream apps.</p>

<p>These are becoming one of the fastest-growing security systems in the market. Why? Because these systems provide a combination of access control and convenience like no other:</p>



  Biometrics is the analysis of biological components by technology&nbsp;  Access control is the management of access points, like a doorway or elevator, to ensure only authorized users get in  



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/resource/biometric-authentication-access/">Biometric access control</a> systems combine the power of biometrics with access control systems for a modern security technology that delivers numerous benefits across a wide variety of industries.</p>



 What Is a Biometric Access Control System? 



<p>Biometrics is a method of establishing a person’s identity based on their physical, behavioral, or chemical traits. These uses the biometric data to either grant or deny access to premises. These systems look for behavioral or physical characteristics which are unique to each individual, including iris or retina scans, voice recognition, and gait analysis. Over <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/4989/biometric-technologies/#:~:text=Over%2075%20percent%20of%20U.S.,can%20add%20to%20their%20organization.">75%</a> of Americans have used some form of biometric technology, ranging from fingerprint to facial recognition to hand geometry.</p>







 How Do Biometric Access Control Systems Work? 



<p>A standard system has four main components, which we break into small, easy-to-understand pieces, below.</p>



<p>Working Main Components&nbsp;</p>



  The Sensor Device  



<p>A biometric scanner obtains necessary information from the user. For example, the optical sensor in a fingerprint capture device produces an image of the ridge structure of your finger. The scanned image serves as the bedrock for further processing and analysis. The sensor unit forms a key interface between the user and the system, minimizing the possibility of reading failure rate. The quality of the data obtained depends on the quality and characteristics of the sensor.&nbsp;</p>



  Data Quality Assessment  



<p>The next step is to assess the quality of biometric data gathered by the sensors. If needed, a signal enhancing algorithm is applied to the biometric data to improve the data quality. After the data is assessed, a specific data set is chosen to represent the qualifying data set. The biometric feature set that is used is stored within the system’s database as a biometric template.&nbsp;</p>



  Comparing and Matching Data  



<p>After the feature set is gathered, it is compared to the stored data to find any identical matching points. The number of matches can fluctuate between the readings depending on the quality of data collected.&nbsp;</p>



  The System Database  



<p>The database stores all the required information. A single biometric sample is usually sufficient for extracting a user template from the system database, but sometimes multiple samples may be required to form a mosaic representation.&nbsp;</p>



 Types of Biometric Access Control Systems 



<p>Ensuring that your building is free from unauthorized visitors is important for the safety of your infrastructure. Here are some of the most popular types that can help you secure your building:&nbsp;</p>







 Fingerprint Scan 



<p>One of the earliest and most common forms is fingerprint scanning. In ancient times, the Chinese used fingerprints to authenticate government records, and the people of Babylon used fingerprints to sign written contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, fingerprint scanning continues to be widely used in many different industries. Examples include: identifying suspected criminals, authenticating payments, and access control systems.&nbsp;</p>



 Iris Scan&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/the-eyes-have-it-what-is-iris-recognition/">Iris recognition</a> technology uses multiple unique patterns in the human eye to provide accurate identification. Iris scanners use infrared light and high-resolution cameras to create a structured map of the iris and convert this information into a biometric template that becomes a person’s ID. Currently, iris scans are used in a variety of access control systems as well as law enforcement for identifying suspects.</p>



 Voice Authentication 



<p>The use of voice authentication can reduce and even eliminate the need for passwords to access your facility. Voice authentication works by breaking down the audio of speech into individual sounds and analyzing each sound using algorithms. The algorithms find the most probable word to fit into that language and transcribe those sound clips into texts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/biometric-voice-recognition/">Voice authentication</a> is used to identify individuals over the phone for medical or banking purposes as well as to authenticate users logging into applications.</p>



 3 Benefits of Biometric Access Control Systems 



<p>The three main benefits of using a biometric access system are:</p>



  Highly Secure  



<p>The use the unique characteristics of a human body, which are unlikely to be stolen or used by someone other than the intended user. Traditional access keys or tokens can be easily spoofed, lost, or stolen, but biometrics cannot.</p>



  More Convenient  



<p>Biometric access systems are convenient because they do not require additional information other than the user themselves. Additionally, most biometric systems can identify users in less than a second, reducing delays caused at manual identification checkpoints.</p>



  Reduced Expenses  



<p>This help organizations cut costs by eliminating the security staff required to conduct manual identification. In addition, access control systems that use keycards or other tokens incur replacement or damage costs, however; there are no such costs with&nbsp; biometrics.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>There are several important reasons why biometrics are so popular for access control, including increased security, improved convenience, and lower costs. Traditionally, when upgrading technologies, there is a tradeoff among security, convenience, and costs, but with biometrics all three work together to provide the perfect solution.</p>



<p>In short, when it comes to access control systems, biometrics are unbeatable.</p>

<p>Completamente rinnovato, il servizio consente ora di accedere in tempo reale<br>a oltre 140 diverse tipologie di documenti, provenienti da ben 8 banche dati ufficiali.</p>



<p>Roma, 21 marzo 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, ha completamente rinnovato il proprio servizio Report e Visure, da oggi denominato Informazioni Commerciali, rendendolo uno strumento ancora più prezioso per chi voglia valutare in modo estremamente semplice e in tempo reale il grado di affidabilità di un partner d’affari sulla base di informazioni certe.</p>



<p>Sono infatti salite a ben oltre 140 le tipologie di documenti acquistabili e scaricabili dalla piattaforma, punto di accesso unico alle informazioni provenienti da 8 differenti banche dati: Registro delle Imprese, Camera di Commercio, Catasto, Conservatoria, PRA, Registro nazionale dei protesti, Procedure da tribunale e Pregiudizievoli di conservatoria.</p>



<p>Già indispensabile per professionisti e imprese, nella sua versione rinnovata il servizio è molto utile anche ai privati cittadini che vogliano informazioni per gestire in sicurezza, ad esempio, le proprie compravendite di veicoli o immobili, grazie all’accesso a documenti quali visure su mezzi di trasporto o catastali.</p>



<p>Il servizio offre anche l’inedita possibilità di ottenere Focus Approfonditi. Si tratta di report che, aggregando tra loro tutte le informazioni ufficiali disponibili su un singolo soggetto, ne forniscono una visione d’insieme completa e dettagliata, comprensiva anche di eventuali eventi negativi come protesti e procedure concorsuali.</p>



<p>Tutte le informazioni sono disponibili in tempo reale, senza i tradizionali tempi di attesa necessari per ricevere una visura o un report, e, grazie alla nuova funzione Monitoraggio, è possibile ricevere la notifica di ogni variazione che avvenga in merito ai documenti su cui si ha necessità di restare sempre aggiornati.</p>



<p>“Con il servizio Informazioni Commerciali completamente rinnovato confermiamo il nostro impegno a fianco di professionisti, imprese e anche privati cittadini” commenta Marco Lauro, Web &amp; Inside Sales Officer di InfoCert – Tinexta Group. “Sappiamo bene come il fattore tempo giochi un ruolo cruciale quando si devono prendere decisioni di business che, pertando, devono basarsi su informazioni non solo immediatamente disponibili, ma anche accurate, complete e affidabili”.</p>



<p>Utilizzare il servizio Informazioni Commerciali è davvero semplice. Una volta effettuata la registrazione, basta acquistare sull’eCommerce InfoCert una ricarica prepagata, scegliendola del taglio in linea con la propria esigenza (da 20 fino a 10.000 Euro) e beneficiando di bonus progressivi.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>Dr. Donnie Wendt's presentation will explore adding deception as a component of a security-in-depth strategy to increase cyber resilience. He will elaborate on this idea in his keynote <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5062/2" title="Donnie Wendt: Cybersecurity &amp; Deception">Vampires &amp; Cybersecurity: Using Deception to Increase Cyber Resilience</a> on Thursday, May 12, 2022, 11:30 am at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Donnie some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 How is deception used in the cyber realm? 
<p>I like to think of deception, you know, it's not really about deceiving the enemy, but it's about causing that enemy to deceive himself. So the art of deception is really about providing that enemy with something they want to believe. In my presentation, we'll discuss a few famous examples from history but when we talk about the cyber realm, that is where deception can really thrive. Cyberspace has made creating fake realities, imaginary assets, and false personas quite simple. In cyberspace, people use deception with ease for many purposes. Some of those users, and it's become so ubiquitous, we often don't even think of them when we think of deception. In some cases, they mimic very deceptive activities in the physical world. Sure, deception is used by cyberattackers and defenders, but it's also used for things such as ensuring privacy, criminal investigations, intel, counter-intel operations, conducting espionage. I use it for research, criminal activity, and quite often by ordinary people wanting to boost their social media profile or provide fake accounts on websites. However, my presentation is going to focus on the practical use of deception to assist with the cyber defense of our companies.<br><br></p>
 Why does your session title mention vampires? 
<p>Oh well, I am a big fan of vampire literature and I decided to have a little fun with this presentation, so I incorporated some analogies with vampires. I found that when discussing deception for cybersecurity, people seem to jump right to the honeypot and hunting nets. They start envisioning you know, enticing that attacker and perhaps through external lures and possibly even engaging the attacker. However, inviting attackers into your network, much like inviting vampires into your home, can have very serious repercussions. Furthermore, engaging them or watching them move about can be quite risky. I like to say leave that type of engagement to the professionals, the external security vendors and researchers, or in the case of vampires, let Buffy handle it. Often the best approach when encountering vampires is just to drive a wooden stake through his or her heart as soon as possible. Similarly, in most situations, once a suspected attacker is identified, organizations want to evict and block that attacker quickly and effectively.<br><br></p>
 How might companies use deception to increase security and resiliency? 
<p>Well, unfortunately, when we talk about attackers that targeted our organizations, unlike vampires, they can enter without an invitation. But that does not mean we need to invite them in, right? Fortunately, defenders can deploy many types of deception which can detect attackers and provide that early warning system of possible intrusions. So that we can respond quickly. Defenders can create a wide range of decoys, including servers, network devices, files, database entries, and even passwords, which only a malicious attacker should access. Defensive systems then monitor those decoys and alert on any interactions with bogus resources, including from insiders. Several of these methods are very simple to implement and require no new technology. However, I do believe that like an integrated deception platform can provide many benefits related to the creation, deployment, and maintenance of deceptive assets over time.<br><br></p>
 What are some keys to success when implementing a deception program? 
<p>First and foremost, the successful implementation and operation of a deception program require a clear strategy that defines the goals and objectives. Clear objectives and goals are going to assist in prioritizing many use cases for deception. Also, the program has to define the roles and responsibilities required not only to implement but to support that deception strategy over time. For example, what will be required to develop, deploy and maintain deceptive assets and respond to all the generated alerts? The objective and goals should then drive prioritization and implementation of use cases because when you consider an objective focused on detecting and evicting an attacker. It's going to have very different use cases than one focus on collecting threat intelligence. So it is important, again, to always start with that clear strategy, objectives, and goals. Let those drive your implementation. Also, be careful not to underestimate the effort required to maintain deceptive assets. Finally, always keep in mind, if you intend to engage the vampire, be very sure of your capabilities of wielding a wooden stake.</p>

<p>This week’s roundup of top biometrics stories is a varied one, featuring some interesting legislative news, a positive market forecast, a device launch, and some useful educational content.</p>



<p>On the latter front, readers showed sustained interest in a rundown of Gartner’s recently issued guide detailing the basic steps that businesses can take to start moving toward passwordless authentication. It’s a general roadmap aimed at corporate decision makers who aren’t necessarily very familiar with passwordless technologies, and the post’s popularity may speak to a growing appetite for such solutions:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/gartner-shares-roadmap-passwordless-authentication-030805/">Gartner Shares Roadmap for Passwordless Authentication</a> 



<p>For those who are more familiar with passwordless security and biometrics in particular, FindBiometrics has posted a full replay – helpfully broken into discrete sessions – of the recent Year in Review Virtual Identity Summit. Each of these sessions features experts delving into various degrees of detail on their particular domains of expertise, offering insights both for those who would be considered industry peers and for newcomers eager to learn about a particular topic:</p>



 <a>REPLAY: FindBiometrics and IBIA Present the Year in Review Virtual Identity Summit</a> 



<p>Moving on from education to prognostication, FindBiometrics readers showed a lot of interest this week in a new market forecast concerning the global ‘Biometric System Market’. The report anticipates that this market will grow from a value of $42.9 billion this year to $82.9 billion in 2027, with consumer electronics playing an important role in driving that growth:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/consumer-electronics-drive-82-9-billion-biometric-system-market-031403/">Consumer Electronics to Drive $82.9 Billion Biometric System Market</a> 



<p>Of course, there will also be plenty of room for biometric solutions that aren’t aimed at the consumer market. EyeLock’s offerings, for example, are primarily pitched to businesses and other organizations in need of secure access management, and the company got some attention this week with its launch of NanoAccess, a web-based software solution that can be used to manage all of its hardware as well as additional devices beyond its biometric portfolio:</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/eyelock-introduces-nanoaccess-biometric-solution-503142/">EyeLock Announces NanoAccess System, Greatly Enhancing Biometric Solutions Portfolio</a> 



<p>And finally, lawmakers in Virginia raised some eyebrows this week with the latest sign of a possible backlash against the wave of facial recognition bans that swept across parts of America over the last couple of years. They have now replaced a blanked ban on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement with a new, more nuanced piece of legislation laying out the conditions in which police can use this kind of technology in the state:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nuance.com/index.html">Nuance Communications</a> continues to strengthen its relationship with the <a href="https://www.cerner.com/">Cerner Corporation</a>. Cerner is best known for its Cerner Millennium electronic health record (EHR), which leverages Nuance’s Dragon Medical Platform to simplify medical recordkeeping procedures.</p>



  



<p>The two companies expanded on that partnership in 2020, when Cerner <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/cerner-adds-nuance-voice-assistant-ehr-platform-073105/">added Nuance’s voice assistant technology</a> to allow medical workers to navigate healthcare records with voice commands. They are now taking that one step further to allow doctors to generate new records with similar voice technology. Cerner will specifically be integrating <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nuance-formally-adds-ambient-clinical-intelligence-dragon-medical-portfolio-022405/">Nuance’s Dragon Ambient eXperience</a> (DAX) solution into the Millennium platform to speed up documentation.</p>



<p>In doing so, Nuance and Cerner are hoping to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare professionals, and to address the high rate of clinical burnout during the pandemic. They noted that most healthcare schedules only give staff 15 minutes for each patient appointment, which is a problem because the average Cerner EHR session lasts more than 16 minutes. The use of Nuance’s DAX technology should help lower that number, since it can identify keywords referring to things like allergies, medications, and procedures and automatically add them to a patient’s record. The platform negates the need for manual input, and allows doctors to devote their attention to patients instead of paperwork.</p>



<p>“Cerner is focused on putting the patient and caregiver at the center of all we do,” said Cerner Chief Health Officer Nasim Afsar. “By strengthening our collaboration with Nuance to automate administrative tasks, we will help caregivers get back to caring for patients and ensure they get the care they need.”</p>



<p>“<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/cooper-expands-use-nuances-dax-solution-083102/">Health systems that have deployed Nuance DAX</a> are creporting improvements in physician satisfaction, patient experience, and documentation quality,” added Nuance EVP and Healthcare GM Diana Nole. “Deeper integration with Cerner will streamline workflows while enhancing the essential value of the EHR for delivering care.”</p>



<p>Nuance and Cerner announced the new arrangement at this week’s HIMSS Global Health Conference &amp; Exhibition. They project that the number of healthcare workers will be 3.2 million short of the demand by 2026, especially if burnout goes unaddressed. In the meantime, Microsoft completed its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/microsoft-completes-nuance-acquisition-503072/">acquisition of Nuance</a> earlier this month.</p>

<p><a href="https://onfido.com/">Onfido</a> is urging financial institutions to stay vigilant in a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-offers-advice-sanctions-compliance-030801/">rapidly shifting regulatory environment</a>. The company noted that many governments (including the US, the UK, and the European Union) have <a href="https://onfido.com/resources/blog/sanctions-compliance">imposed strict sanctions</a> on Russian businesses and political actors since the country launched its invasion of Ukraine, even going so far as to revoke access to the international SWIFT financial system.</p>



  



<p>The problem, from a financial services perspective, is that it is difficult to fulfill sanctions requirements when those requirements can change on a daily basis, and there is very little leeway for those that fail. Doing business with sanctioned entities or individuals can cost a financial institution hundreds of thousands of dollars for each violation, and the total can easily climb into the billions if it happens at scale.</p>



<p>That’s why financial institutions need to make sure that they are not transacting with any sanctioned parties, and that’s where Onfido believes it can help. The company specifically pitched its Watchlist Check solution, which provides financial institutions with insight into their clients beyond the initial onboarding process. Watchlist Check cross-references client lists with lists of criminals, sanctioned individuals, and politically exposed persons, and sends a notification to the financial institution if there are any names that it needs to be concerned about.</p>



<p>As it relates to the current situation, the solution is also noteworthy because it re-screens users every single day to make sure that someone has not been added to a watchlist in the past 24 hours. In doing so, the Watchlist Ongoing Monitoring feature keeps financial institutions up to date with the latest Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, and ensures that their decisions are made with accurate intelligence. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Onfido encourages financial institutions to maintain strong security during onboarding. The company advocates for the use of database checks, and the use of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-security-significantly-reduces-id-fraud-suggests-onfido-report-7122103/">biometric identity verification technology</a> that can match a face to a photo ID. Onfido itself has provided such services for businesses all over the world, with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/wallester-as-opts-for-biometric-onboarding-via-onfido-7032203/">Wallester AS</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-provides-biometric-onboarding-tescos-mpayments-app-030901/">Tesco Bank</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-provides-selfie-onboarding-lemonway-payments-platform-122002/">Lemonway</a> standing as some of its most recent customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> and <a href="https://www.areeba.com/">areeba</a> are continuing to grow their biometric payment card business in the Middle East. The two companies entered into a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-inks-exclusive-biometric-payment-solutions-agreement-with-areeba-110141/">strategic partnership to market biometric cards</a> in the region back in 2020, and went on to announce a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/middle-east-bank-announces-biometric-card-pilot-with-zwipe-areeba-010602/">card pilot with a mid-sized bank</a> in the Levant region earlier this year.</p>



  



<p>They are now trying to build on that initial success with another biometric card trial. Zwipe and areeba have agreed to provide biometric payment cards for Iraq’s Al Mansour Bank, in a move that will make Al Mansour one of the first to offer a biometric card to customers in the country. Al Mansour itself is a relatively small private bank with just over 10 branches in Iraq, though the news nevertheless indicates that the interest in biometric cards is accelerating in the region.</p>



<p>In that regard, it is worth noting that Qatar National Bank is the majority owner of Al Mansour. The pilot is expected to kick off sometime in the next few months.</p>



<p>“Post pandemic, we have seen strong demand for PIN-free and touch-less payment solutions as they are safer and much more secure,” said Al Mansour Head of Retail Roger Abboud. “Biometric Payment Cards will uplift our payment portfolio and enable us to deliver excellent service quality to our customers.”</p>



<p>“The banking sector in Iraq is demonstrating a great appetite for innovation,” added Zwipe MENA Region GM Ramzi Saboury. “We are thrilled with our collaboration with Al Mansour Bank on biometric payment cards together with areeba, one of our key partners in the region.”</p>



<p>The news comes only a few short months after the Central Bank of Iraq <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/central-bank-iraq-encourages-banks-work-zwipe-712103/">gave Zwipe an official endorsement</a>, and encouraged banks in the country to try the company’s technology. Zwipe itself has also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-forms-biometric-card-partnership-with-qatar-fintech-hub-030203/">partnered with the Qatar Fintech Hub</a> in an effort to raise awareness for biometric technology in the financial sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mazda is installing a facial recognition system in its new CX-60 SUVs. The system does not come in the standard version of the vehicle, though it is available in the premium Homura and Takumi models, or as an optional add-on for those who purchase the Comfort Pack.</p>



  



<p>In terms of utility, Mazda’s system is able to store the faces of six registered individuals, and will automatically adjust various settings to suit the preferences of the person behind the wheel. The aptly named Driver Personalization System is connected to more than 250 different features, and can tweak everything from the temperature to the radio volume.</p>



<p>However, the seat adjustment feature may be the biggest selling point. According to Mazda, the Driver Personalization System takes advantage of an onboard camera that can gauge the position of the driver’s eyes within the vehicle. It can then adjust key components of the vehicle like the side mirrors and the steering wheel to meet the driver’s eyeline. In doing so, the system makes driving more comfortable, and could improve visibility to make things safer on the road.</p>



<p>The Personalization System covers the heads-up display in addition to the seat, mirrors, and steering wheel. It can also move the steering wheel and seat when someone opens the door to make it easier for drivers to get into and out of their vehicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CX-60 is a plug-in hybrid. Beyond the biometric features, Mazda customers can purchase a Convenience Pack that comes with a 360-degree camera that is mounted on the roof and can provide a top-down view of the vehicle. That feed can be brought up on a 12.3-inch center display to give drivers more situational awareness in tight spaces.</p>



<p>Mazda is not the first car manufacturer to use facial recognition to personalize the driving experience. Genesis offered a similar system in its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/genesis-offer-facial-authentication-fingerprint-ignition-with-upcoming-gv60-092002/">recent GV60</a>, and Tesla is reportedly planning to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/patent-suggests-tesla-will-personalize-cybertruck-with-facial-recognition-060204/">add the technology to its Cybertruck</a>. LG Electronics, meanwhile, is working on a system that would <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/lg-patent-filing-delves-into-automotive-biometrics-7012204/">use faces to enable biometric ignition</a>.</p>

 Ontology EVM — I Don’t Get&nbsp;It! <p>We’ve been gathering the most frequently asked questions about the Ontology EVM. This article will continue to be updated, as more questions arise. If you can’t find the answer to your question here, then please come over to <a href="http://t.me/OntologyNetwork">t.me/OntologyNetwork</a> and ask one of the friendly admins or Harbingers.</p> General  1. What is a Virtual Machine? What is&nbsp;EVM? <p>A virtual machine is a computer that runs on the blockchain and allows smart contracts from multiple sources to interact. Ontology already supports Wasm and NeoVM. This summer, we <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-3rd-anniversary-special-ontologys-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-debut-f92111436a8e">announced</a> that we had completed the development of our Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is the most popular and widely used VM, supporting a huge variety of&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>Read more in our Ontology <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/what-are-ethereum-virtual-machines-and-why-should-you-care-930a739171a9">EVM 101</a>&nbsp;blog.</p> 2. OEP-4 tokens are on the Ontology blockchain. What do they become when bridged to the&nbsp;EVM? <p>They will become ORC-20 tokens after being&nbsp;bridged.</p> 3. How many blockchains will Ontology have after the EVM&nbsp;launch? <p>Still 1 blockchain. Ontology’s multi-virtual machines make it the most VM-supported blockchain, including <a href="https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/neovm.html">NeoVM</a>, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Wasm</a>VM, and now Ontology&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>.</p> 4. How many decimals will ONT and ONG have after the recent MainNet&nbsp;Upgrade? <p>9 for ONT and 18 for&nbsp;ONG.</p> 5. How will the decimals change affect node staking? Do we still need to put ONT in integer form when&nbsp;staking? <p>The decimals change won’t affect ONT staking rules. You need at least 1 ONT to stake and your total staking amount needs to be an&nbsp;integer.</p> 6. Which popular wallet will support the new EVM&nbsp;tokens? <p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onto-wallet/ifckdpamphokdglkkdomedpdegcjhjdp">ONTO Web Wallet</a> and <a href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask</a>.</p> 7. What’s the RPC URL for Ontology MainNet that supports Ontology&nbsp;EVM? <p><a href="https://dappnode1.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode1.ont.io:10339</a></p><p><a href="https://dappnode2.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode2.ont.io:10339</a></p><p><a href="https://dappnode3.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode3.ont.io:10339</a></p><p><a href="https://dappnode4.ont.io:10339">https://dappnode4.ont.io:10339</a></p><p>Reference: <a href="https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract/development-environment-and-tools#network-info">https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract/development-environment-and-tools#network-info</a></p> 8. What does it consume when transacting on the&nbsp;EVM? <p>When making transactions on Ontology EVM, you consume the native gas token ONG for any transactions on the Ontology EVM. Each transaction on the Ontology EVM costs at least 0.0525 ONG (0x- address) depending on the complexity of the smart contracts.</p><p>If you start the transaction from an address that starts with an A, it will cost ONG from an address that starts with an&nbsp;A.</p><p>If you start the transaction from addresses that start with 0x, it will cost ONG from an address that starts with&nbsp;0x.</p><p>For instance, ONG (0x- address) ⇔WONG (0x- address) performing wrapping or unwrapping transactions will cost ONG (0x- address).</p><p>If you transfer ONG from an address that starts with an A to an address that starts with 0x, it will cost you 0.05 ONG from the A addresses. If the transaction is the other way around, it will cost you 0.0525 ONG for 0x addresses. The gas fee is determined by underlying gas fee requirements in smart contracts.</p><p>9. What is the purpose of WONG? Why would you wrap ONG?<br>ONG is actually the native gas token of the Ontology network. However, some contracts may require ORC-20 (Similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum) standard tokens. Just like ETH isn’t ERC-20 compatible, hence wETH exists, so we need WONG for those types of contracts.</p><p>A wrapped token is a token that represents a cryptocurrency from another blockchain or token standard and is worth the same as the original cryptocurrency.</p><p>You can wrap ONG via <a href="http://bridge.ont.io">Ontology Bridge</a>.

How to apply for the 10m Ontology EVM&nbsp;Fund? <p>You can simply submit your application to join us on our journey by proposing on the <a href="https://buidl.ont.io/">Ontology Community Forum</a>. Our team will check and respond to your applications soon.</p> 11. What to do if my exchange has suspended deposits or withdrawals of Ontology&nbsp;tokens? <p>It is a common action for exchanges to suspend deposit or withdrawal transactions during network upgrades. This is to make sure users are protected. Please stay tuned with your exchange’s news channel and normal transactions should be resumed soon after the upgrade is complete.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>***</p>
<p>Il prossimo 22 marzo, Danilo Cattaneo, CEO di InfoCert prenderà parte dell’evento organizzato da Forbes Italia dal titolo “Empower The Future”, il digital business summit dedicato all’innovazione e alla sostenibilità.</p>
<p>Forbes Italia è l’edizione italiana del business magazine più famoso al mondo. Punto di riferimento per chi lavora con e per il business. “Empower The Future” mette attorno a un tavolo i protagonisti istituzionali, accademici, d’impresa e culturali per tracciare uno scenario possibile riguardo a come verrà affrontata la transizione digitale, ecologica ed energetica e come sarà in grado di abilitare un nuovo sistema economico e sociale, a moderare le tavole rotonde vi sarà l’autorevole autore e conduttore Enzo Argante, di Forbes Italia.</p>
<p>L’apertura dell’evento vedrà una prima sessione dedicata alla transizione digitale, dalla gestione della conoscenza data-driven, all’intelligenza artificiale. Partendo dall’assunto che i cambiamenti che hanno caratterizzato gli ultimi anni sono stati profondi e irreversibili, la società intera si trova a dover riscrivere le logiche e i processi del sistema economico mondiale, il quale per resistere deve adeguarsi ai nuovi modelli di business.</p>
<p>Aprirà la discussione il Rettore dell’Università Luigi Bocconi di Milano Gianmario Verona; successivamente Igor De Biasio, AD di Arexpo parlerà del progetto che vedrà la creazione di uno dei più grandi Distretti dell’Innovazione europeo nell’area Expo2015; a seguire Giorgio Ventre di Apple Academy descriverà il modello accademico pubblico/privato, un sistema che rappresenta un’eccellenza a livello europeo; la parola passerà quindi a NTT DATA conil suo CEO Walter Ruffinoni, il quale avrà il Focus sulle palestre relazionali; con Erminio Polito, Direttore Energy &amp; Utilities in Italia di Minsait&nbsp; verrà affrontato il tema delle competenze e processi di trasformazione digitale delle imprese che abilita nuovi modelli di business; Giampiero Savorelli, Managing Director HP, tratterà di manifattura digitale, uffici distribuiti e nuova organizzazione del lavoro; per InfoCert invece sarà il turno del CEO Danilo Cattaneo, il quale proporrà una lettura dei processi di deburocratizzazione messi in atto negli ultimi anni e in via di implementazione futura, sia in ambito italiano che europeo, di quanto valore possa generare la transizione al digitale sia in termini di risparmio che di semplificazione della burocrazia, di quali benefici possa essa portare al cittadino così come alle imprese e alla pubblica amministrazione; a seguire Roberta Cocco, Consulente del Ministro per l’Innovazione tecnologica e la transizione digitale approfondirà l’argomento “come le competenze digitali potranno aiutare le persone”; la tavola rotonda si concluderà con l’intervento di Dario Menasce, dell’ Istituto Nazione Fisica Nucleare, il quale parlerà del futuro quantico, su cui si stanno investendo capitali enormi in tutto il mondo.</p>
<p>La sessione delle 15:00, dedicata alla Transizione Energetica avrà numerosi ospiti fra i quali Caterina Petrillo, Presidente Area Science Park; Mario Calderini, School of Management Politecnico Milano; Cristian Acquistapace, Managing Director Renovit; Andrea Bombardi, EVP RINA; Angelo Fienga, Leader Sustainability and Circular Economy di CISCO EMEAR; e Annalisa Muccioli, CEO Eni Progetti.</p>

  <p>As programmers, how many of you have a good understanding of programming safety or secure programming? It’s not the same as application security or cyber security. I have to confess; I didn’t know a lot about these in the early years of my career, especially since I didn’t come from a computer science background. But looking back, I think programming security is something every programmer should be aware of and should be taught at a junior level.</p>

<p>What is safe programming, or to be more precise, what does being safe mean for a programming language? Or rather, what does unsafe mean? Let’s set the context first.</p>

 Programming safety 

<blockquote>
  <p>Programming safety = Memory safety + Type safety + Thread safety</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we talk about “safety” in programming, we mean some combination of three distinct things: memory safety, type safety, and thread safety. There are four if you count null safety as distinct from memory safety, but we’ll group those two together today.</p>

 Memory safety 

<p>In a memory-safe language, when you access a variable or an item in an array, you can be sure that you are indeed accessing what you meant to or are allowed to access. In other words, you will not be reading or writing into the memory of another variable or pointer by mistake, regardless of what you do in your program.</p>

<p>So, why is this a big deal? Don’t all major programming languages ensure this?</p>

<p>Yes, to varying extents. But some languages are unsafe by default—for example, C and C++. In C or C++, you can access the memory of another variable by mistake, or you can free a pointer twice; that’s called double-free error. Sometimes a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed, and that’s called a use-after-free (UAF) error or a dangling pointer error. Such behaviors are categorized as undefined; they are unpredictable and cause security vulnerabilities rather than just crashing the program. In these scenarios, a crashing program is a good thing as it won’t cause a security vulnerability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965</p>

  <p>– Tony Hoare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then there is also null safety which is kind of related to memory safety. I come from a Java/JavaScript background, and we are used to the concept of null. Null is infamous for being the worst invention in programming. Garbage collected languages need a concept of nothing so that a pointer can be freed when unused. But the concept also leads to issues and pain, like the null pointer exceptions. Technically this relates to memory safety, but most memory-safe languages still let you use null as a value leading to null pointer errors.</p>

 Type safety 

<p>In a type-safe language, when you access a variable, you access it as the correct type of data according to how it is stored. This gives us the confidence to work on data without manually checking for the data type during runtime. Memory safety is required for a language to be type-safe.</p>

 Thread safety 

<p>In a thread-safe language, you can access or modify the same memory from multiple threads simultaneously without worrying about data races. This is generally achieved using message passing techniques, mutual exclusion locks (mutexes), and thread synchronization. Thread safety is required for optimal memory and type safety, so generally, memory and type-safe languages tend to be thread-safe as well.</p>

 Why does it matter? 

<p>Ok! Why does this matter, and why should we care? Let’s take a look at some stats to get an idea first.</p>

 Memory safety issues 

<p>Memory safety issues are the cause of most security CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) we encounter. Undefined behavior can be abused by a hacker to take control of the program or to leak privileged information. If you try to access an out of bounds array element in a memory-safe language, you will just crash the program with panic or error, which is predictable behavior.</p>

<p>This is why memory-related bugs in C/C++ systems often result in CVEs and emergency patches. There are other memory-unsafe behaviors in C/C++, like accessing pointers from stack frames that have been popped, a memory that has been de-allocated, iterator invalidation, and so on. Memory safe languages, even ones that are not the safest, still protect against such security issues.</p>

<p>If we take a look at stats, we can see that:</p>

 
   About 70% of all <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/18/we-need-a-safer-systems-programming-language/">CVEs at Microsoft</a> are memory safety issues. 
   Two-thirds of <a href="https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/lssna19/d6/kernel-modules-in-rust-lssna2019.pdf">Linux kernel vulnerabilities</a> come from memory safety issues. 
   An <a href="https://langui.sh/2019/07/23/apple-memory-safety/">Apple study</a> found that 60-70% of vulnerabilities in iOS and macOS are memory safety vulnerabilities. 
   <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/queue-hardening-enhancements.html">Google estimated</a> that 90% of Android vulnerabilities are memory safety issues. 
   <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/">70% of all Chrome</a> security bugs are memory safety issues. 
   An <a href="https://twitter.com/LazyFishBarrel/status/1129000965741404160">analysis of 0-days</a> that were discovered being exploited in the wild found that more than 80% of the exploited - vulnerabilities were memory safety issues. 
   Some of the most popular security issues of all time are memory safety issues:
     
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Slammer">Slammer worm</a>, <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/docs/memory-safety/out-of-bounds%20write">WannaCry</a>, <a href="https://blog.lookout.com/trident-pegasus-technical-details">Trident exploit</a>, <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/would-rust-have-prevented-heartbleed-another-look">HeartBleed</a>, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/09/stagefrightened.html">Stagefright</a>, <a href="https://blog.qualys.com/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability">Ghost</a> 
     
   
 

<p>That’s a huge chunk of CVEs, and of course, it’s no surprise that most of it is from C/C++ systems 🤷</p>

<p>Imagine a world without memory safety issues. Imagine the amount of developer time saved, amount of money saved, amount of resources saved. Sometimes I wonder why we still use C/C++. Why do we trust humans, against all available evidence, to handle memory manually? And this is without considering other non-CVE memory issues like memory leaks, memory efficiency, and so on.</p>

 Thread safety issues 

<p>Though not as notorious as memory safety, thread safety is also a cause of major headaches for developers and can result in security issues.</p>

<p>Thread safety issues can cause two types of vulnerabilities:</p>

 
   Information loss caused by one thread overwriting information from another
     
       Pointer corruption that allows privilege escalation or remote execution 
     
   
   Integrity loss due to information from multiple threads being interlaced
     
       The best-known attack of this type is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_check_to_time_of_use">TOCTOU</a> (time of check to time of use) attack, which is a race condition between checking a condition (like a security credential) and using the results. 
     
   
 

<p>Both information loss and integrity loss can be exploited and lead to security issues. While thread safety-related exploits are harder and less common than memory safety ones, they are still possible.</p>

 Type safety issues 

<p>While not as critical as memory and thread safety, lack of type safety can also lead to security issues, and type safety is important for ensuring memory safety.</p>

<p>Low-level exploits are possible in languages that are not type-safe, as an attacker can manipulate the data structure and change the data type to gain access to privileged information. Although this type of exploit is pretty rare, it’s not unheard of.</p>

 Why Rust? 

<p>Now that we understand how important programming safety is, let’s see why Rust is one of the safest languages and how it avoids most of the security issues we normally encounter with languages like C/C++.</p>

<p>For those not familiar, Rust is a high-level multi-paradigm language. It’s ideal for functional and imperative programming. It has very modern and, in my opinion, the best tooling for a programming language. Though it was originally designed as a systems programming language, its advantages and flexibility have made it suitable for all sorts of use cases as a general-purpose language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Rust throws around some buzzwords in its docs, but they are not just marketing buzz; they actually mean it with full sincerity, and they matter a lot.”</p>
</blockquote>

 Rust’s safety guarantee 

<p>The safety guarantee is one of the most important aspects of Rust; Rust is memory-safe, null-safe, type-safe, and thread-safe by design.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If the compiler detects unsafe code, it will refuse to compile that code by default. You would have to go out of your way to break those guarantees using the <code>unsafe</code> keyword. So even in cases where you would have to write unsafe code, you are making it explicit and hence issues can easily be traced down to specific code blocks.</p>

 Memory safety in Rust 

<p>Rust ensures memory safety at compile time using its innovative ownership mechanism and the borrow checker built into the compiler. The compiler does not allow memory unsafe code unless it’s explicitly marked as unsafe in an unsafe block or function. This static compile-time analysis eliminates many types of memory bugs, and with some additional runtime checks, Rust guarantees memory safety.
There is no concept of null at the language level. Instead, Rust provides the <code>Option</code> <a href="http://web.mit.edu/rust-lang_v1.25/arch/amd64_ubuntu1404/share/doc/rust/html/book/first-edition/enums.html">enum</a>, which can be used to mark the presence or absence of a value. This makes the resulting code null safe and much easier to deal with, and you will never encounter null pointer exceptions in Rust.</p>

<p>The ownership and borrowing mechanisms make Rust one of the most memory-efficient languages while avoiding pitfalls with manual memory management and garbage collection. It has memory efficiency and speeds comparable to C/C++, and memory safety that’s better than garbage-collected languages like Java and Go.</p>

<p>I’ve written detailed articles about <a href="https://deepu.tech/memory-management-in-programming/">memory management in different languages</a> in my personal blog, so check them out if you are interested in learning more about memory management in Java, Rust, JavaScript, and Go.</p>

 Type safety in Rust 

<p>Rust is statically typed, and it guarantees type safety by strict compile-time type checks and by guaranteeing memory safety. This is not special, as most modern languages are statically typed. Rust also allows some level of dynamic typing with the <code>dyn</code> keyword and <code>Any</code> type when required. But the powerful type inference and the compiler ensure type safety even in those cases.</p>

 Thread safety in Rust 

<p>Rust guarantees thread safety using similar concepts for memory safety and provides standard library features like channels, mutex, and ARC (Atomically Reference Counted) pointers. In safe Rust, you can have either one mutable reference to a value or unlimited read-only references to it at any given time. The ownership mechanism makes it impossible to cause accidental data race from a shared state. This makes us confident to focus on code and let the compiler worry about shared data between threads.</p>

 Other Rust features 

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://deepu.tech/my-second-impression-of-rust/">my impressions of Rust</a> in a detailed post on my blog where I explain Rust’s excellent features that make it unique. Here is a short summary of those features:</p>

 
   Zero cost abstractions: Rust offers true zero-cost abstractions, which means that you can write code in any style with any number of abstractions without paying any performance penalty. Very few languages offer this, which is why Rust is so fast. Rust compiler will always generate the best byte code regardless of the style of code you write. This means you can write functional-style code and get the same performance as its imperative counterpart. 
   Immutable by default: Values in Rust are immutable, or read-only, by default. Mutability has to be declared explicitly. This, along with the ability to pass by value or reference, makes it super easy to write functional code without side effects. 
   Pattern matching: Rust has excellent support for advanced pattern matching. Pattern matching is used extensively for error handling and control flows in Rust. 
   Advanced generics, traits, and types: Rust has advanced <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html">generics</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html">traits</a> with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/type-aliases.html">type aliasing</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/types/inference.html">type inference</a> support. Though generics could easily become complex when combined with lifetimes, it’s one of the most powerful features of Rust. 
   Macros: There is also support for metaprogramming using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-06-macros.html">macros</a>. Rust supports both declarative macros and procedural macros. Macros can be used like annotations, attributes, and functions. 
   Great tooling and one of the best compilers: Rust has one of the best compilers and the best tooling I have seen and experienced (compared to JS world, JVM languages, Go, Python, Ruby, CSharp, PHP, C/C++). It also has excellent documentation, which is shipped with the tooling for offline use. How awesome is that! 
   Excellent community and ecosystem: Rust has one of the most vibrant and friendly communities. The ecosystem is quite young but is one of the fastest-growing. 
 

<p>Usually, a programming language would offer a choice between safety, speed, and high-level abstractions. At the very best, you can pick two of those. For example, with Java/C#/Go, you get safety and high-level abstractions at the cost of runtime overhead, whereas C++ gives you speed and abstractions at the cost of safety. But Rust offers all three and a good developer experience as a bonus. I don’t think many other mainstream languages can claim that.</p>

  <p>“Rust, not Firefox, is Mozilla’s greatest industry contribution.”</p>

  <p>– TechRepublic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn’t mean there are no downsides, and Rust is definitely not a silver bullet. There are issues like the steep learning curve and complexity of the language. But it’s the closest thing to a silver bullet, in my opinion. That doesn’t mean you should just start using Rust for everything. If a use case requires speed, concurrency, building system tools, or building CLIs, then Rust is an ideal choice. Personally, I would recommend Rust over C/C++ for any use case unless you are building a tool for a legacy platform that Rust does not support.</p>

			 Tokenized Real Estate 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 How BlocHome reduces 90% of compliance and administrative costs by tokenizing real estate<br>
 
<p>BlocHome’s team has the vision to democratize access to real estate investment. The founding team made it a reality by using Tokeny’s white-label tokenization platform to allow investors to gradually build up their real estate assets while reducing compliance and administration costs and lowering the entry barrier.</p>

		 
	 
      <p>Fractionalized real estate allowing investment from 1000 euro</p>      <p>100% digitized onboarding and KYC processes</p>      <p>90% of compliance &amp; administrative costs saved</p>                              The T-REX tokenization platform allows us to turn real estate into a liquid asset in a fast, secure, and most importantly user-friendly approach. We can split real estate into very small pieces and still manage it efficiently. We tokenize assets in a real partnership spirit with the Tokeny team that has a perfect understanding of our business case and is able to provide tailored solutions. Since we started, we can count on the Tokeny team to help us in any situation, as they are organized and efficient at providing support if we run into any issues.  Jean-Paul ScheurenCo-Founder of BlocHome        
	 
		 
			 The asset class that only the more affluent can afford 
<p><a href="http://blochome.com/">BlocHome</a> is a Luxembourg-based real estate tokenization platform which addresses specifically housing. Its founding team is composed of both senior real estate professionals with decades of experience and tech-savvy entrepreneurs. They have observed that many investors struggle to take part in real estate investment opportunities because of these reasons:</p>
 
 Low affordability: Investing in real estate can be very difficult for retail investors because it requires a large amount of money. 
 Lengthy processes: It can easily take months to complete the process from borrowing money from a bank to getting the apartment ownership notarized. 
 Lack of liquidity: The two issues mentioned above compound the liquidity problem, making it extremely hard to cash in when needed. Many investors have no choice but to sell their properties at low prices at the time when they are in desperate need of capital. 
 
<p>BlocHome team wants to change this status quo. Their goal is to move toward financial inclusion by making high-quality real estate projects selected and managed by experts accessible to all.</p>
 ‘Slicing’ ownership of buildings made possible on blockchain 
<p>When the founding members first heard about blockchain technology, they were fascinated by the concept of peer-to-peer value transfer.&nbsp; After months of intensive study of this technology, they believe it is the infrastructure that can help them achieve their vision thanks to the following characteristics:</p>
 
 Fractionalization: Assets can be divided into as many pieces as asset managers want via tokenization, providing affordable ‘slices’ of assets to their investors. 
 Programmability: Compliance rules and other conditions can be coded into tokens, enabling automated compliance, facilitating the investment or secondary trading process. 
 Transferability: Since compliance rules are embedded into the asset-based tokens,&nbsp; peer-to-peer transfers of assets are enabled, which leads to improved asset liquidity. 
 
 Preparing project and legal documentation for tokenization 
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We must now take advantage of this innovative technology to make real estate investment opportunities available to everyone.” said, Jean-Paul, after the team’s research into blockchain technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Luxembourg’s authority has given <a href="https://tokeny.com/luxembourg-gives-the-green-light-for-the-native-issuance-of-security-tokens/">the green light </a>for the native issuance of security tokens in 2021. Naturally, the team decided to tokenize the first real estate called <a href="https://www.blochome.com/en/clapton-residence">CLAPTON Residence</a>, a luxury 8-lot residence in the heart of Luxembourg.</p>
<blockquote><p>
As Jean-Paul states “Tokenization is not a gadget, you need to have a business plan that uses the full capacity of tokenization to democratize access, to achieve low-cost, high-security, and peer-to-peer transactions. We want to develop a service culture amongst the Blochomers’ community. In the end, we will be able to use tokenization at its full capacity and separate ownership from usage and ultimately redefine housing as a service.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The team designed a sophisticated business plan and model and then joined forces with CMS and Finimmo Luxembourg to prepare documents and provide all the information required by CSSF, the financial regulatory body in Luxembourg, for a non-regulated public offering.</p>
 Technology shield with onchain compliance built-in 
<p>While the documentation process went smoothly, the team faced technical difficulties when it came to bringing assets onto blockchain and embedding compliance rules into asset-based tokens as defined in the documentation. They realized that they needed to find technology experts to help them, and after comparing multiple providers, they opted for Tokeny’s tokenization solutions due to its unique <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchain-finance-leveraging-decentralized-technology-for-capital-markets-infrastructure/">onchain compliance approach</a> that consists by two elements:</p>
 
 Permissioned tokens: The platform uses the ERC-3643 standard to issue assets as permissioned tokens to embed eligibility and offering rules into tokens. 
 Digital identities: The solution links digital identities to tokenized assets, guaranteeing asset ownership (e.g., issuers can recover tokens for investors in the event of wallet loss). More importantly, automated compliance is realized as permissioned tokens can self-check investors’ eligibility through their identities’ verifiable credentials. 
 
<blockquote>
<p>“Tokeny’s solution bridges the gap between blockchain technology and the financial market with a powerful platform, allowing us to apply compliance and control on the ultra-efficient decentralized infrastructure,” Jean-Paul added.</p>
</blockquote>
 Asset management is quicker and cheaper 
<p>As all the securities documents were ready, the tokenization process was straightforward. Tokeny’s team was able to quickly set up the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX platform</a> for them by defining their parameters and branding, as the solution is modular and white-label. Assets were brought to the blockchain in a matter of a few weeks.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>BlocHome’s investors were able to register and invest directly via the digital platform in three main steps, which are (1) creating an account, (2) completing the KYC check, and (3) transferring funds. Once the process completes, investors can check the real estate-based tokens on their dashboard. The value of their holdings will be updated in their account after each independent 3rd party valuation every 6 months.</p>
<p>As a result, the whole onboarding process and lifecycle management of the securities are digital. The T-REX platform allowed the company to save up to 90% of the time and costs it takes to onboard investors, leading to 800 potential investors onboarded in the first month. As a result, BlocHome has attracted capital from sources it wouldn’t have otherwise reached, including small-scale investors spread across a number of countries.</p>
<p>More excitingly, the team is planning to add, after receiving approval from CSSF, the secondary market solution <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/">Billboard</a> to the platform in the coming months to allow investors to find an eligible counterparty, then conduct <a href="https://tokeny.com/dvd-transfers/">peer-to-peer transfers</a> whenever they want, freeing up liquidity in this historically illiquid asset. The settlement will be instant onchain and the transfers will be automatically verified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jean-Paul said: “We are satisfied with Tokeny’s solutions because they are designed with compliance at their core, addressing the need to comply with securities regulations required by law. We can therefore take advantage of all the benefits of blockchain technology for our investors and for us. Having them handle the technical aspect of everything lets us focus on what we do best. Together, we provide a complete digital experience to our investors.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today’s customers do not have one second to spare. They want their identities to be verified, fast. To meet their demands, you need to see more than just the status or result of their identification attempts.</p>



<p>You need a variety of useful features that give you real insights and control. Features like the ability to mine unique insights from your customers’ identification journeys, through smart configuration capabilities to general features like filtering identifications and accessing in depth reports. Ideally, all these features should live in one, easy to navigate place.</p>



<p>At IDnow , we understand the appetite of your customers and the range of services you need to satisfy them, which is why we enable you to actively manage and shape your customers’ identity verification experiences and diligently monitor verification outcomes using our customer portal, My IDnow.</p>



 Unparalleled orchestration for identity proofing 



<p>With My IDnow, you can choose the IDnow products your customers prefer and create intelligent fallback routing straight from the portal. This enables your customers to select their identity verification method of choice while you line up a secondary – or even tertiary – method should their first choice be inconclusive.</p>







<p>For example, a customer may begin the process using VideoIdent yet be unable to verify</p>



<p>their identity due to poor connectivity or being in a loud public space. In this instance, you can direct them straight to AutoIdent, which is better suited to their circumstances and stops them from abandoning the verification process.</p>



<p>Orchestration enables self-service, letting you direct your customers to another form of identity verification when they encounter bottlenecks. This leads to higher conversion rates, disrupts failed attempts, and leads to a far more customer-empowered experience with greater customer satisfaction.</p>



 Powerful insights 



<p>See all the information relating to the progress of your customer’s identification journey and visualize your customer’s identity verification.</p>







<p></p>



<p>Using My IDnow, you can access specific identity details and linked photos, videos and documents, and the up-to-date status of their application. From here, you can quickly and easily manage and verify customer identities.</p>



 Deeper customer analytics 



<p>Use vast identity verification metrics to analyse their business, maximize the strength of IDnow orchestration and understand customer onboarding better than ever before.</p>







<p>These metrics include the volume, conversion, SLA, channel breakdown, and abandonment rate of identity verification attempts, giving you unbeatable insights into your conversion rates, channel mix and the ability to spot and cancel fraudulent details.</p>



 Complete configuration 



<p>You can control the look and feel of your identity verification service with our customizable frontend design. Take control of your mobile app or web page, changing the font, color palette, button shapes, and company logo to showcase your company brand.</p>

<p>We are delighted to announce the launch of <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign</a>, a decentralized way to sign and verify files privately and securely. DIDsign is designed to make online services more convenient and safer in Web3, the next generation of the internet.</p><p>DIDsign allows you to sign any digital file — PDFs, audio, video, software — directly in your browser using a unique decentralized identifier (DID). You can download your signed file (or group of files) together with the signature to your device as a zip file and send it to anyone via your preferred method (email, Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.). The recipient can then easily verify that the file has not been tampered with. Signing, sending and verifying files is always&nbsp;free!</p><p>Using DIDsign, several people can sign the same document separately and confirm that it was signed. For example if a contract needs to be approved by several parties, each party can sign it and send their signature to the others. The document can then be checked against each signature, showing that each party signed the document in its original&nbsp;form.</p> Real-world use&nbsp;cases <p>With DIDsign, documents can be signed by anyone with an on-chain KILT DID. The recipient can then verify the files on <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign.io</a> — no blockchain experience needed! Only the sender and recipient have access to the files; they are not stored anywhere else. This provides a safe and private way of signing&nbsp;files.</p><p>In addition to text documents, DIDsign can be used for signing a video file, making sure it came from the right person and hasn’t been tampered with. Researchers could use DIDsign for verifying new research discoveries; doctors could use DIDsign for signing and verifying lab reports with colleagues in clinical settings. Developers could use DIDsign for signing software — if a single line of code is changed, the signature isn’t&nbsp;valid.</p><p>And DIDsign provides a new mechanism for Web3 processes like signing contracts in DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) or in the metaverse. Your avatar could even have its own DID for signing contracts. Decentralized ownership needs decentralized signatures.</p><p>DIDsign was built on KILT by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol.</p> How to Create DIDs on&nbsp;KILT <p>A digital identity contains your own unique “decentralized identifier” (DID), a string of numbers and letters that looks like&nbsp;this:</p><p>did:kilt:4s8kEBWV9nwU5znxmfR7DVA31DdBoqYGj49SAiAPzzigwJDm</p><p>You can create your DID for free using <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a>, a wallet for KILT Coins and credentials developed by BTE. In order to use DIDsign, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">upgrade your free DID to an on-chain DID</a> in Sporran, which anchors it on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>On-chain DIDs require a deposit of 2 KILT Coins and a small transaction fee (currently less than 0.01 KILT). This deposit remains on your account and is unlocked if you later delete your on-chain&nbsp;DID.</p><p>DIDsign can be used in large enterprises in a scalable way. While each signer requires an on-chain DID, the deposit and fees don’t necessarily need to be paid by the owner of that DID. Instead, businesses could pay the KILT Coin deposits for employee DIDs. In this way employees don’t face any of the hurdles that first-time users may have when buying&nbsp;crypto.</p> Your data under your&nbsp;control <p>Unlike centralized services that currently offer digital signatures, DIDsign does not store any data. You sign and store the files locally on your personal device (laptop or mobile) without external servers, providing privacy by design. Using the DIDsign website, the file recipient can quickly and easily verify that the signature is valid and that the contents have not been changed in any way since&nbsp;signing.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>Signing with DIDsign requires a Sporran wallet (<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/How-to-Set-Up-Sporran_22-Nov.pdf">setup instructions here</a>) and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">an on-chain&nbsp;DID</a>.</p><p>Once you have set these up, you can use this step-by-step <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/DIDsign_How-to_guide_17March.pdf">guide</a> to sign your files, or follow the walkthrough below:</p><p>Step 1: Go to <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign,io</a>.</p><p>Step 2: Drag and drop the files you want to sign into the dropzone, or add them from your&nbsp;device.</p><p>Step 3: Click the blue “SIGN” button below the&nbsp;files.</p><p>This triggers a Sporran&nbsp;pop-up.</p><p>Step 4: Enter your password in the Sporran to sign the files. (Please note, if you accidentally close Sporran during this process, click “DISMISS” on the “Signature needed” pop-up to restart.)</p><p>Step 5: Save the signed files with the signature file in one zip file that can be easily sent via email&nbsp;etc.</p><p>That’s it!</p><p>The recipient then goes to the “VERIFY” section on the <a href="https://didsign.io/">DIDsign website</a> and adds the zip&nbsp;file.</p><p>DIDsign now verifies that the signature matches the file contents and the on-chain DID on the KILT blockchain. If the file was not changed and the DID matches the signature, then a green checkmark is displayed:</p><p>If files have been altered, the verification fails and DIDsign shows an orange exclamation mark:</p><p>The signer should share their DID with the recipient so that they can make sure the files come from the right&nbsp;person:</p><p>DIDsign also integrates verification of credentials issued by trusted entities such as <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC</a>, adding extra layers of security to the signed files. SocialKYC is an attestation service built on KILT that confirms ownership of your accounts (email, Twitter, Discord, GitHub) after you prove that you control&nbsp;them.</p><p>If users choose to make some of these credentials public, by exposing them via service endpoints of their DID, recipients will have more evidence about who signed the file than in Web2 solutions.</p><p>Future versions of DIDsign will also include the ability&nbsp;to:</p>  Include KILT credentials directly in a signed&nbsp;file  Add a unique name to your&nbsp;DID  Self-attest timestamps anchored on the KILT blockchain at the time of&nbsp;signing.  <p>Keep up-to-date with these new developments by following the KILT <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a>, or join the conversation on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a>.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials.

<p>Hoe om te gaan met persoonlijke data is een van de belangrijkste kwesties van onze tijd. Te vaak haalt dit onderwerp de krantenkoppen om de verkeerde redenen. Het publiek wil gewoon dat bedrijven die zich bezig houden met persoonlijke data ethisch, open en transparant zijn over hun activiteiten.</p>



<p>Daarom zijn we enorm trots dat we in 2022 opnieuw de titel MyData Operator Award mogen dragen!</p>



<p>Maar wat houdt dit in? Kortgezegd krijgt een organisatie de MyData Operator Award wanneer zij individuen in staat stellen toegang te krijgen tot hun persoonlijke gegevens, deze te beheren &amp; opnieuw te gebruiken op een mensgerichte manier, en voldoet zij aan de gouden standaard voor het beheer van persoonlijke gegevens.</p>



<p>Dit betekent dus dat wij erkend worden om onze ethische benadering van persoonlijke gegevens en dat individuen hier zelf de controle op hebben.</p>

<p>This is a technical article about another of Anonyome Labs’ contributions to&nbsp;supporting the ongoing development of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;–&nbsp;the future of privacy and identity management on the internet.</p>



<p>Quick read: Through extensive research, we have discovered that using an air-gapped and security-tightening wallet is the optimal approach to safely storing $CHEQ tokens from our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/02/anonyome-labs-joins-the-cheqd-mainnet/">cheqd mainnet validator node</a>. This solution is known as a cold wallet because it’s a cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet, which makes it difficult to remotely steal the assets stored in it. As the cryptocurrency space continues to develop and gain traction, the importance of securing tokens is becoming more apparent. Cryptocurrencies are very desirable to criminals and we’re seeing more hacks<a href="https://www.hedgewithcrypto.com/cryptocurrency-exchange-hacks/">&nbsp;happening to various exchanges</a>. With Anonyome Labs continuing to develop and participate in the SSI space through the cheqd network, putting privacy and security first helps set the pathway for the future. This cold wallet concept is an important step along the path.</p>



<p>Long read: Since&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/02/anonyome-labs-joins-the-cheqd-mainnet/">Anonyome Labs joined the cheqd mainnet</a>, our&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">validator</a>&nbsp;has been actively participating in the network and earning $CHEQ tokens. The validator earns a commission on the staked tokens from other parties’ delegations as well on those that are self-delegated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tokens and cryptocurrencies in general continue to attract criminals who exploit vulnerabilities in these newly developed technologies. As a result, the decentralized finance and decentralized identity communities face&nbsp;<a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/lcx-loses-usd-8m-hot-wallet-hack.htm">hot wallet hacks</a>&nbsp;and the resulting theft of personal or company assets. To combat potential theft or loss of tokens, Anonyome Labs researched and implemented a cold wallet storage solution for its $CHEQ tokens which addresses the risks in running a validator node.</p>



 About cheqd and $CHEQ 



<p></p>



<p>Since its launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>&nbsp;has provided a utility token ($CHEQ) that will allow future issuers, receivers, holders and node operators to pay each other privately and securely for digital credentials. A suite of mobile and backend tools will allow developers like Anonyome Labs to use cheqd decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for SSI applications. While the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method">cheqd DID method is still being implemented,</a>&nbsp;node operators can already contribute by hosting nodes to participate in the network. As we said, the cheqd network is maintained by node operators that earn tokens through commissions via participant delegations. The so-called “nodes” run the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/">cheqd-noded</a> software, which is the server portion of the cheqd network stack built using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk">Cosmos SDK</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint">Tendermint</a>. Nodes actively participate in the network by validating transactions, signing and writing new blocks to the public ledger, using computer resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 Risks involved with running a validator node 



<p></p>



<p>Operating a node on the cheqd mainnet requires tokens to initiate governance proposals and to pay for transactions. But not all the tokens that the validator earns need to remain in their wallet and could be kept on another wallet less prone to vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The validator’s wallet is potentially vulnerable to attack in two ways:&nbsp;</p>



  Tokens can be sent from the validator’s wallet to any other $CHEQD wallet via the cheqd-noded command line interface (CLI). The CLI transaction command is protected by a keyring passphrase which is created during the setup phase. In the circumstance where access to the validator and keyring passphrase are compromised, all tokens stored on the validator could be transferred to any other wallet. Such an attack would require a weak passphrase in order to be brute-forced.<br>  If all tokens are stored on the validator and the recovery phrase (mnemonic) were to be lost, the tokens would not be recoverable if anything were to occur to the validator. For example, in the event of a corrupt or deleted node with no backups, without the mnemonic the tokens would be lost forever.  



<p>The solution to address these risks for Anonyome Labs is to successfully implement a cold wallet to store the majority of tokens it earns and owns.&nbsp;</p>



 What are cold wallets? 



<p></p>



<p>Cold wallets are devices that generate and store private keys used by cryptocurrency wallets while remaining&nbsp;offline. Being offline is an advantage because the private keys are never shared without authorization. The term “air gap” in this context describes the process of physically separating access to assets from a security perspective.</p>



 How does a cold wallet address security risks? 



<p></p>



<p>Using a secondary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledger.com/academy/security/the-secure-element-whistanding-security-attacks">security-hardened</a>&nbsp;wallet allows for tokens to be securely backed up. Any tokens that the validator isn’t using to perform transactions can be sent to the hardware cold wallet address. Once there, the tokens are air gapped and not accessible without authorization from the cold wallet device. The fact that a cold wallet is a physical medium ensures the assets stored on it are truly in the owner’s hands.</p>



 Which options are available for $CHEQ? 



<p></p>



 Ledger Nano Hardware Wallet 



<p></p>



<p>While the Ledger Nano natively supports the Cosmos Interchain it doesn’t support $CHEQD natively and must be configured via an interchain wallet such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.keplr.app/">Keplr</a>,&nbsp;which provides an interface to pass cheqd transactions to the Ledger Nano. This configuration alone doesn’t provide an interface to perform decentralized governance tasks, so Keplr needs to be connected via Omniflix.</p>



<p><a href="https://cheqd.omniflix.co/">Omniflix</a>&nbsp;is a dashboard used for staking, delegation and governance on the cheqd network. It connects with the&nbsp;<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap">Keplr Chrome Extension</a>&nbsp;through the extension’s&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.keplr.app/api/">API</a>,&nbsp;which authorizes any transaction through the Ledger Nano linked to the account. The Ledger Nano acts as the security-hardening component of the cheqd wallet since it must be unlocked with a 4-8 digit PIN code and be physically present when interoperating. This means that no tokens can be taken from the wallet unless the ledger owner authorizes it.&nbsp;</p>



 Ledger Live 



<p></p>



<p>The Ledger Nano devices use Ledger Live to install individual cryptocurrency “apps” onto the device. While Cosmos is supported as an app, there is no direct support for cheqd within Ledger Live. As a result, Ledger Live is not suited as a wallet to store, stake or delegate $CHEQD tokens and is only used to install the Cosmos app. The Ledger Cosmos app, when connected and unlocked within Keplr, allows the wallet to communicate to the cheqd network. Ledger Live also acts as a further management console for the Ledger hardware wallet to change preferences, settings and perform important firmware updates.</p>



 AirGap vault and wallet 



<p></p>



<p>AirGap vault is a novel approach to storing wallet private keys offline. It’s novel in the sense that no specific hardware is required, only an app on any iOS or Android device. Once the app is installed, the device can be put on airplane mode to remain completely offline. While AirGap supports Cosmos and staking of tokens, it doesn’t yet support $CHEQ tokens.</p>



 Our decision and implementation 



<p></p>



<p>Due to the limited adoption and support for $CHEQ tokens among wallet providers, the best option to date for securing assets is on a Ledger Nano device that interfaces through Keplr and Omniflix.</p>



<p>To summarize, this lets us:</p>



  back up excess tokens on a separate air-gapped wallet  stake air-gapped wallet tokens to the Anonyome Labs’ validator and claim the rewards  transfer tokens from the air-gapped wallet to the validator if it requires more tokens to process transactions.  



<p>Anonyome Labs has employed a multi-stage approach to transferring tokens off the validator, which requires:&nbsp;</p>



  biometric authentication  two-factor authentication (2FA) command line access  air-gapped cold wallet authorization  password manager access to strong passwords.&nbsp;  



<p>This process is audited and separates roles and duties, with need-to-know principles limiting the access to company assets both internally and externally. The process for backing up tokens from the validator’s address is outlined next.&nbsp;</p>

  <a href="https://www.ledger.com/">Ledger Nano (S/X) device</a>  <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013349800-Update-Ledger-Nano-X-firmware?docs=true">up-to-date firmware</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;    <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411149814417-Set-up-and-use-Keplr-to-access-your-Ledger-Cosmos-ATOM-account?docs=true">Cosmos app installed</a>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live/download">Ledger Live</a>    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap">Keplr Chrome extension</a>&nbsp;with Ledger Nano (S/X) imported  Keplr connected to the&nbsp;<a href="https://cheqd.omniflix.co/">cheqd Omniflix dashboard</a>.  



<p></p>







  An authorized user uses biometric authentication to sign into their device and open their 2FA app.  The user logs into Validator EC2 Instance using the correct certificate file and 2-factor authentication code.  The user accesses the cheqd node CLI to send unused tokens to the Ledger hardware wallet address.  Keplr asks for the Ledger Nano to be connected and unlocked with the on-device pin and to open the Cosmos app.  Keplr Chrome extension is unlocked using the password stored in a password manager protected by another password or biometric.&nbsp;  The user is authorized to send, receive, delegate, stake and claim $CHEQ tokens. The ledger must remain connected and unlocked during any of these actions.  



 Conclusion 



<p></p>



<p>Through extensive research, Anonyome Labs has discovered that using an air-gapped and security-tightening wallet is the optimal approach to safely storing $CHEQ tokens from our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/02/anonyome-labs-joins-the-cheqd-mainnet/">cheqd mainnet validator node</a>. As the cryptocurrency space continues to develop and gain traction, the importance of securing tokens is becoming more apparent, to mitigate the risks from malicious actors. With Anonyome Labs continuing to develop and participate in the SSI space through the cheqd network, putting privacy and security first helps set the pathway for the future.</p>



 Key terms to know 



<p></p>



<p>Validator – a node responsible for verifying transactions on a blockchain. Once transactions are verified, they’re added to the public distributed ledger</p>



<p>Node – a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. It acts as a relay point which keeps a copy of the ledger and verifies its validity</p>



<p>Ledger – a public record of transactions that is replicated and distributed across the participating network to its peers (other nodes on the network)</p>



<p>Staking – the process of depositing cryptocurrency into a smart contract on a network to receive tokens as a reward. This is considered similar to an interest-bearing savings account</p>



<p>Delegation – the process of picking validators to stake tokens in. Holders vest their tokens in validators they trust to process transactions and earn rewards</p>



<p>Keyring passphrase – the password that restricts access to the cheqd-noded command line interface</p>



<p>DID – a type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. This can refer to any subject, person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity etc.</p>



<p>Verifiable credential – an open standard for digital credentials. Verifiable credentials represent statements made by an issuer in a tamper-evident and privacy-respecting manner.</p>



<p>Hot wallet – a cryptocurrency wallet that is always connected to the internet and cryptocurrency network</p>



<p>Cold wallet – a cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet, making it difficult to remotely steal the assets stored in it</p>



<p>Air gap – a metaphorical description of the conceptual gap required by the physical separation between computers</p>



<p>Inter-chain – the way all blockchains and traditional systems can connect in a secure manner</p>

<p>Mydex CIC has been awarded ‘MyData Operator’ status by <a href="https://mydata.org/">MyData Global</a>, an international non-profit organisation whose purpose is to “empower people by improving their right to self-determination regarding their personal&nbsp;data”.</p><p>The award symbolises best practice that reassures individuals, governments, investors, and other companies and organisations alike.</p><p>MyData Global says the Awards reflect the rising demand for a more ethical and human-centric approach to personal&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“The Award process gives companies and organisations the opportunity to transparently communicate their business practices and service offering, raising trust in their operations. Further, companies must clarify how they ensure that individuals remain primary beneficiaries of their services.”</blockquote><p>Its press release adds: “As promoted by the European Commission, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6428">putting people in the centre of digital transformations is needed for a safe and sustainable digital future</a>. Further, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6428">boosting data sharing and ensuring its trustworthiness</a> is critical to reaping the benefits of our digitised lives. Organisations awarded with the MyData Operator Award are vital enablers for such a vision, providing value for companies and individuals alike.”</p> A long way to&nbsp;go <p>Mydex CEO David Alexander commented on this Award&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“This month Mydex celebrates its 15th birthday. We are particularly proud to receive this Award because its existence and content reflects and develops many of the principles that we pioneered in the ten years before MyData Global was&nbsp;formed.</blockquote><blockquote>“But for many reasons, winning such Awards is just a first small step. The MyData movement currently faces three big challenges.</blockquote><blockquote>“First, it needs to achieve impact at scale — to embed citizen data empowerment into the everyday lives of people and organisations, to become the ‘new business as usual’. Mydex may be further down this road than most, given our longer history and the maturity of our live, operational platform (for example, the fact that we have had independently awarded accreditation under ISO 27001 for Information Security and Management for nine years running). But this is a long journey and we are still only at the beginning.</blockquote><blockquote>“Second, as the movement grows we need to achieve full interoperability between MyData Operators. People should be able to move their data where they want to, and it would be a tragedy if a movement devoted to empowering citizens ends up imprisoning them in new data&nbsp;silos.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Third, founders come first. Then profiteers. We need to develop strong, robust and resilient ways of ensuring mission sustainability so that over time, initiatives and organisations claiming to promote citizen empowerment are not subverted or overtaken by forces more interested in data monetisation and profiteering.”</blockquote><p>Mydex was one of the first organisations to sign the MyData Declaration, when MyData Global was first established in 2018. So far, 41 companies and organisations have been given MyData Operator Award status, reflecting the growing movement for ways to empower citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>To achieve the Award, organisations have to answer multiple detailed questions about how its services work, what technologies they use, how it is governed, what role the organisation plays in the data ecosystem, its business model, how its services are actually being used, how individuals and others benefit from them, along with detailed questions about identity management, permissions management, data models, interoperability provisions, and use of data standards.</p><p>You can see what Mydex’s application says&nbsp;<a href="https://apply.mydata.org/gallery/mPLRwJzJ/rbvoWgRr?search=66b23b0744e87aa6-20">here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/mydata-operator-status-awarded-to-mydex-2916d1c48c3d">MyData Operator Status awarded to Mydex</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Humpty shared the progress Ontology is making with Binance users, answered various questions about Ontology EVM, and also airdropped $10,000 of&nbsp;ONT.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1499467144853024768?s=20&amp;t=l7Q0LHRzoxnxYuGd6NOJTw">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “$10 million EVM Fund”. The fund is divided into three categories: first, to provide financial support for developers to deploy/build applications; second, to provide bounties for maintaining Ontology network security; third, to organize hackathons for more developers.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He shared “How Women Empower Blockchain”: If women want to gain a safer and fairer position in the blockchain industry, they need to use DID to break the traditional identity framework and get the help of more resources.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News <p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was invited to be a guest at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0LUNqBTx40">DEFIYIELD</a>, a popular YouTube channel, and shared the details of Ontology EVM and the $10 million EVM Fund, as well as “How to PROFIT from your IDENTITY?” which users are most concerned about.</p> Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Crypto Mode — “<a href="https://cryptomode.com/3-reasons-why-ontology-becoming-evm-compatible-is-a-big-deal/">3 Reasons Why Ontology Becoming EVM-Compatible Is A Big&nbsp;Deal</a>”</p><p>“There are many good reasons for blockchains to achieve compatibility with <a href="https://cryptomode.com/swing-and-neon-evm-partner-to-enable-cross-chain-liquidity/">EVM</a>. One big reason is the overall interoperability improvements such a development provides. In addition, a seamless connection between EVM-capable ecosystems unlocks a broader user base and more liquidity and allows for the development of more complex products, services, and solutions.”</p><p>Since its inception, Ontology has always been deeply engaged in decentralized digital identity technology, and hopes to provide more mature DID and data solutions in the wider Web3 field. Therefore, Ontology has recently integrated EVM to provide financial, technical and platform support for the majority of Ethereum developers, helping them to quickly build applications and achieve breakthrough innovations.</p> Read this month’s report in your preferred language:   <a href="https://medium.com/p/da902d4caad1/edit">中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/1abcd456fab/edit">繁體中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/858c615944af/edit">日本語</a>  한국어(coming soon)  <a href="https://medium.com/p/406eba680a09/edit">Española</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/a9338aeb7551/edit">Français</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/d5f6148a30bc/edit">Slovenčina</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/b4a055b0b9a8/edit">Tiếng Việt</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/1760cb8e964/edit">Hindi</a>  русский(coming soon)  <a href="https://medium.com/p/d11d73d05940/edit">Tagalog</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/cf12d0241230/edit">සිංහල</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/cb2bddea7186/edit">Türk</a>  Italiano(coming soon)  <a href="https://theontologyteam.medium.com/ontology-monthly-report-february-2022-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE-40b0945c013e">বাংলা</a>  <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			<p>After launching the <a href="https://infocert.digital/infocert-continues-its-growth-at-international-level-from-today-available-the-new-romanian-website/">Romanian language portal</a> last June, InfoCert announces the release of two more portals dedicated to two important European geographies. Countries already served by InfoCert through its local sales force but also through the ever-growing partnerships for the resale of services and products.</p>
<p>For some years InfoCert has started a commercial presence in Poland and Hungary for the development of the local market, considered two extremely important countries for the development of new business opportunities related to digitalization. The decision is part of InfoCert’s wider strategic plan for international expansion and, in particular, in Eastern Europe where the company is already active in countries such as Slovenia, Croatia and Romania.</p>
<p>Today, in line with this strategy, we are pleased to announce the publication on our website infocert.digital of a section tailor made to the Polish market and one to the Hungarian market, navigable at these links:</p>
 
 <a href="https://infocert.digital/hu/home/">https://infocert.digital/hu/home/</a> 
 <a href="https://infocert.digital/pl/home/">https://infocert.digital/pl/home/</a> 
 
<p>The digital market of both countries is characterized by a strong dynamism and rapid growth in technological innovation and use of Trusted Services, making both countries key drivers in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Through the contact form it is also available, also for Polish and Hungarian companies, the registration to the InfoCert Partner Program, which offers important advantages to those who want to integrate InfoCert solutions with their services or release them to their customers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Hyperautomation has the potential to disrupt and accelerate business all over the world. It is necessary to be prepared. 
<p>There is automation, and there is hyperautomation. Buckle up!</p>
<p>Before we get to hyperautomation, we should start with automation within the enterprise in the context of business process automation. Or as it is often called, <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80333/robotic-process-automation/">robotic process automation</a> (RPA). First of all, RPA is a software solution to automate repetitive tasks in the organization like calculations, record-keeping, making reports, filling forms, and much more. RPA typically handles digital data that must be worked on or transformed in some way. If a human employee must click, drag-n-drop, copy and paste, etc. with mind-numbing repetition, that is a great indicator of if a task could be automated with RPA.</p>
 What is Hyperautomation? 
<p>RPA is a software “robot” that imitates the actions of a human users – keystrokes, mouse movements, and applications used. Once automated, these tasks take place in the background while the human employee is doing other tasks, working in parallel. An important observation to make here is that RPA “robots” do not know what they are doing; they are programmed to mimic the actions of a human user click for click. There is no flexibility for non-typical cases.</p>
<p>Hyperautomation integrates <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/artificial-intelligence">AI/ML</a> in order to automate enterprise automation. In a nutshell – automate the automation. This can achieve enterprise-level scalability for automation that uses methodical processes to identify processes and tasks that could be automated, as well as increasing the capabilities and flexibility of the automation “bots” that carry out those tasks.</p>
 The underlying technologies 
<p>Hyperautomation is a concept, not a single technology. Take a look under the hood at the tech making it work.</p>
<p><a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/Ultimate-guide-to-RPA-robotic-process-automation">RPA</a> is a foundational part of hyperautomation since it delivered a lot of the groundwork for business process automation. It made great progress into no and low code development options and many useful integrations. These capabilities are carried over into hyperautomation for better usability for business users.</p>
<p>But of course hyperautomation doesn’t just automate the tasks, but it automates the process of automating tasks. This requires discovering processes and tasks that could be automated with what is called <a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/6-ways-AI-and-automation-could-improve-process-mining">process and task mining</a>. This uses data from an event log to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_mining">identify and assess processes</a> from the backend.</p>
<p>But most notable of all is the incorporation of AI/ML for more dynamic automation, using natural language processing (NLP) to better handle unstructured data, machine learning models for computer vision, continuous learning and improvement, and much more.</p>
 Hyperautomation synergy with future technologies (machine learning, AI) 
<p>Automation and AI/ML are a great match. Here is why:</p>
<p>AI/ML thrives on data-rich tasks that are repetitive because at its core it is a mathematical model that ingests data and returns a prediction based on its previous training. It requires extensive training on tasks that are all similar to each other, and after the model is trained is only suitable to continue tackling tasks like those it handled in training.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>A strong AI use case leverages the availability of historical data, real-time data, and the ability to fulfil a repetitive task. – <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80266/emerging-technologies-fostering-digital-business-innovation-healthcare/">Advisory Note: Emerging Technologies Fostering Digital Business Innovation</a></p>
</blockquote>
 
<p>A more existential quality of AI/ML is its ability to disrupt business as usual. Concepts of autonomous vehicles&nbsp;will change the landscape of cities as well as the logistics industry with uncalculatable legal implications, AI is a tool that will escalate the cybersecurity conflict&nbsp;between defenders and attackers, and its contribution to digital identities will change how humans interact online and in the real world. Hyperautomation (with the help of AI/ML) is changing the approach to enterprise process automation by removing active human participation more and more. The human is shifting into an oversight position while the day-to-day tasks of running the business are handled automatically which will change the work landscape in years to come.</p>
 Curse and blessing of Hyperautomation 
<p>Hyperautomation is a disruptive concept. And like any disruption, it can help and it can harm.</p>
<p>Efficiency and reducing repetitive work for human employees should be a familiar theme when considering AI/ML, and it is definitely the case here with hyperautomation. Overall, it is relieving the workload of human employees that manage time-consuming tasks. With the implementation of hyperautomation, many tasks are removed from human employee’s workloads to free up their time for more demanding and creative work.</p>
<p>But it is also very likely that many human roles in the organization will be made redundant, causing <a href="https://www.itproportal.com/features/how-will-automation-change-the-human-workplace/">job loss</a> for many individuals. And since hyperautomation is likely to see widespread adoption across most industries, human employees with similar skills will be eliminated from their roles across all industries and making it unlikely that they will be rehired elsewhere without significant upskilling. Implementing hyperautomation comes with a responsibility to train employees for other types of work, or to offer compensation for upskilling when they are let go.</p>
<p>Security must also be integrated into hyperautomation initiatives. Connected data and systems provides a larger threat surface and potentially more damaging data breaches if the organization is attacked. <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/11/what-hyperautomation-means-for-identity-and-data-governance/">Data governance</a> that is adapted for automated tasks must be in place, especially for sensitive data that may be part of the automated process. Appropriate access management for both humans and bots must be in place, along with constant monitoring for vulnerabilities.</p>
 Hyperautomation practices taking over business 
<p>Hyperautomation isn’t about automating exact tasks, but about reshaping the way the organization approaches tasks. Here are some common use cases:</p>
<p>Goal-oriented hyperautomation: The organization may define a goal to improve a particular KPI, like time needed to process invoices. Although the task may belong to a particular department, it could pull data from different departmental siloes, require communication between different team members, or an approval from a manager. Begin with a key metric to determine were to focus your hyperautomation initiative. Examples include focusing on accounts payable, ordering, document processing, customer service, and much more.</p>
 Vendor map: Guidance for you 
<p>This is a dynamic vendor space with many new entrants. Here are a few vendors to get you started:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a>, <a href="https://www.automationanywhere.com/">Automation Anywhere</a>,<a href="https://www.blueprism.com/?selected-locale=%E2%9C%93"> Blue Prism</a>, <a href="https://www.celonis.com/company">Celonis</a>, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/26/microsoft-tackles-hyperautomation-with-power-automate-rpa-update/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.kryonsystems.com/">Kryon</a>, <a href="https://www.workfusion.com/business-automation/">WorkFusion</a>, <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/">ABBYY</a>, <a href="https://www.pega.com/hyperautomation">Pegasystems</a>, and many more.</p>
 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p>Think carefully about how you approach hyperautomation. It has great potential to serve your organization if managed in a strategic and intentional way.</p>
<p>Hyperautomation is a tool for the digitally transformed organization. Organizations that are successfully operating digitally have critically examined and adapted their business and operating model to fit the changing world and its expectations for user experience, sustainability, ubiquitous connection, and global scalability. Digital transformation does not follow a single recipe, but is unique to each organization, its mission, and its existing and future <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/guest/creating-an-innovative-identity-fabric-structure">IT architecture</a>. Hyperautomation better serves the digitally transformed organization by benefiting from connected cross-organizational data, well-architected security and identity management systems and clear business goals that automation helps to achieve.</p>
<p>Be critical of implementing a hyperautomation initiative. Question how it fits with your organization’s digital transformation plan. Does widespread automation of internal processes really help accomplish your business goals, or is it just a cost-cutting measure? Account for the human cost on your organization, including the changing demographics of consumers as more and more are made redundant and will make different buying choices as a result. And build accountability into the individual tasks being automated, with visibility into why a task was handled the way it was. In light of the massive scalability that hyperautomation brings, the individual should not be lost.</p>

<p>Roma, 16 marzo 2022. Un importante passo verso la semplificazione degli adempimenti fiscali che le aziende devono compiere per gestire il proprio business all’estero è stato compiuto, questo grazie alla partnership siglata da InfoCert (Tinexta Group) ed EDICOM, importante provider di servizi di eBusiness; l’accordo prevede lo sviluppo e la commercializzazione di LegalInvoice OpenHUB, un nuovo servizio di fatturazione elettronica internazionale.</p>



<p>LegalInvoice OpenHUB agevolerà i clienti enterprise nella fatturazione elettronica in un sempre maggior numero di nazioni, rendendo trasparente la conversione nei diversi formati previsti dai sistemi di fatturazione locali; sempre più Paesi, infatti, si apprestano a rendere obbligatori i processi di fatturazione elettronica in ambito B2G e/o B2B, grazie a LegalInvoice OpenHUB i clienti enterprise saranno pronti a rispettare gli obblighi legislativi per i flussi di fatturazione elettronica internazionale.</p>



<p>L’invio e la ricezione dei documenti elettronici potranno avvenire senza la necessità di integrare, nel processo di e-invoicing, tool specifici per l’adeguamento delle fatture ai singoli formati locali: le fatture generate utilizzando il canale LegalInvoice già attivato saranno poi convertite nel formato richiesto e trasferite al sistema di interscambio/Hub del Paese di destinazione grazie all’integrazione con la Global eInvoicing Platform di EDICOM.</p>



<p>InfoCert ed EDICOM – entrambi service provider accreditati per la fatturazione elettronica in Italia – hanno contribuito allo sviluppo di LegalInvoice OpenHUB con le rispettive e consolidate esperienze internazionali nel campo dei servizi digitali e, in particolare, proprio della fatturazione elettronica.</p>

<p>LegalInvoice OpenHUB consente l’interoperabilità tra sistemi di Paesi diversi e supporta la crescita internazionale delle imprese.</p>



<p>Roma-Milano, 16 marzo 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, ed EDICOM, provider internazionale di servizi di eBusiness, annunciano di aver siglato una partnership per lo sviluppo e la commercializzazione di LegalInvoice OpenHUB, un nuovo servizio di fatturazione elettronica internazionale.</p>



<p><a>LegalInvoice</a> OpenHUB agevolerà i clienti enterprise nella fatturazione elettronica in un sempre maggior numero di nazioni, rendendo trasparente la conversione nei diversi formati previsti dai sistemi di fatturazione locali.</p>



<p>Nel corso del 2022 infatti, nuovi Paesi – fra cui per esempio Portogallo, Polonia, Panama e Paraguay – introdurranno l’obbligatorietà dei processi di fatturazione elettronica in ambito B2G e/o B2B e LegalInvoice OpenHUB permetterà ai clienti enterprise di essere pronti a rispettare gli obblighi legislativi per i flussi di fatturazione elettronica internazionale.</p>



<p>L’invio e la ricezione dei documenti elettronici potranno avvenire senza la necessità di integrare, nel processo di e-invoicing, tool specifici per l’adeguamento delle fatture ai singoli formati locali: le fatture generate utilizzando il canale LegalInvoice già attivato saranno poi convertite nel formato richiesto e trasferite al sistema di interscambio/Hub del Paese di destinazione grazie all’integrazione con la Global eInvoicing Platform di EDICOM.</p>



<p>InfoCert ed EDICOM – entrambe service provider accreditati per la fatturazione elettronica in Italia – hanno contribuito allo sviluppo di LegalInvoice OpenHUB con le rispettive e consolidate esperienze internazionali nel campo dei servizi digitali e, in particolare, proprio della fatturazione elettronica.</p>



<p>InfoCert, insieme ad AgID e all’Agenzia delle Entrate, è stata infatti key technological partner in ben tre progetti Europei – eIGOR, EeISI, SCALES – tutti propedeutici all’attuazione della direttiva EU 2014/55 sulla fatturazione elettronica conforme allo standard Europeo EN 16931-1.</p>



<p>“Siamo molto soddisfatti dell’accordo con EDICOM, che, ne siamo convinti, aggiungerà valore alla nostra offerta e ci permetterà di essere ancora più vicini ai nostri clienti nel loro percorso di crescita e trasformazione digitale”, commenta Daniele Citterio di InfoCert-Tinexta Group. “Il business internazionale è sempre di più una chiave di crescita strategica per le imprese, che hanno quindi bisogno di soluzioni uniche, semplici e veloci che permettano di agevolare gli scambi con altri Paesi”.</p>



<p>EDICOM, dal canto suo, non solo ha sviluppato un’offerta di servizi eBusiness specifica per il mercato internazionale (Global e-Invoicing Platform), ma ha anche partecipato al progetto Europeo GOVEIN19 per l’implementazione del formato fattura Europeo in ambito sanitario.</p>



<p>“Questo accordo è il frutto di una grande sinergia tra le due società che permetterà alle aziende con presenza internazionale di godere di una soluzione tecnologica robusta e compliant con la normativa di più di 70 paesi” afferma Luis Molina Apestegui, Sales Manager di EDICOM in Italia.</p>

				  Interoperability hackathons showcase the benefits of open source and community and drive scale  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The growth in open source software has been driven by a simple, powerful value proposition: more means more. The more people use an open source solution, the better the solution becomes through stress testing and innovation; the better it becomes, the more it will scale because more people will want to use it.</p>
<p>This can happen organically—or it can happen through a community pushing itself to adopt, adapt, and scale. This was the idea behind the first Cardea Interop-a-thon. </p>
<p>Cardea is a complete open-source codebase for creating, sharing, and verifying digital health credentials with a focus on COVID-19 testing and vaccination; it was developed by Indicio and SITA and donated to Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH), where its continued development is overseen by a community of companies and interested parties, including Indicio and SITA. </p>
<p>As the concept of verifiable digital credentials requires interoperability to scale, we decided that the best way to drive interoperability was to set up a reference implementation of Cardea and invite other companies using Hyperledger Aries-based solutions to test against it and each other. </p>
<p>It was a success. The six companies that participated in the virtual event all achieved their goals. It wasn’t painless—and that was the point. Glitches, bugs, and unknown obstacles were all uncovered by the concerted focus on testing against each other. The result is that everyone&nbsp; emerged with better products.</p>
<p>The reaction was, “we need more of this!” And so, this week, on March 17, we will host our second Cardea Interop-a-thon. We’ll have the standard reference implementation to test against, but we’ll also have two new and important features: out-of-band invitations and machine readable governance.</p>
<p>Out-of-band (OOB) invitations use the new out-of-band protocol for creating a connection using an invitation URL or QR code. The first phase is coming to Hyperledger Aries at the end of March (see the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0496-transition-to-oob-and-did-exchange">transition plan</a>) and the community will proceed until the full OOB invitation process is supported as the default connection method (to read more, see the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0434-outofband/README.md">Aries RFC</a>).</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance is a way to implement governance rules at the agent level; it makes the governance authority portable. Why is this important? </p>
<p>First, it means that governance rules can be cached and verification can happen offline. </p>
<p>Second, it means that complex information flows with “if this, then that” logic become simpler to choreograph than if governed by a central trust authority; bonus, they can be kept private too (for more on the benefits of machine-readable governance, see “<a href="https://indicio.tech/where-do-you-put-a-trust-registry-in-a-decentralized-digital-ecosystem-not-where-it-turns-into-a-wrench/">Machine Readable Governance is the Key to Scaling Decentralized Trust</a>.”)</p>
<p>Registration is closed, and we’ve got over twice as many participants for our second Interop-a-thon; but you’re more than welcome to show up and watch! Visit <a href="https://cardea.app/">https://cardea.app</a> for details.</p>

        <p>TAAL’s Norwegian Partner UNISOT Shows How Blockchain Improves<br>
Food Safety and Quality</p>
<p>For UNISOT to grow, it will need predictable costs and a dependable partner to process the number of data transactions it will send to the blockchain. That’s where TAAL comes in. With world-leading 4GB block sizes on the BSV blockchain, TAAL has the data capacity to fulfil UNISOT’s needs. The Scandinavian company recently began speaking with some of the biggest packaging companies in the world and one of the region’s biggest retailers. Transport companies have expressed interest in partnering too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So much about what we are doing is about cost. If we can have an agreement with TAAL to process 10 million transactions per month and if we can get a fixed price for those 10 million transactions, then we can turn to our customers and with confidence say, ‘If you order 1 million transactions from us, we can offer you a fixed price’. In doing so, we are moving away from the fluctuations of the bitcoin price and will have a stable, predictable price that we can work with for the benefit of our customers and their customers. You can’t do professional business without that cost structure in place,”</p>

<p>Attivo was founded in 2011 in the Bay Area. Their initial focus was on the DDP market. DDP is an innovative approach to detecting and preparing for cyberattacks, whereby organizations deploy decoy resources to attract the attention of would-be attackers. This strategy allows organizations to study attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) while protecting their crucial assets, ensuring that the intelligence gathered from the DDP is of the highest quality and most pertinent for each customer. Attivo was a leader in all categories (Overall, Product, Innovation, and Market) in the 2021 edition of the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80340/distributed-deception-platforms-ddps">KuppingerCole Leadership Compass on DDP</a>.</p>
<p>Two of the main decoy components of DDPs such as Attivo’s are traps and lures:</p>
 
 Traps are servers, virtual servers, and/or appliances that host simulated assets. Traps can mimic traditional IT assets such as file and web servers, desktops, and containers, as well as Operational Technology (OT) assets such as Industrial Control System (ICS) servers, sensors, Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI), IoT devices, etc. 
 Lures are objects that are designed to appeal to attackers and get them to interact with the DDP. Lures can include services, files, credentials, x.509 certificates, SSH keys, scripts, ICS devices, etc. 
 
<p>Many OT, IoT, and health care environments do not support standard endpoint security agents, due to incompatibility of operating systems and/or restrictions against adding security software to managed hosts. Solutions such as DDPs and Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) tools can provide visibility that would otherwise be missing from these critical portions of customer environments.</p>
<p>Traps and lures are foundational components of DDPs, but identity deception is essential also because attacks leverage user and admin credentials. Attivo Networks has extended its product portfolio significantly beyond DDP, to also support ITDR. These capabilities are delivered via the Attivo Networks Active Directory Protection Portfolio. The portfolio is comprised of ADAssessor and ADSecure. ADAssessor monitors customer AD to look for ways to reduce the attack surface. &nbsp;ADSecure returns fake privileged credentials as query results and hides real privileged credentials to attackers while alerting customer IT security staff.</p>
<p>SentinelOne’s strategic vision is to provide an integrated security platform to replace multiple types of endpoint and network security tools with a single solution to prevent, detect, analyze, and respond to cyberthreats across all enterprise IT assets, on-premises and in the cloud. SentinelOne has agents for Windows XP to version 11, Windows Server 2008+, MacOS, all Linux flavors, Android, and iOS. SentinelOne’s solutions are powered by Machine Learning and Deep Learning detection models that are capable of providing the highest levels of protection, even for clients that are not constantly connected to their cloud. SentinelOne has participated in a number of KuppingerCole reports, such as the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response#heading5.14">Market Compass on EPDR</a>.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Attivo by SentinelOne will provide additional XDR (eXtended Detection &amp; Response) capabilities for their Singularity Platform. We have identified DDP as an innovative component of XDR platforms. Only a handful of vendors that are purporting to be in the XDR space have DDP within their solution set yet. Moreover, ITDR not yet is a common capability in XDR, but being able to analyze signals from the network and endpoints to the behavior of digital identities provides significantly enhanced insight into threats. This acquisition demonstrates that both DDP and Identity will be essential ingredients in XDR.</p>
<p></p>
<p>KuppingerCole will continue to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">monitor and publish</a> on developments in the XDR and related markets.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Allan Foster thinks the identity and access management industry is an immature industry mostly because it is still thinking in siloes. He will elaborate on this idea in his keynote <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5055">Access Control – The New Frontier</a> on Thursday, May 12, 2022, 9:10 am at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Allan some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 You have been involved in Identity for many years now. Have we solved all the Identity Problems? 
<p>Well, wouldn't that be nice, right? We wouldn't even have to have a conference like this. We've solved everything. Well, yes and no. We have solved a lot of the identity challenges that we've had, right?<br>There's a lot of people over the last years that have done a lot of hard work at this, and we do. We've understood most of the challenges. <br>We understand what we have to do. And in general, we're pretty successful at it. However, I'm sort of going to step back a little bit from that and say there's still some big problems that we've got with it. <br>First of all, it's still siloed. <br>We're buying an identity solution from a vendor and honestly, I'm familiar with all of the different vendors I'm going to pick on ForgeRock and Okta. It's an example. We're buying a solution from them and they are two different solutions. <br>They're are two different silos. And what that ends up is giving us multiplied entities. <br>And I only have to say things like LastPass for every single one of us to roll our eyes, knowing that we've got dozens or hundreds of different identities that we need to keep track of. <br>The reason we have to do that is that we've got these silos. And so when we start talking about have we solved all of the identity problems, I think it's worthwhile for us to stand back and say: Why? Identity is not why we're doing this. Identity is the “How”. Identity is how we do things. <br>The "Why" is actually access control, right? And in that space, we're still a very immature industry. Where we're taking our baby steps. <br>The only reason we need to know who someone is, really is so that we know what they can do. And that's really an access control problem. <br>And so sort of going back to the question, have we solved all of the problems? No. Have we gone a good way into solving many of them? <br>Yeah, we've built some great foundations, but there is still an awful lot to do as we start looking at how do we implement access control. <br>And obviously, I'm going to be talking about that through the different sessions and what we need to look at in access control.</p>
<p></p>
 You have said that we are still quite immature as an industry. Why?  
<p>The immature industry. Well, the good news about being an immature industry is we've got a long way to go to grow, right? The reason I say that we're immature is that we are still working. <br>And I'm going to go back to what I just said about silos. We're still working in the ideas of specific products, and I'm sort of going to use an example that many of us are familiar with. USB, right? USB is if we think about it, it's really just a serial protocol that we can plug into the side of our computer. However, I can use a USB thumb drive, write one of these, and I can plug it into my Mac and it just works. <br>And then I take it and plug it into the PC and it just works and I want to print onto a USB printer and it just works. And the really interesting part about this is that all of those products come from different manufacturers, right?<br>And the really important piece there is the interoperability and the standards so that it works no matter what we want to do with it. We're not there yet with identity. Sure, we've got some great standards like OAuth2, and OpenId Connect and some of the old gray hair devices may remember things like SAML and things like that. We have some great standards to build on. <br>But as we start moving up right, I look at it from the idea of my car knows who I am, and so does my Nest thermostat. But they don't know about each other and there's no way these are just two different universes, and there's so much growth that we can have in that and grow. <br>The challenges of access control, the challenges of me being able to prove my identity no matter what the context that we're dealing with. <br>And really, when I talk about being an immature industry, we talking about web-based access control, we're talking about browsers.<br>There's so much more that there's this whole industry is growing into things like smart cars, smart refrigerators, smart thermostats, my personal favorite smart light bulbs, right?<br> So we have all of these different things that either are skirting around identity or we haven't really been able to integrate them. And I think there's an awful lot of opportunity there. <br>And that's sort of why I say it's immature. We haven't really addressed these issues and we haven't worked out how they interoperate to provide that access control. <br>Right. If I've got a smart door lock, how do I give somebody else access to that door lock without doing it specifically in that door lock? <br>So the good news about being immature is we've got so much more to explore and there's still a lot of growth. So I think that's a really big positive thing.</p>
<p></p>
 I noticed you are talking about Access Control, rather than Identity. Why?  
<p>Because access control is what we're trying to do. Identity is really just a means to an end. Identity is the way that we find out who we're dealing with, right? <br>Access control and the bigger the sort of bigger picture of access control is answering the question of what should this person or what should this identity be allowed to do? <br>What should they be allowed to access? <br>And so let's go back to my example of the smart door lock. It really doesn't matter to the door lock, who the person is on the other side. <br>It's going to open the door and let that person in. What matters to the door lock is the person on the other side allowed to come in to my house. <br>And so really, when we look at that, the who is important because that's how we know whether they're allowed to or not. But allowing them into the house is actually the end goal. <br>And so sort of the drive that I'm trying to go towards is to move away from the thought of simply thinking about identity and, you know, multi-factor and all of these kinds of things that that we've heard over and over and over again. <br>Identity is really just there to prove who we're dealing with and to start thinking about the access control side of things. How are we going to make that smooth, ubiquitous and work across multiple platforms, multiple devices, multiple identity sources? <br>And that's why I'm sort of focusing on the access control side of things. <br>Identity, we've got a pretty good handle as to what we need to do for it.</p>
<p></p>
 What challenges do we still have ahead of us? 
<p>Well, this goes back to the immature industry side of things, right? <br>So in order for us to do this and I'm looking at all of the vendors that we have, and we've got several of them around in the hallways and in the booths and things like that, but as an industry, we need to start thinking less about building the best product out there and more about interoperability. <br>We need to really look at this idea of having siloed products and say that's not really in the best interest of our users, right? We need to have interoperability. <br>We need to be able to work with each other's technology, work with each other's identities, protect each other's resources. <br>And in order to do that, hand-in-hand with interoperability is standards and many of you know, me, I've sort of been a standards geek for years and years and years. <br>Standards is the way that an industry comes together and decides how we're all going to do something so that we can build a viable ecosystem and I think that's the way that we mature our industry is building that interoperable ecosystem so that we can plug IoT devices or smart cars or smart refrigerators, along with all of the other places where we have to deal with identity. <br>Identifying ourselves from a health care perspective, from a financial industry perspective and all of these things and bringing them together so that from the end-user experience. <br>Now I'm sort of focusing a little bit here on the consumer side, but both consumer and in the employee case, the end-user experience should be seamless. <br>They should be able to say, this is who I am now. Let me do what I'm allowed to do. <br>And I think that's really where the challenges are. We need to continue to build that into our operability. <br>We need to start thinking about things like how do we define these access control rules, interoperable policy, interoperable standards, so that agents and security agents can work with each other systems. And I think that's really the exciting part probably of the next decade.</p>
<p></p>
 If you were to focus on one thing to take away from EIC, what would it be? 
<p>Well, to start with, all of the friends and everybody that's there, because it's always great to come together and meet everybody that's working in this industry. <br>I think it's a conference I know from my perspective that I love coming to every year. <br>But if we walk away from it, the, the I'm going to kind of break away from the one thing is to sort of maybe if I put commerce between the two, this all becomes one big thing. <br>There is still a lot of work for us to do in the identity space. We're not done. So there's still a lot of ideas for us to do and we need to keep our eye on why we're doing it. <br>What is the reason that we're doing identity or doing access control and that "Why?" has to do with the consumer. <br>We're trying to make a workable ecosystem for that consumer. <br>And in order to do that, we need to focus on get involved in standard and interoperability. It's not a problem to work with other vendors that are in the same space, right? <br>We've got even this nice word co-op petition. There's it's a big industry. We can all make money in this industry and we need to be able to work together and be interoperable with each other so that we can provide that nice, flawless, seamless experience for the end-user. And that's probably the biggest takeaway for me.<br><br></p>

<p>2022 will be the year of AERGO’s expansion. We are working closely with enterprises to secure numerous, demonstrable use cases. Through the insight gained from working with our clients, we aim to reach a wider audience through building applications that are adaptable and scalable. This led to AERGO embarking on a journey to expand its scope from being a ‘Blockchain for Businesses’ to being the “Blockchain for the world” — the team’s aspiration is for AERGO to become a blockchain platform for all. AERGO will not be bound by just enterprise technology, but an explosion of expansions into multi-dimensional technology that exists today and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>We unveil today our new logo and website to show both our past and the direction where we are headed as we continue to build and&nbsp;evolve.</p> The AERGO&nbsp;galaxy <p>AERGO’s new logo embodies what global blockchain adoption looks like. An abstract wave with two different colors was inspired by our rapidly growing galaxy and wanted to emphasize AERGO’s expanded vision for a bigger ecosystem.</p> Refreshed Website <p>We hope our community members find our website to be informative and efficient. We have updated it so that each participant of our ecosystem can find what is relevant for them — whether you are a developer, enterprise, individual or part of our community.</p> NFT-as-a-service <p>We can define a creator as someone who produces valuable content. This encompasses a wide variety of sectors ranging from the music to sports industries. The growing adoption of blockchain technology has given rise to the concept of the metaverse, and the potential that it brings, opening the doors to an influx of individuals and entities who could leverage this technology. To best capture the opportunities in this space, we decided to launch an NFT-as-a-service for creators. Through NFT-as-a-service, creators can easily create and mint their own NFTs on top of AERGO, showcasing and exchanging their NFTs in various marketplaces. We hope this enablement will further unlock value for creators that makes the creator economy more viable and sustainable for all participants.</p> AERGO AMA&nbsp;#4 <p>The recording of the Mar 2022 AERGO AMA #4 has now been uploaded on YouTube.

<p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are a tamper-proof and machine-verifiable way of sharing your data safely with just the people you want. It is a larger part of a revolutionary identity paradigm called the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> where users have complete control over their data, where it is stored, how it is used, and with whom it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Since these VCs can be used in many <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-life scenarios</a>, it’s important to have different VC types for issuing different credentials. For example, you need a VC with attributes such as date of employment, role, organisation name etc, to generate an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">Employment VC</a> that’ll have credentials about a person’s past or current employment. A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">Driver’s License VC</a>, on the other hand, will have attributes such as name, licence number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>As you can see, each VC has a different set of attributes, and hence, requires a different schema.</p><p>This ability to issue custom VCs greatly enhances your flexibility. However, from an implementation standpoint, it is not easy because you can’t simply create new VCs directly through the&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>Also, there is no simple way to clone and extend existing schemas or make new versions of existing ones. Overall, the creation of a new schema type via the SDK was not a straightforward process.</p><p>This is where Affinidi’s <a href="http://ui.schema.affinidi.com/">Schema Manager</a> comes into&nbsp;play.</p> What is Affinidi’s Schema&nbsp;Manager? <p>Simply put, the Schema Manager is a tool to manage, create, clone, update, and reuse credential types and existing&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>It can come in handy for developers, product managers or engineers who are tasked with building an SSI application and faces a problem of ensuring trust between actors (mainly, Issuers and Verifiers).</p> Why Should You Use Affinidi’s Schema&nbsp;Manager? <p>Below are some compelling reasons to use the Schema&nbsp;Manager.</p>  You have the flexibility to create any VC schema for any situation.  The creation process is simple and straightforward as explained in the next&nbsp;section  The schemas you created are saved, so you can reuse them&nbsp;later.  This tool generates the JSON schema that you can simply copy-paste into your&nbsp;code  You can define the attributes for each schema&nbsp;type  The schema you create can be public or private, depending on your preference. You have the choice to even publish it as a searchable schema so others can reuse&nbsp;them.  You can create the schemas you want through an intuitive and friendly user interface, that in turn, will automatically generate the JSON code for your new&nbsp;schema.  <p>Thus, these are some reasons to use Affinidi’s schema&nbsp;manager.</p><p>Moving on, let’s get into nitty-gritty details and see how you can search through existing schema types, create, review, and even fork new VC schemas using the schema&nbsp;manager.</p> Using the Schema&nbsp;Manager <p>To access the Schema Manager, go to <a href="http://ui.schema.affinidi.com/">http://ui.schema.affinidi.com/</a></p> Explore VC&nbsp;Schemas <p>Schemas that are already created can be found in the Explore&nbsp;tab.</p> Create VC&nbsp;Schemas <p>VC Schema Types can be created in the Create tab with the following steps.</p><p>Create New&nbsp;Schema</p><p>Credential schema type needs to be filled with the name of type with no space and&nbsp;number.</p><p>Version and Revision will be automatically 1 and 0 respectively when the schema type when creating from&nbsp;scratch.</p><p>Detailed information about specific schema type can be put in the Description field.</p><p>Searchable Schema is a public Schema, that means, it appears in the Schema Index page. When the “Publish as searchable schema” option is selected, the schema type will appear in the Schema Index Page for everyone to find it. If it is not selected, it doesn’t appear in the Schema Index Page but can still be accessible by&nbsp;URL.</p><p>The JSON Schema section will be generated based on the inputs you give during the creation&nbsp;process.</p><p>Define Attributes</p><p>Attributes will be added to the VC schema type in the Define Attributes section</p><p>The CredentialID, IssueanceDate and IssuerID attributes are only readable and required for all the&nbsp;types.</p><p>Any other attributes which are needed for VC Schema Type can be added as the following data types; DID, URI, Text, Date, DateTime, Number,&nbsp;Boolean.</p><p>Review Schema</p><p>The newly-created Schema Type needs to be reviewed before it is published. After checking the schema fields, if anything is missing or incorrect, go back to make the changes. If everything looks good, it can be published.</p><p>Publish</p><p>We can see a success message in the Publish section after the schema type is published and ready to&nbsp;use.</p><p>The newly-created schema type can be checked by clicking the View&nbsp;button.</p><p>With the Formatted View, schema type can be reviewed as human readable form or can be switched to JSON Schema or JSON-LD&nbsp;Context.</p><p>Schema URLs can be shared using the Issue VC with schema button. The JSON Schema or JSON-LD Context format’s URLs can be found&nbsp;here.</p><p>Selection of Json Schema&nbsp;View</p><p>Selection of JSON-LD Context&nbsp;View</p><p>Fork VC&nbsp;Schemas</p><p>Forking VC Schema can be useful when you want to edit an existing schema type or if you want to use a schema type as a template to create a new VC type on top of&nbsp;that.</p><p>Forking creates a new schema. If the schema name already exists, revision number increases incrementally and if the schema type name is different, a new one will be created on top of the existing&nbsp;schema.</p><p>There can be no more than 999 revisions of one version, and all versions and revisions must be sequential.</p><p>This process applies to the Create section as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Thus, this is how you can navigate through this app to create custom VC&nbsp;schemas.</p> Final Words <p>In all, Affinidi’s schema manager offers the flexibility to create new VC schemas, reuse existing ones, and explore how best these VCs can fit in with your business goals. Since it also generates the JSON code, all that you have to do is copy-paste it to your application!</p><p>Creating custom VCs doesn’t get easier than&nbsp;this!</p> Join our Community today   Get conversations going with #teamaffinidi and community on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>  Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>  Get latest updates on what’s new at Affinidi, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v?__hstc=62619635.47aee03c70ce4792c76a5560e796e3ca.1637746550073.1646983543973.1647315106981.42&amp;__hssc=62619635.3.1647315106981&amp;__hsfp=2853627963">join our mailing&nbsp;list</a>  Interested in <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/careers">joining our&nbsp;team</a>?

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
<p>Laws against money laundering were created to use against organized crime during the period of Prohibition in the United States during the 1930s. Organized crime received a major boost from Prohibition and a large source of new funds that were obtained from illegal sales of alcohol. The successful prosecution of Al Capone on tax evasion brought in a new emphasis by the state and law enforcement agencies to track and confiscate money, but existing laws against tax evasion could not be used once gangsters started paying their taxes.</p>
<p>“Always follow the money” has been sound advice in law enforcement and political circles for decades. Nevertheless, tracking the flows of illicit funds generated by drug trafficking and organized crime and analyzing the magnitude and the extent to which these are laundered through the world’s financial systems remain daunting tasks.</p>
<p>Can Digital ID come to the rescue?</p>
<p>This episode covers the intersections of Digital ID, AML and Open Banking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the key questions answered are:</p>
 
 What’s the global impact of money laundering today? 
 How can Digital ID help prevent illicit financial flows? 
 How can technology (e.g., device fingerprinting) make anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing efforts faster, cheaper and more efficient? 
 What is the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Digital ID guidance? 
 How can you layer multiple sources of identity (outside of government sources) to enhance Identification Assurance? 
 How can you prevent money laundering through stronger Legal Entity Identity verifications? 
 Can Open Banking succeed without Digital Identity? Are open banking and digital identity the same thing? 
 What are some of the key Open Banking standards bodies that are active today? 
 Does Open Banking make money laundering easier or more difficult? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>And more!</p>

				  Indicio hosts Meetups once a month where we bring together leaders in the decentralized identity community to discuss current topics and trends. Join our community here to stay up to date on our next one!&nbsp; <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/">https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/</a> 
 
 
 Recently had the chance to sit down with Gabriel Rene, executive director of VERSES and&nbsp;author of “The Spatial Web: How Web 3.0 Will Connect Humans, Machines, and AI to Transform the World.”&nbsp; A video of this interview is currently live on our YouTube channel, you can watch it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2DntbiRmrE&amp;t=342s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2DntbiRmrE&amp;t=342s</a>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>

<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

   In order to counter the ever-growing threat of stolen, fraudulent or fabricated identity data being used to access services, a KYC process needs to be able to verify that the applicant is in fact real - in other words, to evaluate their ‘Liveness’. Passive Liveness allows companies to provide customers with frictionless onboarding while offering a new level of protection against identity fraud.

  <p>Front-end applications are becoming ever bigger and more complex. It is not uncommon for a React app to have hundreds or even thousands of components. As the project size increases, build times become increasingly important. In large projects, you may have to wait up to a minute for the code to be translated and bundled into a production package run in the browser. The compile and load times for the development server are also a big issue for these projects. Changes in the code may only show up in the browser after a few seconds. These wait times have become a bottleneck that slows down development.</p>

<p><a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> addresses this problem by providing a development server and a lightning-fast build command. Vite, pronounced <code>/vit/</code>, is French for “quick,” and this name describes the goal for this tool. The build command uses <a href="https://github.com/rollup/rollup">Rollup</a> under the hood, which is preconfigured to create highly optimized code. The development server makes use of browser support for ES modules. Hot Module Replacement will instantly load any codebase changes into the browser.</p>

<p>Vite was originally developed for Vue, but you can also create React and Svelte projects out of the box. In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a TypeScript-based React application using Vite. The application will be a simple number conversion tool that converts decimal numbers to hexadecimal and binary. I won’t assume any prior knowledge apart from a familiarity with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 14</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>

 Using Vite to create the TypeScript React application 

<p>Before you start, you should have recent versions of Node and npm installed on your system. The first step is to use the Vite command to create a new application. This can be done using the <code>npm init</code> command without installing any additional software. Open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm init vite@latest vite-number-conversion -- --template react-ts
</code>   

<p>If you are using an older version of <code>npm</code> (below version 7), you’ll need to modify the command slightly.</p>

   <code>npm init vite@2.8.0 vite-number-conversion --template react-ts
</code>   

<p>This command will generate a new folder <code>vite-number-conversion</code> and initialize it with the <code>react-ts</code> template. If you are asked to agree to install the <code>create-vite</code> package, simply answer with yes. This template creates a React project using TypeScript and all the configuration for tooling required to develop and build the project. Next, navigate into the new project folder and run the command below to install all the dependencies.</p>

   <code>npm install
</code>   

<p>You will be using the React Router to manage navigation through your single-page app. Run the following command to install the additional dependency.</p>

   <code>npm install -E react-router-dom@5.3.0 @types/react-router-dom@5.3.3
</code>   

<p>Now open your favorite IDE in the project folder. Feel free to browse around a little to get familiar with the code that Vite has generated. If you are familiar with <code>create-react-app</code>, you will notice that the differences are not that big on the surface. There is a Vite-specific configuration file, <code>vite.config.ts</code>, to tweak Vite’s behavior. For now, leave it as it is, but we will get back to this file later.</p>

<p>Your React components are saved as <code>.tsx</code> files in the <code>src/</code> folder. To keep things organized, create a new folder <code>src/components</code> and add a new file <code>src/components/Home.tsx</code>. This will be the component to show the application’s home page. Paste the following contents into the file.</p>

   <code>function Home() {
    return &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Number Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>Next, create the component that contains the number conversion tool. Create another file <code>src/components/Converter.tsx</code> with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import { useState } from 'react';

function Converter() {
    const [value, setValue] = useState&lt;number&gt;();
    const [origin, setOrigin] = useState&lt;string&gt;();
    const isDisabled = (base: string) =&gt; (origin !== undefined &amp;&amp; origin !== base);
    
    const updateValue = (baseName: string, base: number) =&gt; 
        (e: React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;) =&gt; {
            if (e.target.value === "") {
                setValue((oldValue) =&gt; undefined);
                setOrigin((oldOrigin) =&gt; undefined);
            } else {
                setValue((oldValue) =&gt; {
                    const newValue = parseInt(e.target.value, base);
                    return isNaN(newValue) ? oldValue : newValue;
                });
                setOrigin((oldOrigin) =&gt; baseName);
            }
        }

    return &lt;div className="Converter"&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
            Decimal:
            &lt;input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(10) || ""}
                name="decimal" 
                onChange={updateValue("decimal", 10)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("decimal")}/&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
            Hexadecimal:
            &lt;input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(16) || ""}
                name="hex" 
                onChange={updateValue("hex", 16)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("hex")}/&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;
            Binary:
            &lt;input type="string" 
                value={value?.toString(2) || ""}
                name="binary" 
                onChange={updateValue("binary", 2)} 
                disabled={isDisabled("binary")}/&gt;
        &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
}

export default Converter;
</code>   

<p>The <code>Converter</code> component contains three input fields, one for the decimal value, one for the hexadecimal value, and one for the binary value. It also uses two state variables. <code>value</code> contains the number that should be converted to the different formats, and <code>origin</code> includes the input field’s name in which the user has entered a number. The idea is to disable the input elements filled automatically with the converted values—the <code>isDisabled()</code> callback controls which elements are disabled.</p>

<p>The <code>updateValue()</code> function is a little bit more tricky. It is a function that returns a callback configured with the name and the number-base of the input field. The callback takes the <code>ChangeEvent</code> and updates the component state according to the value in the input field. In the functional programming style, higher-order functions like <code>updateValue()</code> can provide a mechanism to implement configurable code without creating code repetition.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>src/main.tsx</code> and add the Router to the application. At the top of the file, add the following import.</p>

   <code>import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
</code>   

<p>Then, modify the render function to look like the code below.</p>

   <code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
      &lt;App /&gt;
    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
</code>   

<p>To add the routes to the application, open <code>src/App.tsx</code> and replace its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>import './App.css'
import { Link, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import Converter from './components/Converter';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;nav&gt;
        &lt;div className="menu"&gt;
          &lt;Link to="/"&gt;Home&lt;/Link&gt;
          &lt;Link to="/converter"&gt;Converter&lt;/Link&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/nav&gt;
      &lt;Switch&gt;
        &lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/converter" component={Converter} /&gt;
      &lt;/Switch&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  )
}

export default App
</code>   

<p>The application is mostly complete, but it needs some styling. Open <code>src/App.css</code> and edit it to match the CSS below.</p>

   <code>.App {
  text-align: center;
}

.App nav {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  background-color: #333333;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.App nav a {
  color: #ffffff;
  text-decoration: none;
  margin-left: 1rem;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}

.Converter {
  text-align: left;
  margin: 1rem 4rem;
}

.Converter label {
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.Converter input {
  display: block;
  margin-top: 0.5rem;
}
</code>   

 Start it up and watch it run 

<p>Now, the fun begins! You are ready to start the application. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run dev
</code>   

<p>If you are used to React applications built with <code>create-react-app</code>, you might expect to wait a few seconds before the development server starts. With Vite, I see the following message in less than a second.</p>

   <code>  vite v2.8.4 dev server running at:

  &gt; Local: http://localhost:3000/
  &gt; Network: use `--host` to expose

  ready in 461ms.
</code>   

<p>You can now open your browser at <code>http://localhost:3000/</code> and test the application. When I click the Converter link in the navigation bar, I see something like this.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I opened up the Developer Tools in Chrome to understand how Vite achieves these fast starting-up times. When you open up the Network tab and filter by JS requests, you will see many requests to individual JavaScript sources. You will even see the <code>.tsx</code> sources you just edited.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I then looked closer at <code>App.tsx,</code> and saw what is shown in the above image. When the development server is asked to serve a <code>.tsx</code> file, it will compile it on the fly into browser-compatible code. But it keeps all the <code>import</code> statements in place and uses the support for ES modules in the newer browsers. This way, the bundling stage is eliminated, and the loading times are significantly reduced.</p>

 Adding authentication with Okta to the application 

<p>A secure application needs user authentication to keep unauthorized users out of restricted areas. With Okta, it is easy to add authentication to your Vite application in just a few steps.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Now you are ready to add the Okta libraries for React into your project. Open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.4.2 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.1.0
</code>   

<p>Vite needs some help resolving import aliases used by the Okta libraries. To make things work, open <code>vite.config.ts</code> and add the following entry to the configuration object.</p>

   <code>resolve: {
  alias: [
    {
      find: "@okta/okta-auth-js",
      replacement: require.resolve("@okta/okta-auth-js/dist/okta-auth-js.umd.js"),
    },
  ],
}
</code>   

<p>If your IDE or build can’t resolve <code>require</code>, you may need to add the <code>@types/node</code> library for the <code>require</code> method. In the terminal, add the library by running the following command:</p>

   <code>npm i –save-dev @types/node
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/main.tsx</code> and add the following code immediately after the <code>import</code> statements.</p>

   <code>import { Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: `/oauth2/default`,
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: `${window.location.origin}/callback`,
});

function restoreOriginalUri(oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) {
  window.location.replace(
    toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{yourClientID}</code> is the client ID that you obtained earlier and <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain. Next, surround the <code>BrowserRouter</code> component with the <code>Security</code> component, passing in <code>oktaAuth</code> and <code>restoreOriginalUri</code> as parameters. The call to the render function should look something like this.</p>

   <code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
        &lt;App /&gt;
      &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
</code>   

<p>Now that you have made the <code>OktaAuth</code> object available to your application, you are ready to create a secured route and configure the login process. Open <code>src/App.tsx</code> and add the following import.</p>

   <code>import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute } from '@okta/okta-react';
</code>   

<p>Finally, convert the route that serves the <code>Converter</code> component to a secured route and add another route that handles the login callback from Okta. The code inside the <code>Switch</code> component should resemble the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;Switch&gt;
  &lt;Route exact path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
  &lt;SecureRoute path="/converter" component={Converter} /&gt;
  &lt;Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
&lt;/Switch&gt;
</code>   

<p>Congratulations, you are ready to power up the application again. If it is still not running, run the command below in the terminal.</p>

   <code>npm run dev
</code>   

<p>Now, whenever you navigate to the Converter route, the application checks if you are authenticated. If not, it will redirect you to the Okta sign-in page, where you can enter your user credentials. After successfully logging in, you are able to access the application page you requested.</p>

 Learn more about React, TypeScript, and Okta 

<p>In this tutorial, I guided you through creating a TypeScript React application using Vite. Vite is a lightning-fast development server and package bundler that leverages modern ES module browser support and Hot Module Replacement—speeding up refresh times after changes to the codebase can significantly improve development productivity.</p>

<p>As an example, I showed you how to implement a number conversion utility that converts between decimal, hexadecimal, and binary formats. The application was secured using Okta authentication, and you have seen how this can be achieved in just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Next Tuesday March 15th starting from 09:am (CET), InfoCert will take part of one of biggest international virtual conferencese on Client Onboarding titled: “4th Client Onboarding Directors Forum for Banks and Financial Institutions 2022” organized by Amistat Group.</p>



<p>Norberto Ostallo – International Account Manager at InfoCert – will take a speech during the closing panel at 02:05 pm (CET) &nbsp;talking about “Digital Trust in Onboarding Processes: how to reach new customers enhancing security and experience”.</p>



<p>During the presentation he will aproach the following aspects:</p>



  the role of a QTSP and the outsourcing of liability  the balance among user experience, security, legal value, and regulatory compliance  the evolution of customer journeys thanks to new technologies and regulations  



<p>To register, visit <a href="https://client-onboarding-forum.com/">client-onboarding-forum.com</a>.</p>



<p>Client Onboarding is one of the most critical functions for banks as it directly impacts client experience, servicing, and relationships — all of which, in turn, impact profits. </p>



<p>In this challenging economic environment, banks are expected to match each other quite closely in terms of product innovation and financial service offerings. A real difference will, therefore, lie in creating a high-quality first impression. The financial institutions must deal with yet another aspect of the economic fallout-Customer Satisfaction. </p>



<p>The global Banking landscape has been forever changed by the evolutionary credit crisis, leaving issues of trust, customers attrition, brand loyalty,and the resulting revenue declines trailing in its wake. To ensure the success, financial institutions, while marshaling resources to raise capital and cut costs where possible, must not overlook their lifeblood-ongoing acquisition, optimization, and retention of the customers. </p>



<p>The bottom line is that financial institutions must improve customer experience to keep customers happy and satisfied.</p>

 How to stay safe online 



<p>Now more than ever, your online safety is paramount. Thousands of cyber-attacks happen every day, and your personal details could be at risk. Nowadays, most people store a lot of personal information on devices or through online accounts, and if you don’t protect yourself, it is possible that your details could be stolen without your knowledge which can lead to dire consequences.</p>



<p>At Revoke, we have outlined how you can stay safe online!</p>



 Keep your personal information limited 



<p>Only put information that is needed online. Strangers don’t need to know about your relationship status, home address and phone number. You would never physically give out your information to strangers, so why would you online?</p>



<p>For social media sites, we recommend only providing the base data such as your name and ensuring your privacy settings are strict so that strangers can’t view everything that you do with your life. Many people have login details that contain something about their personal life, and publicly displaying this information could lead to unauthorised access to your accounts. In 2019, information related to 530 million Facebook accounts were exposed online for anyone to search and use.</p>



 Choose strong passwords 



<p>Never have passwords that are easy to guess or use the same password across multiple platforms. It’s important to keep them varied and complex, using at least 12 characters along with a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. In the event that your data is compromised in a breach, it will be less damaging if the data is only associated with one account, and anyone accessing this data cannot use it on other platforms.</p>



 Use secure sites 



<p>When browsing online, make sure to look to see if there is a lock symbol beside the URL. If the site does not show this, it means that the site you are on is not secure and that you are in danger of someone else tracking what you’re doing without your knowledge. An unlocked website is now a sign that a website may be dangerous.</p>



<p>Most internet traffic comes from automated sources that can include bots and spammers, along with more malicious sources. Using secure websites means that you are safer from having your data accessed and keeps hackers and thieves at bay.</p>



 Make sure your internet connection is secure 



<p>Ensure that the device you are using online is secure. If you are using a public internet connection, make sure to think twice before providing personal information, as these free Wi-Fi sources provide you with no control over the security. It may be worth waiting until you are on a more trustworthy connection before providing this information.&nbsp;</p>



 Practice safe browsing

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Markus Grüneberg</a></p><p>Among the longstanding challenges that information security leaders have grappled with for years, one stands out: the difficulty of balancing user experience and security. The traditional tug-of-war between ease of access to business-critical applications and resources and robust protection from hackers has never been easy.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>The unprecedented demands that the COVID-19 pandemic have placed on IT and security teams have tested their flexibility, inventiveness and resolve. But they’ve also had a silver lining. Across industries — particularly in those that are highly regulated or have trended towards early adoption of cloud technologies — interest and investments in Zero Trust security initiatives are at an all-time high.</p>
<p>We surveyed more than 600 security decision-makers across North America, Asia-Pacific (APAC), and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) for our <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper-the-state-of-zero-trust-security-2021-report/">recent 2021 State of Zero Trust Security report</a> and discovered that 90% of organisations are currently working on Zero Trust implementation projects or plan to start one in the near future. Despite Zero Trust being coined as a network security concept by Forrester in 2010 (and conceived even earlier by the Jericho Forum), in 2019 only 16% of organisations had begun this journey. In 2020, 41% of organisations were working on Zero Trust initiatives and this shift has accelerated along with the remote working and cloud transformation programmes observed in response to the pandemic. The shift was particularly dramatic in EMEA, where only 18% of organisations had Zero Trust agendas in 2020 and 90% had planned or begun one this year.</p>
<p>For most global organisations, moving from legacy perimeter-based security methodologies (in which internal networks are “trusted” and external ones are “untrusted”) to an identity-centric <a href="https://www.okta.com/zero-trust/">Zero Trust-based approach</a> (in which identity is the new perimeter and users are secured individually so that they’re able to access the resources they need regardless of the location, device or network from which they’re connecting) isn’t simple or easy.</p>
<p>But pandemic response, combined with the need to support remote work has pushed growing numbers of organisations to accelerate Zero Trust adoption. As they do so, they’re seeing added benefits — enhanced flexibility for users who want to continue working remotely at least some of the time, and less friction for employees who increasingly depend on seamless access to cloud resources if they’re to remain productive in the modern digital business landscape. This trend has the potential to end the battle between usability and security – once and for all.</p>
<p>A key example here is the combined use of Single Sign-On (SSO) and adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). SSO enables user access to multiple resources once authenticated. This is convenient for the user but, when used by itself,&nbsp; SSO inherently increases risk as an attacker could likewise use that access if compromised. So, the authentication must be protected with MFA to ensure security.</p>
<p>By making that MFA ‘adaptive’, access can be readily granted to lower risk resources, with unusual or higher risk access attempts prompting a step up authentication challenge. Adaptive, context-based access policies reduce friction for users by prompting for MFA less frequently but ensuring security when it matters.</p>
<p></p>
 Identity is the cornerstone of Zero Trust 
<p>By definition, Zero Trust is an approach to security that ensures that the right people have the right level of access to the right resources in the right contexts, and that that access is re-assessed continuously — all without adding friction for users. To build a security architecture that achieves this aim, organisations must mature their approach to identity and access management, since identity is the cornerstone of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>As organisations implement Zero Trust architectures, they tend to progress through several relatively consistent stages of maturity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s important to note that the technologies adopted by organisations that are further along the Zero Trust maturity curve are those that not only provide more robust and consistent protection for greater numbers of users accessing more and more resources, but also include key capabilities that both simplify management and improve end users’ experience.</p>
 Zero Trust is Here to Stay 
<p>The shifts that were set in motion by COVID-19 &nbsp;will be with us for the long haul. Even as employees return to the office or work in a hybrid fashion, remote work will remain far more popular and widespread than it was in 2019. And the necessity of having secure and frictionless access to cloud resources as well as a diverse and distributed set of IT assets will only become more foundational for business success. We’ll never go back to yesterday’s perimeter-bound networks.</p>
<p>As a result, it’s a safe bet that adoption of technologies like passwordless and biometric authentication will continue to climb. Passwords are brittle, of course, and maintaining Active Directory on-premises with few cloud integrations creates friction for users and administrative overhead for IT and security teams alike. Modernising with a Zero Trust-based, identity-centric approach creates a win for all stakeholders: the organisation will mitigate today’s greatest risks at the same time that users enjoy seamless experiences and security teams exercise more granular visibility and control. This is why industry analysts, <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">government agencies</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">regulatory bodies</a> are all increasingly calling for Zero Trust’s large-scale adoption.</p>

 Interview CEO of Credify MAKOTO TOMINAGA 



<p>The Fintech ecosystem in Vietnam has been expanding more than ever in these recent years. Its mobile payment industry is expected to record a CAGR of 22.8% to reach US$ 27.7 billion by 2025 [<a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/s3dq39/vietnam_mobile?w=4">Source</a>]. Thus, we would like to know how Fintech has disrupted Vietnamese consumer behavior and what Fintech trends should be expected in Vietnam’s market for the next couple of years.</p>



<p>Business managers/bidev officers from potential partners that want to take a step ahead of the game in digitizing their businesses and catching up with Fintech trends.</p>



<p>This article serves as an entry to the thought-leadership articles by Credify, along with three other interview articles in the series #TalkwithCredify’sleaders</p>



Our CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAuk5nsBnScwb7fUnGHImx-ItPjO4rNCnpk">Makoto Tominaga</a>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/techfestvietnam/">Techfest Vietnam&nbsp;</a>AWARD CEREMONY OF FUTURE SOLUTION CONTEST 2021 – STARTUP CONNECT



 Personal Journey 



 Can you introduce a little bit about yourself and share your story when shifting from working in Engineering to doing Business? 



<p>I started my formal career as an engineer in the embedded operating system space, working with Symbian and Nokia. This was mainly systems-level development, and I was excited to see our technologies really taking hold in the world.</p>



<p>After this, I was given the opportunity to join an early-stage biometrics startup called Authentec, where we developed a small form factor fingerprint sensing technology that dominated the market. With this company, we managed to list on Nasdaq and eventually sold the business to Apple. If you’ve used TouchID, you have interacted with the products we built.</p>



<p>Following my work with Authentec, I made an important transition from engineering to technical marketing and business development with Validity Sensors, and with Apple taking Authentec’s products off the market, we were ready to meet the demand with our new offering.</p>



<p>The shift to the business side was a goal of mine after I became fascinated with the inner workings of enterprises, viewing them in many ways similar to complex engineering systems. I felt for someone with a more outgoing personality it made a lot of sense to be able to apply my systems understanding in such away.</p>



<p>Even though I made this transition, I have always been a technologist and can never really completely remove myself from the product side of the business.</p>



 What inspired you to found Credify? Why did you choose Vietnam as a primary market? 



<p>In 2014 I was introduced to Blockchain Technology and spent several years researching and playing around with these systems. During 2017 there was a boom in projects seeking to leverage blockchain, but I felt that majority of them were disingenuous in the application of the technology, with the sole aim to raise insane amounts of money through ICOs without any products in the market.</p>



<p>In 2018, I began to delve into researching real-world use cases for blockchain and smart contract systems and came up with the initial concept of Credify, a protocol for harnessing crowd intelligence to signal counterparty reputation or credibility in the case where the data we traditionally rely on for this is insufficient or easily manipulated. I wrote the seminal academic white paper for the Credify protocol, which included a decentralized identity system that now serves as the basis for our idX technology, and proceeded to patent this globally.</p>



<p>Our focus for Credify has always been the developing world, where we can have the most impact in terms of empowering users with their own data to gain access to fairer credit and life-changing insurance.</p>



<p>Vietnam was a natural great choice for our first market, as we have a strong team here and a broad personal network. Additionally, Vietnam is one of the quickest to begin a serious transition to the new world of digital services, with partners like banks, consumer finance institutions, and insurance companies welcoming solutions like Credify’s serviceX with open arms, as we help them expedite their digital transformation journeys.</p>



<p>We are closely working with top-tier financial service partners to solve some of the really hard problems they face when natively introducing their services to users in Vietnam’s new digital economy. This openness to collaboration is a huge factor in our choice, and given the speed with which we are onboarding financial services partners in the country, it is proving a correct decision.</p>



<p>I should also share that Vietnam is a country that the founding members are absolutely in love with, so it made our decision even easier.</p>



 What were some of the challenges that you faced when establishing Credify? 



<p>In this space, we must comply with complex and often murky regulations, and an uncompromising approach to system security is of utmost importance. Local operators do not always immediately recognize the scope of painstaking efforts that we have put into creating the solutions to the challenges that they both do and will face as these regulatory and security burdens increase, but once we overcome this hurdle of awareness the value of our proposition is deeply appreciated.<br><br>One other challenge we face is the task-driven mentality of the workforce. In our line of business and at our stage, it is absolutely imperative that all our team members take initiative, ownership in our vision and engage with the passion and creativity necessary to solve some really hard problems. It has been a slow process to build a team with this mindset, but we are managing step by step, and the results are simply inspiring!</p>



 The current state of Vietnam’s fintech ecosystem 



 What are some key elements that are helping Vietnam become an attractive market to invest and develop Fintech in? 



<p>The pace of digital adoption cannot be ignored, but I would also say that the ecosystem is robust and open to embracing innovation where it proves practical to the overarching goals of all stakeholders. The government has been very friendly towards fintech upstarts, as well, not being quick to impose overly burdensome requirements that ultimately stifle innovation. From this, the West could learn a lot.<br><br>Vietnam also represents a rich resource for technical talent, with the government, has placed special emphasis on the development of the local educational system to focus on STEM. Having local talent of this caliber really helps us to achieve quicker GTM and a special level of support that is hard to realize where high-quality tech talent is scarce.</p>



 How has Fintech disrupted the Vietnamese market and consumer behaviors, especially in this time of the pandemic? 



<p>By far, the biggest impact on the Vietnamese market and consumer behavior in COVID times has been the rapid urban adoption of cashless payment solutions like e-wallets and QR payments provided directly by banks. We are still a long way away from mass adoption across the nation, but the trend is undeniable.</p>



<p>This being said, we have found that many of the well-respected local financial institutions are struggling to compete with fintech as they seek to bring new innovations to the market. This is exactly where Credify lends the strongest helping hand, as we assist these traditional businesses in bringing their services and products into the digital world more quickly, with lower capital investment requirements and with a much broader scope of availability than if they were to attempt to develop the user engagement channels that Credify offers from the outset.</p>



 What role does Credify play in Vietnam’s current fintech ecosystem? What position is it aiming for? 



<p>Currently, Credify is simplifying access to financial services for users in the digital economy by natively integrating our banking, consumer finance, and insurance partner services with digital commerce platforms, gig economy on-demand service applications, as well as SME wholesale and management systems.</p>



<p>The solutions we offer are empowering users with highly relevant and competitive financial service and product offerings that are being tailored to their individual profiles and needs, removing frictions that are inherent to cross-industry service offerings, and increasing engagement rates for greater levels of client success.</p>



<p>Through one integration, both sides gain immediate access to a rapidly growing network of partners, and soon will be able to leverage offline operational reach through the same channel. We are expanding serviceX to capture offline retail (O2O) opportunities, where financial institutions are currently spending too much to support their existing manually driven customer onboarding processes.</p>







 Vietnam’s Fintech trends in the future 



 What are the successful Fintech solutions in developed markets that would likely become key trends in Vietnam in the near future (E.g: embedded finance, BNPL, etc)? 



<p>There are a few trends of note that have emerged over the past several years in the financial services space that I think is quite important for understanding the direction that the Vietnam market will take.</p>



<p>First is digital banking. Challenger banks are popping up quickly around the world that are more agile, data-driven, and customer experience-minded, all powered by completely digital banking cores like Mambu, and Vietnam is no exception with no fewer than 4 fully licensed digital banks have come to market over the past year. This trend is being expedited by COVID’s impact on traditional banking, which has forced the State Bank of Vietnam to push new regulations around eKYC and digital lending through the legal approval processes much quicker than in times past. This has put competitive pressure on slower-moving or less well-capitalized banks to digitally transform.</p>



<p>Open Banking and Banking-as-a-Service, where banks are adopting standards like OIDC for user authorized access by third parties to their customers’ banking data and API enabled account services. Dominant players like our BEENEXT portfolio sister company Brankas in Indonesia are helping these heavily regulated institutions achieve their digital transformation (DX) goals faster and more cheaply with BaaS platforms. We see that many banks in Vietnam have already begun to explore these types of systems, and we are even working with several at Credify to assist them in these pursuits, especially in digital lending.</p>



<p>Strict regulations and outdated underwriting systems have kept more traditional banking institutions from entering into the fully digital lending space, but here is where Credify is changing the game. We are partnering with several top banks and consumer finance companies in Vietnam to co-develop digital lending services like unsecured cash loans, BNPL, and co-branded virtual credit cards.</p>



<p>With serviceX, we are availing a massive distribution network to these products in our rapidly expanding partnerships base with offline retail, e-commerce, and gig economy application operators. We partner with these ecosystems to natively embed all aspects of these new products–from onboarding to disbursement to account servicing–and enable them to make use of their valuable data in a completely privacy-preserving manner to achieve better conversion rates, lower maintenance costs, and realize higher levels of customer engagement and stickiness, all the while contributing to absolutely amazing user experiences. This is the future. This is embedded finance.</p>



 What advice would you give for Vietnamese businesses to prepare for the rising trends? 



<p>Do not be afraid to embrace new technologies to enhance your services and gain much broader market exposure. Fire any consultants or internal management that tell you that you can develop these technologies in-house more efficiently than solution providers that have focused their entire operations on innovating and perfecting these services as core offerings of their businesses.</p>



<p>Focus on elevating excellence in your core business and work with partners to achieve your DX goals faster, more efficiently, and to a higher degree of quality than you would ever be able to on your own.</p>



<p>I’ve seen far too many financial institutions both in developed and developing economies allow the “not invented here” mentality to drag their operational efficiency down to a crawl, forcing them to settle on mediocre service quality and user experiences and ultimately hindering their ability to effectively compete in this fast-changing world.</p>



<p>Even if you decide that Credify isn’t a good fit, we encourage you to collaborate with focused technology partners rather than attempting to grow these solutions in-house, as you will without a doubt see desired outcomes faster and greater levels of success for making such a smart decision early on.</p>

 Trading partners can acquire user-friendly digital wallets and securely verify each others’ credentials, achieving regulatory compliance <p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> and <a href="https://www.xatp.org/">XATP</a> announced interoperability between their digital wallet services in support of regulatory compliance with the U.S. Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) by fall 2023. This key milestone enables trading partners using either platform to securely exchange and verify each other’s credentials as Authorized Trading Partners&nbsp;(ATPs).</p>Spherity and XATP enable real-time interoperability for Authorized Trading Partners.<p>A critical DSCSA requirement is the assurance that regulated interactions happen exclusively between ATPs: properly registered manufacturers, repackagers, wholesalers, third-party logistics providers (3PLs), and dispensers. More than 60,000 U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain participants are legally required to achieve regulatory compliance by November 2023. Both XATP and Spherity offer electronic solutions that deliver on the FDA guidance to respond to data requests in under one&nbsp;minute.</p><p>“The DSCSA mandates electronic interoperability across the entire U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, and decentralized credentials have emerged as the only realistic path to achieving regulatory compliance,” said XATP president Ben Taylor. “With decentralized credentials, each ATP’s identity is in their own hands. We are excited to work alongside Spherity to enable real-time interoperability for ATPs in a zero-trust world.”</p><p>“Spherity is thrilled to be working alongside XATP to deliver the world’s first truly interoperable exchange between credentialing platforms for DSCSA compliance,” said Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity. “Trading partners can acquire user-friendly digital wallets and ATP credentials to engage in DSCSA-regulated interactions.”</p><p>As members of the <a href="http://oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative</a> (OCI), Spherity and XATP both support the use of W3C-specified Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), GS1 messaging standards and data attributes, and open standards to achieve safe and secure credentialing and information exchange between&nbsp;ATPs.</p><p>“The clock is ticking on DSCSA compliance, and identity lies at the heart of every interaction between trading partners,” said OCI facilitator Bob Celeste. “Today’s announcement is a key moment for verifiable credentials in the pharmaceutical industry, as we all work together to further secure the U.S. drug&nbsp;supply.”</p><p>Spherity and XATP have both launched programs for ATPs and solution providers to obtain and test credentials for ATP authentication.

<p>Last week’s Holochain release brings improvements on many performance fronts. It tackles some database query inefficiencies, bringing some welcome reductions in RAM and CPU usage. Meanwhile, the developer community is exploring last the previous release’s breaking changes to validation, and have produced some materials worth watching if you’re trying to understand what these changes mean for your hApp.</p> A second note about breaking changes <p>This is a follow-up to my <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/big-hdk-change/#a-note-about-breaking-hdk-changes">previous note</a>. From now on, I’m going to be more explicit about breaking changes for each release, by starting the release notes with a big bold warning about anything that’s broken compatibility in the following seven categories. By ‘breaking’ I only mean something that is incompatible with the previous release of Holochain or any other component I’m reporting on — not the change in DNA hash that happens whenever you recompile a zome as described in last Dev Pulse.</p>  Network protocol: This is the gossip protocol that Holochain peers use to talk to each other. No updates are required for your zome code, except when a network message changes the data passed through the host API.  Host API: This is both the API that the conductor exposes to your zome code, such as source chain write functions, DHT retrieval functions, and crypto functions; and the API of callbacks that the conductor expects your zome code to implement, such as init and validation functions, and any arbitrary functions that make up your zome’s public API. A breaking change in the host API always results in a breaking change in the HDK and will require you to update your zome code to match.  HDK: This is the Rust-based SDK that your zome code can use to interact with the conductor. If the host API introduces breaking changes, the HDK will always change. Occasionally it will change in a way that’s invisible to you as an application developer, but even here your zome code will need to be recompiled in order to work with the updated host API. And occasionally the HDK can change in ways that maintain compatibility with the host API, such as <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1156">December’s changes</a> to <code>Path</code>.  Database: This is the SQLite database that holds users’ source chain data, the DHT shard they hold, and DHT routing and health information. If its schema changes, any application data stored by previous releases of the Holochain conductor will no longer work with the new release. No updates are required for your zome code, except when a change is caused by a change to information passed through the host API.  Conductor APIs: The conductor exposes these APIs to any client running on the user’s machine via a local HTTP connection that sends and receives MessagePack data as WebSocket messages. There are two APIs: the admin API, which lets a client manipulate hApps, agent keys, and change conductor configuration; and the application API, which lets a client actually call a hApp’s exposed zome functions. Any change in these APIs will also change the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust">Rust</a> conductor client libraries.  Conductor config format: User and developer machines specify conductor configuration in this format. Changes to it will require users and developers to modify existing config files, as well as scripts that specify conductor config as command-line arguments.  Keystore protocol: The Lair keystore, which stores all the user’s cryptographic secrets on their machine, has a protocol that it exposes to their conductor over a local socket. If this protocol changes, the conductor will come bundled with a new Lair binary, and the new keystore file format will sometimes also change, requiring users to create a new one.  Bootstrap API and proxy protocol: The bootstrap and proxy are two semi-centralised services that help peers discover each other and communicate through firewalls. The conductor talks directly to them using their APIs/protocols. If those change, both the conductor and the bootstrap and proxy binaries (bundled in the Holonix development environment) will change, and our publicly hosted bootstrap and proxy instances will be upgraded too.   Holochain 0.0.128: Database query improvements <p>Breaking changes warning: network protocol, bootstrap API</p><p>In preparation for Holo’s ‘long-term app testing’ <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">milestone</a>, the core dev team wrote a performance test that would simulate a DHT with 15 GB of chat data, hosted by ten conductors — essentially trying to recreate how Elemental Chat would be performing by the end of our multi-week testing run. Initially, the test result wasn’t that great: it couldn’t even complete on a fairly high-powered development machine, as CPU consumption went to 100%.</p><blockquote>Now, after a lot of work (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1243">#1243</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1244">#1244</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1245">#1245</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1246">#1246</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1247">#1247</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1248">#1248</a>) that same test runs on the same development machine with each conductor using only 2% CPU and 65 MB of RAM, for a total of 20% CPU and 650 MB RAM. That’s an impressive improvement!</blockquote><p>Now, it’s important to make meaningful comparisons. This doesn’t mean that every happ will run like this on any sort of computer — some will consume more resources; others less. But this test shows that, even under high gossip load, Holochain is now doing much better than it was a few weeks ago — and it’s more than capable of supporting a public and heavily-used Elemental Chat application.</p><p>It also makes Holochain more viable for low-powered systems such as Raspberry Pis and smartphones. This has always been one of our guiding principles. This helps companies like RedGrid achieve their goal of running Holochain on IoT devices.</p><blockquote>Note: on 3 March RedGrid rejoined our commercial director David Atkinson in a <a href="https://youtu.be/8x-FJkIBDh0">live-streamed interview</a> to share some status updates on the Internet of Energy Network. I found the whole thing really inspiring; I hope you do too!</blockquote>An excerpt from Holo’s 2018 <a href="https://files.holo.host/2018/03/Holo-Green-Paper.pdf">green paper</a>, highlighting Holochain’s resource efficiency. It makes me curious about how many Elemental Chat instances a base-model Raspberry Pi 4 could handle!<p>(Note: storage space has increased somewhat, because one of the fixes introduces new database indices.)</p><p>Other changes in this release:</p>  The old simple-bloom gossip algorithm, which is no longer used, was removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1256">#1256</a>)  Breaking (bootstrap API): The conductor can now get a list of available proxies from the bootstrap server. This feature can be configured in the conductor config. If you’re one of the rare folks running your own bootstrap server, this breaks compatibility with the old bootstrap server and you’ll need to update to <a href="https://crates.io/crates/kitsune_p2p_bootstrap/0.0.4"><code>kitsune_p2p_bootstrap</code> version 0.0.4</a> in order to keep serving your users. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1242">#1242</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1236">#1236</a>)  The entire Holochain codebase has been updated to Rust 2021 edition. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1253">#1253</a>)  Breaking (network protocol): Gossiped DHT operations no longer include hashes, because the receiver needs to calculate them anyway during validation. This saves 39 bytes of wire data for each operation. This breaks compatibility with the network protocol of Holochain 0.0.127 and earlier. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1250">#1250</a>)  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.128/CHANGELOG.md#20220303215755">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.129: Codebase cleanups <p>Breaking changes warning: none</p><p>This release has no breaking changes for anything concerning developers or users. It does, however, contain a lot of work dedicated to cleaning up the codebase. To a non-developer, this might seem like pointless work. But even though you don’t ever see what the kitchen looks like in your favourite restaurant, you kinda do care about that, don’t you? You hope the floors are clean and there are no rats running around.</p><p>So it’s important for the restaurant crew to keep a clean, orderly kitchen. Mess happens all the time; it’s just part of running a busy kitchen. The same is true of a codebase; you need to do regular checkups to clean up and make sure everything’s in the right place and in working order. This makes it easier for all the core developers to work, and in this case also improves performance in a couple places.</p><p>Here’s a sampling of what they’ve been working on in the kitchen:</p>  Rename database code to remove assumptions based on our previous database engine, LMDB. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1270">#1270</a>)  Demonstrate a different approach to interfacing the conductor and the networking library. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1260">#1260</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1267">#1267</a>)  Remove unneeded test structures. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1271">#1271</a>)  Improve reliability of automated test and build (continuous integration) workflows, which are run by GitHub every time a release is cut or code is being considered for a future release. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1273">#1273</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1274">#1274</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1275">#1275</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1276">#1276</a>)  Add a config param to create key log files for debugging TLS sessions. While this changes the config file format, it’s an additive change, not a breaking one. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1261">#1261</a>)   Known issues   Unmet dependency shuts down app: Rather than failing validation on an unmet dependency and retrying after fetching it, the conductor treats this as an unrecoverable error and shuts down the application. This may also be true for other types of application errors. This is already being worked on (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1279">#1279</a>).  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.129/CHANGELOG.md#20220309134939">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Lots of documentation work <p>I may have mentioned this already, but even if I have it’s worth mentioning again. Our new colleague Jost is working to improve the consistency, thoroughness, accuracy, and accessibility of the documentation. Currently he’s working in four different areas:</p>  <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/">HDK reference</a>  <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/conductor/api/index.html">Conductor API references</a> (admin and application APIs)  <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/conductor/api/config/conductor/struct.ConductorConfig.html">Conductor config reference</a>  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">Installation guide</a>  <p>In particular, the installation guide is getting some updates that match more closely how developers actually use Holochain; this should help new developers get up and running with a setup that’s been tested and refined by others. In the future the release team will integrate new tools that make updating Holochain and your hApps to a new version easier.</p> Holochain Launcher 0.3.10 <p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.3.10">newest version</a> of this end-user Holochain conductor and hApp installer has bumped the internal version of Holochain to 0.0.127. You can get it from the above GitHub link.</p> Updates to holochain-runner and electron-holochain-template <p>These two projects from Connor Turland at <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> help you build a self-contained app with all Holochain components bundled into one binary. <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/holochain-runner">holochain-runner</a> wraps the Holochain conductor and keystore into a self-contained binary that runs a single hApp, while <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template">electron-holochain-template</a> helps you build an Electron-based hApp using holochain-runner.</p><p>holochain-runner has seen a new release, 0.0.35, which bumps the included conductor to 0.0.126 (compatible with HDK 0.0.122). You can get it on <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/holochain-runner/releases/tag/v0.0.35">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain-runner/0.0.35">crates.io</a>. electron-holochain-template’s <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template"><code>main</code></a> branch has also been updated to match.</p> Exploring new validation approach <p>As I reported in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/big-hdk-change/">the last Dev Pulse</a>, Holochain 0.0.127 introduced a large breaking change in the way validation works. In summary, each zome now handles validation in a single <code>validate()</code> callback that takes one <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html">DHT operation</a>, matches on its type, and performs validation appropriate to the operation type and the data the operation contains.</p><p>The developer community has been exploring what this change means for their apps. On that theme, the most recent Holochain In Action session is all about validation…</p><p>And Eric Harris-Braun has <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/attestations/blob/20f0b7193acff186e730410a60c73f1a998e1f0e/dna/zomes/attestations/src/lib.rs#L33-L72">shared a code example</a> from a library he’s working on (more on that in the next section).</p><p>Next up, as part of the aforementioned documentation effort, the HDK doc for validation is getting some love, so you can understand exactly how it works and what you should validate for each operation type. <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/op/index.html">Here’s the most recent edition</a>; give it a read and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/new">share</a> your feedback with us.</p> New library: attestations <p>This library by Eric Harris-Braun gives your hApp the power to create <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/attestations">attestations</a>. What is an attestation, you ask? It’s fairly simple: someone claiming something about a subject. Humans do this all the time, so it’s pretty easy to come up with examples: Alice claims that Bob is her son, the driver’s licensing office issues a card that says Carol is allowed to drive, Dave’s university professor Eve signs a certificate that shows he completed his master’s degree. You can see some exciting <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/attestations#use-cases">use cases</a> for this library involving DAO/Discord/NFT mashups, Holochain membrane proofs (the ‘passport’ into a hApp’s DHT), and reviews/ratings/badges/certificates.</p><p>With public-key cryptography, you can create a ‘portable’ or ‘self-verifying’ attestation — a data structure that carries a signature that proves that the proper person made the attestation. All you need is the public key of the person who did the signing (as well as a way of knowing that the public key actually belongs to the person you think it does — which is a whole other story).</p><p>This library’s readme points out that, in a sense, every source chain element is already a cryptographically verifiable attestation. When it gets published, it carries a public key and a signature that together let anyone else verify the identity of its creator.</p><p>The library is pretty simple — basically just enough structure to let anyone in a DHT make an attestation about someone else, plus functionality to search for attestations making a given claim or being made by or about a given agent. I understand there’s also plans to add support for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p> New library: threaded-comments <p>I discovered a small but useful library called <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/threaded-comments">threaded-comments</a>. It does exactly what it sounds like it does, adding support for comment threads to your hApp. It comes with a basic but working demo UI so you can play around with it. It doesn’t make assumptions about what sorts of things can have comments attached to them; it just takes an entry hash and a message as input (in fact, that’s what gives you threading for free — you can attach a comment to a comment). This means you can add comment support for anything your app deals in: pictures, blog posts, tweets, transactions, game moves, etc.</p><p>This library is coming out of the Wednesday hackalong workshops, in which members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/KCnMzzP4qZ">DEV.HC</a> Discord get together to teach/learn Holochain by working on actual projects. The next workshop (which happened the day this Dev Pulse was published) focused on a reactions library; I hope to share its Git repo in the next Dev Pulse.</p><p>It’s really exciting to see more and more developers getting interested in Holochain, gaining experience, and perhaps more importantly supporting each other through the journey. I think of Holochain as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality">‘tool for conviviality’</a>, in the words of philosopher Ivan Illich — a tool that gives regular folks the power to take care of each other and build society without excessive intervention by institutions. And it’s so nice to see the developer community practicing the same conviviality they aim to foster with the tools they’re building.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@mitchorr?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Mitchell Orr</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/whippet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 After a voting campaign and election on Snapshot, the DAO has elected its three community key signers. Find out more about who they are and what they will&nbsp;do! <p>Following a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/shyftdao.eth/proposal/0xe4468c7d45d32ac28255bfc0addb9e91bdf80547ea64eb4784ddad6f85a983b0">voting period on Snapshot</a>, the Shyft DAO is proud to elect its three community key signers! The three elected community members will join four other key signers (two from Shyft Core; two from the Shyft Federation) to execute on transactions connected with the utilization of the Shyft DAO treasury. Key signers will all represent the Shyft DAO and aid in the perpetual advancement of Shyft Network and our mission to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without sacrificing users’ data privacy or sovereignty.</p><p>Now, without further ado, meet the three community key signers, who are represented by their Discord handles below. Upon election, each signer will have the choice to remain anonymous if they choose to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>You can also check out some of the newly elected key signers’ quotes from their candidacy about why they wanted to represent the Shyft community in the&nbsp;DAO.</p>  Hindsgaul (Hindsgaul#0431)  <blockquote>As a DeFi enthusiast and web3 supporter, I have had experience participating in other DAOs such as GRO protocol and Merit Circle. I have been in the crypto space for more than four years and one of my very first investments back in the day was actually in a DAO. Since then, the crypto space has matured a lot, and we see the need for regulation for crypto to truly go mainstream.</blockquote><blockquote>I believe in Shyft Network to solve both the Travel Rule problem and the institutional DeFi problem, and I want to help achieve that. This is the direction that is needed for the crypto space in general. I’d like to represent the Shyft DAO and the Shyft community in order to help grow both the community and the entire Shyft ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Disclaimer:<br>Hindsgaul Capital is a private investor and strong believer in Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>2. Conqueror (Conqueror#1312)</p><blockquote>“I’ve been interested in crypto for a long time and have participated in many votes across various DAOs. I have known DeFi for a long time and am an active participant—most of my time is spent researching and learning in this field. I have loved being in this community from the moment I discovered Shyft. I believe I fit this role and will best represent the Shyft community.”</blockquote><p>3. DT (DT#5207)</p><blockquote>“I am an experienced DeFi user familiar with major DeFi primitives and protocols and am an active DAO member of Inverse DAO and Gearbox DAO. I am a researcher of blockchain technology and its anti-corruption impact (transparency, cost-effectiveness, identity protection, cybersecurity, fraud prevention, traceability &amp; visibility, and real-time information sharing system usage) on different fields with the current focus on global health. This focus includes drug supply, clinical trials, electronic medical records, patient consent, chronic patient monitoring, infection disease tracing, healthcare services, and medical insurance.</blockquote><blockquote>One of the main reasons why DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) is not widely applied is the lack of regulations and lack of trust, accompanied by the lack of technical skills — despite many companies and government authorities already implementing DLT and smart contracts, like FDA big pharma and some end-users. To sum it up, I am an experienced DeFi user and researcher with academic background and connections to different universities around the&nbsp;world.”</blockquote> What’s Next <p>The three DAO community key signers will join the four other key signers (two from Shyft Core; two from the Shyft Federation), who will be elected and announced in the coming&nbsp;days.</p><p>Together, the signers will enable treasury transaction executions in connection with approved proposals that require grant funding. Signers will help strategically facilitate the Shyft protocol’s advancement, infrastructure expansion, upgrades, and ecosystem development, per the Shyft DAO’s mission statement. Elected signers will participate in the signing of Shyft DAO transactions for three&nbsp;months.</p><p>Stay tuned as we share more information on our new key signers and the DAO’s upcoming proposals.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Yesterday, Google has <a href="https://www.googlecloudpresscorner.com/2022-03-08-mgc">announced its intent</a> to acquire <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/">Mandiant</a>, a leading provider of cybersecurity defense and response services, for $5.4 billion – the company’s second-largest acquisition to date. When the deal is closed, Mandiant will join Google Cloud, further expanding its new parent company’s portfolio of security services, both in its own cloud and across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.</p>
<p>To be completely honest, my initial reaction was somewhat akin to “Oh, poor Mandiant, they just won’t leave it alone…” After all, the company had quite an interesting history. Established in 2004, Mandiant has quickly established itself as one of the leading vendors in threat intelligence, incident response, and security consulting. However, in 2013 it was acquired by FireEye in a deal of over $1 billion.</p>
<p>For 7 years, Mandiant operated as a unit within FireEye, growing and increasing its brand recognition even further with such high-profile investigations as the SolarWinds supply chain attack or the Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident. However, in June 2021, Mandiant has again emerged as an independent company after a split that has seen FireEye’s products sold to a private equity group. This freedom didn’t last long, as we can observe now since Alphabet is keen to close the acquisition as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Still, my first reaction was, of course, wrong. Mandiant is anything but “poor” and joining Google Cloud will only open massive new prospects for it, both in terms of reaching much larger customer bases and accessing Google’s own cloud infrastructure. So, while the company’s independent presence was short, its future as a part of the Google Cloud platform seems secure. More interesting, however, is understanding the future benefits of the deal for Google…</p>
<p>As we already mentioned while discussing the company’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/google-cloud-acquires-soar-vendor-siemplify">earlier acquisition of Siemplify</a>, Google is working hard to establish itself as a full-featured security service provider. While Google Cloud has long been recognized as one of the world’s largest cloud service providers, just having a lot of hardware is no longer enough for a reliable competitive advantage. In the times when large-scale security attacks have become a daily norm, data leaks and ransomware attacks can ruin even large businesses, and compliance regulations come with increasingly hefty fines, security has become a crucial differentiating factor for choosing the right provider for your next cloud project.</p>
<p>Fifteen years after the first public cloud has emerged, AWS remains the largest cloud service provider by size and revenue; trying to compete with it by building more data centers is still not a viable strategy. Sooner or later, other providers came to the realization that attracting customers with unique innovative capabilities and services is the right way. Oracle has <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc70309/enterprise-databases-in-the-cloud">the best databases</a>, Google has the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80477/api-management-and-security">best API management</a>, IBM has great managed services, etc. However, no single cloud is best at everything, and thus, “multi-cloud” is quickly becoming the new “hybrid” for modern large-scale cloud projects.</p>
<p>And in this new multi-cloud world, you must ensure that critical workloads and sensitive data remain constantly observable, properly governed, and securely protected against a multitude of cyber threats and other risks. Securing your own cloud is no longer enough – customers expect your security tools to provide holistic coverage across your competitors as well.</p>
<p>Microsoft was perhaps the earliest adopter of this strategy, and it has paid off quickly. In the recently published <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80473/intelligent-siem-platforms">Leadership Compass on Intelligent SIEM Platforms</a>, we have recognized the company’s security analytics platform Microsoft Sentinel as an undisputed market leader despite its relatively short history. Microsoft Defender for Cloud is also the first solution to provide security posture management across all three big clouds.</p>
<p>Now, it’s Google’s turn to boost its security services, and the company has decided to go big by adding a veteran leader in threat intelligence, attack surface management, and automated defense to its already substantial portfolio. This is a clear indication that Google is no longer focusing on “cloud-native” startups, but wants to see large, more traditional enterprises among its customers, and is ready to cater to their complex, hybrid, multi-cloud requirements.</p>
<p>All these developments indicate a welcome departure from the old-school mentality of “my cloud is better than yours” towards more open and mutually beneficial partnerships and multi-cloud collaboration projects. For the customers, consistent multi-cloud security is a must, and seeing the market becoming more competitive is a definite win. KuppingerCole will continue to observe these developments and cover all aspects of security from and for the cloud <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">in our research</a>.</p>

				  NFTs are a powerful technology for digital ownership and value transfer, but verifiable credentials are better for digital identity  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By <a href="mailto:char@indicio.tech">Char Howland</a></p>
<p>Non-fungible tokens, more commonly referred to as NFTs, have leapt from niche tech communities into mainstream media as a way to commodify digital art. Celebrities have garnered publicity for NFTs by issuing them, such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph">Grimes</a>, or investing in them, such as <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nfts-legally-blonde-reese-witherspoon-163256908.html">Reese Witherspoon </a>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22904893/nft-explainer-why-celebrities-buy-bored-ape-yacht-club-jimmy-fallon-paris-hilton">Jimmy Fallon</a>. A $11.7-million gold cube was placed in Central Park in February 2022 to garner <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/solid-gold-cube-central-park-2067281">publicity</a> for German artist Niclas Castello crypto and NFT launch — and symbolize the transition from old-world material value to 21st century digital value. </p>
<p>Inevitably, NFTs and their connection to blockchains and cryptocurrencies are easier to hype or scorn than understand as a technology attempting to create proof of digital ownership or uniqueness in a medium of infinitely copyable ones and zeros. NFTs are technologically interesting as a way of proving ownership and facilitating value transfer; but they are problematic if applied to proving a person’s identity. </p>
<p>As a cryptographic token stored on a blockchain, an NFT is unique, irreplicable, and proves the ownership of an object by one entity. An NFT in the analog world is akin to a receipt, which proves a purchase, except that it is publicly displayed on its blockchain ledger. Having your receipt written to the blockchain means that it cannot be altered without breaking the integrity of the chain. As an immutable record, NFTs solve the problem of selling and owning digital art.</p>
<p>Depending on the ledger, NFTs can be transferable between different owners and can hold intrinsic value (i.e., value independent of market scarcity or desirability). This is because an NFT smart contract defines the relationship of ownership and value transfer on the ledger and not the other way around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What NFTs are good for<br>NFTs provide digital data with verifiable rights of ownership and history. They do this by outlining a smart contract that governs how ownership is authenticated and transferred. NFTs excel at giving digital creators a new way to exchange labor for monetary gain. While NFT smart contracts exist as an extension of digital currency, they are being used to represent <a href="https://docs.nftstars.app/nft-stars/guides/what-are-nft-standards-and-how-to-choose-one#:~:text=financial%20asset%2C%20utility%20asset%20or%20currency">financial assets as well as utility assets</a>. </p>
<p>NFTs are good at providing digital data and digitally represented physical assets with the ability to prove a right of ownership and a history of that ownership. One limitation, however, is secure storage. Blockchain ledgers require a group of computers validating blocks to be added to the ledger. For each computer to maintain consensus in a timely manner with high availability&nbsp;&nbsp;, NFTs must be within a certain size. This size limit prevents large digital assets from being represented on a ledger. </p>
<p>As a result, NFT smart contracts are starting to use identifiers to external data storage to overcome the storage limitations of blockchain ledgers. External storage references are used to connect a digital asset to an NFT where the digital asset is stored with a different service. This use of external, off-ledger storage leads to the centralization of digital assets, with the attendant risks of centralizing any high-value data. Attempts to mitigate this centralization are being taken by using decentralized services that specialize in storage, such as the distributed <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPSF</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to define exactly how value and ownership is transferred on a blockchain ledger, combined with the flexibility to represent large, custom digital assets gives the NFT creator unprecedented control of a digital asset even after its sale. Combined, these benefits provide a completely novel way for digital creators to monetize their art, creating new markets that only exist online. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As NFT smart contracts define digital ownership and value transfer, NFT creators have used the definitions of ownership and value transfer to conceal extra fees and expiration dates. Governments can use these features to collect tax, but scammers can also take the spread of value or manipulate ownership and value. As with any contract, know what you are signing.</p>
<p>What NFTs are not good for<br>As we live in increasingly digital worlds, verifying identity in digital spaces is as important as it is in many physical spaces. And since a person’s identity is unique and irreplicable, some are jumping to the conclusion that NFTs should be used to represent that person and prove their identity in a virtual space.</p>
<p>This is where the hype around NFTs is overstated. While the public nature of NFTs is useful for proving ownership, it is detrimental when applied to sensitive personal information. First, we don’t want any personally-identifying information, including variants such as hashes, written to a public or even a private blockchain. This is just basic digital safety. Even if data on a public ledger is encrypted, that encryption has an expiration date, and in some number of years that encryption will be solvable and the data will be accessible.</p>
<p>Second, NFTs are not designed for verifying personal identity information. If you wanted to verify a particular item of personal information, NFTs would, again, limit privacy because they are indivisible and immutable objects. They are not designed for selective disclosure or the right to be forgotten. This means that NFTs do not meet the needs for GDPR or other, similar, data privacy laws.</p>
<p>Third, some organizations have rules against using token-based technologies or cryptocurrencies. Since NFTs are built on top of cryptocurrencies, those organizations cannot issue or accept NFTs as credentials. Although the number of organizations with token-restricting rules will likely decrease, these restrictions decrease the overall interoperability of NFTs for identity proof.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are the digital identity solution<br>While NFTs are designed to prove the ownership of a digital asset, verifiable credentials (VCs) are designed to prove information about a person or entity. VCs use blockchain-based distributed ledger technology to make credentials private but verifiable: The credential itself is private until the subject consents to revealing it, or sharing data contained within it, but the cryptographic keys necessary to verify the validity of the credential and its ownership are publicly available on the ledger. </p>
<p>In other words, the contents of your passport are held by you in the verifiable credential on a mobile device or other wallet; they are not written to a blockchain as they would need to be if your passport was an NFT. This solves the privacy and safety problem.</p>
<p>In contrast to the roles of seller and buyer in an NFT transaction, VCs support the roles necessary for identity information exchange: an issuer who creates and signs the credential (e.g., the passport office), a holder who keeps and presents the credential (e.g., you), and a verifier who cryptographically verifies the validity of the credential upon presentation (e.g., airport security). </p>
<p>VCs are also designed to be divisible: each credential has a collection of attributes (i.e. first name, last name, birthdate, etc.) that can be revealed or withheld depending on the required information. They can allow zero knowledge proofs, a way of verifying a statement as true or false without revealing its value (for example: proving that someone is over 21 years old without revealing their exact age). VCs pose less of a risk to GDPR infractions than NFTs. Since VCs are not bound to cryptocurrencies, they can be used by all organizations, including those with rules against the use of cryptocurrencies and token-based technologies.</p>
<p>VCs are superior for digital identity verification than NFTs precisely because they solve the digital verification problem while preserving privacy and increasing security (the peer-to-peer&nbsp; communications protocol for verification can render each identity cryptographically unique).</p>
<p>The underlying problem of verifying digital information is only going to become more urgent as our concept of identity expands to include billions of connected devices and digital twins (the virtual representation of a physical object). NFTs demonstrate a need for proof, and meet the need for proving digital ownership; but verifiable credentials represent the better, privacy-preserving solution for personal identity.</p>

<p>The year 2022 hasn’t started well for Google, with the District of Columbia, Texas, Washington state, and Indiana&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/">filing a lawsuit</a>&nbsp;against the tech giant over “deceptive location tracking”.</p>



 The lawsuit alleges Google deceived users by collecting their location data even though the users thought the function was disabled. These “misleading promises about its users’ ability to protect their privacy through Google account settings” date back to at least 2014, the Washington Post&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/techttps:/www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/hnology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/">reports</a>.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Commenting on the lawsuit, DC Attorney General Karl Racine&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/google-lawsuit-location-dc-privacy/">said</a>, </p>



 “Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access. The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.” 



<p></p>



<p>That statement should drive fear through the world’s 4.66 billion internet users.</p>



<p>The lawsuit stems from investigations dating back to 2018 by Princeton University and the Associated Press into concerns that Google iOS and Android apps recorded time-stamped location data without permission.</p>



<p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/google-lawsuit-location-dc-privacy/">Tech Crunch</a>&nbsp;reports, “The lawsuit argues that Google created a location tracking system that’s impossible for users to opt out of and that it misled users about how privacy settings could protect their data within apps and at the device level on Android.

<p>The lawsuit seeks to stop the location data practices and fine the tech giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We like to bring you these stories because they highlight the extent of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data privacy crisis</a>&nbsp;and how, increasingly, privacy laws and consumer backlash are reining in big tech’s blatant disregard for user&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until companies become honest stewards of consumer data, users must proactively protect themselves. At Anonyome Labs, we empower people to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. Enterprises can use our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;to rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersafety customer solutions, and consumers can use our&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;all-in-one privacy app. At the heart of both solutions is the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo digital identity</a>.&nbsp;</p>

The Veteran Funding Tier is therefore being removed. The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects in OceanDAO. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price when the Voting period&nbsp;Ends.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects.

				<p>Since an unprovoked Putin shocked the world by launching Europe’s largest military conflict since WWII into Ukraine, some 2,000,000 individuals have fled their homes in search of safety in a span of less than one week. While the world is–unfortunately–no stranger to refugees, the scale and velocity of the exodus has been unprecedented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these Ukrainians now join in the challenges faced by refugees all over the world, one of which is proving who they are. Whether it’s a doctor unable to prove their credentials, a graduate unable to prove their degree, or even families unable to prove their relationships; critical services and opportunities become that much harder to access as an individual seeking asylum.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problem is regrettably not only faced by refugees, but more than 1 billion other people around the world without access to trustworthy forms of identification. Trinsic’s mission has always been “to make the world more accessible.” Today we are launching Identity for Good, which is focused on enabling solutions that will address these problems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

 Seema Khinda Johnson, Nuggets: “there will only be more transactions, more fraud, and more friction” <p>It’s more important than ever to have an interoperable and reusable verified digital identity that preserves privacy and provides security.</p>Seema Khinda Johnson — Co-founder and COO,&nbsp;Nuggets<p>Online shopping has been sky-rocketing these past few years, with more people opting for this fast and effective way of obtaining goods. As a result, the need for secure transactions grew simultaneously with the need <a href="https://cybernews.com/what-is-vpn/">to protect our identity and personal information</a> when making purchases online.</p><p>To find out more about the concept of identity theft and its dangers, we’ve interviewed a trusted transactions company’s Nuggets COO and Co-Founder, Seema Khinda&nbsp;Johnson.</p><p>Tell us about your story. How did Nuggets evolve from an idea to what it is&nbsp;today?</p><p>In 2015, someone used my husband Alastair’s credit card and data fraudulently. That kicked off a hugely frustrating process and showed us that no one really owns or controls their data. This was against the backdrop of data breaches, constant advice to change passwords, and a lack of any comprehensive solution to protecting data. Every day, customers’ data was being compromised.</p><p>Alastair and I decided this was a challenge for us. We set out to solve it and set up Nuggets in late 2016. Our mission is to help businesses protect their customer data and to give people control back over their data. We believe personal information should be owned and controlled by the&nbsp;person.</p><p>Can you tell us a little bit about your self-sovereign identity platform? What are the main issues it helps&nbsp;solve?</p><p>Right now, the world has a trust&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Trust in the system that supports our digital lives has been massively eroded. Whenever customers sign up, transact or access services online, they become vulnerable to fraud, security, and privacy issues. And businesses are just as&nbsp;exposed.</p><p>This is a huge problem — and it’s only getting bigger. Trust, privacy, and security are now the number one priority for consumers and businesses alike.</p><p>Even so, and despite hundreds of millions spent on cybersecurity, fraud detection, and prevention, the statistics on data breaches and fraud get worse every&nbsp;year.</p><p>And it’s only going to get more complicated.</p><p>Right now, our privacy and security rely on what we can remember (passwords) and what we have in our hands (devices). Not on the thing we can prove: our identity.</p><p>The biggest issue is that no one knows who’s actually behind the password or device. It might be you — or someone completely unknown. So they can’t truly be trusted. This is a huge risk for businesses.</p><p>What you need is a verified identity that’s reusable, portable, and transparent. An identity that allows you to prove who you are, enable access, and serve as a non-custodial cache for your digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Looking ahead, there will only be more transactions, more fraud, and more friction. So we need a new privacy paradigm. One that’s built for today and tomorrow. One that can easily transition from the meatspace to the metaverse.</p><p>The good news is, we’ve already built it. It’s&nbsp;Nuggets.</p><p>Nuggets is an interoperable trust solution that&nbsp;offers:</p>  Self-sovereign verified digital identity that is reusable, interoperable with a reputation that travels with you, for Web 2.0, 3, and the Metaverse.  Trusted Payments — payments are tied to a verified identity.  Personal Cloud Vault — each identity includes a personal digital cloud vault with verified credentials.  Auditable Nuggets — thanks to our self-sovereign auditable nuggets, businesses no longer have to store PII data. You’re just granted access to data for regulatory and auditing purposes.  <p>Which methods do you use to ensure strong identity verification without compromising the user experience?</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/MJSxQUW2S4w">The process for creating</a> a verified SSI with Nuggets is simple. Once you’ve downloaded Nuggets, you do a one-time e-KYC process. You take a photo of a government-issued ID (like a passport or a driving license,) perform a moving likeness check, and you’re&nbsp;done.</p><p>Then all you have to do to use your Nuggets identity is choose the Nuggets option in a payment or verification process. It pings your mobile, and you verify your identity with biometrics. No more passwords!</p><p>In your opinion, what were the most serious cybersecurity challenges that emerged during the pandemic?</p><p>There are many new statistics around the pandemic’s impact on cybersecurity. That impact has been driven by various factors, new and&nbsp;old.</p><p>Having almost everyone working from home has exacerbated already serious vulnerabilities. These are the result of years of complacency around cybersecurity — like the ongoing use of usernames and passwords.</p><p>Working from home has also exposed more people to phishing scams. 47% of individuals fall for these scams while working at&nbsp;home.</p><p>There are some startling statistics from the pandemic&nbsp;period:</p>  Username and password breaches were up 450% in 2020, with 1.48 billion records breached.  Unauthorized access was the most common type of breach for the third consecutive year in 2021 — accounting for 43% of all breaches.  34% of breaches targeted healthcare in 2021 — the most targeted sector of all, which also recorded the highest average cost per compromised record:&nbsp;$474.  The tech sector paid the aggregate cost of recovery — a staggering $288 billion, with over 1.6 billion records&nbsp;stolen.  The average cost of a breach in the US was $8.64 million. This was the highest in the world — up 5% from $8.19 million the year&nbsp;before.  The number of time people spent online more than doubled, at more than seven hours per person per&nbsp;day.  <p>You can read more about all these statistics in <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ch/en/pages/risk/articles/impact-covid-cybersecurity.html">this recent Deloitte&nbsp;report</a>.</p><p>As cybercrime rates are growing, which security measures should be implemented by every Internet&nbsp;user?</p><p>The onus shouldn’t be on the individual to protect themselves.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Comprehending the Current and Future Transformation of Business by Autonomous Machines 
<p>Self-driving cars! Not so fast, autonomous devices include much more than just vehicles.</p>
<p>Autonomous devices perform their function using data it collects from its surroundings and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/16/an-introduction-to-autonomous-devices/?sh=16c1d6fb6875">acts based on its analysis of that input</a>. This is often combing AI/ML and edge computing so that the device can operate without direct commands from an operator. It is not automatic, where it follows a rule-based logic that do not account for changes in the environment.</p>
<p>Autonomous devices are often closely associated with robotics, vehicles, and drones. Most tasks that autonomous devices are trained to do <a href="https://www.bridge-global.com/blog/autonomous-devices-are-here-are-you-ready/">require it to move around in the physical world</a> and respond to it.</p>
<p>How do autonomous devices dynamically interact with the world? By equipping the device with sensors and cameras to collect data, and by using <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/artificial-intelligence">AI/ML models</a> to detect objects, recognize and classify what they are, make predictions about what those objects may do, and determine how best to react to them. For more information on the types of regression algorithms that are often used in autonomous vehicles and other devices, <a href="https://iiot-world.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithms-in-autonomous-driving/">click here</a>.</p>
 Where future is already reality 
<p>Autonomous devices are being used today in several industries, and more are to come.</p>
<p>Autonomous devices are best understood by their function. They can range from devices that support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18194566/amazon-scout-autonomous-six-wheeled-delivery-robot">logistics</a> by monitoring, sorting, delivering, or driving/flying. Health devices that help bring <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/41960-wearable-exoskeletons-built-in-a-i-to-meld-human-machine">mobility to people with paralysis</a> include exoskeletons. <a href="https://fruitgrowersnews.com/news/tg-claims-worlds-first-commercial-robotic-apple-harvest/">Farming</a> uses autonomous robots already for crop and soil monitoring, and harvesting.</p>
<p>There are some driverless vehicles on the road, but these are <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/fisher/moving-towards-ai-and-iot-solutions-beyond-machine-learning">exceptions rather than the norm</a>. But it’s still possible to <a href="https://waymo.com/">take a ride</a> in one.</p>
<p>Its easy to write autonomous devices off as novelty experiments, but the impact on business will only continue to grow. There is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/08/03/three-ways-autonomous-technology-can-and-will-transform-your-business/?sh=58c3736d6896">high potential</a> for better efficiency and improved safety.</p>
 The double-edged sword of autonomous machines 
<p>But we should still be cautious with autonomous devices, and here’s why:</p>
<p>Connectivity issues: Autonomous devices must have the lowest latency possible for the split-second decisions that they must make. Any disruption in the connection could be disastrous.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Connected and Automated Vehicles will require low latency, high volume communication potentially creating terabytes of data every day. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80238/5g-impact-on-organizations-and-security">Leadership Brief: 5G Impact on Organizations and Security</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data privacy: Devices, especially vehicles, rely on sensors and cameras to process its surroundings. What are the implications for individuals passing by if images of their faces are streamed to the cloud, or the current location information of individuals not in the car? Or the license plates and driving habits of other drivers on the road? Will this data be sold to insurance providers, law enforcement, or retail giants is consent is collected from the driver? And does the driver have the right to disclose data about other people and their property? These questions must be clearly answered, and airing on the side of caution and privacy by design.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/05/13/the-collective-power-of-swarm-intelligence-in-ai-and-robotics/?sh=40bceb5c252f">Swarm intelligence:</a> It sounds ominous, and it could be. Different types of autonomous devices that do different types of tasks could share information or trigger a follow-up action. Or the same types of devices could collaborate to all do their tasks more effectively, such as a fleet of autonomous vehicles braking in synchronization to prevent a traffic slowdown.</p>
 Protection and preparing for dangers 
<p>Research in other areas will have to advance and be implemented before autonomous devices become widely used.</p>
<p>Advances in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-story-of-edge-ai">edge computing</a> will reduce dependency on cloud processing by moving computing and storage resources closer to a device’s geographical location. 5G could also help establish the communication infrastructure that connected devices will need, which many autonomous devices will be. 5G is already being rolled out in different parts of the world, but it has not reached the ubiquity that is needed for massive machine-to-machine communication that could help autonomous devices flourish.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>5G is intended to handle up to 1000 times greater data volumes and up to 100 times more connected devices than with 4G today. It can also reduce communications latency and enable up to ten-year battery life for lower power devices. – <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80238/5g-impact-on-organizations-and-security">Leadership Brief: 5G Impact on Organizations and Security</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>IoT security must become stronger if autonomous devices are to be used more widely. Secure identities for devices must be managed, and <a href="https://www.iotsecurityfoundation.org/iot-security-foundation-launches-co-ordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-platform-for-iot-industry/">vulnerabilities must be managed</a>. More research must be focused here, and it must be implemented in any organization that wants to use autonomous devices.</p>
<p>Explainability in AI/ML must become more advanced, because this is our link to accountability. Autonomous devices must be able to account for why they took a certain action in a human-understandable way.</p>
 Final thoughts 
<p>Autonomous devices hold great promise for a digitally transformed organization and world. However, using autonomous devices as a means to become “digitally transformed” is shortsighted.</p>
<p>Technology should never be implemented for its own sake, but because it is clearly the best way to address the gaps and business needs of your organization. Rather, begin by assessing how your business will best survive and compete in a changing world – the IT side as well as the business model side. By creating a structured plan towards digital transformation and taking necessary initial steps like establishing <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/guest/creating-an-innovative-identity-fabric-structure">an identity fabric</a>, your organization can support the integration of autonomous vehicles into daily processes.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and today, in this episode, we’re going to talk about identity and also identity and access management, what is happening in the UK government and also in the public sector of this part of the world. So, for that, we have a very special guest.</p>
<p>Richard Slater started writing code on a second hand ZX Spectrum before he was 10. Today, Richard works as Head of Managed Services at Amido, a London-based start-up working on identity and microservices projects for some of the largest companies in the UK. He lives and breathes DevOps, which means he is a vocal proponent of best practices for software development teams focusing on continuous-deployment, systems thinking, reducing feedback cycles, configuration-management, infrastructure-as-a-code and of course, cyber security.</p>
<p>Hello, Richard.</p>
<p>Richard Slater: Hello, Oscar. Thank you for inviting me on.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure having you Richard and well, let’s start talking about, let’s talk about digital identity. So first of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, if you can tell us about yourself, and especially your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Richard: Sure, yeah. So, over the course of the last, I don’t know, 20 odd years in the IT industry, I’ve kind of written my fair share of login pages. At one point in time, I was a dotnet developer, before that, I was a systems administrator. So that kind of gave me interaction with enterprise IdAM solutions, like Active Directory. But then also, as a developer, you know, consumer IdAM, from the point of view of login pages are required for the vast majority of applications that I’ve ever written in my time.</p>
<p>And then about 10 years ago, I joined Amido, and had the opportunity to deliver over that time, about half a dozen identity platforms for kind of big and small companies, both public and private sector. And then I started to move my career over time much more towards the cybersecurity side, and really enjoy the kind of IdAM side of it. And that kind of led me into cybersecurity.</p>
<p>However, I then really realised that cybersecurity was the thing that kind of got left behind in DevOps. And actually, that’s the area where the innovation needs to happen to really kind of change the world, change the way that we approach IT, including IdAM, including cybersecurity in general, and kind of shift left on that thinking. And IdAM is a huge part of that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. Yes, as I read from your bio I found on Stack Overflow, yeah, you said, you live and breathe DevOps. And of course, yes, security, cybersecurity is something that is super important there. So, thank you for sharing your interesting story.</p>
<p>We’d like to hear you and Amido who are working very tightly in the UK, of course, I’d like to hear what’s the latest development in the UK government’s identity strategy?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, absolutely. So, I think we’re probably at a point now where most people have realised that GOV.UK Verify is starting to kind of wane a bit, it’s starting to sunset, so that it’s starting to become old news. And in its place, there is various kind of proposals floating around.</p>
<p>However, predominantly, what we’ve seen is our DCMS, Department of Digital Culture, Media and Sport, really been pushing this idea of a trust framework. And they’ve had a couple of public consultations on it so far. It’s just a really interesting approach. It’s a really kind of innovative way of looking at identity from a government perspective, in a way that enables privacy, but also creates that rich ecosystem of identity solutions.</p>
<p>And it’s been adopted elsewhere. And it’s still in its infancy. I know, Canada is a little bit ahead. The UK, and there’s a couple of other Commonwealth countries like Australia and New Zealand, who have been trying to approach government identity in a way that is less tied to being a single identity for a department and then having a different identity entirely for a different department actually creating an ecosystem.</p>
<p>And the real key to these trust frameworks being decentralised is that it comes into kind of flavours as it were. You have the identity providers, so the people that say, “You are who you say you are.” And those identity providers could fundamentally be anyone. So, it could be the NHS that say you are this person, you have this this NHS number which represents who you are. We’ve done the identity verification for you and thus, you can use an NHS identity to be able to access other non-NHS services.</p>
<p>Equally, it could be the home office that say that you’re a naturalised resident, or that you’re a British citizen. It could be even as far as you know, if you’ve got somebody coming in from- temporarily into the UK. It may be that it’s the foreign office that’s able to provide them an identity that demonstrates the fact that they are that person.</p>
<p>But the other side of the equation really comes down to what are called attributes. And those attributes allow individual government departments, and potentially private sector as well, to be able to kind of enrich that identity, and do it in such a way that it can mask the kind of personal data that can sometimes be encoded in identity.</p>
<p>So, a really good example of that one, if, for example, you were to go into a bar or a pub. At the moment, you have to show somebody some form of photo ID, so it might be a passport, it might be a driving license. And obviously on that it’s got your passport number, your driving license number, your date of birth, potentially your address on it as well. So, you’re sharing a lot more data than you really need to share. All they need to know is your date of birth. And even then, they don’t really need to know your date of birth, what they need to know is, are you legally entitled to buy alcohol in the UK? And for us, that means it’s 18.</p>
<p>And really, you know, what you’re able to do with attributes is create a digital identity that is able to be enriched, so you can present that digital identity. It might be through an app, it might even be through an actual physical ID card with a chip on it, that will then allow the establishment to go, “Is this person allowed to buy alcohol? Are they over 18?” And ask those questions.</p>
<p>Now, the really interesting thing is, is what the government’s doing here is they’re not trying to tell industry how to implement this. They’re trying to create a framework for trust, which is why they call it a trust framework. What they want is they want to go, “Here is the standard. Here is the approach. This is how we secure it. This is broadly, semantically how it’s going to work.”</p>
<p>Now, industry bring products to market that enable us to turn this from something that is essentially a white paper, into a product that enables government identity in a distributed manner. I think it’s a really exciting time because it helps to balance the privacy aspects of identity with the need to actually not have multiple identities.</p>
<p>I mean, I have probably 30 different government-based identity accounts just because I’m a British citizen. I’ve got accounts with the NHS, I’ve got accounts with the passport office, I’ve got accounts with the drive– DVLA. They’re all completely separate from each other. But what this trust framework promises and really, I hope it’s something that can be brought to bear is actually building out that system that means I only really need to have one true identity and all the other attributes are able to be added by the relevant parties.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, a trust framework would solve this problem, as you said, dozens of identities you have from some public service institutions in the UK. So, you said that there’s one organisation that is already leading in creation on that trust framework in the UK.</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah. So DCMS is being kind of charged with actually bringing this to bear, they have overall responsibility for both digital policy and cybersecurity policy. In the UK, they’re the organisation that sets policy for the Information Commissioner’s Office. So that’s kind of backing off into GDPR, and other privacy laws.</p>
<p>So really, these are the people, this is the government department that is fundamentally there to drive forward the digital agenda in the UK. And their role is really to help define what that’s going to look like. And then allow other government departments to start working with industry partners to be able to deliver an identity platform that meets this specification.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, we expect to see in the near future results, a more unified identity verification service in the UK. But something that every single public sector organisation, they also have to deal with IAM in their way based on their own needs. So, if you can tell us about – in general public sector organisation, how they should be approaching IAM from this year 2022.</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, definitely. So, you’re right, it’s great to talk about what’s in the future, but we are a good few years off having anything even in kind of an alpha or a beta stage that was going to be using the trust framework. IAM is not going to go away. It is something that is fundamentally necessary to be able to deliver a product and deliver it securely. So, you’re right, companies need to be looking at this- companies and departments need to be looking at this in 2022.</p>
<p>Amido are a cloud-native consultancy, you know, I kind of want to call that out o maybe I’m a little bit biased here. But the answer for me is really is it’s got to be on cloud. We’ve actually had a number of clients recently, I can’t mention them, unfortunately, who have come to us and asked us, after we built their cloud platform, you know, in an on-prem world, to help them move it into the cloud.</p>
<p>Cloud-first has been on the Cabinet Office agenda for the last five years, it’s something GDS has been pushing really heavily in the UK. And actually, you get so many benefits from cloud. It’s proven now, there is so many IdAM solutions that have been delivered using IaaS, using past components, that actually we’re starting to see government departments adopting cloud more and more as their predominant mechanism for delivering a service. And so, it’s not going to go away anytime soon.</p>
<p>And you know, as I say, those benefits if you’ve got VMs, on Azure, or AWS, where you’ve got commercial off-the-shelf software, or using SaaS components, it’s a whole lot less work for departments. And in these times of post Coronavirus and recovery – departments, budgets are going to be squeezed and you’re going to have less money to be able to spend on IAM. And that’s really where, you know, adopting the cloud, adopting those best of breed services, you can outsource a lot of their ongoing operational costs to the cloud providers, and focus on delivering that IdAM solution that is specific to your needs.</p>
<p>And, government, public sector, like no other sector has got some very specific needs for IAM. We’ve got one of our clients have to contend with building into the IAM solution a mechanism for identifying conflict and resolution. And like ensuring that segregation of duties is both implemented at the technical level, but also ensuring that there are no conflict of interest between two element, two IAM users in this particular solution.</p>
<p>So, it can be horrifically complicated. But it’s something that actually products are out there on the market, able to support those kinds of rules, those kinds of mechanisms, to protect the privacy of individuals, to ensure that regulatory requirements are being met. Departments need to be focusing on the solutions that are actually going to serve citizens. And by using cloud, you’re just removing all of that kind of underlying, like, let’s look after the VMs, let’s look after the hardware in the data centres, just focus on the actual applications themselves.</p>
<p>And all of the vendors I talked to, we work with vendors across the industry to deliver IdAM for our government clients and private sector clients, everyone has now got some kind of cloud offering. There is absolutely no reason in 2022 to be looking at on-prem environments for hosting IAM. You lose all of the flexibility. You lose all the maintainability aspects of it. Use the vendor’s cloud native offerings to be able to deliver IAM and focus on your kind of unique selling point, the thing that actually delivers value to citizens.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah, it’s interesting to see that now in the beginning of 2022, these public administration organisations are already asking for that, explicitly asking for cloud.</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, given that IAM is core to an organisation’s cybersecurity strategy, how can the public sector ensure that the IAM implementations are successful?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, so this is interesting. So, as an organisation, we counted it up a couple of days ago, and we have delivered 37 IAM platforms over the last five years. And I think really, there are two things that we’ve seen most common, that are mistakes that have been made during an IAM implementation. And the first one is a bit of a weird one, a bit of a curveball. A couple of organisations we work with have left IAM to last. They’ve almost forgotten about IAM, or considered it as not part of a greater whole, you know, IAM you know, it’s a login page.</p>
<p>IAM is so much more than a login page. It may be that’s the first thing that people see. But IAM is actually a much wider solution that enables you to implement your cybersecurity controls, that enables you to grant access, grant privilege, et cetera in the relevant parts of your service. And I think this is a bit of a symptom really of a disconnect between security, compliance and technology.</p>
<p>Security is often not involved early enough. And I don’t necessarily mean a security department, I mean, the concept of security. And in reality, all of those elements are important – security, compliance and technology. Each of the standards, you know, I talked about ISO 27001, or cyber essentials, each of those talks about vital requirements for authentication and authorisation. And security is increasingly leading to adopt that shift left mentality that’s required to be able to ensure that InfoSec is really involved from the beginning.</p>
<p>I have this bit of a saying that what I want for my information security teams, what I want when I’m having a cybersecurity is how do we get to saying, yes, because all too often particularly when security is involved later in the project, the answer ends up being no. Like, no, you can’t go live until you’ve done this, this and this.</p>
<p>What I want to be in a position is at the beginning of a project, having security involved and going, what do you need? What do you need from this solution? What are your fundamental non-functional requirements that mean that you’re going to be able to say yes? What tasks do we need to do? What kind of level of pen testing do we need against this solution? So that when the business wants this to be live, the answer is going to be, “Yes, of course, we’ve been involved all the way through. We’re absolutely happy with this. And we have utter utmost confidence in it.”</p>
<p>And I think what often happens is that organisations, both public and private sector, get caught out that thinking IAM is something somebody else does. It never something somebody else does. Even if there is a pre-existing IAM solution in place, for a government department or for the private sector, then half of the effort is going to be involved in actually integrating that into the application or service that you’re building.</p>
<p>IAM is not something that is purely a case of redirect out somewhere and get back a failed or success message. It involves JWT tokens, it involved claims, it involves actually understanding how the IAM solution works across firewall boundaries, how the IAM solution works in terms of gaining access to privileged information.</p>
<p>In terms of administrator access, how is that working? What happens when somebody is trying to log into your application and the error message isn’t instructive enough to say, this is a problem with the login versus a problem with the application? There’s a lot to think about with IAM, so don’t get caught out. Do not think that IAM is something that somebody else better do for you. Embrace it, and like build it into your thought process from day one, before you even start designing anything, thinking about IAM and actually building that into the kind of wider picture is absolutely key to ensuring that implementation is successful.</p>
<p>And then that is related in many ways. The second mistake I really see is, is IAM not really being embedded in the organisation. We see a lot of organisations that try to implement IAM as a team. So, we have an IAM team, they are responsible for IAM for the organisation. Fundamentally, every application developer, every product owner, every business analyst in an organisation needs to understand the basics of identity, the basics of the OpenID connect protocol, the OAuth 2.0 protocol, because those influence how applications are designed and built.</p>
<p>I would actually say it’s 30% of the time for an IAM team should be dedicated to education and knowledge transfer to people who are outside of the IAM team, and the rest of the organisation. Because actually, those are the people that need to integrate. Those are the people that actually are going to be the relying parties. And those are the actual applications that IAM is there to kind of serve and protect.</p>
<p>And there’s a couple of ways of handling this. I really like the Train the Trainer programmes. When I’m working with client teams, I’m trying to make sure there’s a person in each of those service delivery teams who is the IAM champion. They are the person that has kind of put the time in, they’re talking with the actual IAM delivery team. They’re understanding how it works, what they need to do. And they’re championing that within the project.</p>
<p>Every time the sprint goes round, they’re putting their hand up and going OK, well how is this integrating with IAM? How are we handling the fact that something in the IAM platform is changing? How are we handling the changes in the wider ecosystem? And we’ve got additional claims available to us now. How are we managing that? And actually, having that Train the Trainer programme or that kind of subject matter expert embedded in the team is really important.</p>
<p>But then also, you know, it’s increasingly important to have really good training materials. As I record a lot of videos, half of the reason I’ve got a decent microphone and camera is I record videos, I’ll stand there in front of the camera and I will talk about IAM for our clients so that they have material that they can put into their Confluence or their SharePoint or their LMS to be able to educate people on how to interact with IAM as an application developer.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that is very powerful, what you have just said about training, the Train the Trainer, or just the fact of making sure there is a champion in the organisation and the customer will keep… yeah, training and educating about IAM across several functions. So that’s definitely, definitely a great idea. And I see – it came out you are doing this constantly for a while already. And your first point was that organisations leave IAM to the last. So yeah, it’s…</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, never leave IAM to last. We have had a couple of opportunities where we have gone into a client to talk about IAM, only to discover that actually it was forgotten about. It was not included in the project plan. And actually, the work has already started on application services. And really just getting to a point where realising that there needs to be a lot of thought to go into IAM right at the beginning, do not leave it to last. It is so important to actually think about IAM from day zero, and build it out as part of your wider technical strategy.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. And also, as you said, identity management systems are touching very different also roles in the organisations. What about one that the users will feel directly is the user interface, user experience. So, what about the user experience in government identity systems, how is the sector’s approach to UX? How is it changing? What is the direction it’s heading now?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, so this is a really interesting one. There’s a GIF floating around that we have in our company Slack, which is essentially is a cat going through a gap in a door. And successively over time that this gap gets smaller and smaller. And the labelling around it is around security controls. And the very last section of the GIF, it says ISO 27001, where the gap is maybe about three centimetres wide, and the cat just jumps over the door, just goes straight over it. And that’s a fundamental problem.</p>
<p>If you make things so hard to use, people will find their way around it. People are intelligent, people are innovative, if you make it difficult, it’s going to be the last thing somebody is going to want to do. And that really, I think is something that has been influencing IAM over the course of the last five years.</p>
<p>And what we’re seeing is it moving from being a fairly cumbersome kind of login system, as it might have been termed, into a heavily researched, well understood ecosystem of user design principles that enables IAM to really kind of get out the way. I mean, for the most part, IAM is going to be something to an end user that should be transparent. In an ideal world, then you would be able to use authentication mechanisms that don’t require people to remember usernames and passwords.</p>
<p>We’re not quite there yet. I think we will get to a point where actually, that kind of transparent sign in model is going to be secure and it’s going to be friendly to end users. But in the meantime, what most departments are focusing on is the research. Use UX professionals to research into how people use the IAM solution, how people interact with it. Not just from the point of login and registration, but also from the point of how do I make this more secure? How can I implement multifactor authentication or passwordless login? Or, how do I reset a password in a secure and efficient way? Sending PIN codes out in the post, whilst incredibly secure and gives a high level of assurance that that address still matches that person and so there’s a good degree of confidence, it’s a very slow process and it’s not helpful if you’re trying to get something done quickly.</p>
<p>So, actually building those flows based upon research, based upon evidence that this is the majority of the system the population are able to use it. This is particularly important for government departments, because unlike private sector, rather, where you can say I have a demographic, you know, one of our clients is ASOS and so they have a very clear demographic graphic, it tends to be young. So, you can make the assumption there that all of them will have a smartphone, and probably a fairly good smartphone. All of them will be very kind of used to using touchscreens and used to using the internet.</p>
<p>When you’re dealing with a government department, you can’t make any of those assumptions, because the vast majority of departments have to deal with a citizen from either birth or, you know, entering into adulthood all the way through to later life. So, you can’t make the assumption that, you know, I can just test it with a small group of people who are in my demographic. You have to understand it from all aspects.</p>
<p>And equally, the vast majority of the particular governments in the UK need to deal with multiple cultures. London is such a cosmopolitan place. But most of the UK is, if you look at Manchester, you look at Birmingham, there are people with English not as their first language, you have got people coming in from very different cultures, either from abroad or just from community cultures within the UK. So, you can’t make the assumption that, you know, a small group of people is actually going to be representative of your actual end users.</p>
<p>So really kind of doing the research and thoroughly kind of getting into a representative example of all of the people that are going to be using your service, the alphas in front of them, the code base in front of them, or even you know, we’re a huge fan of coffee shop testing. So literally just drawn mock-ups really of a service, and actually go to people and go into a coffee shop and go, “Can I buy you a coffee and show you how I think this is going to work? I’d really like to get your feedback on how easy this might be to use, what you’d like to see done instead, you know, what do you not like about this? What do you like about this?</p>
<p>It’s really important to really get into the heads of citizens to understand like what they actually need from an IAM solution and the wider solution, but particularly from there, how do we get IAM out of the way. And it’s something that that I say with my InfoSec teams, is fundamentally we need to be making the right thing to do, the easiest thing to do. So, it’s the absolute antithesis of that cat jumping over the door. It’s trying to make it so actually going through the door, following the rules, following the controls, implementing the controls is by far and above easiest thing to do, rather than having to try and kind of circumvent it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very, very good. You say in a visual way, visual language way with the cat and the door. But yeah, excellent. The key is, as you said, is to do serious research to have success in UX, in user experience. Yeah, so it’s very, very enlightening. Everything you have been sharing about IAM, I can see you also breathe, not only DevOps, you breathe IAM. I can feel it.</p>
<p>A final question for you will be, for all business leaders who are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Richard: Yeah, this for me has got to come down to shift left thinking. So, I’ve talked a little bit about shift left in cybersecurity, but it applies to absolutely everything, so user experience research, cybersecurity compliance. If these are not things that are being thought about at a project level or at a product level from day zero, then they can be shifted left.</p>
<p>The sooner we kind of embrace the fact that we’re part of an ecosystem whereby lots of people are going to get involved in a project and involve those people from day zero onwards, the more effective those products are going to be and the lower risk there is going to be in delivering those proposed projects and products. So really, for me, it’s that if cybersecurity or user experience or compliance is not involved in day one, what one thing can you do this year to move that to the left, to get it in as close to zero as possible?</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Richard for sharing all these super interesting things about not only UK but actually also in not only UK, not only public sector, but many of the things you have also shared with us are valuable for any project that requires identity and access management.</p>
<p>Richard: My pleasure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us how people can learn more about you, get in touch with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Richard: Yes, so I am on the vast majority of social networks, so you feel free to reach out to me I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devopsrichard/">DevOps Richard on LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/richardslater">Richard Slater on Twitter</a>.

 Covid-19 has highlighted the systemic vulnerabilities in the Swedish and planetary food systems, while creating the political economy for deep transformation. This paper seeks to outline the increasingly critical relationship between food and the healthy development of our minds and bodies, and therefore the future prosperity of our economies and societies. <p>Covid-19 is increasingly forcing us to recognise that food plays a central role in the human health defense systems <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453020301890">[1]</a>. Yet our health treatment systems are trailing behind, with nutrition left out of governments’ key recommendations announced during the Covid-19 pandemic [image&nbsp;1].</p>Image 1: general recommendations by the public health authority during&nbsp;Covid-19<p>For society as a whole to become resilient and healthy, it appears crucial to recognise the effects of food’s regenerative potential and its capacity for systemic prevention of illness and the avoidance of societal harm. However, to enable this, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, researchers and civil society need to actively start redesigning the systems and institutional infrastructures around our food systems and address deep societal lock-ins.</p><p>We recognise these are easy sentences to write and that a true transformation will require fundamental new models of change and innovations at the systemic level. Even if the evidence for the necessity of a shift is clear, what is needed to address its deep rooted challenges, currently preventing a shift to happen, is less&nbsp;clear.</p> Evidence for the relationship between food and the human mind and&nbsp;body <p>Evidence exists for the multiple ways in which food and health are interconnected.</p><p>Today there is evidence for the negative human and financial impact of health-depriving foods. For example, today’s obesity epidemic cost Sweden SEK70 billion every year <a href="https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/livsvillkor-levnadsvanor/fysisk-aktivitet-och-matvanor/overvikt-och-fetma/#:~:text=Baserat%20p%C3%A5%20att%20drygt%20en,f%C3%B6r%20individen%20och%20f%C3%B6r%20samh%C3%A4llet.">[2]</a>, type 2 diabetes cost SEK18 billion <a href="https://ihe.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IHE-Rapport_2015_1.pdf">[3]</a> and heart and lung diseases cost SEK60 billion<a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/e8gvzq1fwq00/412SVQCzTi6JmXv6rmY15y/336a3ff35c595fe9f9a816aaebeff06b/IHE_Rapport_2021.pdf">[4]</a> (these costs have significant overlap and can not be directly added together as one sum), compared to the total budget for health care, which 2020 was SEK102 billion <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/sveriges-regering/finansdepartementet/statens-budget/statens-budget-i-siffror/">[5]</a>.

There is no single answer or magic bullet, rather there are multiple factors as to why this is not not yet happening at the scale and speed necessary. It is crucial to take a systems perspective in analysis of this challenge and consider the root causes of the symptoms made visible in society by the Covid-19 pandemic. These root causes impact both physical infrastructures and the metabolic flows of food systems e.g. the logistics of water, energy, nutrients, fertilizers, seeds, waste,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Interventions to address these root causes would need to sit across multiple layers such&nbsp;as:</p>  Culture and language, ex. new nordic&nbsp;cuisine  Capacities, capabilities and competencies, ex. labs and mentor&nbsp;programs  Monitoring and evaluation, ex. beyond GDP initiatives and sustainability reporting  Standards and guidelines, ex. organic farming standards and national&nbsp;goals  Policy making, ex. preventative care strategies  Financing, ex. public procurement models for school and hospital&nbsp;meals  Law, ex. regulatory sandboxes and parametric law  <p>Based on interviews conducted in the Rapid Transition Lab (including a doctor focused on functional medicine, a nurse at a cancer treatment clinic, a nutritionist and two health coaches) and additional desk-top research, there appears to be three critical challenges to consider:</p>  Pricing and accounting of food is struggling to consider its regenerative potential nor the negative externalities created through its production and consumption,  Food lobbying (e.g. around what can be called milk <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8384/sweden-milk-war-oatly">[30]</a>), misleading marketing campaigns and labelling of food <a href="https://annfernholm.se/2022/01/07/hemmakvall-inleder-aret-med-vilseledande-reklam/">[31]</a> is making it hard for consumers to navigate the impact of the items displayed on the supermarket shelves and online stores’ interfaces,  Disconnect between the food and pharmaceutical industries. Food companies are trying to make money through the system challenged by what is described above and pharmaceutical companies by selling patented drugs. This is minimizing the funds available for research into diet’s role in medical treatment, prevention and regeneration.  <p>When looking closer at the food system’s incentive structures it becomes clear that ingredients triggering the brain to want more <a href="https://www.bokus.com/bok/9789113116389/halsosegrar-den-vetenskapliga-vagen-till-ett-friskare-liv/">[32]</a>, for example sugar, salt, saturated fats, or all three combined <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117959">[33]</a>, becomes a desirable for anyone trying to make a quick profit from food. Unfortunately, these items tend to give no or minimal support to the five health defense systems, and over time, large consumption of such products can even harm them [<a href="https://2heal.se/om-oss/">34</a> interview with Anette Lindquist]. Today this reality is not being reflected in the cost of the production nor the price for the consumers. It seems to be that the pricing and the accounting systems are not designed for people’s, nor the planet’s, regenerative health.</p><p>If consumes like to make better choices by themselves, the words, colours, and symbols on the wrapping of ingredients are often misleading <a href="https://foodpharmacyco.com/category/ann-fernholm-en/">[35]</a>; creating cascading effects at societal scale. What is more, people are bombarded with commercials about cheap prices on traditional and social media channels, putting the focus on price over quality [<a href="https://www.johannescullberg.com/">36</a> interview with <a href="https://www.johannescullberg.com/">Johannes Cullberg</a>]. It appears, therefore, that the negative freedom enjoyed by food companies to use certain language and imagery when marketing food is actually diminishing people’s positive freedom to enjoy healthy lives and consequently creating increased liabilities for future generations <a href="https://obgyn.duke.edu/about/our-faculty/susan-kay-murphy-phd">[37]</a>.</p><p>The last structural challenge (mentioned in this blog) is the lack of high-quality and large-scale research into the relationship between diet, healing, prevention, and regeneration. Today, large clinical studies, necessary to change treatment recommendations <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[38]</a>, are almost always sponsored or entirely paid for by pharmaceutical companies <a href="https://www.tidningencurie.se/nyheter/2016/03/02/trovardigheten-hotas-av-bestallda-studier/#:~:text=L%C3%A4kemedelsbranschen%20i%20Sverige%20satsar%20%C3%A5rligen,samarbete%20med%20akademi%20och%20sjukv%C3%A5rd.">[39]</a>. They have little reason to prove that for example, cranberries can be used in cancer treatment <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039576/">[40]</a>, as they can not write a patent for cranberries. Therefore, there are very few large and high-quality clinical studies made to show foods’ regenerative role in society <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[41]</a>. In Sweden, this means that governments and doctors have too little evidence to back up detailed recommendations about using food in prevention and treatment. Without the necessary investment into this area of research, the necessary change will be very difficult to accomplish.</p><p>To ensure resilience in society it is therefore critical to create the incentives for researchers, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, and individuals to become a part of a new transitional system that enables food to play a regenerative role in building society’s capacity to&nbsp;heal.</p> Enabling the transformation <p>Multiple entangled interventions will be necessary to transform the current scenario, requiring the involvement of actors from across the food and health care systems, national, regional, and municipal governments, research institutions, and civil society. To start a conversation with these actor groups, four propositions, addressing the three main challenge areas (described above), have been made and outlined as ‘what if…’ statements below. We invite you to engage with them together with us, exploring why or why not these could help to drive the change necessary.</p> (1) Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods <p>Increasingly food and our food systems have been optimized from a production costs and supply side optimisation perspective. This reality has supported the massive reduction in the cost of food and calories over the last 18 years <a href="https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/">[42]</a>, while off loading increasingly significant societal costs. These liabilities include, as earlier described, the impacts of sugary, fatty and salty food items and the loss of nutrition dense foods on 1) sick leave costs, 2) life style driven health care costs and 3) opportunity costs; in terms of the cognitive capacity of society as whole. This is not including the food systems’ impact on the environment, such as GHG emissions <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2021-389/">[43]</a>, biodiversity loss <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[44]</a>and soil erosion <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[45]</a> — to name a few. Today these outcomes are almost always ignored when food is being&nbsp;priced.</p><p>What if the societal and environmental costs generated throughout the supply chain of food had to be considered and paid into an autonomous self-balancing system, held by a public good trust, which simultaneously cross finances and balances different parts of the food economy that create societal value? The externalities that are generated throughout the food value chain would be considered at each level, from farmers to producers to distributors, to create a true value market inclusive of future societal liabilities and assets. The cost of negative externalities, and the value of positive externalities, would be standardised and decided collectively yet self determined by the actors involved when pricing their products — for example a farmer when selling their cabbage, a manufacturer when selling their cabbage&nbsp;crisps.</p><p>What if this balancing system even considered how different people are impacted by different foods?</p>Image 2: Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods<p>Such a system would seek to shift the incentives in the current food system and encourage consumers to buy those foods that are benefiting their health defense systems and the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>As farmers and producers would need to evidence their self-set prices (through verifying externalities generated) they are incentivized to both continuously self-evaluate their practices and continuously improve them as means to reduce liability costs and increase competitiveness under the new market and price&nbsp;logics.</p><p>This systemic realignment of our food system and incentives to societal outcomes as opposed to capital optimisation is&nbsp;vital.</p><p>Some actors are already testing new logics to pricing food. Felix Climate Store <a href="https://webershandwick.eu/our-work/felix-the-climate-store/">[46]</a> is one example and in our interview with them, we understood that when they based their prices on a product’s CO2 emissions, items that usually never get left on the shelves became harder to sell, for example, their classic frozen meatballs.</p><p>In order to increase the complexity of the pricing beyond CO2 emissions and look at multiple outcomes at the same time (suggested by the what if… statement above) would require highly-complex information infrastructures. Companies would need to be able to combine different types of data (public, private, sometimes personal) in order to build real-time and context based pricing models. This might not be a 1st horizon scenario, however, with the technology at hand today, this could become possible over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Still there are multiple important questions to ask before moving forward with such an idea. For example, who decides what positive and negative outcomes are and for who? Considering the development of accuracy in measurement, how would the system tackle discrepancies in externalities estimated and measured e.g. would there be retrospective adjustments, if so who would hold the risk for that, would bespoke insurance products be needed? What would be required in terms of labelling, displaying and packaging of foods? What would be asked of the individual to navigate this system? What research would be needed to cover current knowledge gaps about how different food impacts people differently? recommendations? And the list could go&nbsp;on.</p> (2) Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food <p>Many decisions in today’s economy are informed by the reports created by accountants. Still, the existing accounting systems are struggling, similar to the pricing models, to account for the spillover liabilities and assets created in the wider system. Instead accountants are concentrated on the economic costs and revenues of one specific entity, in order to put a number at the end of the balance sheet. This is creating a simplified picture of the complex value flows generated by the supply chain of food and the systemic discounting of externalities (this is not only an issue within the food system&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">[47]</a>).</p><p>What if the accounting systems and accountability structures were able to account for the entangled values and liabilities created by food and include the many co-beneficiaries impacted? By combining new accounting practices and monitoring systems (making sense of the outcomes created) new lines could be added to the balance sheet. Maybe even items that do not directly impact the entity concerned? This would paint a different picture for companies to consider when making decisions.</p>Image 3: Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food<p>Such a shift would create incentives to consider the entangled values and liabilities generated throughout the supply chain when choosing, for example, what crops to grow, as well as how to grow&nbsp;them.</p><p>The new sustainability reporting requirements <a href="https://www.icaew.com/insights/viewpoints-on-the-news/2021/nov-2021/new-sustainability-standards-board-targets-globally-comparable-reporting">[48]</a> are an important step in this direction, as companies are being asked to report their social and environmental impact. However, until these impacts are visible on the balance sheet, we may not see enough change as urgently necessary [49]. Visibility would influence a companies’ ability to raise capital, and the cost of that capital, it would also influence the insurance premiums needed. Equally, it would make it more transparent for customers how a certain company operates.</p><p>At the same time as this shift seems important, it can not be discussed without mentioning the risk of trying to put a number on social and environmental impacts. What sort of design decisions would be needed to be taken in order to calculate this, for example what impacts, over what time-span — and who would take these decisions? For example, how would the interests of non-human actors and future generations be taken into account, and what would happen in situations where a balancing between interests would be needed? What new capabilities, skills and professional training would be needed in order to develop this system? And, as this would also require highly-complex information infrastructures, when could this be made possible?</p> (3) Taxonomy for regenerative food <p>Today the marketing and labeling of food is often done through culturally associated claims, such as clean, all natural, real fruit, happy cows, independent family farmers, humane and environmentally responsible products, naturally sweet and the list could go on. The ambition is to create a cultural wrapper around food which overwhelms its actual nutritional value and associated regulatory requirements, to enable us to believe a product is good and healthy for us/or the planet, without the associative evidence or&nbsp;reality.</p><p>It is becoming clear that this cultural taxonomy of food has been massively exploited for the intentional or the unintentional misdirection of informed&nbsp;choices.</p><p>What if there was a new evidence-based-claims requirement for the taxonomy for regenerative food? Instead of only addressing the words regenerative and food, this could include a whole series of different words and sentences. Let us walk through an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Imagine a new food product is being placed into the market. The producer would in this case be required to make a self-declarative impact model of the product’s impact on different people, society and the environment. Based on this open model, they would be permitted (or not) to make a portfolio of self-declarative claims, such as this product will improve your immune system or the local soil quality. The portfolio of claims could then be structured as a sign that this is a regenerative food, if, for example, the model shows sustainable input, positive societal outcomes and low externality/positive externality process.</p><p>These claims would need to acknowledge the situational variance, i.e different foods have differential impacts on different people, at different times and different foods have different impacts on soils and ecosystems in different climates. This would mean that the portfolio of claims shifts depending on who the buyer is and when the purchase is being&nbsp;made</p><p>Similarly, what if products which are systemically degenerative would be required to label their regressive impacts similar to cigarettes?</p>Image 4: Taxonomy for regenerative food<p>Such a taxonomy would, beyond helping customers navigate different options, create the incentives for food actors to monitor the impact of their businesses. This would increase the awareness of externalities created in the system and potentially encourage improvements to be made. The evidence would need to consider the entire supply chain and could further inform new collaborations across the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Äkta Vara is an existing customer owned organisation trying to address issues with food labeling and marketing using campaigns and their Ä-mark <a href="https://www.aktavara.org/">[50]</a>. They are making it more transparent what a product contains, or maybe rather what it does not contain. Another example is kliMAT, allowing customers to scan items and find out their climate footprint <a href="https://klimatappen.se/">[51]</a>. While both of these examples help the customer to navigate the shelves of a food store, neither creates a framework for how to name and market. Currently this is regulated by the EU-taxonomy <a href="https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/foretagande-regler-kontroll/regler-for-livsmedelsforetag/information-markning-och-pastaenden">[52]</a>, which is not able to address the complexity of impacts in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>While this “EU Taxonomy 2.0” for regenerative food could improve the current situation, it is important to note that the marketing of food is still likely to be miss-leading; mostly due to the difficulty of ensuring quality of evidence, and therefore verifying, claims. This is not necessarily due to intentional misleading of customers, but rather because a food item’s impact is dependant on the entire supply chain, which is entangled with many other systems. Any generalization, therefore, becomes hard to make, without an over simplification. This requires us to ask how to create the necessary information infrastructures to evidence claims uniformly and while allowing actors to make sense of their specific&nbsp;impacts?</p> (4) Invest in evidencing <p>Today there is a funding gap for research about food’s impact on the body <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[53]</a>. As stated earlier in this article, the main root cause of this is the disconnect between the food and pharma industries and the lack of incentives to prove that food can be regenerative.</p><p>What if the self-balancing pricing system was used as a seed fund, matching public and private investment into research to evidence food’s impact on the body and mind? This research would be necessary to make the earlier suggested pricing, accounting and taxonomy models work and could encourage private and public bodies to raise their investments.</p>Image 5: Invest in evidencing<p>Once there is enough evidence to make the new models function, there would be clear incentives for private companies and public bodies to keep investing in this area of research (as it would help them prove what their impact on society and environment is).</p><p>The increased understanding of food’s impact on mind and body would not only enable the new incentive models, it would further help the health care system navigate how to use food in prevention and treatment. When a next pandemic arrives, governments may even know what diet to recommend populations to eat in order to help their health defence systems to stand up against the&nbsp;disease.</p><p>Kostfonden is a fund that is already trying to address the current funding issue. They are particularly targeting food’s role in treatment <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/">[54]</a>. However, it is not enough and it will be important to better understand diets’ role in personalised prevention and regeneration (personalised food is a growing area within the food sector and will need to be explored by&nbsp;itself).</p><p>However, before the investments are pooled, the suggested funding model would need to carefully consider its governance structures. What is the decision-making architecture for deciding who, or what, gets funding? There are already issues with food lobbying in research related to food <a href="https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/fejkmaten-9789127173583?affId=2939453&amp;utm_source=tradedoubler&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=annfernholm.se&amp;tduid=bccf80942c42f1cd13ce74f0a5b55ac9">[55]</a>, how can this be an opportunity to ensure that the research is done for public good? Equally, how can the fund ensure long-term sustainability for researchers while leaving space for the inherited uncertainty in the process? What would the Intellectual property requirements be for research to avoid recreating many of the ills and perverse incentives of our current food&nbsp;system?</p><p>Lastly, how can the insights and results generated from the research become radically legible for people across food and health care systems, different layers of governments as well as individuals? And who is responsible for these translations?</p><p>Combined, these four “what if…” statements, could, if realised with careful consideration, have transformative potential and ensure that food’s regenerative ability is seriously considered throughout its supply chains. However, these suggestions are not enough and it will be crucial to identify additional intervention points moving&nbsp;forward.</p>Image 6: Provocation ecosystem<p>Therefore, in the coming months, we will continue exploring the questions and ideas raised in this blog together with different stakeholders.

				  “I can’t think of anything I’ve done that I’ve been more proud of.”  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Learning new skills in a new industry and technology is always good for growth, both personally and professionally. It’s particularly important for those in college to be able dip their toes into different worlds off campus and get a sense of the kind of work they want—or don’t want—to pursue in life.</p>
<p>Indicio is committed to finding and cultivating the next generation of technical and business professionals through our part time associates program. Associates work side-by-side with experienced staff on all our key projects. It’s an intense learning experience with a ton of opportunities to learn new skills and take on responsibilities. Our unique position as an early-stage startup, there is so much to do and our associates quickly get to see the impact of their work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for new associates to be given a crash course on decentralized identity, maybe some relevant exercises to bring them up to speed, and then have them working on client projects within a week or two of accepting an offer. The team is, of course, always behind them to help with the quick transition and any questions they might have, but we believe our associates have what it takes to fix any problems a client may experience, and to interact with them to ensure our reputation for customer satisfaction at every step of the way.</p>
<p>Specifically this year saw the implementation of a more structured 90-day review and mentorship program that we are particularly excited about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While mentorship programs are fairly common, at Indicio we don’t require our associates to stay inside their team, and in fact we encourage them to experience other parts of the business. An associate on the technical team might have a mentor in finance to give them a more well rounded view of the business and help with their career development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hold 90-day reviews so associates and their managers can&nbsp; mark progress towards more long term goals and provide&nbsp; a chance for the associate to both receive and give feedback on the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What former Indicio associates say about their experience</p>
<p>“The associate program at Indicio has been great for me. I got the position while I was still in school, and I was able to work while I finished my degree. When I started, I only knew javascript and I’d never worked on a mobile app before. I learned React Native on the job, and now I work on apps every day. After school, I went from associate to full-time without missing a beat, so the Indicio associate program totally jump started my career.” — Sean Jensen, Mobile Software Engineer, Indicio, former associate</p>
<p>“I’ve appreciated the balance of challenge and support I’ve received as an Indicio associate. I’ve been able to work on client projects, take ownership of my tasks, learn new technical skills, and more with the help of a mentor and a team who is happy to answer questions and help out with issues.” — Char Howland, Software Engineer, Indicio, former associate</p>
<p>“My associate experience at Indicio has been phenomenal. Initially, I was a little nervous; this was my first time programming for work, rather than just for school. Beyond that, it was my first “office job,” and my first time working from home. A few weeks into the program, after I’d gone through the orientation and trainings, I was given what turned out to be my favorite project I’ve ever worked on. Without going into too much detail, I was given a very basic structure and some project requirements, and was told to get to work. Of course, the team was super willing to offer help and guidance when I ran into snags, but in large part, I was given responsibility for the project. I’ve been working on that project as time permits ever since, and there’s always more to polish and update with it, but the bulk of the project is functional and working smoothly. I can’t think of anything I’ve done that I’ve been more proud of.” — Micah Peltier, Software Engineer Associate</p>
<p>In the coming year, we’ll be running more events for associates, so they can get to know each other better outside of client projects; we’ll be providing more professional development, so that we can help associates structure and progress in their careers; and, critically, we’ll be giving them the time to find, develop, and work on a passion projects.</p>

<p>Ontario, and Canada as a whole, is seeing a transformation when it comes to betting and iGaming, with a bill being passed in 2021, removing the prohibition of single-game betting in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bill (C-218) was a milestone change for gambling in Canada, with single-game betting opening up a ton of markets that were previously unavailable in the country. Regulation is still, however, down to each province and Ontario is looking to welcome iGaming and betting with open arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ontario’s government acted quickly after the bill was passed, creating a new body to contact and manage iGaming in Ontario, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/igaming-ontario-igo/">iGaming Ontario (iGO)</a>. This body serves as a subsidiary of an existing regulatory body, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/alcohol-gaming-commission-ontario-agco/">the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO)</a>, with the two working together to ensure a safe and open gaming market within the province.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, operators are readying to enter what could be a very promising market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What makes Ontario a high-potential iGaming market for European Operators?&nbsp; 



<p>Ontario’s iGaming market is set to be a unique and open one. Managed by iGO and AGCO, there is no limit to the number of operators that can compete in the province, which houses over 15 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early <a href="https://vixio.com/blog/a-new-era-for-online-gambling-in-canada/">VIXIO GamblingCompliance forecasts</a> predict that Ontario’s gambling market could generate over $795 Million in revenue in 2022 and will see rapid growth in the short term, with a forecasted revenue of $1.5 Billion by 2026. These numbers put the province as one of the largest online gambling markets in North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While impressive growth is forecast, that’s not the only benefit for operators. Ontario’s market also features a very competitive annual tax rate of just 20% – one of the lowest in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of all this, Ontario has proven to be a leader when it comes to embracing Canada’s new iGaming market. The province was quick to act following the passing of C-218 and has put out detailed guidelines for operators interested in entering the market, while also working alongside a range of industry leaders to establish responsible regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another keynote is Ontario’s European approach to gambling regulations. We can still expect to see the usual restrictions and regulations. However, unlike in some markets, operators will not be required to cease offshore activities in other Canadian provinces, even after being registered in Ontario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How Ontario’s standards are raising the regulatory bar&nbsp; 



<p>While Ontario looks to be a promising iGaming market, it’s also raising the bar when it comes to regulatory standards. Due to a wide set of rules and regulations, Ontario is being considered a complex market to get into and features a core focus on customer protection. &nbsp;</p>



<p>iGaming Ontario and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario have set out a wide range of rules and regulations which need to be adhered to in order to gain access to the market. This includes and goes beyond standard know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) standards. Specifically, the country is subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This includes things like requiring operators to report suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and step up KYC processes with an onboarding process that includes checking official documents, recent photos, as well as liveness. The AGCO has made available a full list of <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a>, where the full details can be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, Ontario’s iGaming market looks to be a very promising one when it comes to revenue, while also offering a high level of customer protection and strict regulations. If the market proves to succeed as it is forecast to, it could show that stepping up security and customer protection efforts is well worth pursuing and possible while still being profitable. This is especially important in modern times, with regulators all over the globe pushing for stricter gambling rules and regulations. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 How European Gaming Operators can enter Ontario’s iGaming market&nbsp; 



<p>Ontario has introduced a unique method of managing operators within its market. All operators must register directly through the AGCO, and rather than operating individually in Ontario, they will provide their services through a commercial partnership with iGO. This means gaming companies work as private operators on behalf of Ontario’s governing body. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to enter the market, operators must go through an official registration process. This begins with submitting an application through the <a href="https://www.agco.ca/iagco-information">iAGCO</a> portal. It’s a detailed process, which requires operators to submit gaming-related goods and services, gaming website information, and branding details. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there are also comprehensive entity and personal disclosures which require details of both the registrant, as well as associated individuals like parent companies and individuals holding key management or operational roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is, however, more to it than going through the application process. In the long run, operators will need to be fully compliant with Ontario’s evolving rules and regulations. This means being subject to not only iGO’s and the AGCO’s rules and regulations, but also the overarching PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>



 IDnow’s role in easing entry into Ontario’s iGaming market&nbsp; 



<p>Entering Ontario’s iGaming Market will prove to be a sizable challenge for any operator. The wide range and complexity of iGaming requirements in the province mean there is almost a regulatory maze to navigate through to reach compliance. (Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Becoming Compliant in Ontario’s iGaming Market</a>)</p>



<p>All operators will need to meet iGaming Ontario’s and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario’s standards, while also adhering to policies laid out by the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One key issue operators may face is a lacking onboarding process. iGO has set out clear AML and KYC requirements, which exceed even the FINTRAC standards and will require detailed verification, tracking, and data storage systems. You can learn more in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/why-ontarios-igaming-industry-game-changer/">Ontario’s iGaming model ebook</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where IDnow steps in with our verification solutions. IDnow’s AutoIdent is the perfect tool to bolster an operator’s onboarding process as they aim to expand into Ontario’s market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent is fully compliant, fast, and customizable. Using AI-powered technology, it can verify users’ identity in minutes, while remaining fully AML act-compliant. All users need is a mobile phone and AutoIdent guides them through the entire process, this includes Ontario’s and FINTRAC standards, with official document, recent image (selfie), and liveness verification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This International Women’s Day, Revoke is celebrating women in the technology industry, and what better way to do this than with one of our own? Anca is a vital part of the company and works with us as a software developer. Here she is sitting down with Digital Jersey &amp; Skills Jersey, outlining how she started out in this sector:</p>







<p>She also spoke with us to discuss women in the tech industry, and why she made the move over.</p>



 Q: Hi Anca, thanks for sitting down with us to talk women in tech! Could you start off by telling us a little bit about yourself? 



<p>A: Hi, my name is Anca, I am originally from Romania but have been living in the UK for almost 10 years. At first, I lived in Birmingham while studying for my bachelor’s degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management, and once I finished university I moved to Jersey, Channel Islands. I worked in a prestigious 5-star hotel on the island until I decided to change my career and started learning programming.</p>



<p>Long story short: I studied Web Development on my own through online courses and built a portfolio with projects using the latest, most in-demand technologies; in just a few months, I got hired at Revoke where I have been working as a Software Developer for more than 3 years.</p>



<p>During this time, I have learnt a lot, especially on the job, thanks to my amazing colleagues, as well as through additional courses such as the Digital Jersey Coding Course.</p>



<p>I have won a tech award and a Hackathon (second place ), I have become a mentor and a programming teacher for 10-year-olds, and I have recently started to study for a master’s degree in Cyber Security Technology.</p>



 Q: What first sparked your interest in working in the tech industry? 



<p>A: I worked in the hospitality industry for about 5 years, advancing in my career from an internship in a luxurious hotel in Dubai to Events Supervisor and then Assistant Restaurant Manager in Jersey. I was really enjoying the work environment, learning about different cuisines, wines, customer service, the novelty of each day in events, meeting new people, travelling, and making connections.</p>



<p>However, because of the nature of the industry, I was working a lot of hours per week, late nights, as well as all the weekends and holidays and I, was feeling like there was no work-life balance in my job, as well as receiving very little appreciation for my effort and dedication.</p>



<p>Therefore, I started researching other career options and tried a few different things (including opening an online shop) until I eventually came across a great Web Development&nbsp;course online and the <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-for-free">article</a> that Andrei, the course tutor, had written about learning to code and getting hired.</p>



<p>That article was life-changing for me; it described a programmer’s career so well, emphasising on industry growth, the high demand for developers in the future, the need to always learn and stay up to date with technologies, as well as the freedom that comes with a job in IT, for example through the ability to choose where you want to live (since you can find a job anywhere in the world, or work remotely).</p>



 Q: What advice would you give to women just starting out in Software Development? 



<p>A: This is a great time for women to get into the technology industry as everyone is realising the importance of diversity. There is a lot of advice out there for women who are just starting to code, no matter if they have a degree or not. Most of these I’ve heard or read when I started this journey myself and I found them to be very valuable and helpful.</p>



<p>Probably the best advice I got was to&nbsp;not give up in the first couple of months&nbsp;while it feels like climbing “an insurmountable mountain”, to stay strong and keep learning until it all clicks, because it will. If you remember that, then you are halfway there, here are a few more tips that worked for me, to keep you going:</p>



 Make a plan – spend some time planning what you want to learn and in what order, rather than aimlessly following tutorials or reading books. Find out what are the most relevant technologies that will get you hired and aim to learn those. 

<br>If you have a plan, it’s less probable that you will get distracted from your goals or that you will go down a dead end by learning outdated technology. You should start with the basics of how the internet works, how the web integrates with HTML and CSS and reacts to your code, how to use the command line and a suitable text editor, then choose one programming language and stick to it.<br><br>

 Find a mentor or a supporting community, or both – in my opinion, it’s very important to surround yourself with women who have the same goals as you as well as others that you can learn from. Join a coding challenge such as #100daysofcode or Hacktoberfest or a Discord community where you can ask for help, offer help to others, collaborate on projects and many more. <br>

 Ask a lot of questions – once you’ve found a mentor and a supportive community, don’t be afraid to ask lots of questions. I know it sounds like a cliche, but there really isn’t such a thing as a silly question when you are learning to code. Whenever you are stuck on something or there’s something you don’t understand, try to Google it first and if you don’t get an answer to your question, ask your peers. 
<br>

 Be organised! – set some goals for yourself and do your best to achieve them. Give yourself a time-limit to learn HTML and CSS, to build your first website, to complete a module on a course, etc. <br>

 If you have trouble staying focused for a long time, especially when you’re struggling to understand, try using the <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> (You focus on what you’re doing for 25 minutes with no distractions, then take a 5-minute break and repeat the cycle 4 times before taking a longer break) – this was a massive help for me at the start and I am still using it sometimes when I am learning something new, there are many mobile and web apps for it. <br>

 Don’t get stuck on the basics, it will all make sense – when you first learn how to code, you might get stuck trying to memorise basic things such as HTML elements or CSS syntax, but you shouldn’t waste your time on these. <br>

 You should build your first basic website within a couple of days and then move on, as you will always be able to find all the keywords and syntax online when you need them. <br>

 When you get to the actual programming language of your choice, make sure you understand the fundamentals such as data types and structures and variables but don’t waste too much time trying to memorise a certain syntax, you can always Google it later. <br>

 Build a portfolio – this is very important especially if you don’t have a CS degree or any related work experience, since it’s your opportunity to showcase your work to potential employers, to prove what you can do and to show how you have evolved. Having an active GitHub profile where you contribute often to personal and public projects is also a great advantage when applying for junior or mid developer jobs. <br>

 Apply for jobs – if it’s your goal to get hired, start applying for jobs as soon as possible. If you have already 2 or 3 projects in your portfolio, if you have a clear learning path that you are following and if you show that you are motivated to develop further, you might find a company that is willing to take you on and teach/mentor you themselves. Even if you might fail on some interviews, you don’t really have anything to lose, but you will have gained some experience and you know what is expected of you for the next ones. But once you succeed, you will get paid to learn.

<p>Using storytelling to achieve positive social change is Wendy’s passion, as well as helping visionaries to realize their dreams. Concerning technology, Wendy helped launch a new movement for a decentralized, private and secure web that gives control back to its users.</p>



<p>We are happy to share this conversation with Wendy on the occasion of International Women’s Day 2022. Read how her first job taught her the hard way what matters if you want to succeed as a woman in a male-dominated job, and how she would encourage young women to pursue a career in tech or IT. Finally, Wendy shares why she would like to sit down for dinner with Angela Merkel and Michelle Obama. Thank you Wendy for this inspiring conversation! We are glad you do what you do and hope you keep up with the good work to be an inspiration for many more women!</p>



<p>What was your first job, and what did it teach you?</p>



<p>My first job was as a reporter-researcher for TIME Magazine in New York. It was the 80s and the organization was very hierarchical and dominated by men. Women were pretty much segregated into support roles and no woman had ever risen to a senior editorial position. It was eye-opening! After coming from school which felt more egalitarian, the work world was a rude awakening. It taught me that the world would not be a meritocracy and to succeed I would need to break a lot of entrenched, unconscious patterns of promotion and advancement.</p>



<p>Do you have a female rolemodel?</p>



<p>Both my best and my worst boss ever have both been women. At the positive end of the scale, women have been nurturing, honest, and willing to invest in my growth—not for the sake of the organization, but for my sake.</p>



<p>How can we encourage more women to pursue senior leadership roles in their careers?</p>



<p>At one company, my female CEO invited three women department heads to lunch at her house. It was a lovely lunch and I remember one piece of advice she gave us that day: don’t ever wait for your boss to offer you a raise or promotion again. If you want it, you have to ask for it. All three of us had been promoted or offered raises by this CEO, but none of us had gone to her to request it. Why? We were scared of being turned down. It’s important to overcome that fear of rejection if you want to become a leader.</p>



<p>What is the most important message you want to send out to young women thinking about a career in tech or IT?</p>



<p>When you arrive at an organization, don’t be surprised to find the leadership in technical fields 100% male and overwhelmingly white. It will feel impossible to break through, but it’s not. Find allies in unexpected places and don’t be afraid to ask for your own advancement.</p>



<p>If you could have dinner with three inspirational women, dead or alive, who would they be (and why)?</p>



<p>Michelle Obama</p>



<p>Eleanor Roosevelt</p>



<p>Angela Merkel</p>



<p>In the case of Michelle Obama and Eleanor Roosevelt, they took a support role and made it really matter; they overcame incredible prejudice and resistance to find their own voice. Angela Merkel showed you can rule a country—even the European Union—with a rational, even hand and succeed.</p>

<p>Kaliya – known as Identity Woman – is a key figure in SSI and identity on the blockchain. Internet, in her opinion, is there to empower people. By co-founding the Internet Identity Workshop in 2005, Kaliya committed her life to the development of an open standards-based layer of the internet. </p>



<p>We are happy to talk with her about International Women’s Day. In this conversation, Kaliya talks about her own career and sheds a light on how it is not about encouraging women to pursue a career in IT, because women are not the problem limiting their leadership. More likely, she talks about a deep systematic issue. Finally, Kaliya offers advice to young girls who feel inspired to start a career in IT or tech. Thank you Kaliya for this inspiring conversation and keep going with your amazing work!</p>



<p></p>



<p>Have you faced any barriers in your career due to being a woman? If so, how did you overcome them?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think when I was in the early part of my career I didn’t believe I experienced barriers or issues but looking back I realize they were there. This included inappropriate sexual advances at conferences (my strategy was to just ignore them).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on when we were all talking on a mailing list about user-centric identity Doc encouraged everyone to start blogging – it was at that time when one needed a name for a blog – that is when named my blog Identity Woman. This was in part because I was the only woman I had met in a meeting about digital identity.&nbsp; I was very lucky to find alignment and connection with Doc Searls and Phil Windley to collaborate in co-organizing the Internet Identity Workshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What was your dream job when you were a little girl?&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was a little girl my family watched the 6pm evening news almost every night. In Canada where I grew up the first 1/3 of the hour-long news program was international news. So I was aware of a bigger world and I saw things that didn’t seem just or right like the first Palestinian Intifada or learning about the tensions in the cold war.&nbsp; I also saw politicians talking and they seemed to have power at least how it was framed and I was putting pieces together as a young child so I wanted to be one of them – to make a difference in the world to make it better.&nbsp; I am still trying to use my power to make the world a better place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What are you most proud of?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m proud of myself for having the strength to follow my own path and through the significant struggles found success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have held true to a vision I caught via my participation in the Planetwork community and ist articulation of the Augmented Social Network vision. It was following that path I worked with others to cultivate the Internet Identity Workshop is an incredible community. I realize, now that I am reading more about international standards bodies and how they work, how our event and the community we have spawned to work on open standards for digital identity that center people and our autonomy instead of centering corporations and governments and their needs that this community and our event is really special.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What was your first job, and what did it teach you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>You could say that my first job was being a water polo player.&nbsp; I played on the Canadian Jr. National Team when I was 17 and 18 years old and from there I got an athletic scholarship to attend University in the United States at UC Berkeley. While I was in college I played water polo for the Canadian Sr. Women’s National Team. Playing sports at such a high level teaches you a lot – more than I really realized at the time.&nbsp; It gives you a mental toughness to really knuckle down and focus to improve yourself over time.&nbsp; I also learned how to play water polo in a team system by observing patterns in the field of play and knowing where to go. This sense of game and strategy serves me very well in both areas of my work facilitating unconferences and supporting communities acting together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you have a female role model?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I admire Esther Dyson and her pioneering of convening within the Technology industry. She a major conference PCForum from 1982 to 2007.&nbsp; It was the one conference where Bill Gates and Steve Jobs appeared on stage together. She published a book Release 2.0: A Design for Living in the Digital Age in 1997. I aspire to have enough money to be an investor like her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>How can we encourage more women to pursue senior leadership roles in their careers?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t really think it is about encouraging women. We aren’t the problem limiting women’s leadership. The problem is the dominant culture and the way that it frames who is worthy and who it can “see”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I founded a conference in 2007 called She’s Geeky for women in technology.&nbsp; I was about 3 years into my career and was bright-eyed and optimistic. We kept hosting the conference and as I and others who attended approached year 10 of our career many of us contemplated leaving the industry. It isn’t that it’s toxic and hard right away – it is that the deep systemic issue and the years of micro-aggressions and not being seen and recognized for one’s work build-up to the point that it sort of become “why bother”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we need to do some significant cultural work amongst those in the dominant and largely unconscious culture. It is so toxic and really quite terrible for women and people of color.&nbsp; I am unclear how we get to this type of significant cultural change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the most important message you want to send out to young women thinking about a career in tech or IT?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is critical to find allies and people who will support you and your work. I have been materially helped most by men of color who have made proactive steps to materially help me – get me contracts, do key introductions, help me address bad behavior by white men, give me job opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you could have dinner with three inspirational women, dead or alive, who would they be (and why)? &nbsp;</p>



<p>I would like to go back and talk to my great-grandmother Spoor. She went and got her bachelor’s degree at the University of Wisconsin and in fact, did a senior thesis that was almost exactly the same as a science fair project I did in 7th grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My mom died when I was 18 and I would really love to see her again. She would be really astounded at what I have accomplished. She didn’t even see me go to college.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>‘International Women’s Day is an occasion to celebrate the progress made towards achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment but also to critically reflect on those accomplishments and strive for a greater momentum towards gender equality worldwide.’</p><a href="https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/womenday">https://en.unesco.org/commemorations/womenday</a></blockquote>



<p>March 8th is International Women’s Day and it’s all about celebrating women’s success and raising awareness against bias. Celebrated each year since 1911, thousands of events occur to mark the economic, political and social achievements of women. &nbsp;</p>



<p>‘Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow’ is the theme for this year. As it stands, just 19% of the tech workforce are women. It is unlikely that the gender pay gap in tech will be closed in a short amount of time, because even as more female graduates enter the tech industry, they will be entering at more junior positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, times are changing in general, and more women are being encouraged to join the ranks of innovators and developers working to bring remarkable technological innovations to this world. To bring about change, we need to challenge stereotypes and overcome gender bias, and we need more female role models and mentors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For that, we at Jolocom are celebrating two leading female tech professionals today: Wendy Hanamuna, and Kaliya ‘Identity Woman’ Young.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kaliya – known as Identity Woman – is a key figure in SSI and identity on the blockchain. Internet, in her opinion, is there to empower people. By co-founding the Internet Identity Workshop in 2005, Kaliya committed her life to the development of an open standards-based layer of the internet. </p>



<p>We are happy to talk with her about International Women’s Day. In this conversation, Kaliya talks about her own career and sheds a light on how it is not about encouraging women to pursue a career in IT, because women are not the problem limiting their leadership. More likely, she talks about a deep systematic issue. Finally, Kaliya offers advice to young girls who feel inspired to start a career in IT or tech. Read more about it here: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/kaliya-identity-woman-young/">https://jolocom.io/blog/kaliya-identity-woman-young/</a> </p>



<p>Using storytelling to achieve positive social change is Wendy’s passion, as well as helping visionaries to realize their dreams. Concerning technology, Wendy helped launch a new movement for a decentralized, private and secure web that gives control back to its users.</p>



<p>We are happy to share this conversation with Wendy on the occasion of International Women’s Day 2022. Read how her first job taught her the hard way what matters if you want to succeed as a woman in a male-dominated job, and how she would encourage young women to pursue a career in tech or IT. Finally, Wendy shares why she would like to sit down for dinner with Angela Merkel and Michelle Obama. Find the interview here: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/wendy-hanamura/">https://jolocom.io/blog/wendy-hanamura/</a> </p>

Moving forward, Worldpay will also be involved in Veriscope.</p><blockquote>“It’s about how we bridge the crypto world and the traditional world,” said Shyft co-founder, Joseph Weinberg. “Having institutions like DLA Piper or Worldpay being able to cross-verify these types of entities really helps establish on-chain trust in ways that we’ve never seen&nbsp;before.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/03/02/payments-giant-fis-worldpay-joins-shyfts-crypto-compliance-network/">Read the full Worldpay announcement on CoinDesk</a>.

 The Solana x Web3Auth Hacker House world tour turned out to be a massive success paving the way for more such global collaborations for both&nbsp;parties.  What is the Solana Hacker&nbsp;House? <p>The Solana Hacker House world tour is a series of events around the globe where developers building on Solana can build, find collaborators, and learn from some of the greats in the Solana ecosystem. Participants will have all the essentials: good WiFi, food, power, and (of course)&nbsp;swags.</p> Solana — Web3Auth Partnership — a Quick&nbsp;History <p>Web3Auth and Solana share a close partnership dating back to 2020 which more recently resulted in the launch of the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/lets-replace-seed-phrases-on-solana-make-onboarding-easy-for-the-next-billion-users-on-both-ed6054520a74">Solana Torus Wallet</a> and Web3Auth committing 100% support to all Solana developers. The partnership took a deeper turn with Web3Auth’s commitment to co-headline 4 Hacker Houses with Solana — the first of which commenced in Singapore between February 15th — 20th.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleSamani/status/1495793687401414658">@KyleSamani</a></p></blockquote> Singapore Hacker House — A closed-door event for 200 curious developers <p>Participants were welcomed with exclusive Web3Auth&nbsp;swags</p><p>The event was hosted at the iconic Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Center overseeing the beautiful Marina Bay in Singapore. Given Singapore’s stringent Covid protocol, the Hacker House was a closed-door gathering of only 200 individuals. These mostly included Developers, members from the investing fraternity, and of course senior team members from both the sponsors — Solana and Web3Auth. All of the participants had one thing in common — the urge to collectively contribute towards the development of&nbsp;Web3</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/hackerhouses/status/1494598814446985223">@hackerhouses</a></p></blockquote> A Galaxy of Star Speakers graced the&nbsp;stage <p>The Hacker House saw a galaxy of speakers grace the stage to offer valuable insights, fascinating demos, and intriguing panel discussions.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/muhnkee/status/1496137947254595584">@muhnkee</a></p></blockquote><p>On Day 1, Our Head of Engineering Chaitanya Potti(Chai) spoke about how Solana Developers can eliminate the need for seed phrases while onboarding users into their dApps or wallets. The developers were pleasantly surprised to know that they could increase user conversion on their dApps by up to 64% with our solution.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1493482058030608384">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>On Day 4, our Sr Software Engineer conducted a workshop on how Solana Developers can leverage the power of the Solana Torus Wallet while building their dApp or wallet. The talk was received with much intrigue and interest which also invited many curious questions from the audience.</p><p>On the final day, Web3Auth talks culminated with Chai and Shubham doing a panel discussion along with moderator Tristan, founder of Zeta finance. The discussion revolved around “UX, Wallets, and the future of Web3Auth“.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495337601816928258">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Web3Auth won Developers with their state-of-the-art auth infrastructure<br>True to the spirit of the Hacker House, the Web3Auth team forged many collaborations through the 6-day event. Various developers discovered the ease of onboarding Web3Auth’s Plug and Play SDK offered to their dApp and with every integration, Web3Auth moved closer towards their vision of making crypto accessible to the&nbsp;masses.</p><p>Here are a few examples of some integrations that happened during the Hacker&nbsp;House.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1494957294915706885">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495331334352355329">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>We are certain that the different partnerships and collaborations made during the Hacker House may result in bringing the next billion users into the Solana Blockchain.</p><p>The event culminated with Tom who leads Growth and Strategy at Solana thanking the participants and partners for making the event such a grand success and also shared what the future holds for&nbsp;Solana.</p> 3 more events to go… Where to&nbsp;next? <p>The success of the inaugural Solana x Web3Auth Hacker House has paved the way for many more such collaborations. With 3 more Hacker Houses to co-headline in 2022, there is much anticipation around where the next Solana x Web3Auth Hacker House will be conducted.</p><p>The Web3Auth team would be headed to New York to take part in the Hacker House from 14–18 March 2022!

 Verus Showcases Scalable, Decentralized Currency Launch and Anti-MEV DeFi Technology for Ethereum and Other Networks at Consensus 2022&nbsp;🔥  Verus will showcase its Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) Technology at Consensus 2022, June 9–12, Austin, TX. The world’s most influential crypto &amp; blockchain experience of the year. Here tens of thousands of crypto enthusiasts come together to discover the latest industry-leading developments.  Verus Addresses Ethereum Network Challenges <p>The Verus protocol addresses challenges that are seen in Ethereum and other networks. Challenges such as MEV (Miner Extractable Value), scalability and cross-chain/network interoperability.</p><p>With the release of the new Verus testnet (March 6, 2022, <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.1">see extensive release notes</a>) and the planned mainnet launch before the start of Consensus 2022, Verus can be used as, among many other things, a launch platform for ERC-20 tokens and currencies.</p><p>Through the Verus Interchain Protocol (VIP, decentralized bridging technology) creators can use the Verus protocol to create currencies and tokens and immediately export them to Ethereum as ERC-20s without needing any Solidity developers or actual programming. Saving costs and having the ability to use the most feature-rich decentralized crypto protocol to date. Currencies and tokens on the Verus protocol can also be created to be mapped 1:1 with any ERC-20 token, making never seen before value transfers possible.</p><p>All currencies and tokens on the Verus and Ethereum networks can be used with Verus DeFi. Verus DeFi is part of the L1 consensus protocol, which means that all AMM conversions can not be front-run or reordered, and are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion.</p><p>Additionally, anyone can create a blockchain with Verus PBaaS technology. Rent-free, independent and fully interoperable with all other connected blockchains in the network. <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.9.1">See release notes for more extensive information on various launch options for currencies, tokens and blockchains.</a></p><p>Ethereum is the first network that has a decentralized bridge to Verus, and many networks will follow. The Verus community is excited to showcase these working technologies to the masses at Consensus 2022.</p> Powerful Verus Community <p>The Verus community came together to make the attendance of Consensus 2022 possible and donated VRSC, BTC and ETH at an incredible combined amount of $150,000. Thank you so much to everyone who donated!&nbsp;❤️</p><p>With the funds, the Verus community acquired a 10x10 feet (3x3 meter) booth at Consensus. And a hotel suite to be used as a Verus community home base and where interested parties can learn about Verus away from the noisy and busy Austin Convention Center.</p><p>Most Verus community members are all joining Consensus 2022 and we want you to join as well! Let’s make a big presence and let the world see what Verus has to offer. We are all hyped and confident it is going to be a great opportunity for Verus and its ecosystem!</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus2022/">Grab your ticket here</a>. ⚠️ Get a 15% discount on your Consensus 2022 ticket if you join the <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discord channel</a>, and ask for the discount code in #marketing!</p> 💙 <a href="http://www.verus.io">Visit verus.io for more information on&nbsp;Verus</a>  <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-showcases-scalable-decentralized-currency-launch-and-anti-mev-defi-technology-for-ethereum-96c165e94c1">Verus Showcases Scalable, Decentralized Currency Launch and Anti-MEV DeFi Technology for Ethereum</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Looking Forward — Community <p>Written by Paul Pomerleau, Developer Relations at BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol.</p><p>Last year was the most exciting to date in KILT’s short history. With incredible support from the community, the KILT crowdloan cap of 220,000 KSM was achieved hours after the parachain slot auction began. On September 8, 2021, KILT won its slot and went live as a Kusama parachain. Staking, governance, and a Treasury were then added to the KILT blockchain, along with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials to provide developers with the tools to <a href="https://www.kilt.io/how-it-works/">create businesses around identity and credentials</a>. After testing and auditing, on November 10, 2021, KILT transitioned to a decentralized network. <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-sporran-and-stakeboard-storing-and-staking-for-kilt-3e37125fc744">Ways to store and stake KILT were launched</a> and the community of KILT Coin holders started participating in active <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/how-to-vote-on-a-kilt-referendum-2a9e167a24f0">governance</a>. It was a busy four&nbsp;months!</p> The Way&nbsp;Ahead <p>2022 is already shaping up to be another whirlwind. <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC</a>, a service that uses KILT to regain control over your digital identity, launched in January and more services are on the way. Even more exciting is the KILT community’s evolution, as it begins to imagine and build real products and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The prime direction of the KILT community is now clear: driving development and adoption. How? By ignoring the noise, removing friction, and staying laser-focused on outcomes. This is where the fun really&nbsp;starts!</p><p>Let’s do a quick&nbsp;recap:</p>  KILT is ready to go. It’s past the concept stage and the infrastructure already exists to allow anyone to build a real-world services on the KILT blockchain.  The KILT blockchain is live and running as a Kusama parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem. Polkadot addresses a lot of problems — such as interoperability, security, and stable transaction fees — that have hampered blockchain use to&nbsp;date.  Entrepreneurs and developers who want to build real-world products around digital identity can harness the advantages of blockchain without any blockchain experience via the JavaScript <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk/">software development kit</a>&nbsp;(SDK).  The KILT SDK can be downloaded free from the KILT website, and extensive<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/#/"> technical documentation</a> is already available.   The Power of Community <p>The community around KILT is constantly growing and forming support systems for those interested in building on KILT. Anyone who wants to run a successful business and tap into the KILT blockchain can join the conversation and collaborate on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a>, an active hub that already has over 2,000&nbsp;members.</p><p>Trello, the newest community addition, provides a platform for individuals and teams to share information. Areas are devoted project ideation and practical support when building:</p><p>Projects that are underway&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://burma.ac/">Burma Academy</a>, a MOOC (massive open online course) platform built by a team in Myanmar that provides education, will implement KILT for login and credential issuance.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/yazgit/">YAZGİT (Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing Community)</a>, a project at the Konya Technical University in Turkey, is creating Arduino-powered smart locks that use KILT DIDs and Credentials + RFID Cards to allow users&nbsp;entry.  <a href="https://publiclandprotocol.com/">Public Land Protocol</a> is building the ORGO App, a mobile application that will gamify and incentivize land maintenance and remediation. ORGO will use KILT DIDs and credentials to attest completed tasks and accomplishments to unlock perks and earnings.  <a href="https://trello.com/c/Ye8pcyvc">Doggo DID</a> is a project focusing on credentials for dogs to certify hard traits like ID and vaccine status, as well as soft traits like skills, disposition, etc. The project is exploring existing NFC Collars and future-facing UWB technology. It also plans to interoperate with existing Web2 registries in order to tap into an existing user&nbsp;base.  <p>Some of these projects including Doggo DID and ORGO are actively seeking developers! Message the teams in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a> by role, or in their collaboration channel.</p> Treasury Funding <p>KILT also has a <a href="https://www.kilt.io/treasury/overview/">Treasury</a>, a store of on-chain funds available for creating infrastructure or initiatives that benefit the network and contribute to its long-term sustainability. These can cover a wide range of projects, from software or infrastructure development to community outreach programs. Any KILT Coin holder can create a proposal and request funds from the Treasury.</p><p>Since KILT is at the beginning of this exciting phase, the “KILT Distillery” was created to support a culture of “abstract and open source”&nbsp;. This is a cookbook of recipes and tools allows devs to quickly spin up projects leveraging the work and learnings of others. As a new member of the community building your business, you can engage with more experienced members for advice on finding abstractions that you can use to create open-source code and contribute to the ecosystem. You can also apply for Treasury funding for your outcomes.</p><p>For example: Burma Academy is using a tool called OpenEDX and is exploring creating an KILT &lt;&gt; OpenEDX auth plugin. YAZGİT may explore Arduino modules, and Doggo DID an NFC &lt;&gt; DID resolver, etc. This creates a win-win situation, with the project obtaining support and the KILT community gaining a growing ecosystem of modular libraries and tools that entrepreneurs and developers can use to quickly bootstrap their business or use cases. Obviously, the common goal of the community is adoption, and together it can happen&nbsp;quickly.</p> Looking Forward <p>KILT was built to counter monopolies and their poor handling of user data. Projects building on KILT are reimagining Web2 identity constructs to create a new digital identity model for Web3, the next generation of the internet.</p><p>Building on KILT goes beyond one blockchain or network. Entrepreneurs and developers can build a better way for the user as well as a successful and sustainable business&nbsp;model.</p><p>Discover more about KILT on its <a href="https://www.kilt.io/treasury/overview/">website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">blog</a>.

				  The Privatyze team is excited to announce a collaboration with IndicioID to develop a robust, decentralized data marketplace.  
			  
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://privatyze.io/">Privatyze</a>, an innovative startup for privacy-respecting data monetization solutions, has announced a collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="http://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, a global leader in developing the infrastructure for trusted data ecosystems, to help guide the Privatyze team as they develop a robust, decentralized data marketplace using the Indicio Network.</p>
<p>The new Privatyze platform will provide an open and secure peer-to-peer environment for market participants to trade data directly, with full user consent and support for enrollment and discovery.</p>
<p>The result will be a more efficient, secure, and transparent platform than any offered by traditional data markets. Users can be compensated for the use of their data. It will mean that those with data to trade will be in complete control of the process, removing the data privacy and security problems of third-party data control. The use of verifiable credentials to manage authentication and decentralized identifiers to generate unique P2P encryption for every transaction will provide the zero-trust level of assurance needed for participation.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Indicio to deliver a world-class data monetization platform that meets the stringent security and privacy requirements of our customers,” said Madison Majeed, CEO of Privatyze. “With the rise of big data and the increasing demand for secure ways to monetize this information, this partnership represents an important step forward in the decentralization of data and the evolution of privacy-respecting technologies.”</p>
<p>“In a data-driven economy, we need a marketplace for data that’s inclusive and not exploitative,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “That means that participants can meaningfully consent to data transactions and do so in a way that enables zero-trust security. This just isn’t possible without decentralized solutions, and we are excited to work with Privatyze on building this solution.</p>
<p>This collaboration represents an important step towards the development of decentralized data markets and will help to promote data ownership, transparency, and privacy protection for all participants.</p>
<p>About Privatyze:</p>
<p>Privatyze is a San Diego based technology startup on a mission to end the Surveillance Data Economy, and siloed-centralized data monopolies, known to many as Surveillance Capitalism. To do this they’re enabling everyday people to take ownership of their digital footprint, data, and privacy and turn it into a valuable digital asset. Privatyze is empowering users to take control of their data by giving them the freedom to collect and store their own data and information, verify its validity, and take it to the marketplace; where they can claim their piece of the $300 billion big data and digital advertising industries.</p>
<p>Privatyze was grown out of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.launchfactory.com/">Launch Factory</a>&nbsp;which brings together talented founders, elite advisors, seed capital, vetted technology, and an accelerator program to give entrepreneurs the unfair advantage they’re looking for. Launch Factory partner Bill Orabone said, “Privatyze is capitalizing on exactly the type of wide-ranging, big thinking opportunity we seek. Everyone knows that data privacy is a huge problem and Privatyze’s approach hits directly at its center.” Learn more about Privatyze at Privatyze.io</p>

<p>This is a transcript of Ocean Founder Bruce Pon’s latest talk at the MOBI Community Lecture Series. In his fourth presentation to the MOBI community since 2019, Bruce offers a deep dive into safe data sharing with blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. His lectUre also underlines the role of <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and its latest technical advances — safe staking and Data NFTs — in spearheading this&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The Value of&nbsp;Data</p><p>Data is an untapped asset waiting to be unlocked. With a combination of new technology, mindset changes and new business processes, this is possible. As a starting point, organizations must acknowledge that publishers need to feel safe, secure and comfortable to share data. If this is solved, then the next phase is to develop pricing signals on the data to incentivize people, reveal the value of personal data to them and get the cycle&nbsp;going.</p><p>My team have worked for eight years to build the tools and technologies to allow for safer data sharing and we have employed blockchain technology and cryptocurrency for this purpose. Today, the world is closer to having the pieces in place to unlock data at a large scale. The technology stack is maturing quickly and many of the core infrastructure pieces are ready to be used. With successful models of bootstrapping and new economies forming in the Web3 space through decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens and decentralised autonomous organisations, the Defi space has a total value of $3+ trillion, which is more than the value of all the startups and unicorns on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The decentralised space is moving very fast, there’s a lot of value being sucked up to it which makes data ripe for this crypto cycle. However, there are still a lot of challenges to improving the user experience. There is a need to raise awareness and educate people and streamline the onboarding process because that’s not intuitive. The need of the hour is to teach people that if they are able to put things into digitized formats using these tools, they will also be able to apply the tools of finance to make it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Ocean Protocol: The key to unlocking an Open Data&nbsp;Economy</p><p>There are a lot of features in the Ocean tech stack that enable users to share their data and monetise it on their own terms. In Ocean’s upcoming technical release V4, these features present a whole new set of opportunities.</p><p>1. Ocean&nbsp;Market</p><p>The <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is the main way for people to interact with Ocean; it’s the front end application that one can access from any browser. Users can see the datasets, stake them, buy them and consume them. What Ocean will work to build soon is a pool to draw people in, whether through a wider range of useful data, bounties or request forms to allow people to ask for the type of data they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>For data providers, the Ocean Market is open-source software that’s freely available to anyone to clone and build their own marketplace. The code is completely available to inspect and any vulnerabilities found can be fixed very quickly. In V4 the providers can set their own fee schedules for each transaction as well as price data in the currencies they want. The advances Ocean has made in the last 14 months are to extend tools, features and control to all participants and stakeholders. Ocean has also integrated both DeFi and NFTs into the Ocean Market enabling users to stake and earn transaction fees. The Ocean Market has now evolved into a more mature front end with which people can start using Web3 technologies. This includes the cryptocurrencies of Ocean, anything else that interacts with it, the concept of NFTs and decentralized finance.</p><p>The idea driving this is that Web3 technologies are future-facing; this is where the world is going to head and the ability to have a live demo that is in production, securing several million dollars worth of data and allowing people to start sharing their data is very rare. This makes the Ocean Market one of the very first data markets available using Web3 technologies.</p><p>2. Ocean Smart Contracts</p><p>With Ocean as an operating system for AI and data sharing, smart contracts are the engines driving it. They serve to enforce conditions of access, facilitate payments, execute a transaction or business logic. It is a globally shared computer that anyone can use, which allows for these transactions to happen anywhere on Earth at any time, given the proper&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>There are multiple kinds of blockchain networks, and Ocean interacts with all of them through smart contracts — these are the core building blocks on which all protocols live. They allow the trustless exchange of value, but also provide an audit trail on what transactions have taken place and what actions have been done. It is a very strong use case because any participant can trace back and see what happened directly on the blockchain, paving the way for automated audits and inspections — continuous monitoring of what happens to the data and personal datasets. Publishers could get daily reports on how many datasets were sold, what was done to them, and be notified of any exceptions or&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>3. Compute-to-Data</p><p>The third piece that Ocean built to meet the needs for people to share their data without exposing it is a reference implementation called Compute-to-Data. It offers privacy-preserving access, which means that data can be stopped from being stolen. Today, there are a host of tools being developed across the entire space, which allow for privacy-preserving computing to happen at multiple fine grain levels. This means that any type of computing on a dataset, any type of action that is run on it will still preserve its privacy. Compute-to-Data is our first cut at this and our team is working with several other entities to integrate their privacy-preserving algorithms and solutions directly into the Ocean Market. Users will be enabled to choose the type of privacy protection they want to implement on top of their services in order for them to be consumed safely. Ocean equips users with comfort and security for providing their data to meet industry&nbsp;demand.</p><p>4. OCEAN&nbsp;Token</p><p>We hear a lot about cryptocurrencies nowadays where more and more people are comfortable acquiring, holding and using them to navigate the blockchain economies. 15% of the American public apparently holds crypto and in about a dozen other countries, such as the Philippines, Nigeria, and other places that you wouldn’t have necessarily thought would be on the edge of innovation, the number of population that actually have crypto is above 20%. This is what crypto does, it invites the world in, and it allows everybody to participate. That is the positive effect of this technology.</p><p>This is where the OCEAN token comes in. It is a native crypto token for the Ocean network that helps to run the smart contracts and we use it for a whole bunch of other purposes like governance, staking rewards and bounties as well. It’s a standard for this data economy and the means of payment in the ecosystem. In the future, we are also looking to introduce other cryptocurrencies in the ecosystem. Our whole goal is to make sure that data sharing becomes easier. We do know that right now, it is mandatory that people have cryptocurrency wallets in order to interact with us but we are looking forward to easier onboarding as technology progresses.</p><p>5. Datatokens and Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>Think of it this way: if you want to play a pinball game, you need to throw in a token to play the game. The way we have architected datatokens is through the idea that one needs a token in order to access&nbsp;data.</p><p>A publisher could set the price of the datatoken at $100 in the Ocean Market. There’s also innovative technology that allows for tokens to be dynamically priced by the community in real-time, without affecting the data itself. If the community takes a look at the data and understands what is being provided, they can help price the data. The datatoken concept allows for a data asset to develop its own dynamic price, the liquidity behind the datatoken gives a price, people can trade datatokens speculatively without moving the actual underlying data — and at the end, because there’s a dynamic price on the datatoken, that becomes the de facto the price of the data asset. It is an interesting experiment to see how we can price data into the future, especially for data assets that we don’t really know the price&nbsp;for.</p><p>If one takes the datatoken concept to its logical conclusion when a dataset is so well used and so broadly traded, one could say that the dataset is IPO’ed — and it is a stock that also grants one access to use the data if one&nbsp;wants.</p><p>One of the things that we’ve realized in the Web3 space is that speculation and pricing are fundamental pieces to a market. In a nascent market, there is only speculation. By using this dynamic, we can start unlocking data through datatokens.</p><p>6. Data&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>Imagine that you have a dataset, and you’ve generated it for your doctoral research but you don’t really need the data anymore. It now turns out that an automotive company would like to have that dataset. One could generate a datatoken and hand over access to that automotive company. But one could argue that there is also the possibility of creating a Data NFT for the licensing rights to a data asset. Not only can you sell this Data NFT to the automotive company, and let them use the data but now it can also be improved and marketed.</p><p>In other words, you’ve licensed out your intellectual property for somebody else to use and monetize themselves. Think of an NFT for a car — where one essentially sells the car with the NFT — the physical object with the digital NFT. Or one can invest in licensing where the process is just granting access at a particular time to a particular data asset. Just like a song and multiple CD’s with access to it, there are datasets and a couple of NFTs to grant access to them enabling owners to monetise their data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In summary, there are two approaches. One is the datatoken, where users maintain control of the data asset, watch over how many people are trading it and what the price is from a dynamic perspective. The second one is Data NFTs, where users generate sublicenses and sell them off. These NFTs are free-floating but whoever has that NFT continues to be able to access a particular dataset.</p><p>These are native, future-facing technologies that we are going to hear a lot more about. With these building blocks, Ocean gives users the tools to sell data and monetize it. Any publisher can now monetize their data using these innovative channels without any reliance on a centralized party or software as a service provider. They have full control over their commissions and they cannot be de-platformed. This allows for a flowering of innovation but also for different business models to be tried out by interested parties in order to get a data economy&nbsp;going.</p><p>Why isn’t data being shared more frequently?</p><p>The answer is simple: there are 100 different ways how data can be collected, but it just stays locked up. Many individuals today want to share and monetise their data however they do not know how to get started. They want to have a comprehensive understanding of the legal, safety and privacy implications involved in the process. There is a curiosity to learn, a sense of opportunity to start building new business lines and that is crucial to building the open data economy that we aim to unleash at&nbsp;Ocean.</p><p>We need more experiments that put small amounts of value and reputation at risk, to learn and adjust organically. Interested publishers must take that first step because no one can predict the market’s reaction. The path isn’t clear for anyone and no one knows how to package and sell the data in a Web3 world. Everyone is learning in this new environment and it is my strong conviction that we can start sharing data now only if we take some bold steps forward. Many people have exactly the kind of data that many organizations are looking for in order to enhance their services and AI capabilities and so, it becomes imperative to dive into the easiest ways to start sharing and monetising it.</p><p>The 3-step approach to getting value out of your&nbsp;data</p><p>Step 1 — Gather &amp; Publish&nbsp;data</p><p>Gather data that you think is valuable but isn’t being exploited and monetized.</p><p>Find some data about supply chains, manufacturing, energy consumption, sensor data, warehouse data — whatever it is that you are collecting and you think has value. However, avoid anything that exposes personal information.</p><p>Find it, package it up, publish it on Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>This allows you to get your feet wet with the tools and paradigms of Web3 — from setting up a wallet, to self-generating IDs and then using the tools available. It’s the best way to learn and demonstrate to stakeholders how to navigate the world of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Step 2 — Explore&nbsp;Value</p><p>If you don’t know what the data could be valuable for, issue a&nbsp;bounty.</p><p>You issue a bounty to the community for helping you find out what the data could be used for. It can be as simple as a $15k prize for the best ideas on how the data is valuable and could be better monetized — $5k to the top 3 winners. Ocean Protocol can also publicize the bounty with its 250,000 strong community. This bounty allows you to gather ideas from a broad swath of motivated people.</p><p>Step 3 — Get&nbsp;Value</p><p>Finally, if you have some burning questions and you think there might be an answer, or at least, an approach to solving the questions, you can also bounty this for the community.</p><p>Give a prize to anyone that can help you solve the riddle or question, using the datasets you published.</p><p>One example: in 1999, Goldcorp Challenge was launched by the new owner of a goldmine — he asked the global community to help him find the gold on his land for a chance to get $1m in prize money. He put up a small file of his geological data for inspection. 20 years later, Goldcorp was sold for $10 Billion and is now the largest gold mining company on Earth. All because he took the chance, opened up his data and let others help him to figure out where to dig for&nbsp;gold.</p><p>Data — when openly, transparently exploited, can be extremely powerful and valuable.</p><p>Through this simple 3-step approach, you can get value out of your data and incentivize a global community of data scientists using bounties. It can be a game-changer only if one takes a&nbsp;chance.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In summary, with Ocean, we have been building infrastructure to enable this kind of safe data sharing. It is there and is ready to use; we just have to get the wheel going. As part of our future Ocean V4 release, Ocean will give publishers more control, transparency and ways to monetize their data. It’s the most advanced stack of technologies in this rapidly expanding space. However, its true potential can be realized only if there is more experimentation. Imagine the discoveries that are just waiting to happen if data could be opened up. At Ocean, we will continue to support and encourage you in this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality&nbsp;data.</p><p>Watch Bruce Pon’s past talks for the MOBI community via the links&nbsp;below:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHuNQ-DmaM0">How to Tokenize and Monetize Your Data</a> — MoCo Los Angeles, 12 November&nbsp;2019</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U2H0qV2VwE">Data Monetization for Mobility</a>, 25 November&nbsp;2020</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybfZUT0Fmb0">Data Sharing Using the Latest Web3 Technologies</a>- 23 February&nbsp;2022</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-sharing-using-the-latest-web3-technologies-7703624aa709">Data sharing using the latest Web3 technologies</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Web3Auth at one of the World’s Largest Web3 Events — ETHDenver 2022  Web3Auth was at ETH Denver to forge partnerships, sponsor the Opening Party where we (literally) air-dropped NFTs, delivered talks, and also unveiled a&nbsp;dance!  What is ETHDenver and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>ETHDenver is the largest and longest-running ETH Event in the world. Attended by the who’s who of the Crypto industry — particularly from within the Ethereum community, ETHDenver is hosted in the state of Colorado — a thriving hub of Ethereum and Blockchain innovation.</p><p>In the three years since we’ve been active as a Web3 company, this is the second time we had the opportunity to participate in this massive gathering of some of the brightest minds in the Web3 space. What better way to open our presence at ETHDenver than to become official sponsors of the Opening&nbsp;Party?</p> How Celebrations unfolded at the Opening&nbsp;Party <p>The Party was hosted at the Wings Over The Rockies Air and Aviation Museum spread across 44000 sq ft and housing over fifty iconic aircraft and the most realistic flight simulators.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1494427295720919042">@epnsproject</a></p></blockquote><p>Starting at 2:00 pm and going on till 2:00 am, the opening party hosted a slew of exciting talks and panel discussions with our own co-founder and CTO Leonard Tan featuring in a very insightful discussion around ”Interoperability, Scaling, and Blockchain Agnosticism”. Leonard also cited the example of Web3Auth whose pluggable SDK is blockchain agnostic which evoked a few pleasant surprises in the audience.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495452625709395970">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Later in the day, our co-founder and <a href="https://twitter.com/zenzhenyu">CEO Zhen Yu Yong</a> also spoke about a popular topic — “How one can accelerate the adoption of Web3 Wallets and Applications”</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/DefiNft/status/1494446562163900423">@DefiNft</a></p></blockquote><p>The audience was surprised to know that with Web3Auth’s pluggable SDK, they could eliminate the need for using seed phrases in their dApps just in a few&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>The party got groovier with an interesting bunch of artists performing through the day(and night) to keep the energy rising in what was an already electrifying space. After having spent the day reaching out to many developers, it was time to put the good old phrase “Work hard party harder” into action. Team Web3Auth partied through the rest of the&nbsp;evening.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495504783909732361">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Web3Auth AirDrops Party&nbsp;NFTs <p>The highlight of the night was a blimp that circled above the event for 6 hours from which we airdropped specially designed physical NFTs. Don’t believe us? See for yourself.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495488929562255364">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/EthereumDenver/status/1494843481172459524">@EthereumDenver</a></p></blockquote> Star-Studded Speaker&nbsp;Sessions <p>ETHDenver set the stage for some of the biggest names in Blockchain to come and share their priceless insights with the rest of the community. The galaxy of speakers included the founders of some of the biggest NFT marketplaces to the founders of giant L2 chains to senior members from the Ethereum Foundation and countless exciting developers from the ecosystem!</p><p>Having helped dApps such as Skyweaver, Rarible, and MyCrypto heroes increase user adoption, Zhen gave insights to the community on how they can scale up too by integrating Web3Auth’s state of the art Private Key management infrastructure.</p><p>However, it was Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum Foundation(with whom both our co-founders worked previously) who eventually stole the show for reasons both expected and unexpected.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/neocrassical/status/1494888681055920129">@neocrassical</a></p></blockquote><p>When Vitalik wore the ETHDenver Mascot Buffi suit, little did he know he would end up as a meme to be shared by Elon&nbsp;Musk</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1496252264171941888">@elonmusk</a></p></blockquote> Successful Partnerships and the Dance of&nbsp;success <p>The simplicity of Web3Auth attracted a lot of attention from the community and people from different quarters reached out to the team to know more about Web3Auth. Below is a snippet from Zhen’s interview with The Sapien&nbsp;Tribe.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/sapien_network/status/1496253333941940225">@sapien_network</a></p></blockquote><p>Web3Auth also forged some promising partnerships at ETHDenver that will help onboard the next generation of users into Web3. You can expect formal announcements in the days to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to leave you with a sweet dance of success — presenting to you the official Web3Auth Dance that we unveiled for the first&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1495790667867508744">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1496291445883420675">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> About Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth, is a pluggable non-custodial infrastructure that enables Web3 wallets and applications to provide seamless user logins for both mainstream and Web3.0 users. By aggregating OAuth (Google, Twitter, Discord) logins, different wallets, and existing key management solutions, Web3Auth provides dApps/wallets with a familiar experience that fits every&nbsp;user.</p> Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-at-one-of-the-worlds-largest-web3-events-ethdenver-2022-4a2180621107">Web3Auth at one of the World’s Largest Web3 Events — ETHDenver 2022</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Over the years, I’ve developed a lot of Java applications. I started writing Java code in the late 90s and spent several years doing Java before I tried another server-side language. I was impressed when I first tried building apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Node.js - they all started super-fast!

<p>Over the years, I’ve developed a lot of Java applications. I started writing Java code in the late 90s and spent several years doing Java before I tried another server-side language. I was impressed when I first tried building apps in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Node.js - they all started super-fast!</p>
 
 
<p>Starting fast is cool, but we in the Java community have often asked, does it perform over time? The Java Virtual Machine is famous for performance and optimization over time.</p>
 
 
<p>I scoffed at serverless when it first came out. Mostly because I was a Java developer and my apps didn’t start in milliseconds. They also used a whole lotta memory and there was no hope in sight.</p>
 
 
<p>Then, along came <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. It’s gained support from many Java frameworks in the last few years and has made their apps start in milliseconds!</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’m proud to announce that this same capability is now available for your JHipster 7+ apps!</p>

 Why should you care about serverless? 
 
 
<p>From <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless">IBM’s What is Serverless computing?</a></p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p>That’s it!</p>
 
 
<p>For companies with high traffic and large cloud bills, serverless makes sense. They can save millions of dollars a month.</p>
 
 
 
 
 GraalVM allows serverless Java for everyone! 
 
 
<p>I’ve been playing with GraalVM and the Java frameworks that support it for around 18 months. After doing a lot of research, I blogged about <a>building native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In September 2021, I did a talk with Josh Long about Spring Native with JHipster at the San Francisco JUG.</p>

<p>I flew out on a Monday, we got everything working by Wednesday afternoon, and then spoke about our experience on Wednesday night. I wrote about it in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/">JHipster Works with Spring Native!</a> on LinkedIn and created a <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498">JHipster issue</a> to automate our learnings.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What is Spring Native? 
 
 
<p>Spring Native provides an API to configure Spring Boot and GraalVM so classes that are not easily discoverable become recognizable. For example, those that are instantiated using reflection. It’s a really slick extension to Spring Boot and will likely disappear with Spring Boot 3 because it’ll be native by default.</p>
 
 
<p>As a result of our successful <a href="https://youtu.be/F9oydL_MndA">presentation at the SF JUG</a>, Josh and I were invited to speak at the Garden State JUG in December. We laid low for a few months and rekindled our research in December. I wrote about it in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/">JHipster works with Spring Native, Part 2!</a></p>
 
 
 
 
 🔥 Announcing the JHipster Native blueprint! 
 
 
<p>In late January 2022, we (the JHipster team) upgraded JHipster to use Spring Boot 2.6 and released version <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/2022/01/23/jhipster-release-7.6.0.html">7.6.0</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In early February, I updated <a href="https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples">the Spring Native with JHipster examples</a> that Josh and I’d been using for research. I was ready to start automating the Spring Native integration using a JHipster module. When <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/16498#issuecomment-1030263905">I asked the JHipster team</a> about the best way to implement it, <a href="https://github.com/mshima">Marcelo Shima</a> volunteered to create the initial blueprint.</p>
 
 
<p>This was on a Friday afternoon (Mountain Time or MT). By the next morning, Marcelo had the MVP finished and provided steps to reproduce our examples. 😳</p>
 
 
<p>I was amazed! I remember telling (my partner) Trish that he’d done a week’s worth of (my estimated) work in a matter of hours.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’m proud to announce the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native">JHipster Native blueprint</a> is available! Here’s how to use it:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-native@1.0
jhipster-native</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This will generate a JHipster app and integrate GraalVM automatically. You can build and run a native image with the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests
npm run ci:e2e:prepare # start docker dependencies
./target/native-executable</code> 
 
 
 






Gradle is not currently an option, but it can be if we add support to the JHipster Native blueprint.



 
 
 
 
 Go native with Spring Native and GraalVM 
 
 
<p>To see Spring Native + JHipster in action, let’s look at a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/full-stack-java-with-react-spring-boot-and-jhipster/">previous JHipster app I created for the Auth0 blog</a>. First, clone the example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native
cd jhipster-native</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>Want results right away? Clone the <code>spring-native</code> branch with the changes below already made:</p>
 
 
 
 git clone -b spring-native https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example.git jhipster-native 
 
 
 
<p>Then, skip to the <a>Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider</a> section to continue.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Install JHipster 7.7.0 and the JHipster Native blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7.7
npm i -g generator-jhipster-native@1.0</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, remove all the existing project files and regenerate them. The <code>jhipster-native</code> command includes parameters to disable caching because it’s not supported by Spring Native, yet.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm -rf *
jhipster-native --with-entities --cache-provider no --no-enable-hibernate-cache
# When prompted to overwrite .gitignore, type "a" to overwrite all files</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you open the project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the Commit Tools Window (⌘+0 on macOS or Ctrl+0 on Linux/Windows) to view files that changed.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Next, run the following <code>git checkout</code> commands to restore the files that were modified in the original example.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git checkout .gitignore
git checkout README.md
git checkout demo.adoc
git checkout flickr2.jdl
git checkout screenshots
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx
git checkout src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo-update.tsx
git checkout src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/config/SecurityConfiguration.java
git checkout src/main/resources/config/application-heroku.yml
git checkout src/main/resources/config/bootstrap-heroku.yml
git checkout Procfile
git checkout system.properties</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather not use the command line, you can right-click on each file and select Rollback.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you ran the <code>git checkout</code> commands, there are several changes I made in the first tutorial that’ll need to be re-applied:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In <code>src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code>, remove the <code>faker</code> profile for Liquibase.</p>
 
 
<p>In <code>pom.xml</code>, re-add Drew Noake’s <code>metadata-extractor</code> library:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.drewnoakes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metadata-extractor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.16.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Next, modify the <code>createPhoto()</code> method in <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/web/rest/PhotoResource.java</code> to set the metadata when an image is uploaded.</p>
 
 
 <code>import com.drew.imaging.ImageMetadataReader;
import com.drew.imaging.ImageProcessingException;
import com.drew.metadata.Metadata;

public class PhotoResource {
    ...

    public ResponseEntity&lt;Photo&gt; createPhoto(@Valid @RequestBody Photo photo) throws Exception {
        log.debug("REST request to save Photo : {}", photo);
        if (photo.getId() != null) { ... }

        try {
            photo = setMetadata(photo);
        } catch (ImageProcessingException | IOException | MetadataException ipe) {
            log.error(ipe.getMessage());
        }

        Photo result = photoRepository.save(photo);
        ...
    }

    private Photo setMetadata(Photo photo) throws ImageProcessingException, IOException, MetadataException {
        String str = DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(photo.getImage());
        byte[] data2 = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(str);
        InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(data2);
        BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);
        Metadata metadata = ImageMetadataReader.readMetadata(bis);
        ExifSubIFDDirectory directory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(ExifSubIFDDirectory.class);

        if (directory != null) {
            Date date = directory.getDateDigitized();
            if (date != null) {
                photo.setTaken(date.toInstant());
            }
        }

        if (photo.getTaken() == null) {
            log.debug("Photo EXIF date digitized not available, setting taken on date to now...");
            photo.setTaken(Instant.now());
        }

        photo.setUploaded(Instant.now());

        JpegDirectory jpgDirectory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(JpegDirectory.class);
        if (jpgDirectory != null) {
            photo.setHeight(jpgDirectory.getImageHeight());
            photo.setWidth(jpgDirectory.getImageWidth());
        }

        return photo;
    }
    ...
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Install the React libraries needed:</p>
 
 
 <code>npm i react-photo-gallery@8 --force
npm i react-images</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>In <code>src/test/javascript/cypress/integration/entity/photo.spec.ts</code>, remove the code that sets the calculated data in the <code>should create an instance of Photo</code> test:</p>
 
 
 <code>cy.get(`[data-cy="height"]`).type('99459').should('have.value', '99459');
cy.get(`[data-cy="width"]`).type('61514').should('have.value', '61514');
cy.get(`[data-cy="taken"]`).type('2021-10-11T16:46').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T16:46');
cy.get(`[data-cy="uploaded"]`).type('2021-10-11T15:23').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T15:23');</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, you’ll need to add type hints for Drew Noake’s EXIF processing library in <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/Flickr2App.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@org.springframework.nativex.hint.TypeHint(
    types = {
        ...
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifIFD0Directory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifSubIFDDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.ExifThumbnailDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.makernotes.AppleMakernoteDirectory.class,
        com.drew.metadata.exif.GpsDirectory.class,
})
@org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint(options = "-H:+AddAllCharsets")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The <code>@NativeHint(options = "-H:+AddAllCharsets")</code> solves the following exception that happens when you upload a photo:</p>
 
 
 
 Caused by: java.nio.charset.UnsupportedCharsetException: Cp1252
    at java.nio.charset.Charset.forName(Charset.java:528) ~[native-executable:na]
    at com.drew.lang.Charsets.&lt;clinit&gt;(Charsets.java:40) ~[na:na] 
 
 
 
<p>Once you’ve made all the changes (or cloned the <code>spring-native</code> branch), you can build your hip native binary.</p>
 
 
 Build a native JHipster app 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.3.0.r17-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, use Maven to build the project. Skip tests since there’s no support for Mockito at this time.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative,prod -DskipTests</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will take a few minutes to complete.</p>
 
 
 
 Configure your OpenID Connect identity provider 
 
<p>When you generate a JHipster app with OAuth 2.0 / OIDC for authentication, it defaults to using Keycloak. It creates a <code>src/main/docker/keycloak.yml</code> file for Docker Compose, as well as a <code>src/main/docker/realm-config</code> directory with files to auto-create users and OIDC clients.</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to use Keycloak for your running app, start it with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather use Okta or Auth0, that’s possible too!</p>
 
 
 Use Okta as your identity provider 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>You’ll need to source the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI creates to override the default Spring Security settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>source .okta.env</code> 
 
 
 






If you’re on Windows, you can modify this file to use <code>set</code> instead of <code>export</code> and rename it to <code>okta.bat</code>. Then, run it with <code>okta.bat</code> from the command line.



 
 






Modify your existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to have <code>*.env</code> so you don’t accidentally check in your secrets!



 
 
<p>Skip to <a>Run your native JHipster app</a> if you’ve configured your app for Okta and just want to see it running.</p>
 
 
 
 Use Auth0 as your identity provider 
 
<p>To switch from Keycloak to Auth0, override the Spring Security OAuth properties. You don’t even need to write any code!</p>
 
 
<p>To see how it works, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file in the root of your project, and fill it with the code below to override the default OIDC settings:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;your-client-secret&gt;
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to create a new web application in Auth0 and fill in the <code>&lt;…​&gt;</code> placeholders before this works.</p>
 
 
 Create an OpenID Connect app on Auth0 
 
<p>Log in to your Auth0 account (or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account). You should have a unique domain like <code>dev-xxx.eu.auth0.com</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Press the Create Application button in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications">Applications section</a>. Use a name like <code>JHipster Native!</code>, select <code>Regular Web Applications</code>, and click Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Switch to the Settings tab and configure your application settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Allowed Callback URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code></p>
 
 
<p>Allowed Logout URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>Copy your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret into the <code>.auth0.env</code> file you created earlier. Then, run <code>source .auth0.env</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles">roles</a> section, create new roles named <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new user account in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/users">users</a> section. Click on the Role tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.</p>
 
 
<p>Make sure your new user’s email is verified before attempting to log in!</p>
 
 
<p>Next, head to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules &gt; Create. Select the <code>Empty rule</code> template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Group claims</code> and replace the Script content with the following.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `https://www.jhipster.tech/${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This code is adding the user’s roles to a custom claim (prefixed with <code>https://www.jhipster.tech/roles</code>). Click Save changes to continue.</p>

 Run your native JHipster app 
 
<p>After you’ve built your app, it will be available in <code>target/native-executable</code>. Start Keycloak or source your Okta/Auth0 settings. Then, run the following commands:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run ci:e2e:prepare # start docker dependencies
./target/native-executable</code> 
 
 
 
<p>It should start in under a second!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 What does the JHipster Native blueprint do? 
 
 
<p>The JHipster Native plugin integrates Spring Native into a JHipster project based on <a href="https://github.com/mraible/spring-native-examples#readme">findings from the research by Josh Long and me</a>. I documented our findings in September and December 2021.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Sep 30, 2021: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-matt-raible/">JHipster Works with Spring Native!</a></p>
 
 
<p>Dec 14, 2021: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/jhipster-works-spring-native-part-2-matt-raible/">JHipster works with Spring Native, Part 2!</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The unexpected thing is, one of the hardest problems we had to solve was with JPA and relationships. In JVM mode, everything worked fine. When running in native mode, <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/17794">there was an exception</a>. The solution took days to figure out, but was quite simple to fix: I just had to add a type hint for <code>java.util.HashSet.class</code>. 🤯</p>
 
 
<p>During this experience, I was surprised to find that Spring Native <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/issues/465">doesn’t support caching yet</a>. I believe this support will be added by the community soon. In the meantime, if you’re looking to start/stop your infra as fast as possible, you probably don’t care about caching. Caching is made for long-lived, JVM-strong, JVM-loving apps.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What’s the performance like? 
 
 
<p>The native binary starts in just over 500ms (581ms) on my 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 
 
<p>If I start it in JVM mode with Maven, it takes just under five seconds.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>As far as build time goes, Spring Native says:</p>
 
 
 
 Finished generating 'native-executable' in 3m 10s. 
 
 
 
<p>If I build a Docker image with the native binary:</p>
 
 
 
 mvn spring-boot:build-image -Pprod 
 
 
 
<p>It takes a while the first time:</p>
 
 
 
 Total time:  06:30 min 
 
 
 
<p>And it’s slightly faster the second time:</p>
 
 
 
 Total time:  06:18 min 
 
 
 
<p>The amount of memory used after starting: <code>180 MB</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The amount of memory used after running <code>npm run e2e</code>: <code>196 MB</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, here’s the command I used to measure the amount of memory used:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color native | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)" MB";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>What about the M1 Max? That’s <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1494417051137585152">not an option yet</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2666#issuecomment-1057819284">could be in the next release of GraalVM</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about GraalVM and Spring Native 
 
 
<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning how to make JHipster work with Spring Native and GraalVM. It’s still a work-in-progress. Startup time isn’t the end-all-be-all metric, but it is important in a serverless environment.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/tree/spring-native">@oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example repository</a>. The source for the JHipster Native blueprint is in the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-native">@jhipster/generator-jhipster-native repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster also has Micronaut and Quarkus blueprints. However, their native support is currently a work-in-progress. I hope to help improve them in the next few months.</p>

				 <p>Maya</p>
<p>Hi everyone and welcome to this SEO identity community meetup for January 2022. We are very excited to have Gabriel Rene with us today and our topic is how web 3.0 will connect humans, machines, and AI to transform the world. Before we get started we would like to have a few words from heather dahl, CEO of Indicio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heather</p>
<p>Hi Maya, thank you, welcome to everyone, I’m excited to kick off the first of our monthly meetups for 2022. We are moving into our just second year of providing this type of content to the community, and I think the topics that we tackle and the experts that we bring on bring really intriguing conversations. I want to give a special welcome to anyone who’s here and new to our community, it’s so cool to see in the chat where everyone’s coming from. Hamburg, I heard a shout out from Brussels, Dublin, go Fairfax, Virginia, we have Seattle, Canada, by all means if you’re new to the meetup or you’re returning, add your location to the conversation because I think it’s really interesting that we bring together this global community. For those of you who aren’t familiar with Indicio, we are a public benefit company, and our mission is to advance decentralized identity. A part of our mission is running educational events like this, and because we’re out there building ecosystems for trusted data, today’s topic we find really exciting, absolutely provocative, excited to see Gabe here, and to talk about the internet of everything, and what it means for people and digital objects and non-digital objects to provide identity and to communicate with each other in ways that are secure and trustworthy. Ken was supposed to be here today to lead the conversation but he couldn’t make it, so senior architect Sam Curren is here to lead the conversation and interview with our absolutely terrific guest, Gabrielle Rene, thank you all for being here and I’m gonna turn it over to you Sam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Thanks Heather, and and thanks Gabriel for being here, I guess we should start with an introduction, that’s appropriate, Gabriel is the architect of the spatial web, it’s a vision he’s described with his co-author Dan Mapes, in the international best-selling book titled the spatial web, how web 3.0 will connect hans machines and ai to transform the world. He’s the executive director at VERSUS lab and the spatial web foundation, and he and his team are bringing this vision to life. The groundbreaking hyperspatial markup language is currently being discussed at a new working group with the IEEE, both web 3 and the metaverse have been recent hot topics in the last couple of months but the spatial web is where the real becomes virtual and the virtual real. So welcome to Gabriel Rene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me Sam, thank you Heather, and Ken when you watch this hopefully we’re doing you proud, good work. on your behalf so Sam thank you, thanks for hosting me today, and it’s an honor to be here and have a chance to speak to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Excellent, I’ve been stunt doubling for Ken in a few areas and I’m not as good looking as Ken is but I’ll do my best. So excellent all right, let’s dive into some questions here, and please answer with whatever you think is relevant, and we can take this discussion wherever we need to go. So you’ve described the spatial web as the internet of everything and you’ve thought a lot about what the internet of everything will look like, what do you see?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well the first thing I see is a more holistic approach to the concept of the application of network computing technologies, like the internet, and a lot of times what tends to occur is that perspectives on emerging technology are industry specific or technology specific. We talk about AI or we talk about XR, we talk about IOT or we talk about blockchain, and we talk about quant, or it’s by industry, this applies to the government or this applies to supply chain which applies to retail and this applies to healthcare. So these narratives are constantly emerging where we even have these themes: human 2.0, we have dialogues around web 3.0, industry 4.0, and the Japanese are talking about society 5.0. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all of those cases almost the exact same set of technologies are being discussed, and it’s the usual suspects I just rattled off. Some people started talking about the internet of things a handful of years ago, this idea that it wasn’t just the internet where we had sort of interconnected communications, but rather these physical connected smart devices would form this new network. That was very exciting, it remains exciting, we’ve yet to see a whole lot of it work. I can tell you that the smart home struggle is real, and interoperability is at the heart of every problem. So this idea that you can connect things is one level, then there’s another debate about things being smart. So at one level you’ve got the internet of things, and then there’s been spatial computing, which has really emerged around this idea and is now re being repackaged again into the metaverse narrative, which you might call the internet of non-things, or sort of virtual things, that are not things or “what are they” things. And then there’s been this idea that is the blockchain folks saying that the internet of money, or the internet of trust, it sort of starts to intersect with the work that your community is doing. And there’s the internet of intelligence thing, which is the AI folks attempt early on the semantic web again. Whether we use the internet, or the web, or some sort of talking variations of this kind of a network where the data is intelligent or smart in and of itself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term smart, which has taken over everything, so there’s a smartphone that was the first thing, it’s just a computer, but that’s fine it’s a smartphone. Why? Because it has some connected capability, and in the beginning smart meant connected. As machine learning and deep learning found its footing over the last decade. The idea of things becoming smart meant actually being intelligent to the feedback loops, adaptive smart home now means that your nest adjusts the temperature for you, and that the lights turn on and off based on some feedback loop or information. Then of course we’re talking about smart cities, and so we go from smartphones, smart things, smart cars, smart cities, the idea is that these cities become intelligent and adaptive. Your autonomous car is able to just drive. Because, traffic is this sort of amorphous thing, like a bunch of starlings moving through. Drones and automated functionality that the amazon go, vacation of everything, you walk into a store, you take what you want, you walk out. All these sort of smart functions that might be built into government services, and all this sort of future sci-fi smart city narratives, but when I spoke to a community of smart cities four years ago in Europe, cities that came together to explore this, their number one thing was well how do we connect with other smart cities? So how do we form a network of smart cities? Well smart cities with all these smart cars and smartphones and smart devices and smart things with these internet and web connections across these various sets of interests and industries forms what you might call a smart world. And that idea that you’ve got this global cyber physical network now that encompasses all of these things, and that the addressability of an object isn’t just that it’s connected, it might just be that it’s being viewed by a camera, it could be an object that has no internet connection in and of itself, but this network has its own, and it’s essentially showing up on the network, that network we call the spatial web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Really good explanation, so a natural follow-on to that, I realize that web 3.0 has become a loaded term. You used it first in the title of your book, obviously, so it’s recorded there, but it’s come to mean some different things in recent times. Using sort of your original meaning of web 3.0 why doesn’t web 2.0 already solve this? What is missing from what we’ve got today that we need to go where we need to go?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well there’s a handful of things, and I think that some of the architects of web 1.0 have lamented about some of the infrastructure decisions that were made at the time. Now there were technical limitations or practical limitations, hardly anyone actually cared, but there were debates around identity and privacy and security, there was a tendency, being academics and scientists, not to think too deeply into all of the societal implications of these technologies. So the anticipation that people would use this for good, and not for personal, selfish, or otherwise harmful ends was the default. “Oh it’s gonna be this awesome network and we’re gonna do information sharing” great, problem solved. Decades of work had gone into that, from the ARPAnet all the way up into the world wide web, where you have Tim Berners-lee pulling a bunch of threads together and stitching that into what became the backbone of this amazing communications network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity was actually one of the real missing ingredients in my opinion, and that anonymity part, the thing that makes the web open is also the thing that makes the web dangerous. The hackers, trackers, and fakers that are permeating our lives from simple sort of issues around misrepresentation, all the way to identity theft, all the way to now ransomware, and we’re about one hop away from biotech, and people being able to hack devices that were what we’re wearing, or that are on our bodies, or that are in our bodies, and so the the openness of the web is a double-edged sword that seems to cut both ways. That allowed the web 2.0 era organizations and companies to maximize the capital potential of that structure, and so they essentially monetized that openness, that anonymity was a function of the sort of the fact that you didn’t have an identity, so we’ll rent you one. We’re google here’s ours, we’re Facebook here’s ours, apple here’s one for you as well, how about one for linkedin and facebook? Alright so we all run around with these sort of two-dimensional avatars, locked in these digital fighters where we serve certain functions. We get certain services from that, so i don’t think that a pure polarized view on this looking at web 2.0 is inherently negative is fair or accurate, but these are major holes in the architecture that allowed for this type of capitalism to thrive in a new dimension, and that thriving has compromised some of the inherent freedoms, and some might say human rights. Now It’s becoming part of the debate: what property do we own here with respect to our data? And I think that those holes have produced really horrific outcomes, like not just on the monetization side, but on how we are programmed into wanting or thinking certain things. One of those things are products and services, whether those things are our own ideas about ourselves and our identity and our self-image, or whether it’s our viewpoint on the effectiveness of vaccines and science, and what political representative we think is in our best interests. You can no longer separate the technical work that we’ve done here with the web and our societal implications, and that’s the real zeitgeist challenge that I think we face at this moment. It requires some new ways of thinking about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’ve talked about some architectural adjustments that would get that will help get us there, one of one of those pieces of architecture i think is the hyperspatial markup language, HSML, that is part of your work at the IEEE, can you describe what HSML will help us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah, so just one quick parenthetical, and it’s a function of a little bit of us copying something. It is HSML, but it’s hyperspatial modeling language instead of markup language, although there was quite a bit of debate internally about whether that was an accurate description. The function of a market language and a modern language are different, but depending on your perspective, in this case it is about modeling at the heart of it. How do we model the world digitally in a way that is coherent with the way that humans cognize the world? And I provide that caveat because there are other ways of cognizing the world that we’re unable to be aware of, and that is not what our concern is with respect to what we need to teach machines or AIs. We need to ensure that they can cognize the world in a way that is similar, or compatible, or at least incorporates our understanding of reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What HSML does is it functions in a sort of semIOTic structure of forming the core elements, in which there are 12, that act like a language. So just like nouns, verbs, prepositions, and adjectives are sufficient components with which to construct descriptions and representation of reality that predominantly is all we’re using today. Like today I’m just using magic mouth sounds to paint pictures in everyone’s heads, and if I had it with squiggly lines it would do nearly as well. But if i could just do what we’ve been able to see some whales and some dolphins do which is actually just project an entire three-dimensional holographic representation of this particular bay, and the position of all the fish, kind of like a sonar snapshot, and just send that to you 20 miles away, “like hey the party’s over here, here’s where the fish are guys” that might be another way to communicate. So HSML enables multiple IOT devices to do what’s called sensor fusion, or data fusion, even policy fusion. So you can take information from sensors, we take information from databases, and you can take policy related information laws, or instructions, or whatever, and you can fuse those together into a multi-layered scene graph, which is a way of representing the information about any set of activities in any given space. All of the objects in the space, all the users in the space, all the activities in space, all the permissions in the space, and at the end of the day that it is intended to enable you to construct descriptions of states of things, and then describe workflows for what needs to happen, so you could conceivably program all the smart things in your house to work in a very certain particular way, one could inform another one, and this could then extend all the way out into the city, and so forth and so forth to the world at large. So the idea of making a standard here in the in many of the same ways that HTML allows us to structure content and information on pages, HSML lets us structure context and information in spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So I like that the modeling of context is a sign of something that sort of begun to happen, but without much organization. So when the web was new it was a new location, we would visit websites and we would go there and it was all about this new world and this new place, and honestly web 2.0 was a lot of that too. IOT starts to get a little interesting because now there’s this internet of things, but the things generally exist in real life and also on the internet, so it’s blending now between there. Of course now we’ve got augmented reality, and virtual reality, and a lot of things that pull that together, so when we think about all this stuff that in the real life that’s sort of blending together with a digital life that means like a proliferation of cameras and sensors and objects that we can interact with etc. So this means identity for everything, which is great. But there’s some implications here that the tinfoil hat wears among us, and I occasionally wear one of a particular shape. What are the implications of all of this interconnectedness upon the privacy we have and maybe governance that can help us with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, so that was the question we started to ask ourselves back in 2016, which was all of that connectedness, all of that capability, all of that monitoring was going to happen anyway. Like that was the clear thing that was happening, so then the question became okay can you ensure certain levels of interoperability? And you need that in order to enable governance, if things are not interoperable you can make as many rules as you like, and it doesn’t it doesn’t matter. So what there’s a bit of a logical cake here, coherence is the first requirement, if you have coherence then interoperability is a function of your description of coherence. What is or isn’t coherent, like if you can describe the physics of the environment, and you want to say how you navigate through it, you can’t do it until you’ve done the first part. And then governance is a function of saying well what you can or cannot do are the ways that you must then navigate that environment, or who can when and what time and all sorts of all the parameters of activity management or activity governance. Because governance at the end of the day is really about changing states in the world. It’s not a theoretical function, it’s a practical function, and so that was what we saw as being really the scariest thing I’ve ever noticed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this cyber stuff is going to get all interconnected, you’re going to end up with this internet of everything. Which there was no term spatial web in that sense, the GIS community had been using it for many years, but not in the sense that we saw this multi-dimensional, multimodal sort of thing, it was like okay this internet of everything is going to happen, there are a handful of real challenges with that, including the possibility for abuse and looking at how wonderfully we did the web 2.0. this was just going to cascade into essentially black mirror, that’s what we’re all concerned about. So it was at that time that identity became clear to me that it was a fundamental infrastructural architectural requirement. Having been in telecom before that, and looking at telemedicine services, that was when I started looking at blockchain and the idea that you might need to own these assets related to your medical history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I wasn’t interested in crypto in the beginning, Bitcoin seemed interesting, but not enough for me to buy any or care, blockchain looked really interesting, and this idea that you would own your sort of property. At that point I started looking for what kind of new identity structure, or what would become like a spatial web url, some sort of key identifier, and that’s when I came across the work that many of you on this call were pioneering. You were working on it before that of course, but also like right around that time, and that was a real eye opener, and it frankly made it possible for us to focus on the other bits. Because it was like this community is completely dedicated to the identity, in our version of this the human is one of those entities, or one of those actors, but every single object, including conceptual objects, can have a DID in the spatial web, and all of these are sort of structured using HSML, and some of these other ontology and taxonomy structures you’re looking at to maintain that coherence. That then grants you this ability to do governance, which gives you the second portion of this of the standard, which is called HSTP, which is hyperspace transaction protocol. What that does is it basically says “okay cool world give me all the information of the states of all these objects, users, actors,” and again they could be holographic objects in that space that that you otherwise wouldn’t be aware of, the IOT device isn’t going to pick that up, but the space knows that it’s there. You sent me something to this room so I could present it on this call as an example. I wanted to get this exact “xyz” position and I knew it was coming. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today one challenge is that you can send anything you want to my email address, I can’t stop you, you can come to my website, I can’t stop you, in fact you can send money to my eth wallet, and I cannot prevent that. But in the spatial web those everything is sort of permission based, and so that ability to then transport objects users activities and the governance around those is described in HSML, and essentially activated using HSTP, which says what are those states, i would like this state to change this way, or if the state changes what is or isn’t allowed in this case in this space, and HSTP says that transaction has passed or failed. So if only Heather is allowed to enter this room, if the temperature is x, and the time of day is y, and her facial expression or other biometric information says she’s in a certain state, all of which are just inputs that would be happening with any modern technology, but now could coherently say okay Heather’s at the right state the door can open and if she’s not then then the door remains closed. So this becomes you are able to program cyber physical activities, and define the governance for those if you were an authority of that space, and so that is the key sort of requirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>I think that it’s important that this doesn’t invent some brand new type of authority, but rather gives existing authorities the ability to express the rules about what they have authority over. So our house still remains our house, and I posit that we’ll have even more control over what’s actually going on in it from a digital perspective than we do today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes and so you could ensure that nothing is installed in your house, if it doesn’t make a certain threshold of some privacy standard, or that requires some certificate, if it doesn’t have it, it can’t it can’t be there, or it can’t turn on. The city could say drones are only allowed to fly in the city in these specific flight lanes, and if they have cameras on them those cameras are allowed to be on, but the drone cannot fly within five miles of the airport. it can’t have its cameras on when it’s flying over schools, or certain private properties, or certain zones, and all this can be spatially defined as if it were a video game. But now you can do it in the physical world in any digitally mediated set of functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>And that’s an incredibly powerful piece of this, so to switch gears just a little bit, we’ve talked about the blending of the digital and the real life thing, but with it with better technology that we’ve got for for things like virtual reality, you can now sort of have a spatially aware virtual thing, instead of a website that we’re looking at as a docent on a screen. So how do these same concepts apply in a pure virtual space? Where I might be in a fictitious world rather than in real life, and what’s the blend between the real and the virtual?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I love that question, so if you’ll allow me to nerd out for a moment, if you’ve seen the original avengers series of movies that marvel put out, there’s a moment where you get the arc of bruce banner and the hulk. It’s like when he can or cannot become the hulk, and everyone’s afraid he’s going to do it, in the final scene of the first avengers movie they’re like “Bruce get angry”, and he goes “that’s my trick I’m always angry”. So the the parallel here is that it’s actually always virtual, in one instance it must map to the physical world, in all other instances it doesn’t need to. So a harry potter world or the death star rendered in a 3d engine somewhere can have all the exact same authorities, and policies, and functions that apply. Vader is allowed to apparently strangle people at the helm of the thing, and Dumbledore, if he does something wrong the ministry fires him for a couple weeks, he’s got to go into hiding. So there are actually policies and things that exist in these virtual spaces, as we look at things like decentraland, and ownership, and NFTs, and assets and rights around this we’re going to need certain guarantees around what we can trust in these environments. How these authority structures are set up what is transparent, and and what we can investigate, what we can audit and so building property in a virtual world that you don’t ultimately have ownership of, or you can’t take those assets somewhere else, for example you don’t have any rights in roblox or fortnite they can do whatever they want, it’s a corporation they own it they can just change it, and change all your assets, change your skins, they can just flip the whole thing they can sell it, they can take the company public, there’s all kinds of other functions and interests at play. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if we expect and of course it seems natural that we’re going to want digital assets, they are becoming increasingly valuable, they’re also becoming increasingly more realistic, and to that degree at some point even experiences themselves will be indistinguishable from reality. Our senses are not that sophisticated, and you have people like Elon and others working on neural link, and others working on neural dust, that at some point are not going to require any sort of ocular interface. There’s not just a singularity of AI, there’s a singularity of reality that is a whole consideration that’s coming, so having certain guarantees around these environments will become increasingly important. This whole move with cryptocurrency, which is native internet money, and now NFTs, which are really smart assets, well not yet, they’re smart receipts to a virtual asset. I think DID’s really get you all the way across the line there, and HSML by the way would allow you to describe the asset in such a way that it would match up. So with the IDs in HSML I would know all these attributes down to color, texture, size or whatever is that version of that thing, and not just a receipt that says that I own something which could be copied a thousand times. A bit wondering of an answer but hopefully that hit a couple of notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>No, that’s fantastic, so I want to draw something out a little bit. You sort of talked about how the same applies when I brought up this virtual versus real thing. You said real is the only instance where it actually needs to line up with reality and all these other things can exist virtually as well, that sounds like the metaverse has been talked about by a lot of folks and facebook audaciously renamed themselves to sort of try and own the space. What’s the difference here between the hyperspatial web that you see and the vision of the metaverse that facebook or other companies might be interested in offering?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Okay great question, so i think that i’ll try and provide a nuanced answer. I actually think everyone is making their best attempt to describe the same thing, which is an open and interoperable network. I think the battle right now is not for Facebook to become AOL, everyone’s seen this we’ve all seen this game before, like you don’t you don’t ultimately win with a closed version of this thing. In fact facebook thrives on an open web so that’s not a requirement that they sort of close their borders and they’re going to defend those borders, i think the battle right now is who’s the wordpress of the metaverse. Where are you going to go to build your sites, your stuff, who’s going to provide all the services, all the plugins, all that. So it’s not about Facebook changing their name to Meta and then saying we’re all about the metaverse, even though they’ve been the least arguably the least trustworthy brand in the modern era since I don’t know, Exxon. We go towards well they want to keep doing the same thing and making money the same way and that’s what Meta is for. I don’t actually think that, I think this is a massive pivot for the company, and that they’re doomed. I talk about this in the book. I don’t think that surveillance capitalism will be a profitable business in 10 years. I think it completely comes apart, look at GDPR right now saying google analytics is not going to work here anymore. That’s his web 2.0 getting smashed, these pillars are already coming down, and I think Mark Zuckerberg has seen this coming since the day he walked in to lucky palmers and put on something that was a space and realized that he had a company about a book. He must have said “oh it’s no longer about pages it’s about spaces” and we’re just seeing the arc of that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark wants an economy, he wants to build the largest economy with the largest amount of services to capture the most. Now people will willingly give over their data in order to optimize and maximize all kinds of inputs and data services around that. He doesn’t have to stay in that same game, and if he doesn’t get out of that game, while building hardware that’s capturing biometric information, the regulators are just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and the laws and the walls are going to close in. So I don’t see a way out of this for surveillance capitalism-centered businesses, and I think actually that they’re smart enough to know that. This is why they already just announced last week, “hey we’re Twitter, everyone NFTs we have NFTs now” you can take them and move things around. You can build assets as well, say the asset I would like to move around is everything that you have about me, so let me NFT my data, and then I want to move it around, okay that’s what i would like. So I think that everyone’s still pointing in the same direction, and if you’re not, and you think that you’re gonna be the prodigy in aol, it didn’t work last time, but we’re gonna really give it a shot this time. So I just I think everyone’s smart enough not to repeat that play, but just like the oil companies and the automobile companies drag their feet as long as possible squeezing every dollar out of something that was causing arguable harm to the world, they still need to maximize the lens that they operate on, which is a fundamentally, their corporations with capital based goals. So now everyone ever wants an electric car, but it took someone like Elon and Tesla to just come in and change the whole game. So think that that’s what’s happening here, is that the battles for the wordpress of the spatial web or the wordpress of the metaverse, no one’s going to win being the siloed version of the metaverse where you don’t own any of your stuff. It’s going to be a wasteland.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a fantastic answer, so we’ve talked about this vision and i think we all have a vision in our minds of what this looks like, we see even films depict this like Ready Player One for example does a really great job like laying out this universe of what it could possibly be like in the future. What’s less clear is how we get from today to there. What does this roll out actually look like? Is there a cut over? Is there a gradual way we get there? What’s this like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Well I mean I can only guess like the rest, but the hardware is the problem. So that’s why you’re seeing billions and billions of dollars being poured into that space, and more or less everyone is going there, so everyone wanted a smartphone. Does everyone remember the facebook smartphone that came out? That lasted like an hour. So Mark was very smart in jumping in on the VR thing when everyone thought that was just whatever, and Google said we’re going to play around in the AR space and their commitment has been soft. Two steps forward, one step back, and a lot of people in that community have not been happy about it, then Magic Leap emerged and said we’re gonna we’re gonna be the new Apple of this space. They said we only need a few billion dollars, and then “oh we spent it all” because it’s hardware and it’s absolutely the worst possible thing to work on, and it’s super hard. So you’re talking about innovation in battery life, innovation in optics, innovation in computing, and it’s just there’s so many pieces. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like that smartphone moment again, which is why Apple just takes their time, and does the exact same thing they always do, waiting in the background so a lot of the froth is squeezed out and some of the core problems are solved, then they find their own path in. They’re like we don’t care about the metaverse, we’re not talking about the metaverse and they’re gonna come out with something different. But you’re gonna see four or five of these all start to really hit the market in a meaningful way, variations on AR and VR or hybrid sort of mixed reality devices or glasses. Then you’ve got Qualcomm, and others that are building chips now that have so much capability in them, AI powered chips with powerful spatial computing capabilities on it. So you’re gonna get 25 chinese companies that are making essentially the android versions of these things. I think by next year we’re going to see sort of that “iPhone 1” moment, and then that’s going to kick off the party. By the end of the decade, for some that can afford it, because the prices will go down you will have those early “Ready Player One” moments. Halfway into the next decade it seems like that’s the dominant thing so that’s the arc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course one of the places we’re looking at, because we always tend to look at this through the consumer market lens, really where a lot of this is needed is in industrial spaces. In warehouses and ports, mining and agriculture, and that’s where the holographic part of this is only one layer, like you could think of the metaverse as sort of being the internet of experience. It’s a human-like interface layer of the spatial web while the internet of things is a machine interface. You having an experience where you go into a store, you grab some stuff, a bunch of cameras identify you and the object, and your account, and your wallet, and you walk out and it just charges you, that’s not a metaverse experience. That’s that you’re embedded in a mesh network of the internet of things, but from our lens that’s still the spatial web, and if then something popped up in front of you that gave you a holographic receipt and that was maybe that’s part of the metaverse. But if as you’re walking into the environment you’re seeing information displayed on top of all of the items saying “hey you’re gluten-free this week how about 10 off that”, that’s a metaversal layer on top of an IOT mediated experience. So you have to consider that component, that sort of digitization of the physical, and physicalization of the digital. These things are intersecting, and one sort of abstract point here is that, that’s what language is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The experience that a deer has of the physics of a space is almost identical. The deer is in my living room. It can navigate that room better than I can, it understands the objects, but it doesn’t know what they are. But I’ve embedded the meaning, “oh that’s my couch, that’s my tv, that this is a picture of my family” it can see all those things, but it doesn’t know what they are. So I’ve embedded this virtual layer of meaning into the world, all these objects have terms, functions, and ideas. I know what they’re supposed to do. A monkey can still tell that it can sit on a couch, it understands the basic physics, it understands gravity, it can even understand the function of a couch, in that manner, but it doesn’t know whether that it might be meaningful socially to me whether it’s from Ikea or it’s from some fancy italian store. That’s a social virtual layer that humans, the human monkey has embedded into the world around us. We both configured it physically, like we shaped all this stuff, all these objects, but we’ve also added this whole virtual layer. Now we’re just doing it in a completely multi-dimensional way, so that the sort of digital twinification is putting those data sets onto the objects, and into the environment, and then we’re going into those sort of imaginary spaces that we put in our brains that we put into books we put in pictures we put into paintings we put into films. Now we’re just making them fully experiential. I think that’s that big shift, is moving from the information based web, to this experiential based web, whether that’s in the physical world or the digital world. Those blurred lines really create some new kind of digital environment and digital era. I don’t have a good word for it, that’s not a good word, forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>That’s a good start though. So you’ve implied that the roll out of the spatial web is not tied to the success in the hardware of augmented reality or virtual virtual reality hardware, meaning it can start sooner. So what does the rollout of the spatial web technologies look like as opposed to things that are tied to a VR or AR experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yeah what a good question. So well one of the things we just spoke about was it’s really the IOT first perspective. So in a warehouse you’ve got workers that essentially spend eight hours a day walking around 100,000 square feet trying to locate an item in a box. So what you do is you you build a three-dimensional map in your head, because some things are high, and something’s low, and some things are on the second floor, and then you get an order on your android phone it says go to row 17, isle 12 section l and grab item xj4-92. Okay where am I? You do all this three-dimensional triangulation, and then you route yourself. What we found is if you build a digital twin of that entire environment, and you map the inventory into every single location, so you now embedded the information into the space, you can take that same android phone and route that person to that location, and the cognitive load drops in half, and they basically speed up by 30 percent. The productivity, and performance, and actually the mental cost, the tax, we think about “oh people working hard for eight hours and now you’re making them more productive” there are some societal concerns about optimizing human activity in these environments, and there’s been some real concerns about how amazon is doing it, at the same time if you can reduce the cognitive load that’s actually the most expensive part for them, and so that’s one of the functions. So you’re building a three-dimensional twin you’re embedding the information into the environment, and you’re routing the human worker through that, now ultimately that human worker is hands and feet, because you’re no longer relying on the brain to do that much so the ability to then have humans and robots working in that same space or having humans in the day and robots at night or any combination thereof is a function of creating that shared model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> If there’s a shared model, whether it’s in the city and how how drones then decide are the certain flight lanes that they have, or or government policy that says in europe maybe the eu wants to say that the total flight height for all drones of a certain class is 120 meters, but in the netherlands they might want to say that it’s 100, and brussels maybe they say it’s 80, and as a drone passes through, it cannot ever go higher than 120, but as it goes through the netherlands and over the brussels it has to go down and then down. This is the machine’s view of the spatial web, and all of those capabilities and things are necessary right now, look at the supply chain, we had 500,000 cargo containers sitting off the coast here over christmas, and that’s because the ability for these systems to be able to communicate to each other is really poor, and our understanding of supply and demand globally is really bad. You have something like the pandemic hit and the butterfly fly effect is just happening all over the place and we’re not resilient enough to be able to adapt at this scale.&nbsp;So that’s really what the ultimate value of something like the spatial web means, adaptation. So it’s about the internet of experience over here on the metaverse side, the internet of things, this industry 4.0 narrative is about automation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s really the goal. Can we use machines and algorithms to automate physical functions in the system, and if you did that the impact on climate and the amount of carbon we’d be using would be hyper optimized, and we could set thresholds and regulations and the machines could adapt and adjust this. Instead something like the pandemic hits, we all go to Amazon and buy everything we ever wanted to buy because we can’t go anywhere, and then we just log jam every port in the world. This allows us to start to get a more holistic view, and the way that we start to look at the function of monitoring is not so much monitoring and surveillance, because those capabilities will be there, but if you use things like verifiable credentials, you use things like the IDs, and these get built into law and regulation, then we have we can have the ability to share this kind of information with each other. So you can set up a relay race of an adaptive supply chain, don’t send the automated truck until the thing arrives at the port, minimizing the total amount of carbon output. This adaptive thing is very much what organic systems do, this is how the body manages, you’ve got the autonomic nervous system, we need autonomous supply chains. These are the kind of functions that you can have in the spatial web which are absolutely critical, that are not about having an awesome virtual experience or or trying to sell a jpeg for a million bucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>So you’re claiming then that the world yesterday needs the spatial web, and that the visualization can currently be done, maybe in a 2d factor, or something like on a smartphone, or other flat screens that we have, and then as soon as the AR and VR get ready it’ll slide right into to that function for visualization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>That’s a really important point in this, in the warehouse we have an application that is multi-modal, and some people prefer just the audio, like with turn-by-turn instructions. Some people want to look at the map, some people prefer to hear it, some people want both, in our cases a lot of the workers are spanish so they want spanish audio. Generally they don’t want 3d, we started with 3d holograms, people were like “this is awesome, but i just need this” this is what’s most useful for me. So even this idea that “oh yeah 3d information is better and holograms are better”, we started doing that four years ago, and everyone was impressed and it was faster and easier, but it hurt to wear the headset for eight hours and the battery would only last three hours. So the hardware isn’t ready on that front, but cameras, AI, algorithms, and computer vision are ready to go, and so that’s a place where this is able to start. It’s really quite useful in some of these really critical environments that are far more relevant to our day-to-day lives and not so much in the entertainment or gaming or space. There’ll be education, we won’t be doing zooms like this, we’ll all be awkwardly sitting around a very large table, but there are functions today that are super meaningful for deploying the capabilities and use of the spatial web, and this is without even getting into any of the the broader needs around how DIDs can permeate, and self-sovereign identity is relevant in and of itself. Just like land title ownership by the dimensions this is going to end up being the domains of the spatial web, we will essentially be bound like boundaries. Your home is a domain, your property is a domain, the city’s a domain, today we think of domains as urls but domains in the spatial web are spaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Absolutely, so you’ve hinted at this a little already, which is really powerful. What do governments and companies do now to prepare for the coming spatial web?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>I mean I think that there are a few groups that governments and researchers and regulators need to start becoming aware of. Predominantly that’s the work that’s being done around DIDs and DIDcomm, verifiable credentials, and the spatial web foundations working group at the IEEE. I think those are the critical components that you need to understand. I think that there is a more provocative branch off of this question, which is what role do governments play in virtual worlds? So it’s outside your jurisdiction, so what is legal or not not legal, and who says and how? So thinking about your geopolitical domain is one thing, thinking about people physically in your dimension that are experiencing something in another dimension that you have no jurisdictional power or authority over is a question. This ties into larger questions of governance, i mean Minecraft i think is eight times the size of earth. That’s big, that’s a big space, okay that’s one little world, you’re talking there’ll be thousands and then hundreds of thousands. There’s 300 million websites today, there’ll be billions and billions of these environments and spaces, at some point AIs will just auto generate whatever experience you want. Just start choosing adventure in real time based on biometric feedback, so the possibilities here are going to get really weird, really interesting. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chinese quote may you live in interesting times is sort of a double-edged sword. These are interesting times and so these are the kinds of questions. The last question I want to leave you with on this point is if Disney land or H&amp;M or whoever builds a store in decentraland, can I build a Disney store right next to the Disney store in decentraland? Who’s preventing it? Are they respecting the trademark and IP agreements of the United States? We will need treaties between organizations, countries on earth, and in these virtual worlds as if they were other planets. In the same way that we had to look at these challenges when we formed the league of nations or the united nations, we’re going to have other dimensions that we need to interact with that have entire economies that we trade in where the jurisdictions don’t apply. Then again who do you trust in those environments relative to what authorities? And so what prevents me from doing that in decentraland? Why can’t I sell Disney merch? or modify it with marvel or warner brothers stuff or whatever i like? So i think this is where trusts and guarantees around verifiability and credentialing of authorities becomes really critical, and if we’re going to digitize all of this, all of our reality in this next age, and all this money is flowing into the space, these are the kinds of big questions that we’re constantly thinking about and working on with respect to the standards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, we are unfortunately out of time, but this has been great to hear your vision and thoughts around these things. Is there anything you’d like to leave us with?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Yes, I think that the the role of identity is a fundamental pillar, and i think that in the the arc of history when we look at the role of property, and property rights, physical property rights, i just talked about intellectual property rights, data property rights, and digital asset property rights are are the next challenge. This is not a purely philosophical question, this is going to come down to law. So we need to start thinking of what does digital law mean in the 21st century? And making sure that the work we’re doing is addressing some of those questions, or hosting some of those conversations, I’d like to see more constitutional lawyers involved in these conversations. I’d like to see people that are really working through this sort of lens of data rights and ethics having these dialogues. That’s why I think that the next battleground is property rights, with respect to the function of data and the things that data form, which become these new hyperspatial objects in this next era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam</p>
<p>Fantastic, Gabriel, thank you for spending this time with us we’re we’re grateful for your willingness to be here. I hope everyone enjoyed this conversation and we’ll look forward to seeing you all in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabriel</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having me, take care everybody&nbsp;</p>

  The attack on OpenSea users raises legitimate, valid questions about the security of web3 platforms that must be addressed if web3 is to survive &amp; reach mass adoption.

<p>By now, you may have heard about the attack on <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>, the world’s largest NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace, that resulted in roughly $1.7 million worth of NFTs being stolen from users’ wallets. The apparent phishing scam took place on February 19th, and some OpenSea users fell prey to it. </p><p>OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer took to Twitter on the 19th to explain the details the company knew at that point, denying direct responsibility for the hack: “As far as we can tell, this is a phishing attack. We don’t believe it’s connected to the OpenSea website. It appears 32 users thus far have signed a malicious payload from an attacker, and some of their NFTs were stolen.” </p><p>OpenSea later revised the original estimate of 32 affected users to 17, and clarified that some of the NFTs had been returned to their rightful owners, though by <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/02/23/2390008/0/en/UPDATE-Mintable-Recovers-NFTs-Stolen-in-OpenSea-Exploit.html#:~:text=While%203%20NFTs%20have%20been%20recovered%20and%20will%20be%20returned%20by%20Mintable%2C%20over%20a%20million%20dollars%E2%80%99%20worth%20of%20NFTs%20remain%20lost">some reports</a> about $1 million in assets are still unrecovered. </p><p>This attack raises legitimate, valid questions about the security of web3 platforms that must be addressed if web3 is to survive &amp; reach mass adoption. </p><p>In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/31/success-of-web3-hinges-on-remedying-its-security-challenges/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAHZNOQLkIbdMdaa19R3WYV-CGFpWmBY396bPvAF5sATS6Fpai-XQSb_PU9ckqZSo7o8mdRCL5FB_UwqX-sV8upKGEDORCVQskmGwMaDbYTOcpaMeU6bzPU0-ZmE4M4gnidqN8ABfYAjx-9v5V7FOVPsUkq8l7EyZSKm5MwnU52i">TechCrunch article from January</a> titled “Success of web3 hinges on remedying its security challenges,” author Wei Lien Dang lays bare the security tradeoffs between Web 2.0 and web3: “The blockchain does not require actors to be trusted as in Web 2.0, but making updates to address security problems is harder. Users get to maintain control over their identities, but no intermediaries exist to provide recourse in the event of attacks or key compromises (e.g., how Web 2.0 providers can revert stolen funds or reset passwords). Wallets can still leak sensitive information like an Ethereum address – it’s still software, which is never perfect.” </p><p>Dang goes on to say “in Web 2.0, a substantial part of the security model is about response. In web3, where transactions cannot be changed once executed, mechanisms must be built in to verify if transactions should happen in the first place. In other words, security has to be exceptionally good at prevention.” </p><p>The TL;DR: because of the decentralized structure of web3, with users amassing more control of their identities, it’s crucial for platforms to focus on attack prevention, rather than solely on response, which is the previous Web 2.0 mode of handling security. </p><p>Web3 is growing in scope and popularity, and is no longer just a nascent movement populating quiet corners of the internet. As web3 gains momentum, underlying vulnerabilities are coming to light as malicious actors find ways to exploit them, as with the OpenSea attack. Vulnerabilities can stem from issues with authentication, key management, and a plain lack of user knowledge from which attackers can capitalize. Because transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, falling prey to an attack often has no positive resolution for victims. </p><p>Whether or not these security issues are just web3 growing pains or develop into larger, systemic problems remains to be seen. Much of that trajectory depends upon how developers, enterprises, and thought leaders in this space address these problems. Ultimately, if users who are educated enough in the web3 space to be buying NFTs fall for a sophisticated phishing attack, then how can we expect a nontechnical populous to participate in a new, decentralized web that’s supposed to be for everyone? </p><p>We want users to control their identities – to own their credentials, to stop trusting platforms with sensitive information – but enterprises, organizations, and individuals must take seriously the technological challenges posed by a growing web3 movement in order to fully realize that ideal end goal.</p><p>Fortunately, a community built largely by individuals with a passion for a decentralized digital landscape is addressing those vulnerabilities head-on. One such core challenge is privacy-preserving accountability, which NuID’s Trustless Authentication protocol provides. </p><p>In our next blog, we’ll define and explain how NuID provides privacy-preserving accountability to enterprises &amp; assists in furthering the goal of individuals’ self-sovereignty online. </p>

 Massachusetts has advanced its data privacy bill. 



<p></p>



<p>For the first time, the commonwealth has moved the Massachusetts Information Privacy Act beyond the committee stage.</p>



<p>As with all other states who have either passed data privacy legislation or have a proposed bill on the table, Massachusetts wants its citizens to have greater control over their personal information in the digital economy.</p>



<p>In progressing its bill, Massachusetts moves closer to California, Virginia, and Colorado, which have all passed state privacy legislation, although California’s updated law (<a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/cpra-text/">CPRA</a>), and the laws in&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0035">Virginia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2021a_190_signed.pdf">Colorado</a>, don’t take effect until 2023.&nbsp;All these laws restrict how businesses can collect and use the personal information of residents within the relevant state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>State-level pushes for comprehensive privacy bills have never looked stronger, with Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska also&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/01/4-major-data-privacy-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">likely</a>&nbsp;to pass laws in 2022.</p>



<p>Of course, the states continue to act in the absence of a&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-federal-privacy-legislation-tracker/">federal privacy law</a>, which appears to remain a long way off, locked in partisan divisions over the detail.</p>



<p>But the goal remains a single federal privacy law with streamlined compliance obligations for business and clear rights for consumers. Recent discussions have looked at what might be the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/the-us-data-privacy-law-floor-what-deserves-basic-protections/">minimum protections</a>&nbsp;of a national law, and survey results show&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/75-of-americans-want-national-data-privacy-standards/">75%</a>&nbsp;of all Americans want some data privacy standards at the national level.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The organization that is ready to onboard pre-verified customers should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>The organization that is ready to provision, authenticate, authorize their employees, contractors, suppliers, etc. remotely and based on credentials verified by trusted service providers should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>The organization that is ready to manage identities with data minimization built into credential sharing, and transparent audit trails to check the validity of those credentials should pay attention to global identity networks.</p>
<p>Global identity networks propose a different way of identity management, one that operates on shared standards so that organizations <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/bc80792/providers-of-verified-identity" title="Global identity networks">don’t need to repeat onboarding and verification</a> with the same individuals, and one with verification built in so that organizations don’t need to rely on trust. But this post isn’t to explain global identity networks; if you’re curious about that, this <a href="https://gainforum.org/GAINWhitePaper.pdf" title="GAINforum Whitepaper">white paper</a> is a great place to start.</p>
<p>The question to ask is how to leverage them? The short answer is to get involved: participate in any number of the organizations that are designing the technical and governance architectures. Contribute to the conversation, join a PoC or a pilot where it fits your requirements. Join the cause as long as it also helps achieve your identity management or digital transformation goals. Collaborate, because we all have something to gain.</p>
 Where to Begin 
<p>Knowing where to start can be difficult, but understanding a bit of the context in which global identity networks are developing is a good place to begin. As is typical with a blog post, this is an oversimplified explanation, but the regulatory environment in Europe could soon make big waves in the identity community and beyond, complimented by the long-standing action from numerous organizations.</p>
<p>For those of you that European-based, you certainly are aware of eIDAS. For those who are not, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG" title="EU Regulation on electronic identification">EU Regulation No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market</a> (most commonly referred to as eIDAS) sets out a common interoperability framework for Member States to accept the national eIDs and trust services (like electronic signatures) of other Member States to authenticate citizens when accessing public services. It may sound pretty dry, but it was a very clear attempt to facilitate a regional identity network, where identities could be issued by different identity providers and accepted by cross-border public services. In other words, eIDAS tried to facilitate a portable, reusable identity.</p>
 The Revision 
<p>Unfortunately, tried is an important word here. The uptake of eIDAS (facilitating cross-border acceptance of eIDs) is low relative to the technical capacity of states; <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1" title="eIDAS requlation requirements">only 15 of the 27 Member States</a> able to fulfil the regulation’s requirements of accepting the eIDs of other Member States for public services.</p>
<p>The EU Commission did reflect on the effectiveness of the regulation in its <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/35274ac3-cd1b-11ea-adf7-01aa75ed71a1" title="Impact Assessment">Impact Assessment</a>, and is developing a revision of it. There are multiple revision options being discussed, but thus far, the preferred option would establish a framework that provides citizens with optional use of a personal digital wallet. This could be used to access public and private services across EU borders. Provision of cross-border trust services is also part of the revision, but is out of scope for this post.</p>
 The Collaborative Action 
<p>Upping their digital identity game between 2014 up to the present (freshly 2022), EU Member States may now need to provide not only a digital identity to each of their citizens and residents, but also a personal digital wallet with which the individual can present to the public services of any other EU Member State. Why does a digital wallet make that big of a difference, and what does that have to do with you and global identity networks?</p>
<p>This could be a catalyst for reusable, portable identities in private industry, not just for public services. For consumer-facing businesses, that could mean inheriting a digital identity for a consumer at increasingly high assurance levels with even faster onboarding times and less responsibility for managing consumer data. It also means that onboarding your workforce digitally, and enabling other methods of high assurance authentication is available to more organizations. And it’s possible, even likely, that the basis of both consumer and workforce credentials would be based in an eID.</p>
<p>A digital identity wallet plays a big role in enabling the same individual to use their digital identity for multiple purposes. Instead of creating numerous accounts and being bound by usernames and passwords for each consumer and/or employee service, digital wallets put identity credentials that have been issued and verified by trusted parties into the hands of the individual to share as they please.</p>
<p>This concept starts to edge on decentralized identity, sometimes called self-sovereign identity (SSI). Digital wallets have been part of the decentralized identity conversation since the early days. But digital wallets are not exclusively the domain of decentralized identity, and benefits from the cooperation of many initiatives, organizations, and foundations that are globally working to promote interoperable, secure, privacy-centric, and functional identity standards for personal and enterprise use.</p>
<p>The following is just one example of how these identity networks and organizations are interconnected and support each other. There are many other projects besides identity wallets that tie these networks together. The order in which these organization are mentioned is arbitrary, and doesn’t denote any formal hierarchy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ssi-eidas-bridge/about" title="eIDAS Bridge">eIDAS Bridge</a> project which is supported by the European Commission and the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF) is striving to make eIDAS available as a trust framework in the decentralized identity ecosystem. This means that there are now efforts from both sides of the spectrum: eIDAS may be revised to accept personal identity wallets and technological mechanisms such as zero-knowledge proofs and Verifiable Credentials. The European decentralized identity scene is also actively working to integrate eIDAS by enabling issuers to issue a VC “through” the eIDAS bridge to add additional trust to the credential.</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/EBSI" title="European Blockchain Services Infrastructure">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI)</a>, also supported by the European Commission, Member States and Lichtenstein and Norway are aiming to establish a blockchain infrastructure for cross-border public services, and to enable information verification and trustworthy transactions. ESSIF and identity are a critical part of the first major pilot, which is to issue and exchange credentials between universities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/Projekte_Umsetzungsphase/IDunion/IDunion.html" title="IDUnion">IDUnion</a> is also on the scene. It is a consortium of decentralized identity vendors and other influential partners, funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) and private investment. It is providing an open-source infrastructure to issue credentials, identify legal entities/natural persons/devices, and authenticate user and relying party. It aims to be available globally, but with governance remaining primarily European. It is designing its structure to align with the eIDAS revision, is compatible with <a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html" title="GAIA-X">GAIA-X</a> (a European-based secure data infrastructure project), and is working to improve interoperability with EBSI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/" title="GLEIF">GLEIF</a> is also a part of this as a non-for-profit organization to manage the organizations who issue Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs). LEIs provide a unique identification for legal entities. It was establish to facilitate improved financial governance, but with potential for many other uses like authentication of relying parties, as is likely required in the eIDAS revision. GLEIF is part of Trust Over IP (ToIP), and uses ToIP’s governance framework and technology stack.</p>
<p><a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/" title="Trust Over IP">Trust Over IP</a> is an independent project hosted at the Linux Foundation and lays out the governance model and a trust framework to provide Internet-wide digital trust. The main use cases they address with this trust framework are passwordless authentication, long-term private digital connections, and verifiable origins. This is a governance stack to complement the (often decentralized) technology solutions that are being developed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/" title="Decentralized Identity Foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) aims to and ensure an open ecosystem and interoperability for decentralized identity. DIF has contributed DIDs, DID authentication, and many other standards, wallet security, and much more related to implementing decentralized identity. They and ToIP <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/w3cdidspec/" title="ToIP and DIDs">both support</a> the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) 1.0 specification being advanced to an official W3C Recommendation.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops technical specifications and guidelines, of which the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" title="DID specification">DID specification</a> is a proposed recommendation. W3C carries the influence and respect to propose decentralized identity standards to the web community at large.</p>
<p>Though this took a turn into the decentralized world, the cooperation of other non-decentralized organizations are critical to test the interoperability and standards that are being developed. <a href="https://gainforum.org/" title="GAIN forum">The Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN)</a> proposes a federated identity network that would allow any organization to utilize verified identity attributes. It utilizes the international collaboration of financial institutions <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/deeper-dive-into-gain" title="Leverage trusted identities">to leverage the trusted identities</a> that are issued by those financial institutions for reuse in any industry.&nbsp;This project is in close collaboration with OpenID, Open Identity Exchange, the Cloud Signature Consortium, and GLEIF. While this is still in early stages of launch and development, GAIN may emerge as a parallel effort along with decentralized identity. Achieving interoperability can be achieved between such decentralized and federated global identity networks will be a monumental leap forward in enabling a verified, reusable identity for consumer, citizen, and workforce identity management.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/" title="Cloud Signature Consortium">Cloud Signature Consortium</a> is working to establish a standard for secure and open cloud signatures, motivated in part by eIDAS goals to create a single digital EU market for trust services.</p>
<p>This is a very brief and simplified map of some of the most active organizations working for global identity networks. This is a space remarkably focused on collaboration and first enabling interoperability before striving for market share. Each organization has their own individual goals which dovetail with many of the goals of others, and even provide a critical technology or governance frameworks that help other organizations to achieve theirs.</p>

 The Launch of the Ontology EVM Fund Makes $10 Million in ONT/ONG Available to Enable Expeditions <p>As Ontology community members, we have chosen a life of adventure where we push the boundaries of what is possible. We are pioneers, explorers, choosers of the road less travelled. Now, looking to fund our adventures and fuel our journeys into uncharted lands, Ontology has created a $10 million (ONT/ONG equivalent) EVM Fund. The fund, which has been launched in celebration of the recent release of Ontology’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aims to support Web3 developers building on Ontology.</p><p>We invite you to join us on what could be our greatest adventure to date, entering the Metaverse. Web3 will bring us together to game, invest, communicate, and innovate online. It will offer a world where we are self-sovereign and not simply a product which companies capitalize on by collecting our data. In the new era of the web, there can be a decentralized metaverse world where we have more control over our identity and our&nbsp;data.</p><p>Fueled by the new Ontology EVM Fund, we can make this vision a reality. We have made $10 million equivalent funding available to support suitable projects who are working towards creating an incredible Metaverse that is open and decentralized. Of course, success on a new planet is not only dependent upon finances. That is why further to the support offered by the Ontology EVM Fund, developers will benefit from a Fast, Accessible, and Secure public chain with a focus on Decentralized Identity and Data. Projects also benefit from the growing user base of <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, which already has over 800k users, and the flagship identity solution, <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, which has been created over 1.5 million times. Ontology offers projects the opportunity to achieve exposure by top level media outlets and the opportunity to join the crypto conversation with some of the leaders in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>We think of these projects as spacecrafts, the driving force behind a shared mission and the stable vessel that holds collective explorers together. If you are one of these projects/spacecrafts, bring your crew to join us on an adventure. We have landing platforms prepared on Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, and Mars. Our ground crew is waiting to welcome you with the resources you need. Simply check out below to see which planet best suits your&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Should you possess an adventurous spirit, but not yet own a spacecraft and team, then do not fear. We have space on our public spacecraft where you can put your skills to use and be rewarded for your endeavors. These flights take you to Mercury and to the Moon, where you can take part in Bug Bounties and Hackathons. See the details&nbsp;below.</p><p>So how can we support your adventurous spirit? What can we do to make our journey a success? What awaits you when you land on your planet of choice. Whilst we only have limited space available, each selected project will be eligible for rewards to help them succeed. See the landing and flight plans&nbsp;below.</p><p>We are going to the Metaverse. Are you coming with&nbsp;us?</p><p>Submit your application to join us on our journey by proposing on the <a href="https://buidl.ont.io/">Ontology Community Forum</a>.</p><p>Technical Reference</p><p>Links of tools and docs about the Ontology&nbsp;EVM:</p>  Ontology Bridge: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/">https://bridge.ont.io/</a>  Ontology Explorer: <a href="https://explorer.ont.io/">https://explorer.ont.io/</a>  EVM smart contract development doc: <a href="https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract">https://docs.ont.io/guides-and-tutorials/development-guides/smart-contract-dev/evm-contract</a>  Ontology EVM supported Web3 API: <a href="https://docs.ont.io/developer-tools/api/eth-web3-api">https://docs.ont.io/developer-tools/api/eth-web3-api</a>   Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Ontology Releases Ethereum Virtual Machine and Announces $10 Million Fund To Support Web3 Developers Building On&nbsp;Ontology <p>The EVM will increase interoperability and reduce migration costs for developers, allowing them to enter the Ontology ecosystem with lower gas fees and faster block production</p><p><a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions, has today announced the release of its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Seamlessly connecting the Ontology and EVM-based ecosystems, it will increase cross-chain interoperability, allowing EVM-based blockchain developers to migrate easily across ecosystems and seamlessly construct applications on Ontology.</p><p>To celebrate the release, Ontology has also announced a $10 million USD (ONT/ONG equivalent) EVM Fund to support developers building Web3/Metaverse decentralized applications (dApps) on Ontology. As well as receiving investment and the potential to access Ontology’s state-of-the-art protocols and tools, participating projects can receive tech, marketing, and business development support. Ontology will receive equity/tokens in the projects, enabling the synergistic growth of its interoperable ecosystem across a diverse array of projects.</p><p>Ontology’s EVM will reduce migration costs for developers, allowing them to enter EVM-based ecosystems on the Ontology blockchain. This will enable lower gas fees, as the Ontology EVM uses ONG as the gas fee for on-chain services, which usually costs 0.05 ONG per transaction. Developers will also benefit from faster block production.</p><p>Ontology’s multi-virtual machines make it the most VM supported blockchain, including <a href="https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/basic/neovm.html">NeoVM</a>, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Wasm</a>VM and now <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">EVM</a>. The latest virtual machine will help to connect thousands of developers building on Ethereum to the Ontology blockchain. These developers will be able to build rapidly with Ontology’s decentralized identity and data protocols.</p><p>As we move into the next iteration of the internet, decentralized identity solutions and privacy preserving technology are becoming increasingly important for the secure expansion of decentralized networks. Ontology’s EVM will facilitate the creation of privacy preserving technologies within a more mainstream developer group. These developers will be able to leverage <a href="https://onto.app/">ONTO</a> Wallet, the gateway for a seamless Web3 experience which has a base of 800K users, as well as <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, Ontology’s decentralized digital identity application which reached over 1.5 million users last&nbsp;year.</p><p>Commenting on the development Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, said: “As we migrate to Web3 we have an opportunity to create a safer, fairer, more decentralized internet. By launching our EVM, Ontology is contributing to this vision by increasing cross-chain interoperability, as well as expanding our decentralized identity solutions to mainstream developers within EVM-based ecosystems through our EVM Fund. The fund hopes to contribute to the creation of a decentralized, secure and fully interoperable metaverse. For this reason, it will put a specific focus on metaverse and Web3 projects. The Ethereum network is an essential connection for Ontology given its extensive support of smart contract creation and decentralized application development, not least its position as a leader within the DeFi space and its extensive portfolio of world class developers.”</p><p>The EVM will increase Ontology’s functionality by adding an Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web3 APIs. The existing Ontology chain native assets can be transferred to dApps on the EVM for circulation without redevelopment, allowing for the seamless continuity of Ontology’s ecosystem development.</p><p>Dr Kendall MAO, Chief Scientist at Ontology, said: “Since the completion of our EVM development in June last year, it has gone through rigorous checks to ensure that developers will experience a seamless, secure integration upon its release today. In September, we opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers across the world, as well as launching a bounty program in collaboration with renowned security experts, <a href="https://www.slowmist.com/en/">SlowMist</a>. Now fully audited, the machine will offer seamless interoperability to a host of new mainstream developers, as well as allowing them to enter the Ontology ecosystem with lower gas fees and faster block production.”</p><p>Any new or established dApp interested in the EVM Fund can apply and will be subject to evaluation from the Ontology community and team. Project submissions can be made through <a href="https://buidl.ont.io/">Ontology Community Forum</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 RapidLEI support now live for new Common Data File formats driven by ROC, enhancing legal entity reference data available within the Global LEI Index 
<p>LONDON, UK – 1 March 2022 – Today, <a href="https://rapidlei.com/">RapidLEI</a> announced a major platform update to support new Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) format standards, as set out by the Regulatory Oversight Committee (<a href="https://www.leiroc.org/">ROC</a>) and the Global LEI Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">GLEIF</a>). All Local Operating Units (LOUs) are required to support the platform changes within the month of March.</p>
<p>RapidLEI is a Ubisecure service, and is the leading global LOU for LEI issuance and data quality. These achievements are largely due to RapidLEI’s pioneering automated LEI issuance API, and a partner network that spans the world.</p>
<p>The GLEIF requires LEIs to be reported according to Common Data File (CDF) formats, in order to standardise how LOUs report LEI and reference data. The ROC, which oversees the Global LEI System (GLEIS), recommended the new policies for updated CDF formats, enabling new information to be reported within the LEI records. As of 1st March 2022, these formats are now required by the GLEIF in order to ensure uninterrupted access to LEI data.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes to the CDF formats is the inclusion of <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20181030-1.pdf">legal entity events</a>, such as mergers, acquisitions, or entity name changes. This enriches the information available about an entity, for example removing potential previous uncertainty around whether name changes were corrected mistakes or intended alterations.</p>
<p>Another substantial change is the ability to report on complex groupings of entities – particularly <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20190520-1.pdf">fund relationships</a> and <a href="https://www.leiroc.org/publications/gls/roc_20201229.pdf">government entities</a>, which can both form composite networks. Entities will now be able to report beyond just parent companies, to provide information around relationships and structures.</p>
<p>Other new data offered in the updated formats include further available entity categories, resulting in fewer blank category entries, and foundation date, which will facilitate record de-duplication.</p>
<p>Steve Roylance, Senior VP Identity Services at RapidLEI and Ubisecure, said, “Since the LEI is primarily intended to increase transparency in financial transactions, the information available in the new CDF formats is valuable in enhancing that transparency further. RapidLEI is committed to GLEIF’s vision of legal entity identification enabling trusted business, so we’re excited to support these enhancements to the Global LEI System and the additional benefits they will bring to organisation identity use cases.”</p>
<p>Most of the new information will be added to the GLEIS when renewing, importing, or creating new LEIs from this point onwards. As LEIs are renewed on a yearly basis, the GLEIF anticipates a period of up to one year for the GLEIS to be fully populated with the new data.</p>

<p>Paul Kohlhaas, the co-founder of Molecule Protocol and co-author of VitaDAO on longevity research and the role of decentralization in&nbsp;science.</p><p>In this episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/voices-of-the-data-economy-learn-about/id1506212617">Voices of the Data Economy, </a>we spoke to Paul Kohlhaas, co-founder of <a href="https://www.molecule.to/">Molecule Protocol</a> and co-author of <a href="https://www.vitadao.com/">VitaDAO.</a> ​​VitaDAO is a community-owned collective funding early-stage longevity research. Paul Kohlhaas is an entrepreneur and economist with a passion for open-source utility networks. His drive for pharmaceutical innovation led him to found Molecule–a networked marketplace that enables the distributed R&amp;D and funding of new chemical intellectual property. In a chat with us, he spoke about the need for longevity research, IP-NFTs, DeSci, and more. Below are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;episode.</p><p>Why invest in longevity research and how can DAOs add&nbsp;value?</p><p>Longevity research and longevity therapeutics are the final frontiers of medicine. If we can stop the genetic ageing process in our body, we can also stop the onset of many diseases ranging from cancer to age-related diseases like Alzheimer’s. This would mean saving an enormous amount of cost across society. Developing longevity therapeutics is about how high medical costs typically associated with age can be&nbsp;reduced.</p><p>Most of the medical costs associated with a person’s life, typically happen in the last two to three years of their lifespan. Through the onset of age-related diseases, be cardiovascular disease or tumours developing in your body, or even Alzheimer’s, the question remains — could we offset the onset of those diseases by 10–20 years? The goal wouldn’t be to live up to the age of 150 but to have the same decline that we know today where one can’t move as fast anymore. How can we have a more productive and happy end of&nbsp;life?</p><blockquote>“Most longevity research that we know, is being funded by billionaires today. Longevity therapeutics haven’t really been in the purview of a pharma company and the reason for that is that aging is not considered a disease. If you want to develop a pharmaceutical or medicine and you want to take it through the classical pharmaceutical development pipeline — what you’re developing has to be considered a disease by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, or by the EMA (European Medicine Agency). However, aging has been in this weird field, where if you essentially develop a medicine that would prevent people from getting a disease, its not considered a treatable disease. This may actually change in the&nbsp;future.”</blockquote><p>There’s also a blossoming venture capital industry that is only focused on supporting biotech companies and researchers that are working on developing longevity therapeutics.</p><blockquote>“Even though there is a large research community for longevity, I think it’s been quite difficult for the general public to participate in that and to actually get involved. The biotech field always has this area of secrecy around it. Looking at it from the lens of a DAO, or a decentralized community, it can be really powerful in democratizing access to research and also democratizing involvement in the therapeutics that have been developed. It can avoid the risk of developing aging therapeutics in a monopolized way.”</blockquote><p>The ownership of IP in pharma and the role of blockchain</p><p>A large pharmaceutical company only has a few things from an asset perspective. It’s based on their intellectual property portfolios in the form of patents. It takes quite a long time to get a new medication onto the market. Once you have it on the market, there’s a long funnel, and it typically starts in academia in small research laboratories, where a researcher has an idea to treat new cancer therapeutically and begins on a path of obtaining funding to prove her thesis and drug development.</p><p>The other component of drug development is data production. Throughout the pharmaceutical development process, you need different entities that essentially finance data production. In return, you are distributing ownership of the IP gradually as you move along. Today, distributing ownership in the IP really happens through equity. Let’s say this researcher decides to create a biotech company and obtains some venture capital funding. The biotech company might file for a patent, and probably then a series of new discoveries will need more financing to begin researching and producing data about this IP. Those companies grow and move along, and typically at some point are acquired by a biopharmaceutical company. Typically the VCs that finance these companies are also backed by pharma companies.</p><blockquote>“The problem starts in a small lab in an academic institution and then goes all the way to these large companies. The IP essentially says, ‘Hey, here’s a new molecule, and it could be a viable cure for this disease, and then you produce data to solidify that thesis. The problem with that is that IP today in the form that it works is essentially a monopoly and if we contain IP within companies, those companies only have an incentive to show positive data. For example, if I’m a company backed by venture capital firms with a certain valuation — we only show positive data about this drug. At the point where a pharma company would then be interested in purchasing the IP or purchasing the biotech company. I don’t have an obligation to show you the negative data, I will only show you the positive data to learn so and so we could have run 50 studies on this on a particular drug or the IP and only two of them work. So 48 didn’t work, two of them work and one of them is maybe kind of inconclusive. So we’ll only show you the positive data. And then let’s say, this acid, this company, or this IP is now purchased, it goes into a pharma company. And the pharma company invests now, another says they purchased the company for $100 million.”</blockquote><p>What are IP&nbsp;NFTs?</p><p>The problem is the monopolization of IP and how we share data essentially creates a lot of inefficiencies in this entire drug development process.</p><blockquote>“We’ve been working on it in Molecule protocol and VitaDAO is really our first organization that has fully vilified that thesis and proven that the model could work. We’re essentially saying that we move IP out of these centralized organizations and move the IP into a more open structure where essentially fundraising around the IP is not tied to an individual organization, but you can distribute ownership to multiple participants. And those participants can now move in and out of the IP ownership and confirm the IP in a more decentralized way.”</blockquote><p>NFTs can really represent pretty much anything. IP, by nature, is a construct, it’s completely virtual. It is, for example, a relationship between two companies. It’s a right that’s granted between two companies or rights granted by the government, in the form of a patent. However, over the past 30 to 40 years, the IP landscape hasn’t really evolved and it’s very hard to transact an IP. NFTs could be, let’s say, technology carriers for IP.<br>In some cases, the creators of art NFTs, specifically remove media ownership from them, so that you actually don’t have any rights. But in other cases, the rights to the artwork are fully encapsulated within the&nbsp;NFT.</p><blockquote>“We’re using the same technology to essentially attach on one side full legal rights to an underlying intellectual property asset, for example, the discovery of a new molecule — we’re attaching that to an NFT. But then on the other side, what we’re also attaching to the NFT are essentially all of the raw data assets that now come with this molecule.”</blockquote><p>So going back to the original example of a researcher at an academic institution — she can now attach the IP rights in her biotech company to an NFT. At the same time, also attach all of the raw data, let’s say, like the pre-clinical data, the studies that she’s running in the laboratory — she could attach that also to the NFT. The NFT encapsulates those IP rights and then the NFT can be purchased by cancer research staff. This cancer research by purchasing the NFT actually begins funding her research and her work. This way you could move the IP now into a decentralized community of other researchers, or scientists across the world of investors, and the funding community.</p><p>Fractional NFTs: The next interesting thing that VitaDAO is looking at doing is essentially taking those IP NFTs and then making them fractional again.<br>What does one mean by making NFTs fractional? This means essentially, now, you could create a million tokens of this NFT. And you could now open them up to community ownership. Say we need some additional research studies done on this particular drug that we’re looking at. If a researcher comes in and does them, then they get let’s say X amount of ownership in the NFT. You can also now create a public&nbsp;market.</p><p>The demand and supply dynamics of&nbsp;DeSci</p><p>There are biotech companies and biotech VCs and angels that work in different research areas, that are actively looking for IP constantly and then there are interesting researchers. To date, there’s no good way to transparently find and discover the IP where this research was discovered.</p><blockquote>“I think it’s very powerful to enable researchers to obtain funding in a seamless way but also to put them back in control. Through the systems and frameworks that we’re building, researchers have more control over what happens to the IP that they’re developing. The same actually goes for the universities that are involved in this. If a researcher is approached by a pharma company, the pharma company obviously has much more control over what’s going to happen next If they’re really interested in wanting to finance this. So Web3 in that sense levels the playing field making processes more transparent and more democratic.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1.15–8.30: Why invest in longevity research?

<p>Pricing matters — it’s often one of the first things to consider when adopting a new&nbsp;product.</p><p>That’s why we value transparency not only when it comes to building Magic, but also iterating on pricing. Thanks to all of the helpful feedback from the community, today we’re excited to introduce new and improved pricing&nbsp;plans.</p><p>Since we launched metered pricing (based on logins) last summer, we heard from developers across different sized teams that this model made it harder to predict costs. With that in mind, our new pricing is based on monthly active users, and adds clarity to how you and your teams can make the most out of&nbsp;Magic.</p><p>Before we share more insight into why we’re updating pricing, let’s cover what’s&nbsp;new.</p><p>Note: if you’re an existing Magic customer, these new pricing plans won’t impact your account immediately (and we will be grandfathering in&nbsp;perks!).</p> Our new&nbsp;plans <p>The changes to <a href="https://magic.link/pricing">Magic’s pricing</a> make it simple and straightforward to choose the plan that’s most tailored to your&nbsp;needs.</p> Builder plan <p>With Builder, you’ll get 1,000 free monthly active users and 100 free login text messages per month. This plan also gives you access to all login methods, access to all 20 <a href="https://magic.link/docs#blockchains">blockchains</a> to build a dApp, low-code login form, and User Settings, in addition to the ability to add a custom logo and&nbsp;theme.</p><p>For budding startups or indie devs diving into a fun hack project, the Builder plan is a great way to get started with Magic for&nbsp;free.</p><p>Want unlimited monthly active users and text messages? Easily upgrade from the dashboard; add your credit card to keep scaling worry-free. After the first 1,000 MAUs free every month, it’s $0.05 per additional MAU. Similarly, for SMS login, after the first 100 texts are free every month, <a href="https://magic.crisp.help/en/article/sms-pricing-1y7u2ck/?bust=1646078799953">market-rate</a> surcharges apply per&nbsp;text.</p> Enterprise plan <p>With Enterprise, you get everything in Builder, plus premium features: multi-factor auth, custom session length, custom email providers (SMTP), additional team seats, and priority support. Volume-based discounts make the Enterprise plan a great fit for customers serving over 20,000 monthly active users. Our Sales team will partner with you to discuss a custom pricing agreement.</p> The “why” behind these&nbsp;changes <p>From conversations with developers and teams of various sizes, we learned the pros and cons of the legacy pricing&nbsp;model.</p><p>As a result, we aimed to keep the “best of” and added key benefits:</p>  Free to get started — 1,000 MAUs free, no credit card&nbsp;required  Suits your needs — whether you’re an indie dev or a large organization  Pay as you grow — self-serve upgrade to unlimited MAUs and login text&nbsp;messages  Predictability — unlock volume-based pricing and custom pricing agreements   What you can&nbsp;expect <p>We are rolling out new pricing for new users on March 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>All existing Magic customers will remain on their current plans and will not need to take any action. Our aim is to make the migration as seamless as possible. Over the coming months, we’ll continue giving existing customers a heads-up on the perks that will be grandfathered in, plus the summer migration planned via email and in the Magic dashboard.</p><p>Have questions or input regarding the new plans? We’re all ears and more than happy to help. Contact <a href="https://magic.crisp.help/en/">Support</a> on our site&nbsp;anytime.</p><p>We can’t wait to see the dApps you&nbsp;build.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/new-pricing-based-on-monthly-active-users-733793b09aa3">New Pricing based on Monthly Active Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is a transcript of the conversation between Vinay Gupta and David Orban on 11th February 2022. You can see the full recording of the live stream&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBeCGtc0tOQ">here</a>.</p><p>David: Welcome to What is New in the World of Blockchain! My name is David Orban, I am Managing Advisor of Beyond Enterprises. We love bringing you thought leaders in this frontier of technology that — even though it is already 10 years old, and more — is still often misunderstood, both in what it stands for, how it aims to achieve its goals, and how it can benefit a diverse but inclusive set of people, organisations, enterprises, and which is so full of creativity and passion around people who come up with great new ideas, arguably often not picking the best acronyms or the best descriptors and labels for them. NFTs… I don’t even want to say what they stand for, for anyone who doesn’t already know, because saying that it stands for non-fungible tokens is just making things worse rather than making them&nbsp;better!</p><p>Today I am very happy to welcome our guest, because I have been following his work for many years. He has a diverse set of accomplishments, as well as current activities that have very interesting and potentially very important implications. So, let’s welcome Vinay&nbsp;Gupta!</p><p>Vinay: Hi, good to be here — good to talk to you again,&nbsp;David!</p><p>David: Thank you Vinay for being here with us! Rather than showing my name in the banners as an overlay, I am already showing your Twitter account, which is one of the best ways for people to get in touch with you. You have an active Twitter presence, with very interesting threads. As I was preparing for this episode, I just read the thread that you pinned to the top of your Twitter&nbsp;stream:</p><p>“It probably helps if I define it: here is <a href="https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1423247169725812737?s=20&amp;t=9Zhasdfr6qMh7cJS9RZtbg">my best short&nbsp;summary</a>.</p>  The human race is currently running the world like a death camp for poor humans, and particularly for the other species we farm or drive into extinction.  Fixing the situation is possible, but requires&nbsp;will.”  <blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1423247169725812737">@leashless</a></p></blockquote><p>So, there you go, it’s an important starting point. What brought you to where you are? And in particular, what brought you into the world of blockchain?</p><p>Vinay: My history goes back to the 1990s. I was involved very heavily in the kind of cypherpunk movement in the ’90s. My first year where 100% of my salary went through crypto cash was 1999, so ‘99/2000 I got a full year of salary in crypto cash. Then I did a little bit of work in the defence world after 9/11, specifically on crypto projects, both in the US and in the UK, specifically looking at how we could protect biometric data from being abused, so biometric privacy&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>After that, in 2014 I got interested in Bitcoin and I spent a lot of time talking about Bitcoin, and I came to the conclusion that Bitcoin’s biggest threat wasn’t the state but it was competitors that were more technologically sophisticated. So I was getting kind of attuned to what’s out there, and then I saw Ethereum, and it was like, “Ah, smart contracts!”. And I had been part of the community that was very interested in smart contracts conceptually, 10 years before Bitcoin was launched, way back in the kind of Nick Szabo early days of figuring that stuff out. The e-rights guys, so Mark Miller’s team… I’d been around all of that stuff conceptually for ages and ages — knew the names, read the papers — so when I saw something that was doing smart contracts, I’m like “Okay, that’s my bus, I’m going to get on there.” I joined the Ethereum team, became the release coordinator for the Ethereum launch in 2015, did a lot of the early communications work.</p><p>And now I’m basically implementing a bunch of the core concepts from the cypherpunk era in the 1990s, and implementing a lot of those core concepts on the blockchain, to bring the kind of full power of the cypherpunk vision to bear on the present. Because the smart contract is only a small piece of the cypherpunk vision.</p><p>David: And when you talk to people who are cautious, because they know deeply how important the mission is, and they are not driven by the hype of the moment, or the bear market of whatever period, and we both went through both stages many, many times in the history of Bitcoin… If you ask them how are things going, they will reply “So far so&nbsp;good.”</p><p>So, what do you think? Is the Bitcoin experiment beyond certain stages, where the kind of attackers that you mentioned could threaten it? That’s one question. And the second question is: is Ethereum, which is an experiment, right? It’s code, we found a lot of bugs, important ones too… We had a furious debate in the community, and, forked, hard-forked, rewound the block even… And then here we are, after a few years, Ethereum seems to be going, so far so good. So, how do you feel about the maturity of these two big, important projects?</p><p>Vinay: So, both of these projects are really showing their age, yeah? Bitcoin has become more and more and more well-understood, more and more people are using it, but not much has happened which is new in quite a while. It’s very, very mature, it’s very, very dug-in, it’s very kind of institutional and blue chip and all the rest of that stuff, but Bitcoin is beginning to look a lot like legacy systems. It’s big, it’s standard, everybody is using it, but it can’t solve most of the problems that people want to solve with it, without very, very complex layer-2 infrastructure, and we still don’t really have all of that stuff worked out quite&nbsp;right.</p><p>I mean, the innovation has kind of moved past Bitcoin, because the next… like, when you go from… however many Bitcoin users we have now, maybe 100 million, something like that? If you go from 100 million to a billion, all of the technology which will be used to get that population using Bitcoin will not be Bitcoin technology. It’ll be layer-2 systems, it will be credit card integration, it will be integration with Shopify, there will be all kinds of buildouts around that core system, and it will have to address keeping the transaction costs low, which basically means things like Lightning Network or something better. You know, somebody will figure out how to take optimistic rollups and port them back to Bitcoin, or something — I don’t know what they’re going to&nbsp;do.</p><p>So, that thing of when a technology gets to be so mature that all of the next steps are not that technology, they’re things around that technology, that’s a real sign that something is becoming very, very mainstream and heading into&nbsp;legacy.</p><p>And Ethereum’s problem is very simple, which is it has promised scaling forever, and it hasn’t scaled yet, and that’s really problematic. Ethereum needs to be fast, and I keep hearing it’s going to be fast, and it’s not fast yet, and that’s making huge amounts of room for things like Avalanche to come along. And Avalanche is here now, and it works just like Ethereum, but it’s fast. Okay, now what, you&nbsp;know.</p><p>David: We will probably go back to this. Because as we talk about Mattereum and what the project is doing these days, what your latest milestones and achievements are, we will have the opportunity of asking ourselves gas prices, and all of these fun questions, and potentially composability across multiple chains… Let’s go back there hopefully.</p><p>But, why don’t you tell me about Mattereum. How did it come about? What drove you to found it? What is its&nbsp;mission?</p><p>Vinay: Mattereum makes smart contracts legally enforceable. You take an event that happens on-chain — I pay you for something, or we exchange some token for some other token, something along these kind of lines — and Mattereum makes that transaction visible as a legal event in 160 countries. Somebody does something on-chain, you say, “Now you owe me something,” I take the proof that you owe me that thing in the form of a contract to court, and that court recognises the blockchain as a source of evidence, recognises blockchain transactions as valid, makes a ruling, and that ruling is enforceable in literally all of the countries that signed up to the 1958 New York Convention, which at this point is well over 160&nbsp;nations.</p><p>What we do with that legal enforcement capability is we make it possible to buy and sell physical assets on the blockchain: gold bars, fine art, collectibles… The biggest thing that we’ve done recently is we sold an <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/10/mattereum-sells-unique-historic-ring-as-an-ethereum-nft-warhol-up-next/">antique ring for&nbsp;$65,000</a>.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/10/mattereum-sells-unique-historic-ring-as-an-ethereum-nft-warhol-up-next/">Mattereum Sells $65,000 Unique Historic Ring As An Ethereum NFT, $200,000 Warhol Up Next</a></p><p>We’ve worked very closely with William Shatner, who is the actor who played Captain Kirk on Star Trek, there will be another collection from Mr Shatner coming up probably late Q1, early Q2… If you go to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/our-news/">News page on Mattereum.com</a>, this is an <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">asset passport for a Warhol print of Alexander the Great</a> which is about to be sold… And these are NFTs for the physical goods: there is a vault, the picture of Alexander the Great is in the vault, it’s a Warhol print, and when you buy the NFT you get the legal right to take that object out of the vault and take it for your own. And you could potentially sell that NFT a number of times, before somebody decides that they want to take the physical delivery of&nbsp;that.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">Mattereum Asset Passport: Alexander the Great</a></p><p>David: And how do you address what in the blockchain world is called the oracle problem? If the trust is in the smart contract, the trust stops where the smart contract ends, and interfaced with the physical world becomes the vulnerable attack&nbsp;surface.</p><p>Vinay: Yes. Let’s take a look at the <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/01_Identity/assets/out/certification-contract.html">warranties of the Warhol print</a>. The way that our system works is there are legal warranties attached to each item. You and I are going to do a trade, you make a legal guarantee that the object in the vault is one kilogram of gold, or a Warhol print. That legal guarantee attaches to the owner of the NFT. I buy the NFT, and what comes with the NFT is your legal guarantee, and there is a direct legal and financial relationship between us at that point, so we can now enforce the promises that you made on the blockchain, in the real world, against your physical&nbsp;assets.</p><p><a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/01_Identity/assets/out/certification-contract.html">Warranty Agreement</a></p><p>David: And in certain jurisdictions, common law jurisdictions, the proof of that is for a claim to be asserted against a broken warranty for example,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Vinay: Mm-hm.</p><p>David: Has this happened yet with a Mattereum claim?</p><p>Vinay: Not yet, no. We have tested it in moot. We’ve had a QC, which is the most senior class of lawyers in the UK — there are solicitors, barristers, and at the top of the pile are the QCs [Queen’s Counsel] — so we had a QC who chose to run a moot on a Mattereum contract and test the contract and make sure that it would work, and they did an enforceability check, and it is indeed enforceable.</p><p>We also worked very closely with the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce, which is a group constituted by the UK High Court and the UK Law Society in a partnership, and the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce has actually extended the roles of arbitration in the UK specifically for handling digital disputes under arbitration that involve blockchain property.</p><p>David: So these assessments raise the probability that were contract, the legal agreement broken, and the party suffering assert their claim in court, they would be able to win, they would be able to have the contract validated by the&nbsp;court.</p><p>Vinay: Yes. And remember that we’re going to private courts, not national courts. International arbitration is a convention, I mentioned this 1958 New York Convention. The international arbitration convention says that if you and I have a contract together, and we agree that if there is a dispute the judge will be a Swiss lawyer from one of the following five law firms, the 1958 Convention says that both of our countries will regard the resolution of that lawyer as if it had been made by a judge in our own country. What this gives is enormous legal force to these opt-in legal structures.</p><p>David: Jumping ahead 20 years… Because, once again, the trust ends at the court. Because if I have a judgement against another party, I have to be able to execute that judgement, right?</p><p>Vinay: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>David: So, are autonomous machines of some kind going to be triggered by court judgements, where for example the Swiss vault that holds the painting would open for me to pick it&nbsp;up?</p><p>Vinay: So, this is here now; this is not 20 years out. I mentioned that we had worked very closely with the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce on their new arbitration rules for digital assets. In Clause 11 of their guidance, it states that basically if the arbitrator of the case has the technical ability to make an award, so they can do something like take an escrow contract and decide which party will get the escrow, they’re legally empowered in the UK to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>So, when it comes to the process, both sides present the evidence, which is almost entirely or entirely on-chain. The arbitrator, who is a privately-appointed lawyer or barrister, who has excellent technical credentials as well as legal credentials, examines the evidence. They make a decision, and then they take the crypto key that they were given as part of they being kind of instantiated as the judge in this situation, and they use that crypto key to directly access the account which stores the value, and then they can award the escrow to one party or the other party. They can reissue an NFT, they can move the asset from one person to another person’s control, and they are fully legally insulated, you can’t sue them, because they’re acting under the Arbitration Act, which gives them legal indemnity, just like a&nbsp;judge.</p><p>So, what we’re attempting to do here is super-empower arbitrators. And arbitration law is the backbone of international business, it’s absolutely the backbone. Because if you are a French shipping company, and you’re commissioning repair work on one of your ships from a place in Vietnam, in all probability, neither party trusts the other country’s lawyer or the other country’s court, they’re always going to favour the person from their countries, so you pick a neutral third jurisdiction, which is usually London, and then the arbitration happens there. And that as an approach, it forms a kind of de-facto global jurisdiction in which commerce happens. And what we are doing is we are taking the de-facto global jurisdiction of the blockchain, and we’re attaching it to the de-facto global jurisdiction of the arbitration world, and connecting these two things together gives us a technologically-enhanced arbitration world, or it gives us a legally-enhanced blockchain world. It’s bringing two existing global systems together in a single unified&nbsp;whole.</p><p>David: Often the promise of blockchain is to lower the barriers to entry to some facet of the modern world, where too many people were excluded before, whether it is banking or international commerce, which are the traditional examples. And in this case, it would sound that rather than talking about a huge multinational shipping company on one side and a port of access worth billions of dollars on the other side having a dispute, there could be a lot of other things. And a lot of people, who would never have even thought about using arbitration as a process, now they will have access to it through the Mattereum platform potentially. Is that&nbsp;correct?</p><p>Vinay: Yeah, absolutely. Making arbitration cheap is dangerous, and it’s dangerous because unless the evidence is very strong, if you do cheap arbitration, you’re going to get kind of rapid decision-making on not-great cases. There are a lot of people out there that think that the objective is to make arbitration cheaper and cheaper and cheaper, and you do this by having less and less qualified people acting as judges… That kind of stuff eventually is just going to break the arbitration system, because the rulings will be of such low quality that the nation states will just change the rules and those people will no longer be allowed to arbitrate.</p><p>The only way that you could get cheap, high-quality arbitration is by having crystal-clear evidence-gathering every single step of the process, so that 99.9% of the time, you look at the data and you understand exactly what’s happening, and you know where to make the award. And to get there, we need a very deep, pervasive soaking of the blockchain into the transactional layer. When you ship a box by FedEx, FedEx isn’t publishing that data to chain. But in 20 years, when we talk about making these systems cheap, FedEx will put it into the chain. When you take a package from the door, there will be a blockchain transaction where you take legal custody of the package, and you’ll be able to open it right there in front of an app running on your phone, which will log the data directly to the chain in a way that makes it evidential. I open the package in front of my phone, my phone is running the court app, the court app records what happens when I open the box, and that’s seen as being legally-authoritative data-gathering. So, there’s a lot of infrastructure you have to build to get really high-quality evidence collection, before you can get into that kind of position.</p><p>David: 30 years ago my activities were already digital, but a little bit less digital than today, and I remember being fascinated by incoterms…</p><p>Vinay: Oh&nbsp;yes!</p><p>David: Which is the table of when the responsibility during a shipment goes from filling the ship, then getting to port, then unloading the goods, and really complex agreements around when one or the other party is responsible for the shipment. So, as you described, FedEx and my next-generation Alexa Ring doorbell documenting the on-chain custody and legal ownership of a good is supercharged, incontrovertible chain of evidence — that will be very, very interesting.</p><p>What role do custody or non-custody solutions play here? If I don’t hand over the private key, am I going to go to jail until I do? What’s going to be the solution for a non-custody system to be part of&nbsp;this?</p><p>Vinay: The answer to almost every question when it gets to crypto and the real world is escrow, escrow is where it’s at. Because, at the end of the day, we’re not going to see a world in which non-custodial wallets are accessible to court order, it’s never going to happen. So, if you and I are going to do a transaction, both parties have to have escrowed value bigger than the value of the transaction, and that value sits there, available for a litigator to come and claim, and when we both agree that the transaction was successfully done, then we release our escrows and everything opens up again. And it has to be an escrow on both ends of the deal. You can make the payment sit in escrow, but what if the damage done is greater than the payment? If you send me a part for my car and it blows up my engine, the part cost $200, and the engine damage is $6,800; we need to have the ability to have guarantees for more than the price of the payment going&nbsp;across.</p><p>So, you have $100,000 bond which sits there guaranteeing all of your trade, we do a bunch of transactions, I come along and say, “I want $6,800 of the settlement,” at that point immediately $6,800 is frozen. Then we go through the arbitration process, and at the end of that either the money is released, or it’s awarded to me. And I want to stress: that’s not 20 years out. The legal machinery for that came from the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce last year, we have implementations of the Mattereum system that use it, and we have physical assets issued on that platform right&nbsp;now.</p><p>David: What do you see as your next challenges around the Mattereum? What will make your dreams come&nbsp;true?</p><p>Vinay: We’re doing real estate, the next big piece of news is we’re going to do the first real estate transactions. And once you can move real estate around on an NFT, like… Welcome to the 21st century — we’re here now! I mean, imagine the difference between the existing real estate systems and an NFT-based real estate system: you buy the NFT, you call the estate agent, you tell them you’re the new owner of the NFT, and you’re coming to the office to pick up the&nbsp;keys.</p><p>David: Yeah. [laughs]&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>Vinay: And you’re like “Really?!” and it’s like “Yeah, really! Really really.” We can do that right now, we’re in the late stages of actually shipping projects to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>David: That is fantastic. What kind of new markets will develop around the frictionless transactions of asset classes that before were much less&nbsp;liquid?</p><p>Vinay: Well, so here let’s talk about how to save the world with crypto. Because we know that the world’s main problem is environmental, and also poverty, these are the two big challenges. What we say is capitalism is extractive at one end and polluting on the other. So, what would it take to dramatically increase the efficiency at which goods circulate in society, to the point where we can hugely expand the amount of human welfare that we can create, for every unit of environmental damage that we do by existing?</p><p>I’ll give you an example: I have on my desk a pair of binoculars. Now, I have more than one pair of binoculars in my house, and only the pair on my desk ever really gets used. So if I had a liquid market for the other pair of binoculars that I own, I can immediately just take those binoculars, drop them into a box outside of my front door, and somebody would put some money in my bank account and I’d be set, and that would be one less pair of binoculars that the world has to manufacture. I can take the pair that I actually use to go and watch the deer in the backyard, and these are my binoculars; the other binoculars, they can just go roaming around and somebody else could buy them, and five or six other people could buy them, if the goods have liquidity.</p><p>The problem is that if I want to sell the other binoculars, as long as I don’t use them… If I want to sell them, it’s 10 times more work to sell them than the economic benefit to me getting a pair of binoculars sold for $16. Right? It just doesn’t&nbsp;help.</p><p>David: I remember being in love with the concept of eBay, and hating to use&nbsp;eBay.</p><p>Vinay: Exactly! So, let me find these&nbsp;guys…</p><p>David: I actually tried to convince my children, who were young at the time, that they should Tom-Sawyer-like use eBay, because it was so much fun! But they called my bluff, and they always refused! [laughter] I couldn’t incentivise them enough! They would still say, “Nah, it’s too much work!”&nbsp;[laughs]</p><p>Vinay: Exactly, exactly — there’s your&nbsp;problem!</p><p>So, here we have some Mattereum tags, and each one of these tags is a wallet on-chain. There is a cryptographic secret key on this tag, and when you beep it against your phone, it does a cryptographic signature to prove that this key is on this chip, but you can’t get the secret key off the chip. If I stick one of these tags onto the binoculars, now the binoculars have a digital ID, and we can take everything we know about these binoculars — manufacturer, brand, all the rest of that information — we can tie all of that stuff together, and immediately at that point we’ve got a digital identity. And when we come to sell this thing, we don’t have to go and take pictures of the thing and all the rest of that stuff; all we need is a third party to look at the binoculars, look at the asset passport that describes them, and says, “They still match the asset passport.” And then that third party puts the claim that these two things match into the asset passport as a new claim, and then at that point they’re free, they can be sold immediately. It’s literally somebody holds them up, checks they match, looks through them, beeps the tag, says, “Yeah, they’re exactly the same thing. I verify that all of this is still true,” and boom, you can now sell&nbsp;them.</p><p>David: Well, it sounds really, really wonderful. And, as you said, very healthy for the environment, very much towards accelerating the speed of money in the system, and without uselessly creating new gizmos or gadgets that we don’t&nbsp;need.</p><p>Vinay: And this is here today. This sounds like science fiction, but it’s not science fiction. I mean, we’ve got the tags right there, we literally just stick them onto things, and off you&nbsp;go.</p><p>So, that as an approach… Imagine what happens to the world when we’ve got correct specifications for everything! Because this asset passport thing has a bunch of machine-readable data in it! Remember all of that semantic Web&nbsp;stuff?</p><p>David: Well, Tim Berners-Lee used to call Web 3.0 something that is completely different from what Web 3.0 means today… But yeah, that was the semantic&nbsp;Web.</p><p>Vinay: Right, that was the semantic Web. So, instead of semantic Web [we have] semantic blockchain: we take the semantic Web data, we embed it in the asset passport, the asset passport is tied to the NFT, and the NFT is tied to the chip. And now, we scan the chip and we get semantic Web, machine-readable data about what the object is! Can you imagine what this is going to do to the&nbsp;world?!</p><p>David: Fantastic. One of the beautiful consequences of technology is that the way it develops is allowing groups of people and groups of companies or countries or continents to leapfrog. There was some industry report in the ’80s, saying that Africa will never have cell phones, because there isn’t enough copper in the world to lay down the cables. And obviously with smartphones, or mobile phones first, you stopped needing the cables, and Africa and India and China have phones&nbsp;aplenty.</p><p>Where do you think the leapfrogging opportunities are coming here? Because it would sound like the low-hanging fruit is in the UK, as you mentioned. And of course one of the largest real estate markets is New York, so why don’t we do real estate transactions with Mattereum on the blockchain in New York? But [I see] two problems, one is that, yes, it would sound easy, but actually incumbent interests will raise the bar against execution. [Problem number] two, the benefit accrues to establish the structures rather than spreading out more widely. So, do you have any examples where this kind of leapfrogging could uplift 100 million people here, 200 million people there, providing a wider spreading of the benefit of these technologies?</p><p>Vinay: I think that we can roughly quadruple the efficiency of global capitalism. I think we can take the cost per unit of human benefit… I think we can quarter the cost per unit of human benefit. Now, that’s a bold claim. But, how many owners should a thing have over its lifetime? One, two, three, four? If it’s four owners, then capitalism is now four times more efficient. Now, that doesn’t cover energy, it doesn’t cover services, but I’ll give you an example: I seem to have too many USB batteries. How did I wind up with too many? You kind of lose them when you’re on a trip, and you discover that they were still in your bag, but you’d already ordered another one, and that happens two or three times over five years, and now you’ve got like a swarm of the damn things! Somebody out there is buying a new one of these right now, even though this thing has probably been used less than 200 times. If we could certify how much volume is still left in this battery, I could sell this thing tomorrow&nbsp;morning.</p><p>Now, what happens to the world when every single thing that a rich person in America or Europe doesn’t need is sold on to somebody who’s less wealthy? What happens is we take the existing pool of goods, which currently covers about two billion rich people who are kind of in the stuff world. Then there’s another four-five billion people that aren’t really in the stuff world, they have barely enough stuff, and two billion people have too much stuff. So we’re just going to stick a price tag on every single thing that a person in the rich world no longer needs, and then we’re going to sell that. Some of that stuff is going to be sold to other people in the rich world, most of it is going to be sold to people in the developing world.</p><p>David: An alternative could be that rather than imitating uselessly the wasteful models that have been adopted in the developed world, communities will become wealthier through a different model, more along the lines of faster sharing of goods, and more effective and efficient sharing of goods, enabled by this technology.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah. You’ve been to India,&nbsp;right?</p><p>David: Yes.</p><p>Vinay: In India, practically everything that can be made out of stainless steel is made of stainless steel: caps, saucers, plates, trays… You know the stuff I’m talking about, this kind of stainless steel…</p><p>David: Yeah,&nbsp;yeah.</p><p>Vinay: How long does stainless steel last? Centuries. None of that stuff is ever going to be manufactured again, those things are permanently here. A stainless steel cup never wears out, and nobody throws it in the trash — it just lasts forever. This we call permafacture: we make things to last forever, because they’re going to be sold and sold and sold and sold. And the rule is this: the rule is a human being never buys anything they don’t intend to sell again. And if I buy something with the intention of selling it, I will take good care of it, I will buy good quality, I will make sure that it lasts, I’ll make sure that it can be repaired, I’ll make sure that it’s easy to test to verify that it functions, and a set of other attributes. And this permafacture approach, where you make sure that everything you buy you intend to sell again, means that whenever you stop using a thing, you execute the sale plan that you had when you bought it originally, and you get rid of&nbsp;it.</p><p>David: I am not very much into luxury goods, but one of my favourite advertisements in The Economist is a black-and-white photo of a father with a kid sailing, and you see the watch on the father, and the tagline says, “You never really own this watch; you just preserve it for the next generation.”</p><p>Vinay: And like that for everything that we manufacture!</p><p>David: [nods] Very good. We have someone following us from Kenya, David de Weerdt, and he actually refers to a meeting that he had with the Maasai elders, in Kenya and Tanzania, which of course have a deep, deep culture that deserves not only to be preserved but to be… Well, neither monetising and securitising, none of these labels are appropriate, but to… [to be] made an instrument of empowerment for that culture, that today is not sufficiently able to leverage it. And through the examples and the technologies of NFTs and others, they really could achieve recognition beyond what is happening today.</p><p>Vinay: Oh yeah. Let’s take an example: if I want to buy let’s say a Maasai stool, I want some Maasai furniture in my house, I want a Maasai stool, I’m going to buy one. The biggest obstacle I have is that if I try and buy a Maasai stool on eBay, what I’m going to get is a cheap knock-off that was made in some other country, by somebody in a furniture factory.</p><p>David: Yep, yep. And actually David is writing exactly that, he said, “Global brands make money using their [Maasai] cultural objects, knocking them&nbsp;off.”</p><p>Vinay: Right. This inability for those people to prove that they manufactured something, so that I only buy a genuine object made by a specific craftsman… We get back to these good old digital tags here. If the Maasai have these things and cell phones, you make an object, you embed this in the object at manufacturing, you scan the tag and verify the identity of the object before it goes into the sales pipe, and I buy the NFT, which means that I own the object, and now you ship it to me. And that as a&nbsp;process…</p><p>I mean, I can’t overstress how the shadow of fraud reduces our willingness to trade directly with people in the developing world. Because you don’t know when you buy something that you’re going to get something that was really made by the Maasai, you don’t know that you’re going to get something which works, you don’t know whether you’re going to be sold a knock-off… It breaks down the possibility of global peer-to-peer trade, because we don’t have global peer-to-peer trust. And if we have this global peer-to-peer trust, because the tags work, the object identification works, the payments work, the justice system works, you could get this trade sorted out… Anybody that has something to sell, and has cultural value to sell with that something, has the ability to do that successfully. And it sounds kind of dumb, but a good example of this is music: do you know the kind of Bedouin guitar bands that have come out of the&nbsp;Maghreb?</p><p>David: Yes, yes. Not deeply, but I have a friend of Tunisian origin, and he always shares that kind of music with&nbsp;me.</p><p>Vinay: Now, that musical genre is kind of right now understood to be the best guitar music in the world, that’s like… [These people are] musicians’ musicians, these people are fantastic! And they’ve managed to make enough of a jump to the world of copyright and branding and distribution that they’re doing tours, their music is on Spotify, their music is on YouTube, they’re making a living doing this stuff, because there is a strong-enough connection for copyrighted material to link it up at one end to their bank accounts, and link it at the other end to the media distribution machinery. As a result, that stuff has become an industry, they’re getting paid. They’re not getting paid as much as they should, no musician is getting paid what they should, but they’re getting&nbsp;paid.</p><p>That’s not happening for manufacturing. It’s not happening for clothing, it’s not happening for food, it’s not happening for furniture…</p><p>David: So, there are these waves of attention, and there are movements and labels, fair trade, and you go and buy fair trade coffee beans and fair trade trinkets of whatever kind. Even those are unable to deliver the value to the producers to the degree that they&nbsp;should?</p><p>Vinay: Well, it’s just a digital question. I mean, if you have an analogue fair trade system that was designed 40 years ago… You know, they do it for a category of goods: this thing was fair trade, okay, but there are, like, 4,000 of them. And I know fair trade as a standard, but I don’t know whether the standard is enforced properly… I have some&nbsp;doubts.</p><p>[But] if I can see a video of the person making the thing… I got the workshop, I got the camera, the camera films me making the thing, and then at the end of that process there’s a tag on the thing, and I beep it against the camera and it registers that video as the video of the thing being manufactured… Fair trade is my money goes directly into the digital wallet of the person that I just watched making the thing that I have in my house! You see what I’m saying? Radical transparency all the way down the manufacturing supply chain is possible now, we have the technology to do it, and this is how we clean up the enormous sort of environmental and social footprint of capitalism, is by making sure that people can see the consequences, right down to the original mining of the goods and the manufacturing of the goods — total transparency.</p><p>David: Let’s flip it around. Many countries need to upgrade their social contracts, and in this I include Western countries too, and there is a large difficulty in doing that. In some countries the work is even harder, it is not even “Oh, our representative democracy is broken, we must repair it,” [but rather] it is “Well, we have a dictatorship that kills people.” And for those of us who are active in blockchain, the issue of a self-sovereign identity, and a strong ability for privacy — at least pseudonymously, but in some circumstances anonymously — is seen as being crucial for supporting the kind of radical change that is needed in certain circumstances. And I’m not even talking about becoming or being a revolutionary; I am maybe even talking about something as simple as being gay, in a country where it is punished by death being gay. And those who have listened to us until now had this vision of everything being tagged, of everything being tracked, of every merchant having their reputation on-chain, every buyer having their reputation on chain… How do you see this world coexisting with the need for strong privacy, or even anonymity?</p><p>Vinay: Mm — good question, excellent question. The first thing is I absolutely do not believe in reputation systems in any form, at all. Surveillance capitalism doesn’t get better run as a network of 100 million cottages compared to a single big factory. Reputation is terrible, the core concept of reputation is terrible — it’s literally just prejudice as a&nbsp;service!</p><p>David: [laughs]</p><p>Vinay: Right? Because think of this situation: you are a black Uber driver in a racist suburb of a right-wing American city. The reputation system is constantly going to be used to punish you for being black, and nobody is ever going to be accountable, because they’re just marking you down — half a star, half a star, half a star, half a star — until you’re driven off the platform. Reputation is literally just prejudice as a service. We should never use reputation in any situation that we can possibly avoid it, and that’s almost everything.</p><p>What we do want is restitution.</p><p>David: I just googled “prejudice as a service”, and I don’t remember now what you call the result, when you search something and you only have one&nbsp;result…</p><p>Vinay: Oh&nbsp;wow!</p><p>David: Almost — six [results]!</p><p>Vinay: Six — goodness gracious!</p><p>David: Prejudice as a service has six results in&nbsp;Google!</p><p>Vinay: Wow! Well, it should be more popular now, because now people will know&nbsp;it!</p><p>So, prejudices… We don’t want that, right? What we want is not reputation; we want restitution. “I took a ride in this Uber, and the guy got totally lost, he wasn’t paying attention to the map on the screen, he thought he knew where he should go himself. As a result, I missed my flight and it cost me $1,200.” Restitution: somebody has to pay for the damage that I took, because somebody didn’t do their damn job. And that as a model… You and I engage in trade, there are funds set aside for restitution — on an insurance contract, drawn on an insurer — if something goes wrong in our transaction, if I claim on your insurance rather than claiming on your identity, I can take the money from your insurer without ever having to know who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>David: What is I think very interesting, and I will have to think about this more, is that the way that you describe this system, which creates a distance between the individual and the behaviour or the outcome, is a better basis for redeemable events, or the evolution of behaviours that are nudged towards desirable forms, than the current assumption, especially in social justice warrior circles, that once you failed their bar, you are irredeemable forever, there is no way that you will be able to do whatever — if you’re a comedian being cancelled, then it’s&nbsp;over.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah,&nbsp;yeah.</p><p>David: So, it is interesting, and I will have to think about it a little bit, but I will take this alternative of a restitution system rather than a reputation system — very good, thank you, thank you very&nbsp;much.</p><p>Vinay: And the critical thing about reputation and restitution is restitution doesn’t have to come from the person that screwed up. You’re my Uber driver, you get lost and I miss my flight and it’s a disaster, and you were doing something… It’s not like we hit traffic; you were ignoring the instructions from the robot, because you thought you knew better. Okay, we agree this is a problem. I claim restitution from Uber. “I bought this service from you, you’re going to pay me.” Now, at that point I never knew who you were: I don’t have your name, I don’t have your address, I don’t know anything about you. And your business relationship with Uber might be affected, but it might just be that you paid your insurance fees, because you put $6/month into a bucket, and that bucket is there to cover claims against drivers when something goes wrong. And that ability to think of this as being about restitution and being about insurance… As long as I know who your insurer is, I don’t need to know who you are. You give me a digital proof of insurance, and I can verify that you are insured… At that point, I’m much less worried about who you are, because I know if something goes wrong, the transaction is&nbsp;insured.</p><p>So, it’s not that we just take the existing systems of trade and we slap a layer of cryptography on top, and now we’ve got anonymous, unaccountable black markets, and everybody is running around causing trouble, and we have no way of catching anybody, and it’s a disaster. That’s not what we do. We change from reputation-based to restitution-based, we use digital proofs of insurance rather than digital proofs of identity, and we create a society which is fully accountable and also deeply anonymous.</p><p>David: Very good. As people go and visit Mattereum, ideally what kind of enquiries, or what kind of potential partnerships or customers or investors would you like to come banging on your digital&nbsp;door?</p><p>Vinay: Okay, let’s talk about investors first. We are about to do an A round. The objective is to raise $30–50 million, and what we will deliver for that — fingers-crossed, with a little bit of luck, this is not investment advice — is a company which is basically 10 times the size of Visa, and which is the large-scale guardian of global trade in the areas where we need reliable purchases, and we need accountability for all&nbsp;parties.</p><p>We’ve got the technology, we’ve figured out the hardware, we’ve figured out the software, we’ve figured out the legals, we’ve figured out the business arrangements, we’ve figured out the insurance, we have all of the parts of the machinery there, and we’re going to scale it. And we’re going to be throwing around real estate, we can already do gold bars up to $750,000 bars, we’ve worked with celebrities, we’ve done all kinds of different asset classes to demonstrate capability… We are about to turn the blockchain into the thing that everybody thought it was five years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>David: And is this an equity round or a token&nbsp;round?</p><p>Vinay: Equity and tokens. Accredited investors only, obviously.</p><p>David: And the vehicle is UK vehicle or US&nbsp;vehicle?</p><p>Vinay: UK&nbsp;vehicle.</p><p>David: It’s a UK vehicle. That’s great. So, what are you going to do with all that&nbsp;money?</p><p>Vinay: We’re going to build scale. We’re going to take the existing systems we have, we’re going to automate everything that we possibly can to get transaction costs down, and we’re just going to bring on more and more and more stuff to be bought and sold as&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>David: And what are the key markets that you will be concentrating on, or you will tackle first? You mentioned real estate. Is arts an important one, or it was more like an&nbsp;example?</p><p>Vinay: There are two big drivers for what we do. There are markets where the things are very expensive, and there are markets where there’s lots of uncertainty in the purchase. High value and high uncertainty is where we add most value. Because this system that I described with the warranties… You could take the risk on buying a house, and you could have 15 or 20 warranties from different people. “I’m the guy that did the roof, I’m the guy that did the plumbing, I’m the guy that installed the kitchen, I’m the person that manufactured the stove, I’m the person that did the bathroom…” All of those different people take legal responsibility for their part of the process, all of them carry insurance. When I buy the NFT for the house, when I move in, if anything is not as described in the house specification, I can make a claim. Imagine what that’s going to do to the real estate industry! Suddenly houses have specifications, and when something isn’t in spec you can get your money! So, there’s&nbsp;that.</p><p>Wine is a huge asset class. Wine is huge, because there’s two trillion dollars of wine in cellars right now. $400 billion of wine transactions in a year, and somewhere between 8–30% of the wine is fake, 8% at the bottom and 30% at the top. So, maybe $400 billion of fake&nbsp;wine?</p><p>David: Wow.</p><p>Vinay: Oh yeah. I mean, fake wine per year is tens of billions of dollars, it might even be $100 billion, so wine is&nbsp;huge.</p><p>Art is huge, and art is… The main place for art is actually new works. Imagine if every artist currently working had those kind of tags on everything that they manufacture — game-changing! No more fraud in art! Everything has been born… Right at the beginning of the process, it’s born digital, it’s tracked all the way through, we know exactly what’s happening… All the stuff about privacy of ownership by the way, this is where the zk-SNARKs come in. We are probably not going to build SNARK-based systems ourself, because we think the SNARK technology belongs in the platform rather than in the application. We might get dragged into it, but I’m not keen to get dragged into it… But I think SNARKs at the application layer is going to be fragile, SNARKs at the platform layer is going to be robust, so we really want to use platforms that have SNARKs for the identity&nbsp;layers.</p><p>So, I mentioned real estate, wine… Gold, we’re very interested in doing digital gold. We’ve done a little, and we’re going to do a lot more. Here’s the reason on digital gold: right now there’s about $200 billion in stablecoins, but stablecoin just means dollar coin, and dollar coin now means “you’re losing 5–8% of your money every year” coin. So the stablecoins have gone from being stable, to gradually, gradually shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking… There are no stablecoins now.</p><p>David: Yeah, they should be called dollar-pegged coins rather than&nbsp;stable.</p><p>Vinay: Right. And stable relative to the dollar was okay when the dollar had zero inflation; the dollar now has a lot of inflation. So, where do you go if you want a stable transaction that isn’t the dollar? The answer is not euros, the answer is not yen… The answer is gold. Because if you have a mix in your portfolio between Bitcoin and gold — or if you’re really paranoid, Bitcoin, dollars, and gold — at that point you can adjust your risk profile just by changing the ratio of dollars to gold to Bitcoin in your portfolio. And really, if you’re a purist, you don’t need dollars at all; you can just do gold and Bitcoin. But dollars, gold and Bitcoin… that gives you a tripod, and you just adjust your balance between those three things to get something that looks pretty stable to you. Well, at this point most of the people in crypto have dollars and Bitcoin; very few of them have gold. So we’re going to do an enormous amount of gold, to basically fill the gap opened up by dollar inflation in the crypto market. And the way that we do gold is very specific: to give excellent claims on specific gold bars with numbers on them, rather than just “grams of gold” in an account. Because how do you know the gold is&nbsp;there?</p><p>David: Are you a platform in the sense that can a developer interface with Mattereum, integrating it in their system and taking advantage of your infrastructure?</p><p>Vinay: So, it’s pretty much… You as an issuer of the NFT, you want to sell physical things, you come to us, we build the NFTs with you, we hand you the NFTs, and you take them to market. At that point it’s an ERC-721, it’s on OpenSea: you can plug it into DeFi, you can move it around, you could put it in escrow contracts, you could do all of the normal crypto stuff with it, because functionally it’s an ERC-721; it’s just connected to this enormous legal machinery behind it. So you kind of move around this little kind of ERC-721 thing, and what’s dragged behind it is this enormous legal machinery that makes it into this fully-enforceable magic&nbsp;widget.</p><p>David: What is the cost of the&nbsp;tags?</p><p>Vinay: The tags are dollars. The chip shortage has made them a little more expensive than they were, but… I mean, we’ve had quotes as low as $3–4/tag, but in very large quantity, with slightly less security than these guys [on his desk]; these guys are kind of unobtainum, because, frankly, we bought most of the world’s supply that was available when we got a chance, like we just… It was an emergency, and we just grabbed all the chips that we could at that window, so we’ve got a bunch of tags. But by the time the supply chain for those has settled down, it won’t be very expensive. And it’s only going to get cheaper every&nbsp;year.</p><p>David: Yes. You mentioned India, and of course you are… I don’t know, were you born in&nbsp;India?</p><p>Vinay: No, I was born in Scotland! So yeah, I’m Scottish. My father was a medical researcher who came across to study rats in the&nbsp;1970s.</p><p>David: But obviously you recognise, and hopefully I hope cherish your Indian&nbsp;roots…</p><p>Vinay: Oh yeah, yeah — I’m a massive hippy! [laughter]</p><p>David: Have you kept an eye on the recent announcement of India recognising cryptocurrencies, and… well, taxing them at&nbsp;30%…</p><p>Vinay: Yeah!&nbsp;[laughs]</p><p>David: Which to me says that now more than a billion people, and the government behind them, is extremely interested in the success of crypto, because it will become their largest source of&nbsp;income.</p><p>Vinay: “Bring us your tax dollars,” yeah. I mean, to be honest… The delicate thing with India is that it has so much scale, and such an ability to make a mess when it does the wrong thing. They rolled out this biometric system for payment of all of the welfare benefits and so on, and it’s been a privacy disaster! Because the state has sovereign authority over 1.4 billion people, and they’re pretty good at scaling things across their entire territory, and when they get it right it’s fantastic, and when they get it wrong it’s a disaster.</p><p>And India has such terrible problems with corruption. All of the places that were ruled by empires, corruption becomes a civic duty. If you are in a country, and you’re colonised and they’re extracting wealth from your country, everything which operates by the book and everything which is honest serves the imperial masters, and everything which is decadent and corrupt and hides money and steals from the tax man and so on, all of that stuff, while you were still under occupation, is a civic duty. And you see this in all of the countries which were heavily colonised.</p><p>David: And is there a time by which this habit that has been evidently ingrained and adopted… One would expect it has a half-life, or it kind of wanes, or it&nbsp;doesn’t?</p><p>Vinay: I mean, the Indians have had independence since, what was it,&nbsp;’48?</p><p>David: Yeah.</p><p>Vinay: Still one of the world’s most corrupt societies… Ireland has independence since… I don’t know when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948">Irish independence</a> was — I want to say it was about the same time, maybe a little earlier [5] — ’28 maybe for Ireland… I should know this… Apologies to the Irish people, I should know it but I don’t! Ireland is still fabulously corrupt. Greece? Fabulously corrupt. South America? Fabulously corrupt.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republic_of_Ireland_Act_1948">The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 - Wikipedia</a></p><p>David: And is the blockchain going to help with that at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Vinay: Well, this is the question. If the Indian adoption, and the general global adoption for blockchain takes the areas where things are reasonably clean, and gradually expands them in size, there’s a decent chance that it will be an anti-corruption technology. But if it’s taken too large too quickly, so that the blockchain penetrates the society faster than the society can become less corrupt, the prospect is that what we get is the blockchain is used as a fuel for corruption rather than as a cure for corruption. And that, to be fair, really kind of worries me. Because if you take a corrupt system and you just inject blockchain into it, now you have a corrupt system with a blockchain. Whereas if you take a relatively clean system, and you use the blockchain to clean it the rest of the way, and then gradually you scale it, maybe it’s possible to kind of widen the circle of light, until you’ve got quite a well-established sort of social contract, that this part of the system is not&nbsp;corrupt.</p><p>And this is the hope for Mattereum. I mean, we have a world-class anti-modern-slavery expert on board, we have a very good environmental leader, we’re currently in the process of onboarding a friend of mine who is going to take Elinor Ostrom’s work on the commons, and start figuring out how we apply Ostrom’s work… She won a Nobel Prize for commons management stuff. So we’re going to start applying Ostrom’s work to handle the circular economy aspect. We take the thing with the sticker, and it’s being sold, and it’s being moved around and around and around… This thing is now in some sense in a commons. And we take Ostrom’s work on governing commons, and we apply that to the circular economy, because how else would you run a circular&nbsp;economy?</p><p>David: Yes. Dominic is helping out: Ireland gained independence in 1922 — thank you Dominic!&nbsp;[5]</p><p>Vinay: ’22, ’22 — I lived in Ireland for a year, I ought to know&nbsp;that!</p><p>David: Vinay, this was really wonderful. And really, good luck with Mattereum! Even though you have already achieved a lot, the mission is so ambitious that still you have exponentially more in front of&nbsp;you…</p><p>Vinay: [slaps the battery and tags together] Practical solutions, practical solutions!</p><p>David: That’s right, that’s right — very good, very good! Your thinking of course is very deep as well, so I hope you will join us sometime in the future, to give us both an update on what is going on with Mattereum, as well as in the various implications. Because you are, as well as I, very much looking forward to see how blockchain delivers its promise to build a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah.</p><p>David: Thank you, thank you very much for being with us&nbsp;today!</p><p>Vinay: Thank you David, and thank you everyone for watching!</p><p>David: Thank you for watching today’s episode of What is New in the World of Blockchain.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-is-new-in-the-world-of-blockchain-64b482e1f9d7">What is New in the World of Blockchain?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 ComplyDeFi: The Compliance SDK For DeFi Protocols 
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of the <a href="https://www.onchainid.com/complydefi">ComplyDeFi SDK</a>, an easy-to-integrate tool that enables Web3 developers to launch permissioned DeFi protocols.</p>

		 
	 
                          <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			 Who is ComplyDeFi for?&nbsp; 
<p>DeFi protocols, Web3 applications and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) may use ComplyDeFi to “filter” their participants and accept/exclude certain types of users in order to apply compliance rules or launch new segmented business models.</p>
 Why is ComplyDeFi needed?&nbsp; 
<p>By linking Web3 applications with a self-sovereign identity system, ComplyDeFi opens an infinite number of use cases. Perhaps the biggest one would be to open DeFi to institutional investors, who require some compliance guarantees about the DeFi project owner and the other participants in the protocol.</p>
<p>Aave Arc, the institutional version of the well-known Automated Market Maker (AMM) DeFi protocol, is starting the movement to permissioned DeFi. Increasingly, DeFi protocols will choose to launch specific versions excluding retail investors to reach bigger investors, or at least will exclude underage or participants from trade embargoed countries, to make their ecosystem safer and targeted.</p>
<p>In addition, as DAOs grow, these organizations need to validate who can join them, participate in decision-making and take active roles. As a first step, it could be helpful to prove that the governance token holder is a human and not a robot.</p>
 How does ComplyDeFi work?&nbsp; 
<p>It provides a simple modifier, acting as a compliance layer, to link the decentralized identity system ONCHAINID to DeFi protocols:</p>
 
 Compliance &amp; segmentation:&nbsp;The DeFi protocol sets up criteria conditions for participants; the ComplyDeFi SDK will verify eligibility via users’ ONCHAINIDs. 
 Anonymous credentials:&nbsp;ONCHAINID owners share verifiable credentials to the DeFi protocol for eligibility check and the code returns yes or no. No actual information is shared, so users remain anonymous. 
 
<p>Here is an illustration explaining the user journey in permissioned DeFi protocols using ComplyDeFi:</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>As a result, while participants don’t know who they’re dealing with in detail, they can ensure that other participants are verified by trusted parties designated by the DeFi protocol (e.g. KYC providers, auditors, banks, etc.), opening the door for protocol owners to roll out multiple versions of protocols based on different business needs.</p>

 <p>Editor’s note: This article was <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/lawlab/2009/07/01/meta-currency-a-step-towards-the-rheonomy-by-eric-harris-braun/">originally published</a> in the Harvard Law Lab blog on 1 July 2009. In it, Eric gives his analysis of the problems we face — wealth inequity, injustice, ecological degradation, political discord — and argues that many of these problems are caused by the way the economy works. It separates our lives into two worlds, and it does a poor job of recognising the things that really matter.</p><p>Finally Eric suggests that, if we want to get out of this mess, we need to develop our ability to create new social patterns to replace the broken patterns that aren’t working for us. We don’t know what these patterns might be, but Eric is convinced that we can only discover them if we have the tools to express and practice them.</p><p>Why are we republishing this article now? Because we see that societal problems have increased since it was first published. Our struggle to thrive is becoming more challenging. The need for new social patterns is becoming more clear every day.</p><p>This is why we’re building Holochain. We believe that part of the solution is to build a software toolkit that lets people create, try, and evolve new social patterns.</p> <p>In her beautifully insightful book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nature-Economies-Jane-Jacobs/dp/0375702431#reader"> The Nature of Economies</a>, Jane Jacobs suggests that we must broaden our understanding of economics in the context of the flow processes of the natural world. Near the end of the book one of her characters asks the question, “What are economies for?” One of the other characters answers:</p><blockquote>“… To enable us to partake, in our own fashion, in a great universal flow”</blockquote><p>Another character answers with “Economies have a lot in common with language… like language, economic life permits us to develop cultures and multitudes of purposes… that’s its function which is most meaningful for us.”</p><p>What do we mean by economy when we say “the economy is strong / weak / growing / shrinking / healthy / in crisis”? We mean something social, an aggregate of many people interacting. But it’s not just individuals, it’s groups of people in the form of businesses, governments, unions, non-profits, etc, also interacting with each other and with individual people. We know, however, that we aren’t necessarily talking about the entire social organism — for when the economy falters, other aspects of the social organism, e.g., its arts and culture, may thrive. Or, the economy may flourish while we experience a marked drop in “civility” or an increase in other so-called “social problems”.</p><p>“Economy”, it seems, specifically refers to the body of the social organism — its “corporeal” aspect. This includes moving stuff around, building houses, growing food, transforming nature to its bodily needs, etc. Using this analogy, we might say that the mind of the social organism is everything else — its cultures, religions, arts, politics, and so on.</p><p>However, it would be a mistake to project this mind/body dualism onto our nascent understanding of the social organism, thereby forming a dis-integrative framework from the start. So it’s not just that the economy is disintegrating around us, it’s that the very word and concept of economy is dis-integrative!</p><p>Here, the two answers given by Jacob’s characters are so powerful. First, they help us shift our imaginations toward thinking from the point of view of the social organism; toward seeing that the “us” that partakes in the great universal flow, and the “us” that develops cultures and multitudes of purposes, is not the individuals of the social organism, but rather the social organism itself. Second, they suggest a perspective from which to perceive the organism as a unity: as a participant in the “great universal flow.” Third, they suggest how this participation is achieved: through language and expressive capacity.</p><p>Here are the two answers restated:</p><p>1) What we think of as economic life is actually the ability of the social organism as a whole to perceive and interact with the flows in which it is embedded.</p><p>2) This ability of the social organism depends on a coordinative expressive capacity.</p><p>So what is this “coordinative expressive capacity?” We are very familiar with its current form: money. Without money and its context in currencies, most of what we call the economy would collapse. However, with money in its current form, the economy also seems to be collapsing! Money, as a medium of exchange, a unit of measure, and a store of value, is the primary information system that coordinates the flows of goods and services through the economy.</p><p>If it cannot also properly coordinate the participation of the social organism in the greater flows of nature in which it is embedded, then the organism will not survive. Currently humanity is failing to coordinate the basic flows of inputs (fresh water, food, etc) it needs and outputs it produces (CO₂, waste, etc) in a way that will ensure its survival. But perhaps more importantly, seen from the perspective of coordinating flows, the social organism is failing miserably to allocate resources and human effort within itself in a way that yields a healthy harmonious entity. Money as an information-carrying “life-blood” does not rise to the challenges posed by the social organism that humanity has become.</p><p>So where do we go from here? What is needed is the development of a new expressive capacity, what could be called a meta-currency language that allows the social organism to organically develop and express formal information systems tailored to enabling and interacting with all the different types of flows that comprise it. We can still call these information systems currencies because they are about shaping flows, or currents. However, these currencies will take on a huge variety of new forms tailored to the kind of value that they are helping to build.</p><p>Note that this is not a call to “monetize” social wellbeing. Quite the opposite, it’s a call to understanding that money, as currently practiced, inherently destroys many forms of social wellbeing. But formal information systems can, in fact, build social wellbeing, and we are actually quite familiar with them: reputation tokens, formal achievement markers like grades/credits &amp; degrees, certification markers like USDA Organic, and many more.</p><p>But as things stand, we haven’t recognized that all of these formal information systems are related families in a larger coherent pattern. We don’t see this, because we don’t yet have the necessary expressive infrastructure, the language, and grammars that unify the structure and forms these information systems take.</p><p>The word “economy” comes from the Greek roots oikos (home) and nomos (management) = home management. Since what we really need is flow management, we can use the Greek root for flow “rheo” to declare that when we gain this new expressive capacity of a meta-currency language, then perhaps we can start talking about the Rheonomy instead of the Economy.</p> <p>Eric Harris-Braun wants the world to experience the new kinds of thriving and collective intelligence that come from deep, rich, ease-full collaboration. Thus he co-founded Holochain and Holo as a strategy to build Internet-based tooling and frameworks with underlying properties that naturally lead to empowered agency and social coherence (at the same time!). He looks forward to a Cambrian explosion of new types and instances of social organisms made possible by these kinds of tools.</p>

<p>In March 2022 Mydex CIC will be fifteen years old. We’ve had many ups and downs along the way but one thing has surprised us. We’ve found it difficult to recruit the people we need for our particular work. It turns out they’re difficult to come&nbsp;by.</p><p>We’ve been thinking hard about this and we thought there might be some value in sharing these thoughts. Trying to change the way a system works (as we are) isn’t easy. It requires a unique and special combination of mindset, skills, understandings and attitudes.</p> Mindsets <p>In our experience most people bring one of three core mindsets to the work they do (and they are often expected to display these mindsets by the organisations they work&nbsp;for).</p><p>Instrumental Many people are instrumental in their attitude towards work. They want to get as much out of it as they can, whether it’s salary, prospects, perks, whatever. Given that many employers are 100% instrumental in their attitudes towards employees, this is quite understandable. But it’s not for us. We are a mission-driven organisation and we need people committed to that&nbsp;mission.</p><p>Sentimental The other side of the instrumental coin is what you could term a sentimental one. Many people are first and foremost concerned with what should be. They want to make the world a better place, which is admirable. But sometimes, what comes with this impatience with ‘what is’, is an endless focus on what’s wrong — without really addressing, practically speaking, what to do about it. That’s also not for us. We’re about making real change happen, and that involves working out how to move from what is to what should&nbsp;be.</p><p>Impractical There’s another group of people (and organisations) who at first sight appear to provide a connection between these two. These are people focused on ‘policy’: on doing research and making recommendations about what needs to be done. In our experience however, most people with a ‘policy’ mindset rarely get involved in actually implementing the policies they prescribe. That’s left to other people. That’s also not for us. As a mission-driven organisation we’ve got lots of policies and we help develop many of them locally and nationally. But what we’re really concerned about is finding ways to make them actually happen. This requires a practical, determined focus on delivery: hard work, attention to detail, dedication and discipline.</p><p>So what we need is no-nonsense, hands-on, streetwise people — common sense problem-solvers able to work with other people to get things&nbsp;done.</p> Skills <p>To get things done in the real world you need the appropriate set of skills. Here, one of the problems we’ve wrestled with is what you might call ‘CV job title inflation’ where people (and organisations) say they can do a job or deliver outcomes but where (from our point of view) they fall short. Here are three examples.</p><p>Project management Project management is a universal requirement for every organisation that needs to organise and coordinate multiple activities to get things done. But in our experience there are two types of project manager. There are those who apply formulas (such as the use of certain tools and techniques, the need for certain processes) and take a tick box approach to their&nbsp;job.</p><p>Then there are others who display ferocious attention to detail (which requires unending discipline and sheer tenacity), unstoppable determination to get the job done, coupled with patience-of-a-saint diplomatic skills and the ability to read, manage, cajole and corral people into doing what they said they would do. This precious combination of skills is rare. But it’s what good project management is about, and is something we are constantly in need&nbsp;of.</p><p>Business development Many people think that ‘business development’ and ‘sales’ are the same thing. But they are not. Sales is about selling a pre-packaged, pre-defined product with known, fixed functions and features. Business development is something else entirely. It’s about listening really hard to what the other party wants and needs, and using a deep understanding of what the organisation can (and can’t) do, to craft something that is both creative and practical — that uses the organisation’s skills and capabilities to truly address the client’s&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Business development is, therefore, both incredibly creative (in forging a value-adding connection between the two sides’ circumstances and capabilities) and very disciplined, doing the hard listening, developing the deep understanding of your own organisation’s capabilities, and in scoping and scaling what’s needed and breaking it down into a practical, workable roadmap. As an organisation, Mydex may have a mission but we don’t want to employ missionaries who simply proselytise a vision. We need problem solvers focus determinedly on how to turn the vision into a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Software development In digital circles nowadays a hacking mindset is cool. Got a problem? Then write a new piece of code about it! That is the opposite to what we are doing, which is closer to infrastructure engineering — where every piece we build has to fit perfectly with every other piece, and where they need to work together continuously in a secure, scalable and resilient way. Engineering is a real discipline, including understanding and keeping to standards and processes which deliver high quality make-once-use-many-times outcomes. For many people brought up in a ‘hacking’ culture it’s very hard to make the transition to become a successful software development engineer.</p> Understanding <p>Mydex has been at the cutting edge of a society-changing innovation for 15 years now. Another thing we’ve discovered along the way is that many people think they know about personal data, but really, from our perspective, what they’ve imbibed is a series of myths and misunderstandings.</p><p>When we talk about things like personal data stores and citizen empowerment, we have developed a highly specific understanding of the issues, challenges and solutions that are needed — and this is often a far cry from what people assume we are saying. To work for an organisation like ours, people need to engage intellectually in a way that will almost certainly challenge their assumptions. They then need to learn how to use this intellectual engagement to practical, operational effect. Working for Mydex makes your head hurt. This leads us to the next defining feature of what a ‘good’ person looks like for&nbsp;us.</p> Attitude <p>If there is one thing we’ve learned in our 15 years it’s this. Yes. We’ve learned an awful lot. But there’s even more we still need to learn. We need people who really want to learn, and who want to learn in the right way — honestly, and with other people, as part of a team. Admitting the gaps in our knowledge, our errors and misunderstandings. Engaging with the facts, not playing politics. (Big egos are too proud to learn. Learning needs humility.)</p><p>To that extent, we don’t care how much of a novice a person may be. What matters is their willingness to learn — along with their determination to make a hands-on practical contribution.</p><p>There’s something else. As an organisation we are on a steep learning curve, and will be for a long time. This is not just one level of learning, but three levels at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>First, we are obsessed with delivery. Getting results. Demonstrating proof points. Getting the job done. We can’t abide flim-flam: we have to learn how to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Second, one of the drawbacks of results-obsessed organisations is that they become myopic. Along with our results obsession lies a deeper obsession: learning how to improve the ways in which we deliver results; developing skills and capabilities that enable us to deliver the right things at the right times, on time. (‘Make once, use many times’ is a must for us. Re-work is a&nbsp;killer.)</p><p>Finally, we are obsessed with continuous improvement, which includes continuously improving the ways in which we improve these skills and capabilities: improving the ways we&nbsp;improve.</p><p>Working at these three levels is hard. Sometimes it means working twice as hard to deliver a particular result, because you are attending to three things at the same time, not just one. But ultimately it’s the only way to really build momentum, and we need people who ‘get’ this and understand that this is what they are signing up for. The hard graft of breaking new&nbsp;ground.</p> Conclusion <p>The upshot is simple: we are always looking for people who are right for us. But not everyone is. If, on reading this, you think you might be right for us, why not get in touch? Let’s have a chat. Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:alan@mydex.org">alan@mydex.org</a> and we’ll take it from&nbsp;there.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/finding-the-people-we-need-76a2088d3598">Finding The People We Need</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that supports many languages.  Initially, it supported only Ruby sites but now supports various languages, including JavaScript with Node.js.  Heroku also has Docker support so that you can deploy just about anything to it.</p>

<p>This tutorial will teach you how to build a small application using the Express framework for Node.js.  You will then secure that application using Okta by integrating the Okta OIDC middleware with your application.  Finally, you will learn how to deploy the application to Heroku, update your Okta application for your Heroku site, and set the environment variables for your app in Heroku.</p>

<p>This tutorial uses the following technologies but doesn’t require any prior experience:</p>

 
   <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> 
   A free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (to handle your OAuth needs) 
   <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/">Heroku Account</a> 
   A <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">repository on GitHub</a> 
 

<p>Of course, if you want to just see the code feel free <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-node-heroku-app-example">to view it on GitHub</a>.</p>

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select node. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/node/create-okta-application/">Create a node App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create your Express application 

<p>Now it’s time to turn your attention to writing your application.  You will scaffold it using <code>express application generator</code>.  Open the folder where your application will live and run the following command:</p>

   <code>npx express-generator
</code>   

 Install your dependencies 

<p>Run the following command to install the default dependencies from express-generator:</p>

   <code>npm install
</code>   

<p>You will need to install some additional dependencies for your application.</p>

<p>First, you will add <code>dotenv</code> to house your sensitive and environment-specific information.</p>

   <code>npm i dotenv@16.0.0
</code>   

<p>Next, you will add Bootstrap.  You will use the Bootstrap libraries in your <code>jade</code> templates for writing the front end.  Bootstrap is a simple UI framework with many samples to help you develop HTML pages quickly.</p>

   <code>npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
</code>   

<p>You will need <code>oidc-middleware</code> from Okta to help secure your application.  This package makes integrating with Okta painless, quick, and secure.  You will be able to configure the middleware with your Okta application details and start securing your routes with only a few lines of code.  <code>express-session</code> is required when using the <code>oidc-middleware</code> so you will need to install that as well.</p>

   <code>npm i express-session@1.17.2
npm i @okta/oidc-middleware@4.3.0
</code>   

 Write your server code 

<p>The express-generator package does a great job of scaffolding a simple Node.js application.  For this tutorial, you can leave most of the application the way it is.  You will need to make a few changes, though.</p>

<p>Open <code>.okta.env</code> and add the following to the end of your file after your Okta configuration values:</p>

 <code>export APP_BASEURL="http://localhost:3000"
</code> 

<p>NOTE: Make sure that you add the <code>.okta.env</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>app.js</code> and replace the contents of the file with the following code:</p>

   <code>require('dotenv').config({ path: '.okta.env' })

var createError = require("http-errors");
var express = require("express");
var path = require("path");
var cookieParser = require("cookie-parser");
var logger = require("morgan");

var indexRouter = require("./routes/index");
var usersRouter = require("./routes/users");

const session = require("express-session");
const { ExpressOIDC } = require("@okta/oidc-middleware");

var app = express();

// session support is required to use ExpressOIDC
app.use(
  session({
    secret: "this should be secure",
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
  })
);

const { OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER, OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID, OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET, APP_BASEURL } = process.env;

const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  issuer: OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER,
  client_id: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
  appBaseUrl: APP_BASEURL,
  redirect_uri: `${APP_BASEURL}/authorization-code/callback`,
  scope: "openid profile",
});

// ExpressOIDC attaches handlers for the /login and /authorization-code/callback routes
app.use(oidc.router);

// view engine setup
app.set("views", path.join(__dirname, "views"));
app.set("view engine", "jade");

app.use(logger("dev"));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "public")));

app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/node_modules/bootstrap/dist"));

app.use("/", indexRouter);
app.use("/users", usersRouter.userRoutes({ oidc: oidc }));

// catch 404 and forward to error handler
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  next(createError(404));
});

// error handler
app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get("env") === "development" ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render("error");
});

module.exports = app;
</code>   

<p>Most of this code is boilerplate from the express-generator—the notable addition is the configuration for the Okta OIDC.  First, you need to enable <code>dotenv</code> at the top of this file.  Next, configure the <code>express-session</code> and add it to your application.  Finally, you can configure your Okta OIDC middleware using the variables from <code>.env</code>.</p>

<p>Open your <code>routes/index.js</code> file and replace the contents of the file with the following code:</p>

   <code>var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get("/", function (req, res, next) {
  res.render("index", { loggedIn: req.isAuthenticated() });
});

module.exports = router;
</code>   

<p>Here you added a property called <code>loggedIn</code> for the <code>index.jade</code> template to use. This property will help the view decide if it should display a <code>login</code> or <code>logout</code> button.  The rest of the home page will be static.</p>

<p>Open your <code>routes/users.js</code> file and replace the contents of the file with the following code:</p>

   <code>var express = require("express");
var router = express.Router();

function userRoutes(options) {
  const oidc = options.oidc;

  router.get("/", oidc.ensureAuthenticated(), function (req, res, next) {
    res.render("users/index", {
      loggedIn: true,
      title: "Express",
      user: req.userContext.userinfo,
    });
  });

  return router;
}

module.exports.userRoutes = userRoutes;
</code>   

<p>This file is where the magic from the Okta OIDC middleware shines.  You are passing in the <code>oidc.ensureAuthenticated</code> middleware in your route definition.  This function will reroute unauthenticated users to the login route you defined in your <code>app.js</code> file.  Because you didn’t explicitly set this parameter, it will direct the user to <code>/login</code> and trigger the authentication flow.  The model that is passed to the view here also contains some information about the user, which you’ll display when the user lands on this page.</p>

 Write your frontend code 

<p>Now you can write some client code.  By default, the express-generator sets up some views using <code>jade</code>.  Jade is a templating engine for Node.js.  The language incorporates some conditionals and flow controls to make templating HTML from your model easier.  The syntax is pretty simple to learn, and there are many HTML to jade converters out there.</p>

<p>Open the <code>layout.jade</code> file that was generated with your project and replace that code with the following:</p>

 <code>doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css')
    link(rel='stylesheet' href='css/bootstrap.min.css')
    script(language='javascript' src='js/bootstrap.min.js')

  body
    .container
      header.d-flex.flex-wrap.justify-content-center.py-3.mb-4.border-bottom
        h5.d-flex.align-items-center.mb-3.mb-md-0.me-md-auto.text-dark.text-decoration-none 
          a(href="/") Home
        ul.nav.nav-pills
          if loggedIn
            li.nav-item 
              a(href="users").nav-link Profile
          li.nav-item
            if loggedIn
              form(action="logout" method="post")
                button(type="submit").nav-link.active Logout
            else 
              a(href="Users").nav-link.active Login

      block content
</code> 

<p>We have used the HTML elements; the classes are chained with a <code>.</code> between them. The attributes are bounded by parentheses.  This simple layout takes the <code>loggedIn</code> value from the server and determines if it should display a <code>login</code> or <code>logout</code> button.  It also conditionally shows a tab for the <code>Profile</code> page if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>You can add the profile page by creating a new folder called <code>users</code> in your <code>views</code> folder and adding a new file called <code>index.jade</code>.  Add the following code to it:</p>

 <code>extends ../layout

block content
  h1 Welcome #{user.name}
  P locale: #{user.locale}
  p UserName: #{user.preferred_username}
</code> 

<p>This page displays the user information that was retrieved from Okta when the user logged in.</p>

<p>Replace the code in <code>views/index.jade</code> with the following:</p>

 <code>extends layout

block content

  p
    | This repository shows you how to use Okta in a Node.js application and how to deploy the application to Heroku.
  p Truncated for the purposes of the article.
</code> 

<p>As mentioned earlier, this is a static page.  Your next step is deploying the application.  But before you move on to that, run the command <code>npm run start</code> and navigate to <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to view your application and ensure it is working locally.</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy to Heroku 

<p>Make sure all your code is running and checked into your GitHub repository.  Navigate to your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps">Heroku Dashboard</a>.  If this is your first time using Heroku you shouldn’t have any apps configured yet.  Click on New and then Create New App.  Name your app <code>okta-heroku-webapp-{yourUserName}</code> or another unique name you feel is appropriate.  Press Create App.</p>

<p>On the application page for your newly created app, find the Deployment Method section on the Deploy tab.  Click on GitHub and connect your Heroku account to your GitHub account.</p>

<p>Next, in the Connect to GitHub section, find the repository you created for this tutorial and press Connect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can enable automatic deploys under Automatic deploys.  In addition, you can configure it to wait for CI to pass before deploying the application.  CI can be configured from your GitHub account.  This step isn’t strictly necessary for this tutorial, but it’s nice to see how this fits into the CI pipeline.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, under Manual Deploy choose the branch you wish to deploy and click Deploy Branch.  Wait a moment and you should receive a message from Heroku saying that your app was successfully deployed.</p>

<p>Click the view button to be taken to your application.  At this point, your application won’t be running because it isn’t configured correctly yet.  Make note of the URL of your site and then you’ll make a few changes.</p>

 Configure your environment variables 

<p>In your Heroku application click on Settings.  Find the section named <code>Config Vars</code> and click on Reveal Config Vars.  Here you will add the same key and value pairs from the <code>.okta.env</code> file you used locally.  You can see mine below with the values blurred out.</p>

<p></p>

 Configure your Okta application 

<p>Next, you will need to configure your Okta application to accept the new URL from Heroku.  Navigate to your application in the Okta admin dashboard and find the General Settings tab.  Click Edit.  Under the Login section add a value for Sign-in redirect URIs that matches your URI from your development settings, but replace <code>http://localhost:3000</code> with the URL from your Heroku application.  For example, my URI would be <code>https://okta-heroku-webapp-nfisher.herokuapp.com</code>.</p>

<p>Add a similar value for your Sign-out redirects URIs, which should just be your application’s home page from Heroku.</p>

<p>Now return to your application.  You should be able to log in and see your app running as expected.</p>

 Do more with Node and Heroku 

<p>Heroku is a great way to quickly and easily deploy a lightweight application that slides into your existing CI process.  Plus, it’s free to get started. Together with Express and Okta, you can quickly build secure web apps and deploy them to a modern platform.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to build an express application with the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html">express-generator</a> toolchain.  You then secured it with Okta.  Next, you learned how to create an application on Heroku, connect it to your GitHub repository and deploy your app from GitHub to Heroku.  Finally, you learned how to configure Heroku and Okta to work with each other.</p>

 The Shyft DAO is asking for members of the Shyft Network community to apply for one of the three available key signer positions via a formal campaign on&nbsp;Discord. <p>The Shyft Network DAO was officially <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/introducing-the-shyft-network-dao-a6c63b9dd18e">announced</a> this week and moved towards eventual formation with an official vote on Snapshot, where all DAO voting will occur. In the latest DAO resource blog on <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-network-dao-how-to-get-involved-66fb42e79ac4">how to get involved</a> in DAO activity, details were shared on the opportunity for Shyft community members to apply to become one of the three DAO community key signers who will join the four other signers from the Shyft Core and Shyft Federation. Key signers will all help contribute to the DAO’s mission to facilitate the perpetual advancement of the Shyft protocol to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without users’ sacrificing their data privacy or sovereignty.</p><p>A DAO proposal is currently in the process of being sent to the DAO forum, whereby the DAO will invite the Shyft community to elect three community members to join the four other key signers. Elected community members will serve for three months, at which time there will be another election. Elected Community members will be given authority whereby five out of seven signers will be required to execute transactions associated with the Shyft DAO treasury.</p><p>So, what’s next? Now, we’re asking YOU — members of the Shyft Network community — to apply for one of the three available key signer positions via a formal campaign on&nbsp;Discord.</p> Key Dates   We have until Tuesday, March 1, 12:00PM UTC to nominate, and vote on our community nominees. Please use <a href="https://forms.gle/MLCMPQg8gPyNyvcg8">this Google Forms</a> to submit nominations.  The top three nominees by number of individual votes on Discord will be entered into a Shyft DAO Improvement Proposal&nbsp;(SDIP).  On March 2, 2022, selected nominees will be sent to the Shyft DAO Forum; upon receiving five comments, the proposal will move to Snapshot for formal&nbsp;voting.   Campaign Details <p>Individual key community member campaigns will run for three&nbsp;days.</p><p>Regarding the expectations of DAO community key signers, it is prudent to enable participation of highly reputable members of the Shyft community with technical backgrounds, specifically in the DeFi space, to form the group of seven signers delegated with the task of signing for transactions associated with various grant fundings. The ideal signer is also someone who is able and interested in staying informed and involved in the Shyft&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Key signers are required to be abreast of Shyft DAO proposals and timely in their key signings. The expectation is that this will not be a considerable time commitment.</p><p>Interested candidates will be required to share on Discord why they would best represent the community regarding the above specifications and help the DAO accomplish its goals. This is your chance to promote yourself! Consider it something like a campaign speech. The Shyft DAO wants to hear about your technical background, experience as a supporter of Shyft’s mission, and what you would like to see from the DAO. The Shyft DAO urges all community members to be proactive and suggest candidates they believe are active, engaged, and represent the community best.</p><p>Stay connected on our <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> channels for more information on the DAO Key Signer voting&nbsp;process.</p><p>Thanks for reading and your participation in this process. Good luck to all community members who plan to run for these positions!</p><p>— The Shyft&nbsp;DAO</p>

			 Adrian Gibas is a Full Stack Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>I’m Adrian, Senior Full Stack Developer. I grew up in Melbourne where I completed a Bachelor of Computing degree then spent a couple of years running a one-man web development startup.</p>
<p>Soon the lure of earning pounds sterling on the contract market (and having my evenings and weekends back) drew me to London where I spent several years freelancing, before escaping the big city for the seaside town of Brighton. Finally I had enough of the UK altogether and moved to Barcelona, having fallen in love with the city after many visits and realising money isn’t as important as quality of life!</p>
 
 
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>My colleague and friend Max McKenzie told me about this awesome new company he’s working at and how they need more developers. The rest is history!</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s exciting to be working on the cutting edge of an emergent industry and it’s super interesting learning more each day about blockchain technology and DeFi. The best thing about working at Tokeny is the team! The Tokeny family is friendly, fun and professional. Everyone is at a senior level of expertise and there is a sense of camaraderie and pulling together when things get tough, while also enjoying the good times when we score wins.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Analog synthesizers. I’ve recently started building my own modular system using the Eurorack standard, which entails making my own unique music machine by purchasing and inter-connecting an eclectic mix of modules for generating and modulating sounds. It’s a highly addictive hobby; a wonderful combination of mad scientist engineering and creative musical experimentation.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Ability to travel through time, space and dimensions? Hmm tough question! More within the realm of the possible: Gain some success creating electronic art while somehow making the world a better place – like advocating innovative uses of solar energy by powering said electronic art with it.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Abolish private motor vehicles in urban centres. Ok I’m biased as I don’t drive, but I still think we’d all be better off with less cars in cities. The money being spent on maintaining the infrastructure for cars could be better used on free public transport, etc. Might actually make a dent in CO2 emissions also.</p>

<p>Blockchain development and the development of decentralized apps (Dapps) has changed over the past 5 years. When I started with crypto in 2017, Ethereum had just launched, and Solidity programming became the new thing a lot of people wanted to learn. The only problem these days was that little information to get started was available, whereas today we can build on thousands of Youtube videos, courses like <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/">Cryptozombies </a>or <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/">Openzeppelin </a>standards.</p><p>Today, one doesn’t even have to know anything about Solidity programming or blockchains at all to create a product or service that is built on top of a blockchain. Nowadays there are services like Tatum and Moralis, providing almost everything you need to instantly start developing your product or service instead of managing all the “behind the scenes” things on your&nbsp;own.</p><p>This post explains how to get started with blockchain development using the platforms of Tatum and Moralis. I discuss pros and cons and what you can build with them&nbsp;today.</p> Introduction <p>The two main features of Moralis and Tatum are a Web API and an SDK for application development based on a public blockchain. With the Web API we can retrieve all the necessary data from a blockchain and with the SDK we can easily use code to interact with the blockchain to make a transaction or call a function of a smart contract. The blockchain data retrieved by the Web API can be accessed with the SDK as well. Without using such a service a developer must run his own full node to know the blockchains state in order to make a correct transaction based on the current&nbsp;state.</p><p>Moralis and Tatum work on multiple public blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon. Thus, one can retrieve data from all these blockchains using a single Web API. While <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3-sdk/intro#supported-chains">Moralis</a> “only” covers 6 blockchains, the <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/supported-blockchains">Tatum API</a> covers around 40. Both APIs can be used to access the main network and a test network of a blockchain like for example Rinkeby or Ropsten for Ethereum.</p><p>Behind the scenes, services like Tatum and Moralis run a full node of every blockchain they support. Having access to all blockchains’ data, they are able to aggregate it so that one can access all users’ balances, token balances or NFTs in one place. The API can then be used within the respective SDK to help developers creating their product or service. The following picture shows the general architecture of&nbsp;Moralis.</p><a href="https://moralis.io/">The architecture of&nbsp;Moralis</a> Web API comparison of Moralis and&nbsp;Tatum <p>Using a Web API to get all necessary blockchain data saves developers a lot of time and money. Retrieving blockchain data via Tatum and Moralis is free of charge. Both APIs are able&nbsp;to:</p>  Get all Transactions an address has&nbsp;made.  Get the current block of any&nbsp;chain.  Get the native balance or balance of any ERC-20&nbsp;token.  Get all NFT information of a user or a contract.  Get and write data from and to&nbsp;<a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>.  <p>Both, Moralis and Tatum cover all “basic” API requests. Differences are listed in the following.</p> Requests specific to Moralis’&nbsp;API   Get all Events emitted at a specific smart contract.  Get liquidity pair reserves for a Uniswap based exchange&nbsp;(DeFi).  Resolve an <a href="https://unstoppabledomains.com/learn">unstoppable domain</a> and return the&nbsp;address.  <p>Good thing to know: The Moralis Web API differentiate between all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains like Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche and Polygon and the new created Solana Web API for Solana. For Solana, one can “only” retrieve users’ current balance, transactions, NFTs and tokens at the&nbsp;moment.</p> Requests specific to Tatum’s&nbsp;API   Generate a wallet and get the private key, the mnemonics and the&nbsp;address.  Deploy a standard ERC-20, ERC-721 and ERC-1155 contract.  Interact with virtual accounts and the off chain ledger — I will cover this later in more&nbsp;detail.   How to use the&nbsp;APIs <p>After you registered for Moralis you can see on the left side of the screen the Web3 API Button. Once clicked you can use the whole Web API within the browser (see figure below). The x-api-key and the whole curl request are shown when you execute a request. Using the API from outside the browser like for example with Postman or curl is also possible.</p><a href="https://admin.moralis.io/web3Api">The Moralis Web3 API webinterface</a><p>Using Tatum’s API works a bit different. After the registration you will be redirected to your dashboard. Here you can find your API keys — one for all main networks and one for all test networks.</p><p>To see the whole API you have to go back to the homepage to find the <a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php">documentation of the API</a>. Sadly, it is not possible to use the API within the browser. However, Tatum provides request code examples in 13 programming languages (see&nbsp;below).</p><a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php#tag/Blockchain-Polygon-(Matic)">Tatum API example to create a new wallet on&nbsp;Polygon</a> Pricing <p>Both APIs have a very good free version that can be used immediately after registration. The following figures show the number of requests possible with the APIs, depending on the plan you may&nbsp;choose.</p><a href="https://moralis.io/pricing/">Moralis Pricing for number of&nbsp;requests</a><a href="https://tatum.io/pricing.html">Tatum Pricing for number of&nbsp;requests</a> Web API conclusion <p>Most importantly first: both API’s from Moralis and Tatum are working great and as expected and I can recommend both to you. Moralis has a little bit less supported blockchains and features than Tatum but looks more modern on the other hand. With both API’s you have access for all “basic” requests and if you really need something advanced you should look at both API’s and compare if one of these API’s is already dealing with your problem. If so just choose it and try it&nbsp;out.</p> How to use Moralis’ blockchain SDK <p><a href="https://moralis.io/">Moralis</a> describes itself as “the ultimate Web3 Development Platform” and is often said to be “the firebase of crypto”. Regarding help in blockchain software development, a JavaScript SDK is available. You can either use it as a plain npm module named “moralis” or you can use the “react-moralis” module to use the SDK within your React project. All the following paragraphs will focus on EVM blockchains but like already mentioned Moralis also support&nbsp;Solana.</p> Moralis server <p>Starting a new project with Moralis requires you to create a Moralis Server within your Dashboard.</p><a href="https://admin.moralis.io/servers">Add a new Moralis Server within your Dashboard</a><p>Creating a Moralis server requires only to select a name, your region, main network or test network and which blockchains should be included and listened to. In the free version of Moralis, you can run 3 of these servers at the same time but you must revoke them manually after 7&nbsp;days.</p><p>After you created your Moralis server, you can open either its details or its dashboard. Opening the details will show you your Server URL and your Application ID. These two keys have to be imported in your SDK to use it correctly. In the dashboard you can see all your additional databases Moralis is creating for&nbsp;you.</p><p>In the following paragraphs I will show use cases of these additional databases and cover some of the more advanced features you can do with your Moralis server that is helpful for Dapp development.</p> Authenticating users <p>The Moralis SDK provides a simple way to track all users of a Dapp. Either users can register themselves with a username and password or do it the web3 way by using Metamask. The following code example shows how to connect your Dapp with your Moralis server and how to authenticate users the web3&nbsp;way.</p> const Moralis = require('moralis');  const serverUrl = "YOUR_SERVER_URL";<br>const appId = "YOUR_APP_ID";  Moralis.start({ serverUrl, appId });  Moralis.authenticate() <p>The authenticate function will open the user’s Metamask window and request a signature from the user by clicking the “Sign” button. Note that there is no gas fee involved in signing because it is not a transaction.</p><p>Now, here’s the cool part. Once a new user logged in, you can observe a new row added to your “User” table in the Moralis dashboard with the address of the user. Furthermore, the Moralis server creates additional tables like for example “EthTransactions”, where you can see all transactions made of all users on the blockchain networks you selected when creating the&nbsp;server.</p>Moralis Server Dashboard — Get all transaction made from all&nbsp;users<p>Because your tables can get fast quite big, your whole database is capable of managing queries and filters in order to only get and show the desired&nbsp;data.</p> Listening to&nbsp;events <p>One feature only Moralis provides, is listening to events of a specific contract. To this respect, open your server details and go to the “sync” tab. Now either choose to “follow” a specific address or a specific event. If you choose to follow an event, you only have to paste its name with parameter, its ABI as JSON and the contract address. After creation the data will synchronize automatically and the result can be found within a newly generated table in your server. A more detailed tutorial can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://moralis.io/sync-and-index-smart-contract-events-full-guide/">here</a>.</p> Cloud-based queries <p>Complex database queries can be run on the Moralis server in the cloud. For example, if you have a table with movie ratings with 1–5 stars and you would like to know the average film rating, you normally would first get all ratings and then calculate the average. To directly get the answer, just deploy and call the query as a JavaScript function within your Moralis server. For more information about the correct syntax check out Moralis’ documentation <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/cloud-code">here</a>.</p> Getting data with Moralis’&nbsp;SDK <p>Let’s take a closer look at the actual JavaScript SDK and how to retrieve blockchain data. Moralis differentiates between their “normal” API for all EVM blockchains and their Solana API. The following paragraphs refer to the EVM blockchain API.</p><p>To get some data, there are 4 entry&nbsp;points:</p>  With Moralis.Web3API.native.functionName(options) we can access the Web API data within our SDK. Click <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3-sdk">here </a>for more information.  With the useMoralisQuery(‘tablename’) function we can get access to all the data within a specific table of our Moralis server. With the React SDK it should also be possible to enable live updates whenever your table you reference to updates. However, this didn’t work for me while&nbsp;testing.  With the Moralis.executeFunction(‘options’) function we can interact with a smart contract directly in order to get the state of a public variable or the result of a read only function. Click <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3/web3">here </a>for more information.  With the Moralis.Cloud.run(‘function_name’) function we can execute our cloud functions and get the result&nbsp;back.  <p>Using these methods, you can retrieve all blockchain data required for building your Dapp. Of course, all these possibilities can be combined within your Dapp. For example, many requests like getting the specific ERC-20 balance of an address can be resolved using any of these four possibilities.</p> Creating transactions with Moralis’&nbsp;SDK <p>Knowing how to get blockchain data, let’s look at how to make a transaction with the Moralis SDK. The general approach of doing a transaction with the Moralis SDK is by conducting the actual transaction via Metamask. This way, the user and the developer don’t have to deal with any private keys, because Metamask handles them. Metamask provides the SDK with the information, which network the user is currently connected to, so we don’t have to deal with any blockchain network code. The SDK creates a correct transaction with the currently connected network on its own. Thus, the user only has to click on a button within the Dapp and Metamask to accept the transaction.</p><p>Making a transaction with the Moralis SDK is a one liner of code. Only the parameters of a transaction, e.g., the transaction amount, the receiver and the contract address have to be passed as JSON parameter to the Moralis.transfer(options) function. Note the different parameter settings in the code examples below to create a transaction for respectively sending a native coin, an ERC-20 token or an NFT. For more information click&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/sending-assets">here</a>.</p> 1) Transfer native coin options<br>const options = <br>{type: "native", <br> amount: Moralis.Units.ETH("0.5"), <br> receiver: "0x.."<br>}  2) Transfer ERC20 Token options<br>const options = <br> {type: "erc20",<br> amount: Moralis.Units.Token("0.5", "18"),<br> receiver: "0x..",<br> contractAddress: "0x.."<br>}  3) Transfer ERC721 Token options<br>const options = <br>{type: "erc721",<br> receiver: "0x..",<br> contractAddress: "0x..",<br> tokenId: 1<br>}  // Call the Moralis.transfer function with options as parameter<br>const transaction = await Moralis.transfer(options);  // You can wait until its confirmation and do sth. with the result<br>const result = await transaction.wait();  Interacting with smart contracts <p>For interacting with a function of a smart contract, you have to create an options variable as JSON string that includes the contract address, the function name, the <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solidity/what-is-an-abi">ABI </a>of the function, and the parameters. Now call the Moralis.execute(options) function with the options string as parameter. That’s everything it takes to create a transaction with the Moralis SDK as shown in the following <a href="https://docs.moralis.io/moralis-server/web3/web3">code&nbsp;example</a>.</p> let options = {<br> contractAddress: '0x...',<br> functionName: 'FUNCTION_NAME',<br> abi: [ FUNCTION_ABI_AS_JSON ],<br> params: {<br>     parameter1: value1,<br>    }<br>};  const tx = await Moralis.executeFunction(options);<br>const result = await tx.wait();  Moralis conclusion <p>Moralis appears modern and helps building a Dapp. The Web API works great and using the SDK, it becomes a one liner to handle user authentication, getting data from any blockchain or creating valid transactions. Also, the documentation is very well written and detailed. They also have a very active <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MoralisWeb3">Youtube&nbsp;Channel</a>.</p><p>A limitation of Moralis is that it only deals with reading from and writing to a blockchain. Creating your own wallet or deploying a new smart contract are not possible. Therefore, scripting can get complicated because to send a transaction you have to deal with Metamask in the first place. But if you are only looking for a SDK that helps you build the JavaScript/backend part of your Dapp then choosing Moralis makes a good&nbsp;choice.</p> How to use Tatum’s blockchain SDK <p><a href="https://tatum.io">Tatum</a> describes itself as “The ultimate blockchain development platform” that offers a unified framework for 40+ blockchain protocols to reduce the complexity of blockchain development. While Moralis specialized in building Dapps, Tatum is a more general tool with a lot of methods needed to deal with a blockchain. Methods for creating and managing your own wallets and private keys, deploying smart contracts and interacting with them are included in the Tatum JavaScript SDK and their&nbsp;API.</p><p>Maybe because of the broad scope of Tatum, it feels a little bit unfinished. They feature a lot of services and endpoints instead of specializing on one specific. Thus, their Web API documentation is so big that it takes more than 2–3 seconds to load and render the whole page. Also, a lot of things are missing completely, and some other things are not properly explained yet in the documentation. However, Tatum told me that they are working on it already. So as well as in the Moralis section of this article, I will focus in the following paragraphs on EVM blockchains only, since the Tatum API is most developed for these kind of blockchains.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, I will show you the most important things you can put to use already today with&nbsp;Tatum.</p> Initializing Tatum’s&nbsp;SDK <p>Tatum’s SDK is as well written for JavaScript and can be downloaded as npm module with the name ‘@tatumio/tatum’. Once installed you can import it within your project and use one of the hundreds of functions Tatum provides. Calling any of these functions is a one liner. But compared to Moralis you don’t pass all the options as a single JSON string, but rather each parameter is passed individually.</p> Generating a&nbsp;wallet <p>By creating a wallet from scratch, we can script any transaction we want because we know the private key and can sign transactions on our own. To create a wallet with the Tatum SDK you need to import the generateWallet function and the Currency Enum. Once you call the function with the desired cryptocurrency, like for example Bitcoin or Ethereum, you will get your 24-mnemonic words and your xpub for your newly generated <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hd-wallet-hierarchical-deterministic-wallet.asp">HD-wallet</a>.</p><p>With these two variables, Tatum can create new addresses with the corresponding private keys for your new wallet using the generateAddressFromXPub and generatePrivateKeyFromMnemonic functions, which you have to import as well. <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/your-first-app">The following code</a> demonstrates the whole&nbsp;process.</p> 1) const {generateWallet, generateAddressFromXPub, generatePrivateKeyFromMnemonic, Currency} = require("@tatumio/tatum");  2) const btcWallet = await generateWallet(Currency.BTC, false);  3) const btcAddress = generateAddressFromXPub(Currency.BTC, false,    "YOUR_XPUB", "HD_WALLET_INDEX");  4) const btcPrivateKey = await   generatePrivateKeyFromMnemonic(Currency.BTC, false, "YOUR_MNEMONICS", "HD_WALLET_INDEX") <p>In the first line of code, we import the SDK and all required functions. In the second line, we generate a Bitcoin wallet and get the mnemonic and the xpub. In the third line, we create a new address from the xpub and in the fourth line, we create the private key for it. Because we are dealing with a HD-Wallet you must also pass the index of it as a parameter.</p> Tatum’s Key Management System&nbsp;(KMS) <p>To create a transaction, we need our newly created private key to be passed as a parameter to each function. Because it is never a good idea to send your private key across the internet, Tatum provides two approaches: (1) You can sign your transaction locally — this way you must have your private key stored locally on your computer, or (2) you can use the Tatum Key Management System (KMS). KMS is a cloud solution by Tatum, allowing to import your private keys encrypted with a password of your choice to let Tatum sign transactions for you within their service. This way, the private key doesn’t have to be sent across the internet because Tatum signs your transaction and only sends the signature of the transaction. For more information, click&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tatum.io/tutorials/how-to-securely-store-private-keys">here</a>.</p> Accessing blockchain data <p>Currently, the Tatum SDK does not support yet to get all the blockchain data being available via the API. So to access blockchain data via Tatum, one should consult the <a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php">Web API docs</a> and make a HTTP request. This method can be used to build your own Dapp. I recommend to create a separate function for each request, in which you pass all necessary parameters and do the actual HTTP request within this function. This way, you create your own little framework for one-liner requests to get any necessary data from the blockchain.</p> Interacting with a smart&nbsp;contract <p>Interacting with a smart contract doesn’t work yet with the SDK at the time of writing. Instead, you must use the API as described <a href="https://tatum.io/apidoc.php#operation/EthBlockchainSmartContractInvocation">here</a>.</p> Transfering coins and&nbsp;tokens <p>At least the transfer functions for native coins, ERC-20 tokens, NFTs and ERC-1155 tokens exist already in Tatum’s SDK and are documented. The <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-send-ethereum-transaction">following code example</a> shows how to create an ERC-20 token transaction. For more information, check out the <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain">documentation</a>.</p> import {sendEthOrErc20Transaction, ethGetTransaction, Currency} from '@tatumio/tatum';  const transaction = await sendEthOrErc20Transaction({<br>chain: Currency.'CHAIN_TO_USE', <br>fromPrivateKey: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',<br>contractAddress: 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS',<br>digits: DIGITS_OF_TOKEN,<br>amount: "AMOUNT_TO_SEND--0.1 for example",<br>to: "TO_ADDRESS"<br>});  const transaction = await ethGetTransaction(transaction.txId);  Deploying a standard smart&nbsp;contract <p>Tatum’s SDK allows deploying standard smart contracts for EVM-compatible blockchains. Thus, one can deploy a smart contract with custom parameters for token standards listed below. Detailed information on parameters to use regarding using one of the token standards are linked to the&nbsp;list:</p>  <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-create-an-erc-20-token">ERC-20</a>  <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-create-nft-token">ERC-721 (NFT)</a>  <a href="https://docs.tatum.io/guides/blockchain/how-to-create-erc-1155-multi-tokens">ERC-1155</a>   Virtual accounts <p>Virtual accounts are more or less the equivalent of a Moralis server. It’s a separate private ledger maintained by Tatum to enable, e.g., setting up webhook notifications when at a specific address a new transaction is observed. While for Moralis you must paste your address to synchronize and the webhook URL endpoint in your server’s dashboard, in Tatum you must set it up using the SDK or API. Moralis’ dashboard has great usability but Moralis provides no API for specifying webhooks. Tatum on the other hand has no dashboard but provides an API and SDK for the&nbsp;setup.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tatum’s SDK did not work properly during my experiments and I had to use the API again to test the webhooks. The steps for setting up a virtual account in Tatum and to subscribe to blockchain events&nbsp;are:</p>  Create a new wallet and save your&nbsp;‘xpub’  Create a new virtual account with the ‘xpub’ as one of the parameters. Only a private key corresponding to this ‘xpub’ is allowed to do a transaction within this virtual&nbsp;account.  Connect the address to sync with your virtual&nbsp;account  Initialize a subscription that listens to incoming events and send the data to the endpoint of your&nbsp;choice.   Tatum conclusion <p>Tatum’s SDK is a not a complete product at the moment, given its claims. Tatum aims at offering much more features than Moralis for interacting with a blockchain, especially when starting from scratch. Tatum is also more flexible by supporting more blockchains and already provides more usable features that can be helpful for scripting: Generating a wallet, managing keys, or deploying a new smart contract works great. The documentation is quite okay, but I would like to see Tatum to improve on that in the future. For functions not present in the SDK yet, you can use Tatum’s API instead, which works fine. To conclude, Tatum already provides a decent service and given the assumption that they will improve their documentation and SDK, I can recommend using Tatum’s SDK and API for developing a&nbsp;Dapp.</p> Other blockchain SDKs and APIs worth considering <p>Besides Moralis and Tatum, several other services exist that provide a Web API and a SDK for Dapp development. But none of them are as advanced as Moralis and Tatum and can be used only for some parts of your Dapp probably.</p>  <a href="https://idexo.com/">Idexo</a>: It is another service, offering an SDK for blockchain development that feels like the very small brother of Tatum. Idexo provides only an SDK and is very limited regarding the number of blockchains and features. When trying to evaluate it, I had problems with registration and login. What Idexo is most known for is their Telegram bot that allow users to mint an NFT within Telegram.  <a href="https://thegraph.com/en/">The Graph</a>: This is a Web API, focussing on complex and automated queries on Ethereum and&nbsp;IPFS.  <a href="https://nownodes.io/nodes">NOWNodes</a>: They offer a Web API that is comparable to Tatum. The service supports also 40+ blockchains and a lot of endpoints are supported for each blockchain.  <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>: Infura provides some tools and endpoints to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and&nbsp;IPFS.  <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a>: If you even want to build a custom blockchain, then the Cosmos SDK might be worthwhile. Creating an own blockchain gets almost as simple as deploying a new token with&nbsp;it.   Conclusion <p>It’s astonishing to experience how easy blockchain development has become due to tools and services like Moralis and Tatum. I recommend to use Moralis for developing a Dapp and to use Tatum for close interaction with different blockchains. I expect more to come as these services are evolving quickly. On top of that many other services exist to keep an eye&nbsp;on.</p><p>51nodes GmbH based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto economy solutions. 51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (Dapps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@draklein">Achim Klein</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@jpbu">Jan-Paul Buchwald</a> for their help in the course of developing this&nbsp;article.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/getting-started-with-blockchain-development-pros-and-cons-of-tatum-vs-moralis-91dd5acea624">Getting Started with Blockchain Development: Pros and Cons of Tatum vs. Moralis</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the seventh in a series of DM notes, which share information from DM Downloads — our regular internal learning sessions. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #7 reflects upon our approach to visualising and communicating complexity, and explores the ways complexity plays a central role in our practices and&nbsp;output.</p> Diving into the Dark Matter // A brief origin&nbsp;story <p>Before Dark Matter Labs came <a href="https://www.project00.cc/">Project 00</a>, a collaborative design company seeking to think beyond design’s traditional borders.</p><p>The organisation’s name has multiple connotations, In German architecture, 00 denotes a building’s infrastructure (its toilets and corridors), in computing, 00 is the root base of a structure in a file directory.</p>The logo of DM was inspired by the periodic table of&nbsp;elements<p>00’s early work included Opendesk (downloadable, printable furniture) and Wikihouse (open-source housing), but despite the positive attention both projects attracted, they also revealed a series of underlying structural questions:</p><p>How do you provide decentralised warranty for an open source&nbsp;desk?</p><p>Even if you managed to radically reduce the cost of making a house, what about the cost of the&nbsp;land?</p><p>Through 2010 and 2011, 00’s team took part in a series of workshops focused on similarly broad questions, from which emerged both Dan Hill’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15801041-dark-matter-and-trojan-horses">Dark Matter and Trojan Horses: A Strategic Design Vocabulary </a>(2012) and Dark Matter Labs. We realised that if real change was going to be possible, it wasn’t with the ‘things’ we were designing or making, but at the level of institutional infrastructures; the powerful — but invisible — dark matter that makes 93% of the universe and structures the visible world&nbsp;. If we were going to achieve even a modicum of success, we’d have to really explore, uncover, embrace and articulate invisible complexity.</p>A very small sample of how the stack has been used across initiatives at&nbsp;DM The Stack <p>The Stack became our way to communicate interconnected ideas at various stages, and influences how we organise our information architecture on Notion. Over the years, The Stack’s taken on a wide array of colours and configurations, ongoing a regular cycle of becoming excessively elaborate, and eventually simplified again, but ultimately still stands as an intuitive metaphor for complexity, simultaneity and visibility.</p><p>Its isometric projection not only demonstrates multiple activities happening at the same time, but also provides a sense of territorial scale, accounting for the physicality of an environment alongside other intangible structures.</p><p>Inspired by <a href="http://thestack.org/">Bratton’s “stack”</a> and Donella Meadows’ “leverage points” (<a href="https://alastairparvin.medium.com/we-need-new-operating-systems-whose-job-is-that-37421656a2e9">nicely illustrated here by Alastair Parvin</a>), The Stack references (tech holy grail) ‘vertical integration/innovation’ — providing visualisation of the multiple interventions and innovations needed around a problem. But The Stack also has a practical hierarchy; the lower you go, the harder the thing is to&nbsp;change.</p><p>Synthesising the complexity of a context or an initiative we want to portray and guiding people through a narrative that is easy enough to understand remains a constant challenge.</p> Complexity Mapping <p>Today at Dark Matter Labs, embracing complexity is a core part of our daily work and map making has become our central visualisation process. Complexity mapping allows us to explore interconnected, entangled contexts involving multiple stakeholders, interests and interdisciplinary knowledge.</p><p>Whether to present a particular piece of information in full complexity or more streamlined clarity is a constant challenge.</p><p>Done well, opting for complexity offers oversight, allowing us to recognise root causes, potential leverage points, and sites of change for intervention and experimentation.</p><p>Maps can be widely collaborative and provide a starting point for conversations, allowing each viewer to spot their own connections and opportunities.</p><p>A bad map can get excessively complicated, where it should be designed to demonstrate multiple entry points, it can overwhelm and shut people down; quickly ring fencing our work — and while a lot of the work is presented with specialist audiences in mind, we fall majorly short if we fail to make it&nbsp;legible.</p><p>Maps are not simply means of sharing our work publicly. They are a central part of our inquiry process. They allow us to share our individual thoughts, explore connections and work collaboratively. Our daily work often involves moving between projects and holding multiple pieces of information simultaneously, and maps serve as a vessel for retaining that information. Different team members can enter a project, introducing new ways of thinking and spotting a host of new connections.</p><p>Our work is often conducted internationally, presentations at DM Download #7 came from three continents. Mapping serves as a substitute for gathering around a table or a board, chipping away at a problem and exploring its interconnections.</p> Maps are non-linear and open&nbsp;ended <blockquote>“Maps are not the destination, they are tools for exploration”<br>Eunsoo Lee, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</blockquote><p>During the DM Download, Eunsoo’s presentation underlined the importance of the map making process to idea formation, stressing its crucial role in the thinking process behind a piece of&nbsp;work.</p> Maps can reflect our thinking processes <p>They can serve as an intermediary step in the narrative and argument building process, which bridges research and portfolio building.</p> Behind the map sometimes sits a spreadsheet <p>A database of nodes and data points emerges from desk research, interviews and workshops. We sift through the most relevant bits of information, disintegrating them into parts, and breaking insights into components, before reconnecting them again in a way that makes the most sense for what we want to&nbsp;convey.</p> The imperfect disintegration process <p>The information which ends up on a map is usually collected from interviews and research, it gets stored in a database in which insights are tagged, the quotes or pieces of information then get broken into components and bundled according to their theme. The intention is to provide a skeletal framework from which connections can be&nbsp;created.</p><p>Classifying the nodes into domains or themes is always an imperfect, reductive process. The richness of the original statement from which they stem, gets lost in the act of grouping them under umbrella terms, but its purpose is to manage the complexity and guide further exploration.</p> Maps are open for interpretation <p>The map is never considered a complete product, rather, it serves as a foundation upon which hundreds more connections can be built, as well as multiple narratives and interpretations.</p> Maps are a research tool for collective sensemaking <p>Our work requires us to engage with complexity in a variety of ways. The interconnected, planetary-scale challenges are projected onto complexity maps, which help us embrace their entangled, independent nature, and hold the interests of multiple stakeholders.</p><p>Creating and collaborating around maps allows us to use our skills to recognise connections. Our daily work often involves moving between projects and holding multiple pieces of information simultaneously, maps serve as a vessel for retaining that information and when published let us show our thinking, in an open, transparent, and adaptable format.</p>Layering and communicating complexity through systems&nbsp;mapping Maps tell bigger&nbsp;stories <p>Maps can include nodes and connections and visual hierarchies.</p><p>During Download #7, team member Oliver Burgess led us around a visual from the Longtermism project supported by Climate KIC in 2020. The work imagines a world where physical objects (phones, roads, bicycles) have the inherent desire to persist, and so seek to maximise their utility, minimise their environmental impact and contribute to economies of&nbsp;reuse.</p><p>The visualisation centres on a rentable electric bicycle, exploring the product’s manufactured complexity and embodied environmental impact over its life&nbsp;cycle.</p>Map exploring the life cycle environmental impacts of an electric hire&nbsp;bicycle<p>The map covers extraction of raw materials; manufacture of components; usage and operation; and end of life of the bike. It also considers the platform infrastructure that enables the service, the teams responsible for maintaining and redistributing the bikes across the city, and the digital infrastructure upon which it depends. In doing so, it illustrates the negative environmental and social impacts which result from carbon-intensive or polluting processes throughout the bike’s life&nbsp;cycle.</p> Maps are a balance between complexity and&nbsp;clarity <p>Oliver highlighted a visualisation’s ability to balance complexity with clarity. His aim was to encourage the viewer to engage with the whole map and provide a level of detail which conveyed the system’s complexity, without allowing them to get lost in minute&nbsp;details.</p> Maps are always incomplete <p>The map is a static snapshot of part of a bigger system, the scope and detail is often limited by the quantity and quality of available research and&nbsp;data.</p> Maps are only ever approximate <blockquote>Obviously this is only ever an approximation, and it was important in the process to be fully transparent about the assumptions behind it, and the methodology used to make those calculations. Some of the data’s more available than other [bits of data], some of the approximations and assumptions that are used throughout the calculation are estimates, but we tried to keep that very&nbsp;open.</blockquote><blockquote>- Oliver Burgess, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</blockquote> Maps provoke further&nbsp;thought <p>More broadly, the visual demonstrates an approach to thinking about objects: it focuses on a bike, but a similar approach could be taken for many other objects which make up our built environment. Could a better understanding of their embodied value and impacts, change our perceptions around waste and disposability?</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/CrisMoffitt/status/1265492792018599936">@CrisMoffitt</a></p></blockquote> Creating visual hierarchy <p>Despite our desire to keep things legible, their iterative, collaborative nature means these maps can quickly become difficult to read, drawing connections and using shorthand that only the original cartographers can even begin to navigate.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs’ Hyojeong Lee is often tasked with creating legibility and hierarchy to make maps fit for public consumption. At Download #7, Hyojeong led us through the mapping principles which guide the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Through use of colour, grids, keys, icons, linkages, nodes, quotations and visual effects such as shadows or highlights, Hyojeong seeks to create a topography, she often carefully uses clustering to suggest — but never enforce — groupings and narratives. Positioning and then pinning and the nodes enforces a sometimes frustrating rigidity to the information, but proximity, and cause and effect should gently imply our thinking. Underlining the sense that the map is a tool for exploring, rather than a linear singular narrative.</p> Communicating complexity through visual&nbsp;identity <p>While maps are the main process by which we articulate complexity, it also enters our work in other ways. Hyojeong led us through the visual research and thinking which underpinned the graphics in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-indigenous-7-0-459436b6f60">Civic Indigenous 7.0</a>. The research, care and attention to detail that underpin an elegant visual identity and support and enhance the&nbsp;project.</p> Starting point <p>Hyojeong said that the story that the project wants to tell is the most important process in visualising, initially she’ll work through written documents including ideas, thoughts and research.</p><p>With Civic Indigenous 7.0 her ambition was to visual bridge futurism and tradition, the technological and organic, and Tech and TEK (traditional ecological knowledge). Initial visual research led her towards Indigenous art, which she took colour and mood, and contemporary graphic design which follows similar geometric fluidity and intensity of&nbsp;colour.</p><p>Seeking to create seven visuals which explored points of convergence:</p>  Section 35: Opening radically different futures  Verbs not nouns: conjugations and a perpetual state of&nbsp;becoming  Counselling with nature: moving towards more eccentric models of&nbsp;law  Everyday lawing: constituting as a daily&nbsp;practice  Economies of care: towards a systemic reciprocity  High-TEK (traditional ecological knowledge): Indigenous innovation and knowledge  Inherent right: reweaving our relationship to&nbsp;land.  <p>After an initial series of monochrome iterations received a round of feedback, Hyojeong integrated comments, refined the designs and introduced colour and gradients.</p><p>Hyojeong then went on to develop a second series of graphics exploring the resurgence of Indigenous world views and shifts away from western and colonial&nbsp;default.</p><p>Here are some examples of the graphics in&nbsp;context:</p> In short <p>By looking to demonstrate the value and limitations of working with both maps and The Stack, and attempting to lift the lid on our visual processes, we’ve tried to show some ways that complexity enters our daily work and how to improve it moving forward.

 <a href="https://youtu.be/pYT4gj7k7RQ?t=2194">Rivivi l’evento</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Si è svolto il 23 febbraio 2022, il webinar organizzato dal CED (Centro Economia Digitale), evento che aveva l’obiettivo di analizzare le sfide che il Paese si appresta ad affrontare in ambito di Transizione Digitale, Transizione Ecologica e Mezzogiorno a seguito dell’approvazione del PNRR.</p>
<p>L’evento, tenutosi presso Villa Blanc, sede della rinomata Università Luiss Guido Carli, e mandato in onda in diretta streaming, ha visto l’alternarsi di una serie di autorevoli interventi presentati da illustri relatori, facenti parte sia del mondo delle istituzioni, che della ricerca e dell’industria.</p>
<p>Durante la tavola rotonda dal titolo “Next Generation Italia – EXECUTION”,Danilo Cattaneo – CEO di InfoCert – <a href="https://www.tinexta.com/">Tinexta Group</a> – è stato intervistato sul ruolo che può avere InfoCert nell’accompagnare la PA e la società nella Transizione Digitale, quale sia lo stato dell’arte in questo inizio 2022 e quale percorso dovrebbe prendere il Paese per perseguire con successo gli obiettivi strategici del PNRR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>«Sicuramente sul tema della Transizione Digitale abbiamo visto susseguirsi alcune storie di successo che hanno eletto l’Italia ad apripista, a livello europeo, su alcuni ambiti. Esperienze tuttavia intervallate da altre meno positive dovute a evidenti deficit in ambito di cultura del digitale e cultura dell’innovazione.</p>
<p>Già da prima dell’outbreak pandemico, il nostro Paese poteva contare su delle eccellenze in termini di strumenti di digitalizzazione che impattavano su processi e sull’operatività di aziende ed Enti. Parlo ad esempio della diffusione della PEC nei processi della PA e delle aziende private, che hanno portato ad ulteriori situazioni virtuose come il processo civile telematico, l’accesso ai concorsi in digitale e via dicendo. I quali, oltre ad un evidente risparmio di tempo nell’affrontare le pratiche relative ai singoli processi, hanno portato ad un enorme risparmio in termini di CO2e di spazio di archivio, che hanno dei costi di manutenzione e gestione esorbitanti.</p>
<p>Con l’arrivo della Pandemia di COVID-19, tutti noi abbiamo assistito ad una fortissima ed ulteriore spinta di digitalizzazione e remotizzazione dei processi pubblici e privati.</p>
<p>Il Sistema Pubblico di Identità Digitale, lo SPID, ad esempio è cresciuto a ritmi fortissimi, sostenendo l’esigenza del cittadino di usufruire dei servizi pubblici e quella della PA di erogarli. Il primo grande caso d’uso è stata l’adozione dello SPID come principale sistema di autenticazione ed accesso ai servizi dell’INPS. Abbiamo stimato che l’INPS grazie all’adozione di questo strumento di Digital Trust abbia risparmiato qualcosa come più di 50 milioni l’anno.</p>
<p>Questa premessa è doverosa per capire il perché della presenza della “Transizione Digitale” come uno dei Pillar del PNRR e quale deve essere la direzione corretta per proseguire virtuosamente su questa strada che ci consentirà di mettere a terra gli obiettivi che l’Europa ci chiede di raggiungere…»</p>
<p>Danilo Cattaneo, CEO di InfoCert – <a href="https://www.tinexta.com/">Tinexta Group</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Il discorso di Cattaneo si è focalizzato poi sul fulcro del percorso di Transizione Digitale:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>«Le parole d’ordine, anche in uno scenario di “ritorno alla normalità” rispetto ai giorni di emergenza del 2020 devono restare le stesse: digitalizzazione, efficienza, resilienza, flessibilità, ma non solo. Gli strumenti citati hanno un comune denominatore, che ne costituisce il cardine e che ha reso possibile la creazione e la diffusione di questi Casi di Successo: il Trust, ovvero il concetto di fiducia applicata al digitale.</p>
<p>Infatti, solo con uno strumento certificato si può blindare una transazione digitale e renderla sicura. La PEC, lo SPID, la Firma Digitale sono tra gli strumenti principali per tale cambiamento, i “mattoncini” su cui costruire i processi certificati del futuro, che facciano operare vicendevolmente PA Centrale, PA Locale, mondo economico e cittadino. Altri strumenti simili possono essere la Conservazione a Norma ed i wallet per l’Identità Digitale, basati sulla Self Sovereign Identity.</p>
<p>Digitalizzazione, efficienza, resilienza, flessibilità e Trust quindi sono sullo stesso piano per abilitare la Transizione Digitale dell’Italia»</p>
<p>Danilo Cattaneo, CEO di InfoCert – <a href="https://www.tinexta.com/">Tinexta Group</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An explainer on OceanDAO voting improvements implemented in Q1&nbsp;2022.</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> is a community-curated grants DAO for the Ocean Protocol ecosystem. It follows monthly funding rounds where people can propose grants, the community votes on those proposals, and winning proposals receive&nbsp;funds.</p><p>With guidance from the OceanDAO “Parameters &amp; Roadmap” working group, the OceanDAO engineering team works to make curation accessible and fair for every participant.</p><p>This post describes recent improvements to OceanDAO voting mechanisms.</p><p>The rest of the post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>Section 2 — Describes Quadratic Voting (QV), which gives more voice to smaller token-holders and softens the impact of&nbsp;whales</p><p>Section 3 — Describes Bright Id &amp; Voting Boosts, to address Sybil attacks that QV&nbsp;exposed</p><p>Section 4 — Describes Vote Delegation, to allow busier people to let more-informed people vote on their behalf, and to allow people with multiple wallets to benefit from Voting&nbsp;Boosts</p><p>Section 5 — Describes multi-chain voting, so people can vote with their OCEAN and pool tokens beyond just Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet</p><p>Section 6 — Describes future&nbsp;updates</p> 2. Quadratic Voting (QV) — More voice to smaller token-holders <p>Quadratic voting (QV) is addresses two&nbsp;issues.</p><p>Issue: voice of smaller token-holders. Until recently, OceanDAO was one-token one-vote. This gives a lot of power to OCEAN whales. It makes smaller OCEAN holders feel like their voice is weak. This is counter-productive to growing an engaged community. We could go for a democratic ideal: one human one vote. Yet skin-in-the-game matters too: holding OCEAN is a strong signal that you care about Ocean. How do we balance&nbsp;these?</p><p>Issue: competition from long-established projects. Less established projects may find it difficult to compete against longer-established projects that have built up support from many large OCEAN&nbsp;holders.</p><p>We address these issues via two mechanisms.</p><p>1. Preference signaling. First, a given voter has the OCEAN in their wallet to allocate (vote positive or negative; not spend) across project project proposals. This signals the voter’s preference; the voter must choose which projects they feel the most strongly about and allocate more OCEAN to those projects. We’ve already had this for a few rounds, and it’s helped (<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Voting">details&nbsp;here</a>).</p><p>2. Sqrt(). The sqrt() function is applied to the voter’s allocation of OCEAN on a given proposal. This softens whale impact. We deployed this in OceanDAO Round 14. The table below is an&nbsp;example.</p><p>The combination of (1) and (2) is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">quadratic voting</a>&nbsp;(QV).</p><p>If you are a voter with just a few $OCEAN, you are able to vote for a few projects and have an impact. If you are a project that is just starting out, then you are more likely to receive support as voters look at other projects with good <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Value-Add">Value-Add Criteria</a> to&nbsp;support.</p> 3. BrightID &amp; Voting Boosts — Address Sybil&nbsp;Attacks <p>Issue: Sybil attacks. You might have noticed a potential attack vector with Quadratic Voting which is called a “Sybil Attack”, aka “attack of the clones”. In such an attack, a participant distributes their OCEAN into 10 or 20 or more smaller wallets, and votes separately from each. They’ve “cloned themselves”. This allows them to mostly avoid the effect of the square root, to make their OCEAN have higher total voting impact. Sybil attacks are only a problem when you go beyond one-token one-vote. Therefore before QV, they were not an issue; but with QV they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Possible Solutions. We could mitigate the effects of Sybil attacks with a “stick” or a “carrot” approach. In a “stick” approach, the idea would be “you could only vote if you show you’re a unique human”. This would be gatekeeping, and is counter to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">Ocean values</a> and broader web3&nbsp;ideals.</p><p>So, we opt for a “carrot” approach, where we incentivize for showing unique-humanhood. You show unique-humanhood by connecting your Ethereum address to BrightID identity. If you vote with that BrightID-linked wallet, you get a 400% Voting Boost. That is, votes from that wallet have 4x&nbsp;weight.</p><p>BrightID uses a web-of-trust (peer-to-peer) approach to establishing unique humanhood.</p><p>We’ve implemented a portal — <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/web3Tools">here</a> — to make this&nbsp;easy.</p><p>Something to note, you can only associate one wallet to a BrightID, and to an associated Voting&nbsp;Boost.</p> 4. Vote Delegation — More-informed voting <p>Issue: high effort for quality votes. OceanDAO Round 14 had 35 grant proposals. To become well-enough informed to vote with high signal takes several hours, even for people deeply involved in Ocean ecosystem. This is a big time commitment, and many people simply can’t commit the time. This means that the quality of voting signal suffers: some people don’t vote because they don’t feel well-informed enough, or they do vote but with less information than&nbsp;ideal.</p><p>Issue: can only boost one wallet. Many voters hold OCEAN (or pool tokens) across multiple wallets. But the Voting Boost only applies to the wallet associated with BrightID. How might we reconcile this?</p><p>Voter Delegation addresses both issues. It allows busier people to let more-informed people vote on their behalf, and it allow people with multiple wallets to benefit from Voting&nbsp;Boosts.</p><p>OceanDAO Round 15 introduces Voter Delegation. Participants are now able to delegate their voting power to another&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>On the first issue — by delegating Voting Power, you are empowering someone else to make decisions for you! Even if you’re less involved in Ocean, you likely know who might be more informed for voting. We hope this will increase voting signal quality, and also increase the number of people engaged in&nbsp;voting.</p><p>On the second issue — This means that you can delegate votes from a non-BrightID wallet to a verified BrightID wallet, and receive a voting boost more&nbsp;readily.</p><p>Usage. You can delegate your votes via these&nbsp;steps:</p>  Get the 0x wallet address from the person/account that will be casting the votes for&nbsp;you.  <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/delegate">Enter the Snapshot&nbsp;portal</a>  You can choose to limit the delegation to a specific space. In our example, we’ll be limiting the voting power delegation to: officialoceandao.eth  Finally, click “Confirm” to delegate your voting&nbsp;power.  Snapshot’s Voter Delegation Portal<p>Future usage. We hope that by releasing this feature, the OceanDAO community will be able to build on top of and help establish healthy delegates within the Ocean Ecosystem..</p><p>Some ideas for how the community can take this forward include establishing a Delegate Registry Portal such as <a href="https://stewards.eth.limo/">Gitcoin’s Steward Report Cards</a>. This would enable anyone to find or register themselves as Ocean Ecosystem Stewards, and facilitate good decision making inside OceanDAO.</p>Gitcoin’s Steward Report&nbsp;Cards 5. Multi-chain Voting <p>Issue. Ocean is deployed to Ethereum mainnet; but this has high gas fees. To address, Ocean has deployed to several other networks like Polygon which have low gas fees. That’s a great thing! The challenge is that OCEAN and pool token holders in these other networks haven’t been able to vote from those networks; they shouldn’t have to move their tokens to Ethereum mainnet (at high inconvenience and cost) just to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>Solution: vote from Polygon and BSC. As of OceanDAORound 15l, OCEAN and datatoken pool token (BPT) holders holders in Polygon (Matic) chain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) can now vote with their OCEAN and BPTs. Note: R15 doesn’t support votes from other Ocean-deployed networks (Moonriver, EWC); we will continue to grow the supported-networks list over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Here’s what this looks&nbsp;like:</p>  This update supports everything that worked previously.  OCEAN in Polygon and BSC will count toward Voting&nbsp;Power.  OCEAN staked in Polygon and BSC datatoken pool tokens (BPTs) will not count toward Voting Power.&nbsp;*  You can delegate Voting Power within Polygon and&nbsp;BSC.  The sqrt() formula will be applied as described in the QV&nbsp;section  You only need to vote once to have your combined Voting Power deployed.   6. Conclusion <p>This post described several recent improvements to OceanDAO grants curation: Quadratic Voting, Sybil Tolerance, Vote Delegation, and Multi-chain voting. The OceanDAO engineering team implemented these based on guidance by the “Parameters &amp; Roadmap”&nbsp;WG.</p><p>The team will continue to make improvements over time, to further catalyze growth and make the funding process ever more accessible.</p><p>03–03–2022 — * In R16 — OCEAN staked in Polygon and BSC datatoken pool tokens (BPTs) will count toward Voting&nbsp;Power.</p><p>You can learn more about OceanDAO by <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">visiting our website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">reading our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

GEMpay Intends On Establishing Visual&nbsp;Identity<p>Introduction: The Importance Of Visual&nbsp;Identity</p><p>What is GEMpay, it is an important question to answer before delving deep into the intricacies of visual identity. GEMpay is a service that aims to create a new experience and practical benefits through a simple point payment service based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is an immutable and trustless system that enables GEMpay to operate effectively and transparently. The brand’s slogan is as follows “the double discount if there is a GEM.” According to the announcement of the National Statistical Office and the Korea Consumer Agency, the size of the Korean point market is estimated to be about KRW 20 trillion (approximately worth 16.5 billion USD) as of 2019, and it is showing an increasing trend of more than 10% every&nbsp;year.</p><p>As the e-commerce industry has grown substantially in both activity and revenue building, the point market continues to grow substantially. The primary point however seems to accompany a concept known as “the mask of benefits”, a silhouette or an illusion of benefits for the consumers. In the case of Starbucks, the deposit amounted to 200 billion won in 2020, but there was no real benefit to consumers. “The deposit is huge, but why is there no benefit for the consumer?” GEMpay intends to solve this problem by using blockchain based technology. By operating by the point called ‘AERGO GEM’ with a stable token mechanism that guarantees 1:1 value with Korean Won, we intend to provide consumers with a new experience of “blockchain-based simple payment’ and a real ‘double discount benefit.”</p><p>💟The Beginning: Blocko Creates The Payment&nbsp;Service</p>As Easy As Stacking Legos: This Is&nbsp;Blocko<p>“Blocko”, which has planned and created the GEMpay service, is a company who envisions a paradigm “to create a world where anyone can easily use blockchain even if they don’t know blockchain.” In order to make it simple for anyone who isn’t familiarized to utilizing blockchain without the awareness of actually using it, it is incumbent to help experts who are familiar with blockchain technology to easily implement the technology into preexisting applications. This requires disruptive collaboration and paradigm shifts that are not limited to existing systems and industries.</p>Standardizing Blockchain Through Familiarity<p>💟Now More About GEMpay: As Easy As Stacking&nbsp;Legos</p><p>Blocko created the GEMpay service with the philosophy of pursuing ground breaking cooperation and making blockchain as easy as stacking Legos. So, if you look closely at the GEMpay service logo, you can find that it is similar to the Blocko logo as well. Although GEMpay is a blockchain-based service, specific keywords have been extracted based on the service’s goal of the service being efficient, fun and easy to utilize without understanding the basic mechanisms of blockchain technology. Simultaneously, through GEMpay, our goal is to ‘enable everyone to use points safely and well’. Now how is utilizing GEMpay easy and effortless, it is important to highlight how such a claim is&nbsp;valid.</p><p>GEMpay is an app-based service that will provide an easy blockchain-based payment experience to everyone, whether on/offline. Fun: Instead of difficult and unfamiliar terms related to digital currency, easy and traditional terms such as ‘recharge GEM’ and ‘pay with GEM’ are provided, creating a fun experience in all processes from point charging, discount, and payment. Safe: going beyond a simple payment method, we plan to allow users to directly determine the discount rate and risk by selecting an asset management service for deposits. At this time, we want to solve the lug pool risk with the stable token method for asset management services. Smart: it means a smart experience at GEMpay where you can receive a ‘double discount’ rather than a ‘just discount’ when paying with GEM than when paying with cash or card. We also found a commonality between the ‘G’ of ‘GEM’ and ‘jewel’ in the service name, and derived eight key visuals based on this in the infographic showcased above.</p>Visualizing Definitions And&nbsp;Terms<p>The Formation Of Familiarized Symbols</p>Envisioning The GEMpay Prospect Through Visual Representation<p>A representative symbol was created using the above eight key visuals. The symbol of GEMpay is expressed with the hexagonal shape of the uppercase letter ‘G’ and ‘jewel’ and the block shape of a cube, whichimplies that GEMpay is a blockchain-based service. Formally, it is made to look like a hexagon and a cube by minimizing the effect of lines and gradations, visually conveying simplicity, fun, safety and smartness.</p><p>Defining The Color: Aesthetics</p>Artistic Expression In Logo Conception<p>The main color of GEMpay was defined as purple with the meaning of “purple ocean.” Purple ocean is a combination of a red and blue ocean symbolizin the creation of a market with new value (blue ocean) by changing ideas in a market with many competitors (red ocean). We think it is a very good expression of GEMpay, which has a competitive edge through a differentiated strategy called “blockchain technology”, while reducing risk in the already established market called “point&nbsp;market.”</p> 💟On February 28, The GEMpay Pre-Registration Page Is&nbsp;Open!  💎Garner The Double Discount If You Have&nbsp;Gempay!  <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-establishment-of-the-gempay-visual-identity-e8647d28a0dd">The Establishment Of The GEMpay Visual Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Configurations are part of a developer’s life. Configuration data is information your app needs to run and may include tokens for third-party systems or settings you pass into libraries. There are different ways to load configuration data as part of application initialization in <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>. Your requirements for configuration data might change based on needs. For example, you may have one unchanging configuration for your app, or you may need a different configuration based on the environment where the app is running. We’ll cover a few different ways to load configuration values and identify when you should use each method.</p>

 Set up Angular and Okta in a sample project 

<p>First we’ll set up the base project and Okta resources so you can follow along with the post.</p>

<p>To keep things on an even playing field and avoid any new Angular feature funny-business, I’ll use an Angular v9 app in the code sample. All the outlined methods apply from Angular v7 to the current version, Angular v13.</p>
 Create the Angular app 

<p>You’ll need a version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> that works for the Angular app version you want to create.</p>

<p>I’m using Node v14.18.1 and npm v6.14.15 to create an Angular v9 app, but you can create the app for your favorite Angular v7+ version.</p>

<p>Use your globally installed Angular CLI to create an Angular app with routing and standard CSS for styling by running:</p>

   <code>ng new async-load --routing --style=css
</code>   

<p>Or create the Angular v9 app by running the following command:</p>

   <code>npx @angular/cli@9 new async-load --routing --style=css
</code>   

 Create the Okta application 

<p>Let’s create the Okta resource to have the configuration values we need to integrate.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>We’ll need the Okta Angular and Okta Auth JS libraries. Add them to your application by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@5.1 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.0
</code>   

<p>This post won’t walk you through setting up sign-in and sign-out; we’re interested only in setting up the configuration. If the Angular app runs without errors, the configuration aspect is correct. To see the types of errors we’re trying to avoid, try excluding <code>issuer</code> or don’t replace the <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with the values you got back from the Okta CLI. The sample code repo does have sign-in and sign-out integrated so you can see authentication working all the way through.</p>

 Define configuration in code 

<p>When your configuration is static the most straightforward way to configure libraries is to define the configuration directly in the code. In this method, you’d define the configuration data in the <code>AppModule</code> or in a feature module in this method. Examples of this method might look something like defining the configuration for routes and passing it into the <code>RouterModule</code>:</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'profile', component: ProfileComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes)
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>You might be surprised to see routing as an example of defining configuration directly in code.  And yet, when you pass application-wide configuration into a module’s <a href="https://angular.io/guide/ngmodule-faq#what-is-the-forroot-method"><code>forRoot()</code> static method</a> that’s precisely what you’re doing.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed many of our code examples and blog posts to integrate Okta into Angular apps, you’ve followed a similar pattern where configuration is defined directly in the application.</p>

<p>Your configuration code looks something like this:</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthModule, OKTA_CONFIG } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientId', 
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
});

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>Summary of define configuration in code:</p>

<p>The most straightforward way to add configuration to your app is when the configuration does not change based on external factors.</p>

<p>When to use:</p>

 
   Use as often as you can since it’s the easiest way to configure things. 
 

<p>Best use cases:</p>

 
   Static app configurations 
   Configuring third-party libraries 
   Quick tests 
 

<p>Watch out for:</p>

 
   Configuration that involves private keys or tokens 
 

 Configuration that changes by environment 

<p>Angular has a built-in way to support per-environment differences using the <code>environments/environment.*.ts</code> files. When serving locally, Angular CLI uses the values in <code>environments/environment.ts</code>, and when you build for production, Angular CLI substitutes <code>environment.prod.ts</code> instead. You can see this file substitution defined in the <code>angular.json</code> build configuration. And if you have more environments to support, you can customize the build configuration to suit your needs.</p>

<p>The environment files are helpful when you have different configurations you want to support at build time. Some examples include enabling user analytics only on prod environments or defining the API endpoints your QA environment calls.</p>

<p><code>src/main.ts</code> contains an example of a configuration that changes based on the environment. Here you see the following:</p>

   <code>import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}
</code>   

<p>Angular utilizes the environment files to identify when to call the <code>enableProdMode()</code> method. Notice the file imports from <code>./environments/environment</code>. That’s because the build process handles that file swap.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at how we’d use this when integrating with Okta.</p>

<p>In <code>src/environments/environment.ts</code>, add the Okta auth configuration like this.</p>

   <code>export const environment = {
  production: false,
  authConfig: {
    issuer: '/oauth2/default',
    clientId: '{yourClientId}'
  }
};
</code>   

<p>In <code>src/environments/environment.prod.ts</code>, you’ll add the same <code>authConfig</code> properties with values that match your prod environment.</p>

<p>You’ll use the environment file to initialize the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> in the <code>AppModule</code> like this.</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthModule, OKTA_CONFIG } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { environment } from '../environments/environment.ts';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  ...environment.authConfig,
  redirectUri: window.location.orgin + '/login/callback'
});

@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [ BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule, OktaAuthModule ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth }}
  ],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>Summary of configuration that changes by environment:</p>

<p>Customizing environment files is the Angular recommended method to inject values during build time.</p>

<p>When to use:</p>

 
   You have different configuration values based on build output 
 

<p>Best use cases:</p>

 
   Devmode - keep apps served locally from doing things only prod apps should do 
   Multiple staging environment systems 
 

<p>Watch out for:</p>

 
   Configuration that involves private keys or tokens 
   Run the build for each environment to test changes you make. You don’t want to miss adding a property and potentially get a runtime error. 
 

 Loading configurations from external APIs 

<p>Sometimes you need to load configuration at runtime. This makes sense if you use release promotion style deployments - creating a build for a staging/pre-production environment and promoting the same build to production after verification. You don’t want to create a new build, but what if your staging and production environments require different configurations? Loading configuration from an external API is handy in scenarios like these.</p>

<p>To keep things simple for this external API configuration method, I’ll focus only on the Okta example.</p>

<p>In this example, we’ll look at <code>src/main.ts</code> where we bootstrap the Angular application. When you need configuration before the application loads, we can take advantage of <code>platformBrowserDynamic()</code> platform injector’s <code>extraProviders</code> functionality. The <code>extraProviders</code> allows us to <a href="https://angular.io/guide/hierarchical-dependency-injection#platform-injector">provide platform providers</a>, much in the same way we can provide application-wide providers in the <code>AppModule</code>.</p>

<p>Since we need to make the server call to get the configuration before we have a full Angular application context, we use Web APIs to call the API. Then we can configure the provider for Okta’s <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> injection token.</p>

<p>For a configuration API call response that looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
  "issuer": "/oauth2/default",
  "clientId": "{yourClientId}", 
  "redirectUri": "{correctHostForTheEnvironment}/login/callback"
}
</code>   

<p>…the code in your <code>src/main.ts</code> changes to:</p>

   <code>import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';
import { OKTA_CONFIG } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

fetch('http://{yourApiUri}/config').then(async res =&gt; {
  const authConfig = await res.json();

  platformBrowserDynamic([
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: {oktaAuth: new OktaAuth(authConfig)}}
  ]).bootstrapModule(AppModule)
    .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));
});
</code>   

<p>Then your <code>AppModule</code> only needs to import <code>OktaAuthModule</code> since you’ve already provided the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> injection token.</p>

<p>If you need to create the callback URI programmatically or if you need to use the configuration in multiple places, you can store the configuration in the app instead. The minimum we need is a class that holds the config, which we will show in the example. You can wrap the config in a service if your needs are more involved than what we’ll show here.</p>

<p>You’ll add a new file and create an interface that matches the response, as well as a class to hold the config:</p>

   <code>export interface AuthConfig {
  issuer: string;
  clientId: string;
}

export class OktaAuthConfig {
  constructor(public config: AuthConfig) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Edit the <code>src/main.ts</code> to provide the <code>OktaAuthConfig</code> class instead</p>

   <code>import { OktaAuthConfig } from './app/auth-config';

fetch('http://{yourApiUri}/config').then(async res =&gt; {
  const authConfig = new OktaAuthConfig(await res.json());

  platformBrowserDynamic([
    { provide: OktaAuthConfig, useValue: authConfig }
  ]).bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));
})
</code>   

<p>In the <code>AppModule</code> you can provide the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> needed to integrate with Okta by accessing <code>OktaAuthConfig</code>:</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  declarations: [ AppComponent, ProfileComponent ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: OKTA_CONFIG,
      deps: [OktaAuthConfig],
      useFactory: (oktaConfig: OktaAuthConfig) =&gt; ({
        oktaAuth: new OktaAuth({
          ...oktaConfig.config,
          redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
        })
      })
    }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
</code>   

<p>You can now load a config from an API and use the app’s location.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself, “Isn’t there an <code>APP_INITIALIZER</code> token or something we can use instead”? Well, yes, there is an <a href="https://angular.io/api/core/APP_INITIALIZER"><code>APP_INITIALIZER</code> token</a> for executing initialization functions that complete before application initialization completes. However, in our case, we need the auth configuration in order to initialize. So, we need to finish loading the configuration before initializing the app, which we can do when bootstrapping.</p>

<p>Summary of loading configuration from an external API:</p>

<p>Load configuration from an API and provide the config to the application. Depending on your needs, the configuration loading may occur during bootstrapping or via <code>APP_INITIALIZER</code>.</p>

<p>When to use:</p>

 
   You want the configuration to load at runtime instead of being baked into the code 
   Your configuration properties include private information that you don’t want to commit to source control 
 

<p>Best use cases:</p>

 
   You have different configurations for staging and prod and use release-promotion style deployment processes 
   Your configuration changes frequently or often enough where building and deploying the app is not feasible 
 

<p>Watch out for:</p>

 
   Configuration errors or network blips - your app will not run since it’s dependent on the external API. 
   Anything that can decrease application load speed such as overly large configuration response, calling too many endpoints, or slow server response. 
   Potential challenges with verification and testing, since configuration may change.

<p>This week’s Holochain release brings a substantial change to the HDK: validation is based on DHT ops, not source chain elements. This change is coming now as part of the core dev team’s effort to stabilise the HDK so you don’t have to refactor your code as often.</p><p>There’s a lot going on in the hApp ecosystem as well. Read on for all the news!</p> A note about breaking HDK changes <p>Before I share the release notes for the last two Holochain versions, I want to talk about what I mean when I describe some HDK changes as ‘breaking’. Generally I mean one of two things:</p>  Something in the hApp-dev-facing ‘surface area’ has changed — that is, public functions or types — and you need to refactor your code.  The hApp-dev-facing surface area hasn’t changed, but something in the conductor’s host API has changed behind the scenes, which requires you to recompile your zome code against the new HDK.  <p>But this morning the core devs educated me about another, more subtle breaking change. This change happens every time you update to a new HDK version, even if there aren’t any of the above sorts of changes. In fact, it happens every time you recompile your zome code — even if you stick to the same HDK version.</p><p>What is this breaking change? Every time you recompile, the DNA hash changes. This is because the Rust-to-WASM compiler doesn’t produce deterministic builds — at least, not without a lot of tooling work. We don’t have a step-by-step guide for setting up deterministic builds, and from what I understand it’s quite a difficult process.</p><p>I’m still searching for better language, to distinguish different kinds of break. Until I find the right words, I’ll just clarify whether a change breaks your code versus compatibility with the host API. If I say ‘no breaking changes’, however, know that you can still break compatibility with prior copies of your DNA’s compiled WASM simply by recompiling — HDK upgrade or not.</p> Holochain 0.0.126: Bug fixes, HDK consistency <p>Most of the work in this version was administrative — CI improvements, test coverage, and the like — there are three things worth knowing about.</p>  The HDK has been <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/">updated to 0.0.122</a>, with no breaking changes.  A panic on conductor startup has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1206">#1206</a>)  The HDK’s entry deletion functions <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/entry/fn.delete.html"><code>delete</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/entry/fn.delete_entry.html"><code>delete_entry</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/capability/fn.delete_cap_grant.html"><code>delete_cap_grant</code></a> now take a new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/struct.DeleteInput.html"><code>DeleteInput</code></a> struct, which lets you specify relaxed chain top ordering just like create and update functions. This is not a breaking change, as you can still pass just a plain <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/type.HeaderHash.html"><code>HeaderHash</code></a> as before and it will get converted to a <code>DeleteInput</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1213">#1213</a>)  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.126/CHANGELOG.md#20220211091841">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.127: New validation approach, other HDK changes, gossip changes <p>The biggest developer-facing change in this release is a new approach to validation based on DHT operations rather than source chain elements (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1211">#1211</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1212">#1212</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1210">#1210</a>). And it’s a big breaking change. Here’s what you need to know:</p>  When an agent publishes a source chain element, it gets converted into a number of DHT operations that transform the data that other peers store. There are three kinds of operations: ones that create an entry, ones that create a header, and ones that affect metadata on an entry, header, or agent ID (such as a link, delete, update, or source chain change). You can get an overview of this in the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#a-cloud-of-witnesses">core concepts</a>.  Moving validation to operations forces you to think more deliberately about the previous point. This may make things complicated at first, but I feel that it also brings clarity and helps you reason more accurately about what’s happening on the DHT when an agent publishes one of their source chain elements.  Each zome has only <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/validate/index.html">one validation callback</a> which receives all operations it produced, as well as all operations not produced by any specific zome (such as those generated from system elements like the membrane proof or agent ID elements). All other validation callbacks are now obsolete.  The validation callback receives one parameter, an enum called <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html"><code>Op</code></a>, that describes all seven kinds of operations and contains the appropriate element and entry data. The documentation describes the enum in depth, telling you which operations are created from which types of source chain elements.  If you look at the documentation for <code>Op</code>, you’ll notice that <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/prelude/enum.Op.html#variant.RegisterAgentActivity">agent activity ops</a> (changes to an agent’s source chain that get registered as DHT metadata on their agent ID entry) can now be validated.  The <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/struct.ValidationPackage.html">validation package</a>, which included a portion of the author’s source chain, is no longer passed to the validation callback. This <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.122/hdk/prelude/struct.ValidateData.html#structfield.validation_package">input field</a> had been empty for a while and will eventually be replaced by a host function which lets you query portions of the author’s source chain via the DHT. (For now you can iterate over the source chain using <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/entry/fn.must_get_header.html"><code>must_get_header</code></a> repeatedly.) All other dependencies can be retrieved using <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/chain/fn.get_agent_activity.html?search=must_get"><code>must_get_*</code></a> functions, as usual.  You can see code examples for the new validation approach in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/holochain-0.0.127/crates/test_utils/wasm/wasm_workspace"><code>wasm_workspace</code> tests folder</a> (scroll down to ‘validate’).  <p>Here are the other changes in this release:</p>  Sharding is now turned on by default (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1237">#1237</a>). That means that each participant has less work to do in helping secure the integrity of an application’s network and data.  The HDK has been <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/">updated to 0.0.123</a>, with a few breaking changes in the HDK.  The <code>init</code> guest callback, called by the conductor when it runs a DNA for the first time, can now use the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/p2p/fn.call.html"><code>call</code></a> host function, allowing one agent to access functionality in <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#inter-zome-call">other zomes</a> within the same cell, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#bridge-call">other cells</a> with different DNAs on their own machine, or <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#remote-call">other agents’ cells</a> with the same DNA. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1186">#1186</a>)  The host exposes a new hashing utility function called <code>hash</code> with a lot more options. It’s not exposed via the HDK, but it does show up as a number of <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.123/hdk/hash/index.html">convenience functions</a>, including a refactor of the existing <code>hash_entry</code>. Now you can pass anything hashable — not just entries, but also headers and even raw bytes. If you’re passing raw bytes, you can receive either a 256-bit Blake2B hash (the default used by Holochain), a 256-bit <a href="https://keccak.team/keccak_specs_summary.html">Keccak</a> hash (used by Ethereum), or a 256-bit SHA3 hash. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1222">#1222</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1228">#1228</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1230">#1230</a>). Support for 256- and 512-byte SHA2 hashes is also planned.  Breaking: Your DNA manifest now takes an <code>origin_time</code> field, which defines the earliest timestamp that any source chain header may have. This prevents agents from forging nonsensical timestamps, but will also help with the efficiency of the not-yet-released fast gossip algorithm. Timestamps can be specified as an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339">RFC3339 time string</a>, or the number of microseconds since the start of the <a href="https://www.epochconverter.com/">UNIX epoch</a> if you’re good at math. If you don’t specify an origin time in your manifest, it’ll default to January 1st, 2022 at 00:00:00 UTC (maybe we should call this the start of the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/prelude/struct.Timestamp.html#associatedconstant.HOLOCHAIN_EPOCH">Holochain epoch</a>!) Unspecified origin times will eventually be deprecated. When you use the <code>hc dna init</code> command, it’ll populate the manifest with the system’s current time as an RFC3339 time string. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1224">#1224</a>)  Breaking: The P2P protocol has two changes which break compatibility with version 0.0.126 and lower. First, hashes are no longer passed along with data, as authorities need to calculate these anyway. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1233">#1233</a>) Second, in preparation for the new fast gossip algorithm, nodes can sync DHT data by ‘region’ (more on this when the new algorithm lands). (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1234">#1234</a>)  There are also lots of updates to documentation courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/jost-s">Jost</a>, as part of our increased commitment to improving all developer documentation.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.127/CHANGELOG.md#20220223090000">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> DWeb webinar on decentralised storage <p>Our friends at the Internet Archive and DWeb are hosting monthly webinars on various decentralised web topics.

 Decentralised storage on Holochain with the file-storage module <p>On the topic of decentralised storage, I must mention the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage">file-storage module</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/guillemcordoba">Guillem Córdoba</a>, <a href="https://github.com/HedayatAbedijoo">Hedayat Abedijoo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/harlantwood">Harlan Wood</a>. It accepts any kind of binary data, chunked into pieces 16MB or less for more equitable distribution around the DHT, and identified by a file manifest that lets you name it, give it a type, and specify who created it and when.</p><p>It includes examples of two DNAs: one in which everyone can write and retrieve data directly to and from the DHT, and one where they do it through peers who have agreed to be ‘providers’. This second approach could be used to create hosting incentives for certain files, for example.</p><p>Chunking is the responsibility of whatever client you create, because different chunking strategies might make more sense for different contexts. You may want to align your chunk boundaries along video frames, or optimise for lag-free streaming or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_deduplication">deduplication</a>, or play with chunk sizes that have an impact on the amount of data each peer is asked to store. There is an example UI included that breaks files into 256 KB chunks before committing them to the DHT.</p><p>All in all, it’s pretty comprehensive! This module has actually been around for a long time, and I may or may not have mentioned it in a past Dev Pulse, but this seemed like a good time to bring it up!</p> Video: Scaffolding a hApp in less than 10 minutes <p>This is a workshop that Guillem Córdoba in the Web3 Infrastructure room at FOSDEM 2022. It starts with a great introduction to what Holochain is about, then proceeds to show you how to get started writing a hApp using our scaffolding tool, all while explaining how a hApp is architected. I haven’t tried it myself, but the tool looks both easy and comprehensive — it even lets you generate a basic UI!</p> Video and demo repo: Bundling your hApp with Electron <p>In the most recent <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/about-the-holochain-in-action-category/5448">Holochain in Action</a> video, Connor walks you through the process of bundling the Holochain conductor, your hApp, and your web-based UI into an Electron-based executable, using his <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/electron-holochain-template">template</a>. If this is something that you find exciting, you’ll probably want to look at this <a href="https://github.com/Connoropolous/hc-events/">example repo</a> that not only uses the Electron template but demonstrates how to use GitHub CI to do the building for you.</p> Forum conversation: Migrating data on DNA upgrade <p>The question of migration — what to do with all the data in an existing DHT when it’s time to upgrade the DNA — is a good one. There are design challenges involved, so it’s no surprise when someone brings up questions about it.</p><p>This <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/updating-the-source-code-is-going-to-create-a-new-chain/7885">forum thread about migration</a> is a good one. Connor Turland of <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> lays out some good principles for migrating a hApp’s data and hints at the possibility of future changes that will make migration a less common occurrence. (Note: these changes are very likely to happen, but the details are still being worked out.)</p> Correction: dev.hc Discord invite URL <p>In the last Dev Pulse I made the mistake of sharing an invitation to the dev.hc Discord server that eventually expired. Here’s a <a href="https://discord.gg/usvDaqNeA7">permanent invite URL</a>; we’d love to see you there!</p><p>The dev.hc Discord server is created and stewarded by the community; it’s a great place to have informal conversations about developing Holochain apps or understanding the technical details better. And don’t forget the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/">Holochain Forum</a> — not only is it a good place to have more in-depth conversations involving a lot of text and code, but there are a lot of great resources in past forum threads!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniegray?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Annie Gray</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/renovation?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Have you heard the&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/facebook-isnt-growing-anymore/">news</a>? Facebook has stopped growing.</p>



<p>In a first for the social media giant, its daily active user numbers dropped in the&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-events/default.aspx">last quarter of 2021</a>, and its monthly active user numbers remained steady in the second half of the year. The poor performance sent Meta Platforms stocks plummeting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc">27%</a>&nbsp;on Wall Street earlier this month, a result “<a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc">unprecedented in stock market history</a>”.</p>



 <a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc">Observers</a>&nbsp;say this distinct lack of growth for Facebook comes from a convergence of substantial threats: 



<p></p>



  Facebook is an aging monolith that no amount of rebranding as part of the new shiny ‘Meta’ stable can hide or reverse. It’s arguably attracted all the new users it’s going to attract.  <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/we-told-you-so-apples-new-privacy-changes-validate-what-weve-done-for-years/">Apple iOS privacy changes</a>&nbsp;have hit Facebook’s ad revenue hard, at the same time as advertisers are tightening their belts.  The platform admits it’s facing stiff competition for user time and attention from TikTok and YouTube, and its own answer to TikTok, Reels, isn’t engaging users as quickly as hoped.  



<p>We would add another substantial threat to this list: the privacy tide is turning. We’ve been saying for a long time that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers are fed up</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">trading their privacy for access</a>&nbsp;to products and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumers have never been louder in their calls for better protection of their personal data by the brands and products they engage with, and it seems Facebook just isn’t hearing them or responding seriously enough. And we all know Facebook isn’t the only one.</p>

<p>Art in a decentralized world.&nbsp;</p>



 The rise of NFTs.&nbsp; 



<p>NFTs are by far one of the hottest topics at the moment. In March 2021 artist Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, sold one of his artworks as NFT at the auction house Christies for 69 million USD. The sale made him one of the top three most valuable living artists. Less than a year later, the leading NFT marketplace OpenSea kicked off the year with a NFT trading volume of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-monthly-volumes-top-5b-as-nfts-continue-to-mainstream">more than </a>5 Billion USD in January 2022. This equals the volume of the whole of 2021. Ever since, it’s fair to say that NFTs are out of the niche. Is this the future of art? Maybe – but what’s for sure is that NFTs are here to stay.&nbsp;</p>



 What are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/non-fungible-token/">NFTs or Non-Fungible Tokens</a> are non-interchangeable tokens stored on a blockchain or other form of distributed ledger. The tokens can represent any form or data, from a picture or video to a digital asset in a video game. Due to their unique non-interchangeable traits, NFTs are often compared to traditional collectibles, like playing cards or artworks – just with the difference of being fully digital.&nbsp;</p>



 How are NFTs different from cryptocurrencies?&nbsp; 



<p>Unlike NFTs, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">cryptocurrencies</a> are fungible, meaning that every unit is the same. Like with traditional FIAT currencies like EUR, USD and GBP, every monetary unit is equal and interchangeable. In practice, NFTs are usually purchased with cryptocurrencies, like Ether (ETH) or Solana (SOL). In other words, NFTs are the good you are buying, while crypto is the mean to pay for it.&nbsp;</p>



 Where can I buy NFTs, and how are they stored?&nbsp; 



<p>There are many dedicated NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Rarible or Nifty Gateway. In addition, some projects, such as Axie Infinity, NBA Top Shot or Sorare have their own marketplace and sometimes even their own cryptocurrency. In addition, many of the established crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Binance are expanding into NFT trading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some marketplaces also allow you to store NFTs, they are typically stored in a personal wallet. The most popular wallet for storing NFTs is MetaMask. After purchasing a NFT on a marketplace, the token can be transferred to your personal wallet for storage.&nbsp;</p>



 Notable NFT projects.&nbsp; 



<p>Even though the NFT trend is still fairly new, there is already thousands of projects out there. Here are a few projects worth watching.&nbsp;</p>



 



Project nameDescription<a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">Crypto Kitties</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect and breed unique kittens. One of the first NFT projects with significant traction.<br><a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks">Crypto Punks</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect unique punk-themed avatars. Popular as Twitter profile picture.<br><a href="https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a><br>Collect unique and evolve ape-themed avatars. Popular as Twitter profile picture.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect and battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><a href="https://sorare.com/">Sorare</a>&nbsp;<br>Collect digital cards of football players. Over 200 officially licensed clubs.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a>&nbsp;<br>Collectible short video clips from the NBA basketball league.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">Beeple</a>&nbsp;<br>In March 2021 artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, sold one of his artworks as NFT at the auction house Christies. The sale made him one of the top three most valuable living artists.<br>



 



 Fine art – a long history of money laundering.&nbsp; 



<p>Long before NFTs existed, fine art has been used as a store of value, and with that comes a long history of money laundering. Unlike with other assets, like stocks or gold, the value of an artwork is highly subjective to the viewer or owner. Popular paintings are often valued in the double-digit millions with the most famous artworks, like the <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6110563">Salvator Mundi by Leonardo da Vinci, being last sold for more than 450 million USD</a>. Therefore, artworks, mostly paintings, are perfect for storing, moving and exchanging large amounts of value in a very compact form. In consequence, paintings and other artworks have a long history of smuggling and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In February 2022, the United States Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Study_WoA.pdf">Study of the Facilitation of Money Laundering and Terror Finance Through the Trade in Works of Art</a>”. The report showcases the risk of money laundering through art trade being bigger than ever.&nbsp;</p>



 Why NFTs are attractive for money laundering. 



<p>NFTs essentially are digital artworks and therefore have the same traits as conventional art. In addition, NFTs come with the benefit of being fully digital, making them much easier to trade compared to moving physical art. Like with cryptocurrencies, a NFT can be transferred from one wallet or owner to another within seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the trait that makes NFTs particularly attractive for money laundering purposes are the volatile prices. While the exchange rate of Bitcoin to EUR follows the market principles of supply and demand, the prices of NFTs are highly speculative. In practice, a NFT that was just bought for 1 EUR can be sold for 1 million EUR the next day. This makes NFTs attractive for laundering black money through legitimate transactions. </p>



<p>While blockchains allow to trace these transactions between wallets, without a KYC of the wallet holder, it’s easier than ever to anonymously transfer value. For these reasons and according to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) the “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury_Study_WoA.pdf">Emerging Digital Art Market</a>” presents an immense threat for potential money laundering and financial crime.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC in a decentralized world.&nbsp; 



<p>Like with crypto exchanges a few years ago, most NFT marketplaces are not requiring a KYC from their users. For the same reasons as for crypto, buying and trading NFTs on platforms without a KYC process can be <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">an immense risk for both users and platform operators</a> alike.&nbsp;</p>



 What regulation are NFTs falling under? 



<p>Most national regulators just caught up with regulating cryptocurrencies, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/11-fold-increase-in-bitcoin-account-openings/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) or Ether (ETH). For example, the EU with the implementation of the 5AMLD extended the coverage of their AML regulations to include cryptocurrencies. However, due to NFTs being cryptographic yet different because of their non-fungible traits, they are not necessarily covered in existing laws or often fall into grey zones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in September 2020, the European Commission presented a proposal for the regulation of cryptoassets, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52020PC0593">Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation, or MiCA proposal</a>. As part of this proposal, the EU for the first-time defined criteria for classifying a cryptoasset as a “digital representation of value or rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology”. This would extend the coverage to at least partially include NFTs. While the MiCA proposal is still just a proposal, it’s expected to come into effect soon as rising trading volumes are driving demand for clear taxation laws.&nbsp;</p>



 Why NFT marketplaces should implement KYC &amp; AML procedures. 



<p>With rising popularity and especially exploding trading volumes, it’s ultimately only a question of time until the regulators will extend their AML coverage to NFTs. In parallel, the same discussion is happening around <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>. In addition, compliant platforms with proper KYC procedures would potentially boost mass adoption. In particular, institutional investors as well as brands require compliant solutions to stay away from money laundering themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conclusion, NFT marketplaces and platforms now have the chance to act sooner rather than later, and proactively add <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC procedures</a>, before the AML regulations will enforce it.&nbsp;</p>

We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1494393715678457857?s=20&amp;t=MLWkF2PVF0ENRyo0kZZvwQ">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “More uses of DID”, and discussed whether DID can identify other non-human entities, and how to expand the practical use of DID. The participants agreed that DID can identify real non-human entities, such as IoT devices, to provide a more convenient management solution for device administrators; DID can also identify virtual items in the virtual world to clarify the rights and interests of virtual items for holders allocation etc.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He shared the practical liquidity mining strategy, focusing on the importance and operation of liquidity pools.

Gloria said “By using blockchain technology and secure identity solutions built on blockchain, we can combat data breaches and place the control back in the hands of self-sovereign individuals.”   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>World Bank — 《Is the Self-Sovereign digital identity the future digital business registry?》</p><p>“In this digital age of instant access to information and socially distant transactions, unique digital identity is a fundamental requirement. Otherwise, how can we be sure we are interacting with whom we mean to? Unfortunately, we are far from where we need to be. For businesses, legal identity is obtained through registration with a country’s business registration authority. In that process, the business is “born,” and ideally, it should be assigned a unique identifier and business name that is meant to facilitate its authentication and interaction with the government and other stakeholders. This information is collected into business registries.”</p><p>As a digital “identity card”, DID can not only help users prove their identity through uniqueness, but also return data and privacy to users through blockchain technology, solving information leakage and advertising harassment caused by the centralization of the traditional Internet. Ontology has been working in the DID industry for several years, and has gradually reached cooperative relations with service providers in various industries and fields around the world. Through the comprehensive deployment of DID, global users will have a unique digital identity, which can not only protect and manage identity and privacy, but also log in to various dApps with one click, maintaining identity unity and data interoperability.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>, the decentralized data exchange protocol unlocking data for AI, supports the launch of Data Whale’s ALGA datatoken wallet — a project financed through <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, Ocean’s community-curated grants program. In anticipation of Ocean Protocol’s upcoming releases — V4 and Data Farming, ALGA is a tool that allows for an intuitive, seamless DataFi experience.</p><p>ALGA: one-stop DeFi junction for data&nbsp;assets</p><p><a href="https://datatoken.app/">ALGA</a> is an application that offers users the opportunity to engage with the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> on a mobile interface. The overall goals are to facilitate more consumption volume on the Ocean Market, to generate positive network value through onboarding data curators and to accelerate the widespread adoption of OCEAN allowing for more Web3 enthusiasts and yield farmers to participate in an open data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>ALGA integrates with Ethereum and the Ocean Market via WalletConnect — the user can simply connect an existing Web3 wallet without entering private keys or creating a new wallet altogether. ALGA will also integrate with other EVM chains after V4 launch. After connecting, users can take full advantage of the ALGA wallet interface that combines functionalities and insights about datatokens in an intuitive way.</p><p>On the app home screen, users can add their favourite datatokens to a Watchlist, check out the assets with the highest liquidity (TVL) and see the latest Initial Data Offerings on the Ocean Market. The application also provides a detailed analysis screen for each datatoken, where users can analyze price history in different timeframes, total pool liquidity, dataset descriptions and publisher information.</p><p>Once a Web3 wallet is connected, ALGA unfolds its full potential. The application reads and analyzes on-chain wallet data and provides input on datatoken holdings priced in OCEAN, datatoken price changes, historic transactions and more. Users can swap datatokens against OCEAN or stake OCEAN on all datatoken liquidity pools available on Ethereum [gas and transaction fees&nbsp;apply].</p><p>Trent McConaghy, Founder of Ocean Protocol&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“Guided by the vision to bring DataFi to mobile phones, ALGA is showing the way for easier and more secure individual participation in an open data economy powered by Ocean. Our focus in 2022 is to ramp up the adoption of Ocean data exchange functionalities and ALGA is yet another important step in that direction.”</blockquote><p>Moritz Frings, Project Lead, Data Whale,&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>“Ocean Protocol gave me the opportunity to become a part of their journey of kickstarting a Web3 Data Economy. Thanks to OceanDAO and community support, we were able to build ALGA, an application that allows users to track and analyze their datatoken holdings. Since the launch of Ocean Market, it was my dream to have a tool that will allow me to track all of my data assets in one spot. With ALGA, this dream became a reality and I trust the Ocean community will enjoy its features.”</blockquote><p>ALGA is available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realdatawhale.alga">Google Playstore</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/data-whale-alga-wallet/id1585860617">Apple App&nbsp;Store.</a></p><p>For more details, watch <a href="https://datawhale.ai/">Data Whale’s Ocean Data Market Tutorials and </a>visit the <a href="https://datatoken.app/">ALGA&nbsp;website.</a></p><p>For those trading at night, the application’s dark mode will come in&nbsp;handy.</p><p>As part of its future roadmap, ALGA functionalities will be expanded to other data markets and networks.</p> About ALGA <p>ALGA is the first mobile datatoken dApp for the Web3 Data Economy inspired by Ocean Protocol. ALGA is fully integrated with the Ocean Protocol Market and performs a multitude of functions, including swapping and staking&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> About Data&nbsp;Whale <p>Data Whale is a community-oriented project inspired by Ocean Protocol to help kickstart a Web3 data economy. To support the objectives of Ocean Protocol, Data Whale develops a variety of tools that accelerate the adoption of datatokens, an emerging blockchain asset class of tokens backed by real-world datasets.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-whale-announces-the-launch-of-alga-the-first-mobile-defi-wallet-for-the-ocean-market-dea73f29f7d8">Data Whale announces the launch of ALGA, the first mobile DeFi wallet for the Ocean Market</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Successful year supports IDnow’s journey towards becoming the European leader in identity verification and authentication 
<p>Munich, February 23rd, 2022, IDnow, a leading European Identity Proofing Platform, reports another record year, closing 2021 by organically doubling the number of transactions in its core business. The growth rate is fueled by strong momentum in new sales, increased use of the platform among its existing client base and is further supported by the successful integration of ARIADNEXT in France and identity Trust Management AG (“identity.TM”) in Germany.</p>
<p>The acceleration of advanced digital business models has led to a shift in demand from single-product identity verification towards comprehensive identity proofing platforms. IDnow’s acquisitions of ARIADNEXT and identity.TM in 2021 have allowed the Company to seamlessly meet this rising demand across Europe with one of the broadest sets of identity verification methods available in the market.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow, commented: “Our goal is to build the leading unified identity proofing platform that meets the multi-dimensional user needs of our customers, whilst meeting stringent and often complex regulatory demands. Through our successful M&amp;A ventures, the IDnow group is now positioned to offer best-in-class products and services that deliver a seamless user experience across an expansive range of geographies and verticals.”</p>
<p>The combined IDnow platform provides a holistic suite of products, catering to the advanced needs of its leading, international clients. In the past year, IDnow added a record number of new clients, including some of the fastest-growing European brands, such as eToro and Lydia. The IDnow platform is used by leading companies globally, with half of the top 20 banks in Europe as well as each of the top 4 relevant telecommunication operators in France and Germany relying on its services.</p>
<p>IDnow has made a series of senior hires in the past year to support the Company’s rapid growth, including Johannes Meerloo as COO, Doug Pollock as Director of Customer Success, Jamie Turner as Vice President People as well as Dr. Heinrich Grave as Senior Vice President Digital Identity. The Company has also opened offices in the UK as well as in the Middle East to cater to regional surges in demand.</p>
<p>“The identity verification and proofing space is experiencing tremendous growth as companies increasingly adopt digital-first strategies. Our automated verification product solutions have proven themselves to be the first choice for some of the biggest companies across Europe, which is a testament to the levels of fraud assurance we continuously offer our customers. Looking forward to the rest of the year, I am very excited about our position in the market. With our holistic identity proofing platform, strengthened team and additional regional locations, we’re in a unique position to offer enterprises exactly what they need from a single source,” says Andreas Bodczek. “I am looking forward to 2022 – a year in which we will continue to bring our three combined companies closer together and strive for increased market leadership as a unified force.”</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Authentication without passwords is the goal that many businesses have already set, but very few have delivered. Now, WebAuthN is one of the standards that we hear the most lately. So today we’ll have a critical assessment of WebAuthN. And we’ll see, is it ready to deliver its promise? And for that we have a special guest who is Olly Brough.</p>
<p>He’s Managing Director of EMEA at Trusona. Olly has built his career delivering best in class payments, anti-fraud, and identity solutions to leading retail, financial services and public sector clients working with a variety of high growth technology companies in Europe and overseas. Prior to joining Trusona, Olly led European sales and marketing functions of privately-owned technology businesses to successful exit including QAS; an identity and data quality business, Eiger Systems; a consumer payment collection platform, Cambridge Global Payments; a cross border bank payments service, and 41st Parameter; the online device intelligence platform.</p>
<p>Hello, Olly.</p>
<p>Olly Brough: Hello, Oscar. Good morning to you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good morning. And welcome, let’s talk about data identity. But as always, I want to hear more about our guests. So please, Olly, tell us a bit more about yourself and how was your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Olly: Thank you, Oscar. So yeah, my name is Olly. I’m based here in the UK. My focus is, as you said, has been very much around growing technology companies across Europe. I think I somewhat stumbled into the world of identity. I first joined, over 25 years ago, a data verification business that was at the time flexed on helping organisations increase the integrity of their name and address data for old style mailing campaigns, just before the internet was a big thing.</p>
<p>But of course, that morphed into identity verification, because once you have names and addresses and date of birth, you can then start to verify identities. And that business was acquired by Experian, the big PLC. Then really through that, my experience sort of morphed into identity verification. And then I got into the whole area of online security, which is where I am now initially through 41st Parameter, but now focusing on Trusona.</p>
<p>And then finally I dipped into payments along the way. But then payments, as you know, is also very heavily associated with the world of online authentication because payments can’t happen unless they’ve been authenticated in the right way. So yeah, it’s been an interesting last 25 years – long may it continue.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, super interesting journey, touching several industries so you say that were very close to identity. And excellent, OK, so we are going to discuss about especially WebAuthN, if you can tell us first what is that?</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah. Well, first of all, I’ll give it a little bit of context. Trusona was established over five years ago in Arizona, with great backing from the likes of sort of Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins. If I’m honest, we always would have hoped that progress would have been quicker in those early years. But I think many people have the vision to remove passwords and other static authenticators like less OTPs and the like. But I think to a degree, the technology has been the constraining factor in terms of standards that are available to use to bring more consumers into using passwordless capabilities. That’s been there a little bit more in the workplace type environment, but perhaps been a limiting factor when trying to authenticate consumers.</p>
<p>So WebAuthN, the question you asked is, what is WebAuthN and why would you use it? Well, WebAuthN I think is the most exciting development that I’ve seen over the last four and a half years working with Trusona. And it is a standard that has been adopted by FIDO. OK, now, W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, created the standard. And FIDO, which stands for Fast Identity Online. And really FIDO is an alliance, an open industry association that’s mission is helping create standards to remove passwords from those secure interactions. OK? So they are bankrolled by the likes of Google, Apple, Microsoft, and all the usual suspects. And they have a common interest in helping to standardise on the internet so that we can better authenticate individuals and move away from passwords.</p>
<p>So in terms of explaining what WebAuthN is, then probably the best way to describe it is we’ve all now had that experience of being able to open an app and tap in the app to identify yourself, or at least most of us are familiar with that. I, for example, bank with StarlingBbank but you might have other services – where Starling bank, for example in the UK, forces you to use the app and therefore every time you want to authenticate or accept a card payment or move a payment, they will ask you to open your app and to tap in the app using face ID or your touch ID. And I think people now accept that if you have that app, then that is a really good experience for consumers.</p>
<p>The problem with that type of technology, which is stuff that Trusona has been helping people with, is if you do not have the app for the brand, so let’s say I’m trying to talk to my telco, and I don’t have the Vodafone app on my phone. Then Vodafone do not have the capability to ask me just to tap or look into the device to authenticate. Because that is only available if you have that relationship with a native mobile app, the My Vodafone app.</p>
<p>To put it into context, I’m trying to explain that problem and then that will explain why WebAuthN is a useful technology. The problem is if you take the telco industry, for example, then only about 18% of their customers have actually got around to downloading the app. So if you were posing a solution for telcos to authenticate their customers, then you’re proposing a solution that only addresses 18% of their customers, whilst the rest of the world, the other 82%, are still stuck with passwords and usernames and SMS OTPs and the like.</p>
<p>What WebAuthN has done is enabled that same tap in app experience but without the need to have the brand’s native mobile app. It effectively allows the likes of Vodafone to deliver the same experience, but through their mobile website, and using the Chrome or the Safari, or Microsoft Edge app that is installed on the device as the app, so that they do not have to establish that app-base relationship to have that tap and go experience of authentication.</p>
<p>So what WebAuthN really means is that when consumers pull their new phones out of the box, they already have the standard on their device. And there is no technology to be delivered to the customer to enable them to be able to cleanly authenticate to a brand, which means that now instead of 18% of people being able to do it, 100% of people can now have that same tap and go experience. Is that clear? There’s quite a bit of detail there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, yes. I think a good idea is the way you clarified. First of all, you start explaining that there are already nowadays, in the last year, they already have been companies’ services that offer their own proprietary own branded authenticator app, mobile app, which authenticate or which, as you said, the user experience is normally good, that works and is secure. And now, to make it more accessible to everybody, that kind of app is just in every browser, at least in the browser who are supporting WebAuthN. Correct?</p>
<p>Olly: That’s correct. Yeah. It is available to everybody out of the box on all new mobile devices. And increasingly, it’s available on desktop devices.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It sounds super convenient. Of course, you don’t have to install an app. If it sounds so convenient, as you are describing it, why we don’t see this so much. Actually, I think once I try with GitHub, I try but I haven’t found, I haven’t heard many services that offer it. So is it really available now?</p>
<p>Olly: So first of all, let’s address the question as to whether it’s a technology that’s here to stay, or it might disappear in the next 12 to 24 months? The answer is it’s definitely here to stay. Today, about 85% of all smartphones in Western Europe have the capability already. OK? So I think that’s something that people don’t understand.</p>
<p>It is there. The reason there was a delay was that it took a little while for Apple and their iOS operating system to adopt the standard and that happened in September 2021. And now, as those updates have been updated to those Apple devices, there’s a very, very high penetration, it’s almost 100% of Apple mobile smartphone devices.</p>
<p>Coming back to your question about why haven’t you seen it out there? You will now increasingly, it’s being used by some of the core services that Apple and Google deliver themselves, things like Apple Pay and Google Pay and the like. But the challenge is, it’s really- until Apple came to the party back in September 2021, it’s been very difficult for people to deliver use cases. But now that it’s in place in the last year, we’re seeing an increasing incidence of projects using this type of technology. So it’s definitely here to stay.</p>
<p>The challenge is, you probably won’t realise that you’re using it, because the experience is very, very good. It is simply like just unlocking your smartphone device. And so you will be using it in instances that you have no awareness that this is WebAuthN, because why should you? You as a consumer, all you care about is being able to authenticate and get what you want.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So it means that it’s been already, let’s say for the last month, at least available on the services side, but not available because of Apple, Apple didn’t support it on their clients.</p>
<p>Olly: But now it’s in iOS 14 so it’s pretty much, unless you have a very old Apple device, you will have WebAuthN available on your device. As I say, I think the key point is it is being used, but people aren’t aware of it because you wouldn’t explain to the consumer, “Do you want to log on using WebAuthN?” They will say, “Do you want to use biometrics to log on?” And they’ll tap and that’ll be done, and they won’t think any more about it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. I think it’s a good time to hear about the use cases. So I’d like to hear which use cases are being used already.</p>
<p>Olly: So, where we’re seeing the most activity is really in two areas. And I’m talking about on the consumer side of things at the workforce level, then authenticator apps are pretty well-established as a mechanism to do second factor authentication. And you will now see on the workforce side, we’ve already got deployments whereby organisations are using WebAuthN instead of an authenticator app to passwordless the MFA into single sign-on environments like Okta, for example.</p>
<p>So that’s one area, the workforce environment where CISOs want to get rid of passwords, and they want MFA. And they don’t want to have to go around policing everybody to download and enrol to the authenticator app. They just want to move that overhead. So that’s one area.</p>
<p>On the consumer side, I’d say there are two areas of real interest to us. One is the customer services area, which has always been strong because people don’t realise the cost of passwords, pins and codes to customer services. Ultimately, if I can’t self-serve, then I will pick up the phone to customer services, which drives up costs. So it’s always, while security is important, really, the areas where good ROI is delivered is where there’s a real meaningful cost upon the business of passwords, usernames, pins and codes.</p>
<p>So for customer services, we are seeing a lot of interest in using this over chat discussions. If you have an open chat discussion, at some point, the brand will want to enable account servicing via chat. But they can’t do that, because it is very difficult to authenticate someone over a chat discussion. Whereas if you have the WebAuthN capability, you can literally just send a message that enables the customer to tap on the screen, look into the device, and they have authenticated themselves. And now they can move that chat journey into the account servicing level where I might want to change my address. And a lot of time chat discussions are limited to initial sort of high-level questions, but you always have to then pick up the phone if you want something more serious done. So that’s one area that we’re seeing quite good demand.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest is the replacement of SMS. So whilst this is not a true passwordless deployment, SMS is seen as a real pain for businesses. Why is that? Well, one, it costs money. So finance people don’t like it, that can be very, very expensive. Number two, it has a attritional impact and we’ve seen that with PSD2 and Strong Customer Authentication and payments across Europe. There are attrition rates associated with SMS of between 10% and 30%, OK? We’ve all had that experience where we tap a button and say, “Send me an SMS” and it doesn’t turn up and then you tap it again. And then you get two or three at the same time and then you enter the phone number, not the code. So all of that cost money or impacts conversion, which drives revenue.</p>
<p>And then finally, we know that SMS is not particularly secure, because it really is not a true possession factor. It’s the SIM card rather than the actual physical device, whereas WebAuthN strongly identifies the actual physical device. So for those out-and-out mobile login type experiences where there is a security requirement to have a second factor, then we see WebAuthN as being so easy to deploy.</p>
<p>So we’ve seen a lot of interest in the gambling sector at the moment for a very, very cutting edge with regards to customer experience. So instead of having to go through with those steps, the customer literally just taps on the screen, looks into their phone, and they’ve been strongly authenticated, there’s no need to remember anything or type anything. And they can get on with what they want to do, which might be placing a bet on the 2.15 at Haydock. So those are the use cases that we’re seeing early on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks for sharing that. Very interesting, of course, you mentioned the workforce, the replacement of SMS which is widely used today still. And yeah, you have described why it’s not a good idea to keep using that. But there was also fun, quite interesting and I haven’t heard before is about the customer service using the chat. So yeah, definitely, it makes that kind of customer service via chat much more powerful.</p>
<p>Olly: Exactly. Because I saw a stat, I think it’s something like, I can’t remember what the numbers were and I’m going to be cautious not to misquote on this discussion. But I think generally speaking, we would now prefer to get something via chat than picking up the telephone, because you multitask, you can tap a message, “I need this, I need this, I need this.” And that, I think is a very powerful driver.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, the chat person says, “OK, you had to call anyway. So you had to make the one-hour queue and then call.”</p>
<p>Olly: Oh definitely. And all the time the customer satisfaction goes down and costs go up. It’s just this whole digital transformation agenda is primarily it should be about, how can we serve the customer best? And I think this addresses it. And then secondly, of course the finance people will want to know, well, how can we do it more cheaply? And the good news to the finance folk is that it can be done more cheaply, and we can make sure that customers are happier and they’re retained for longer and they spend more money with the organisation. So who wouldn’t want that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely. So we’d like to hear now about the security. So how WebAuthN is secure, if you compare to other standards?</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah. OK. So let’s break that down. First of all, let’s break the security model down into simple terms. And really there are three factors that can be applied, there’s a possession factor, so something you have, there is a biometric, which is something you are, and then there’s knowledge, which is something you know. Now, if you compare WebAuthN to other standards, then let’s look at passwords, for example, passwords is a single factor, knowledge-based check. If I know it, I could pretend to be you, and I can clean out your account.</p>
<p>Now, on top of that, you might apply another standard to improve security, which we discussed earlier, which is OK, well, I’m now going to add on top of my knowledge-based factor, I’m going to add an SMS. SMS is often characterised as being a possession factor. And to a degree, you could argue it is because you need to be in possession of that SIM card, but then the message can be diverted or it can be phished in some way. And so really, SMS quickly becomes another knowledge factor. If I have that code, I can pretend to be you. And there are a number of ways in which that code could be diverted or moved to another party. So, if you look at the two-factor authentication using passwords and SMS, then if I know your password, and I can get your code, then I can pretend to be you and I’ve broken through that security model.</p>
<p>And what we see within customer services is even worse is knowledge-based authentication. So knowledge-based authentication is that experience of secret questions, Oscar, before I can change your address, could you tell me what month you were born? Again, anybody that has got the time and desire to want to break into your account, it’s not difficult information to obtain. And therefore, it is another knowledge factor that I can collect, and again, pretend to be you, OK? And there’s real challenges in customer services with knowledge-based authentication, not just because it’s weak, but it also takes about 34 seconds for every single call to go through, which is more money and more cost associated with trying to identify the customer.</p>
<p>So WebAuthN, factors WebAuthN uses, number one is possession. But it is not possession of a SIM card, it is possession of the physical hardware of your smartphone device. And therefore, if I change the SIM, or if I divert the message, the transaction will not be authenticated. Why? Because you physically have to have this piece of metal in your hand, using cryptography, it is strongly establishing the device and that cannot be transferred to anyone else. OK? So that’s the first thing.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is using the biometric on your device. So WebAuthN does not create a new biometric. It is using the biometric that you have set up to unlock your device probably about 100 times a day on the average person. The important thing about that is that that biometric is very secure, because it is not transferred over the internet, it is only ever retained on the device. And it is secondly, it’s something that you’re very familiar with using. So from a customer experience point of view, if I ask someone to unlock their device, then they know how to do it, because they’re very practiced at it, they do it every day, hundreds of times.</p>
<p>So the WebAuthN standard uses number one, very, very strong, immutable possession of the device that is much better than other standards, such as SMS. And then secondly, it layers on top of that, to get at that possession factor the biometric from the device. Really, it is a very, very strong standard compared to other alternatives. It’s not infallible. One of the key things that we always state is that if you’re using WebAuthN, then you should make sure that the customer is not sharing their device. So these days, if you use Touch ID within a banking app, they will put a disclaimer in there to say “If you share your device, please do not use Touch ID or face ID to authenticate transactions. You’re guarding against other people in your household using their fingerprint or their face ID to unlock your device and approve transactions.” So that’s one thing that you need to think about.</p>
<p>But then when you compare that wrinkle to the other wrinkles within the other alternatives, that is a very, very strong standard. And if you need to layer on top other additional security steps for high-risk transactions, then you can do that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Two strong factors you mentioned. First, the possession but a strong possession. Here, I would like to ask you something. So, it has to be the device and exactly the device that is registered. But if you change the SIM card that’s not valid, or you can change the SIM card?</p>
<p>Olly: You can change the SIM card.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Olly: It doesn’t matter. It is the physical piece of metal by itself. So there is a part of your device called the Secure Enclave, which is where cryptographic elements are stored, and the key is stored within that enclave, and that is resolved when the customer unlocks their device with biometrics to then establish possession of the device. Is this the device that was registered to Olly’s account?</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, thank you for clarifying that. And also the biometrics that can be used depend on the device, correct? Some devices have the fingerprint. So what are the options, fingerprint, face recognition?</p>
<p>Olly: It’s really whatever is available on the device. But I mean, these days, I’m an Android user but iOS devices are all face ID now I think. My device is older Android Moto device that uses touch ID, I think there is a face ID option as well. But it can use either – whatever is available on the phone device.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, I would like to also hear about how easy it is to use, as far as you have described seems to be from the end user perspective, pretty simple. But also, I’d like to know how is for the more technical who would need to deploy this or considering to deploy this? So what would you say – how easy is it to use and deploy?</p>
<p>Olly: You’re right, at a customer level. I mean, I think the way to think about this is the customer doesn’t need to understand how the technology works. The customer is simply prompted and asked, do they wish to enable biometrics to authenticate to the brand whether that’s Vodafone, Lloyds Bank, Klarna, whoever it might be, OK, you’re just asked, “Do you want to unlock your phone to authenticate this transaction?” So it’s very easy, and the customer uses it hundreds of times a day already.</p>
<p>Where the complexity exists is in the orchestration, really, because remember at the front end, it’s a standards-based technology. So it’s not our technology that’s running the frontend, it is Apple’s or Google’s technology. At the backend, there is a little bit more complexity in orchestrating the authentication. And that’s where the benefit of vendors like Trusona come in, because they have plenty of experience of deploying these types of solutions time and time again.</p>
<p>So what we need to do is, for example, first of all, make sure that you’ve got an appropriate enrolment journey so that you’ve established trust with that customer. And then once that’s done, our backend will communicate typically with the brand’s CRM or identity and access management platform to then send and receive messages when authentication events are presented or required.</p>
<p>The other thing to think about is that because you are dealing with multiple OSs, then there are different ways and different devices and different operating systems need to step through that authentication process. And indeed, some of the devices we talked about earlier will not yet be compliant so you need to be able to provide a soft landing for those rather than just say, “No, you can’t log in.” Being able to offer a migration path for those older devices to make sure that you’re offering the right authentication options so if they can’t use WebAuthN then maybe they need to stick with passwords and usernames until the time that they upgrade to that device. And then you can put the offer in place.</p>
<p>So it’s a combination of orchestration and I think good design and planning, and the detail that sits around that to make this all come together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. For instance, as you mentioned, for some type of devices, the service is not supported, you have the good user interface that tells you what are the other options available. One qualification question for you, Trusona is a piece of software that would be installed in the backend of the service provider, along with the CIAM, you mentioned, it’s not a managed service, correct? It’s software that is installed?</p>
<p>Olly: It’s software-as-a-service, we run all of our services on Amazon Web Services in different clouds for different regions. And we provide, all of the technology is served up through that cloud service. So there’s no need for the customer to establish their own cloud, or there’s no software that needs to be deployed locally by the brand.</p>
<p>So one of the questions that pops up when we explain that is, well, what about the personally identifiable information that you hold in your cloud? What about considerations around security and so forth? Well, the answer to that is we do not hold any personally identifiable information. Our service communicates with the identity and access management platform that will hold all of the biographic personally identifiable information. What we are using is, we hold in our cloud public keys that relate to the private key that sits on the device that is resolved. And we then use that as an identifier and we pass that between the two systems. So never at any point do we hold personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Of course, the biometric that’s being used to unlock the devices in the OS, we’d never see that, we just get a result code from the OS to say, whether that has been passed or failed. OK? So our cloud really, if anybody wanted to hack into it, and spent the time they’d be really disappointed by what they got. Because there would just be a bunch of public keys that are proprietary to our own system and are completely useless to any third party.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, great clarification about that. It’s a software-as-a-service, but you don’t hold any or store any personal data of the users.</p>
<p>Olly: Yeah, I think when people start thinking about identity and authentication, immediately, they think, “Oh, there’s going to be a data store somewhere of valuable data and that’s a risk to the business.” And I think that’s one of the things that FIDO and WebAuthN have really thought through in the backend. And vendors like ourselves, Trusona, have thought through in terms of the orchestration, how we pull that together. And that’s probably another real call out to FIDO and WebAuthN is – the security model and in that respect is very, very strong. They’re not creating another honeypot of information that can be hacked by the criminals.</p>
<p>Oscar: And you don’t need to be an expert to deploy WebAuthN on the backend side.</p>
<p>Olly: Yes. I mean, I think it’s the same as, do you need to be an expert to build an identity and access management platform? Well, yes, of course. And do you need to be an expert to build a WebAuthN based passwordless authentication service? And the answer is, of course, we built one. So anybody could do but it’s taken us five years to get it as good as it is today. And that’s a lot of results, a lot of time getting it right. So yeah, you do need to be an expert to do this well, and I think that’s where traditionally vendors in this marketplace, add value on that with Trusona, then we can really help with the leader in that space.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. I will have a final question for you. Olly, thanks a lot for bringing light about WebAuthN, it’s very, very interesting, very enlightening what we’re hearing. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Olly: So I would say we’re probably going to have different types of people listening to this podcast, but many will be identity experts, and potentially their costs sit within a cost centre somewhere within the business. That’s the reality. My one piece of advice would be understand the true costs of your authentication services. Because rather than being a cost centre, you can actually deliver strong return on investment back on improving authentication back to the marketing team, the customer services team, and to your finance director. And I can tell you finance people love it when money can be saved.</p>
<p>And so have a look at those hard costs. So for example, we talked about customer services, most of the organisation, large customer service operations that I talk to are- all of them are seeking to drive down the cost of service, but they don’t want to do it at the expense of customer satisfaction. And as we talked about earlier, one of the big obstacles to completing self-service is the authentication processes.</p>
<p>For example, something like on average about 11% of calls come into contact centres, because people can’t get what they want online. So if you could help them to get what they want, by removing these barriers, like SMS, OTP, and passwords and presenting something that’s much easier to them, then suddenly, you can start to drive down the call flow into the customer service team.</p>
<p>Secondly, have a look to see their existing process. If they’re using knowledge-based authentication, they’re probably spending upwards of a minute trying to identify the customer. And if you provided a service that enabled them to do it with just a touch of the smartphone, then that would save 40 seconds on every single call. So customer service is one area.</p>
<p>And the other area that we’ve talked about is SMS, go and ask, how much are we paying for these messages? What’s the total cost of that? And what would happen if we could take out 50% of that, and make the customer happier in the process? And then go and tell the salespeople that they will get more sales because customers will be enabled more easily to be able to complete and get what they want.</p>
<p>And so that’s where I would start is just do a cost analysis. But think beyond the fraud and identity team and go and ask customer services about the cost of knowledge-based authentication, customer services about how many calls come in that are diverted because people can’t log in. Go and get that. And then go and ask the finance director, how much do you pay every year on SMS? And are you interested in having a discussion as to how we could reduce that by 50%? I think they’d really like it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Again, thanks a lot, Olly for all this. Please let us know how people can get in touch with you or follow the conversation with you.</p>
<p>Olly: Well, first of all, my email address is OB@trusona.com. If anybody wants to give me a call, I’m always happy to chat as well, that’s +44 7823 538 872. But as a good starting point is maybe pop on to our website <a href="https://www.trusona.com/">trusona.com</a> or if you’d like you can look me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olly-brough-5821a38/">LinkedIn</a> and send me a LinkedIn message. It’s Olly, O-L-LY Brough, B-R-O-U-G-H. If you search that Trusona, I’ll pop up and drop me a message and we’d love to talk.</p>

 Read about the key information on the Shyft DAO’s mission, structure, how to submit and vote for proposals, and more as Shyft kicks off this next era of its community! <p>2022 is already off to an exciting and productive start for the Shyft Network platform, team, and community. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-network-end-of-year-recap">Last year</a>, Shyft Network launched on mainnet and introduced key partnerships and products like Veriscope to the ecosystem. One of the first priorities for 2022 is the rollout of something critical to the future of the Shyft Network community and our goal towards total decentralization: the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>So why a DAO, and why now? From historical failures around data, privacy, and identity in Web2 and traditional finance to a rise in security and identity concerns in blockchain, there has never been a more critical time for Shyft Network to exist. The time for the community to take control is now; to expand Shyft Network’s ecosystem, create new trusted data solutions, like a sovereign identity system, and further empower each other to expand what Shyft Network can&nbsp;do.</p><p>It’s time to move closer to the goal of total decentralization and help launch the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Shyft Network is proud to share that after many months of planning and hard work, below is what lies ahead towards forming the DAO and some of the essential information you should know as the process kicks&nbsp;off.</p><p>The first <a href="https://forum.shyft.network/d/15-sip-1-shyft-dao-existence-proposal">proposal</a>, a yes or no vote on the instantiation of the DAO, is now live on the <a href="https://forum.shyft.network/">Shyft Network forum</a> and will move to Snapshot after five comments are posted — if you are a SHFT holder, you will be able to&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Read on to learn more about the Shyft DAO and how to participate. Thanks for being&nbsp;here!</p> What is the Mission of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO? <p>Shyft DAO aims to facilitate perpetual advancement of the Shyft protocol, to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without users’ sacrificing their data privacy or sovereignty.</p><p>The Shyft DAO will enable community governance over Shyft DAO assets by allowing community members to make proposals regarding the operation of the Shyft Network, as well as voting on proposals made by other community members, and participating in the deployment of various network economic systems such as the Shyft staking pool, AMM &amp; Yield Wrap&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>In addition, the Shyft DAO will facilitate community involvement in the implementation of strategic treasury management to facilitate Shyft protocol infrastructure expansion, upgrades, and ecosystem development in conjunction with the curation of strategic grant fundings and community involvement in the distribution of suitable economic benefits to the Shyft community.</p> What is the Structure of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO? <p>Version 1 of the Shyft DAO will consist of the six committees described below.</p><p>At launch, each committee will be populated with members of the decentralized federation of nodes. Their initial focus will be to document and share their mandate as well as build a plan to include new members outside of the Shyft Federation.</p> Treasury &amp; Economics Committee   Oversee treasury management and asset allocation.  Oversee financial analysis and strategies.  Oversee the design of Shyft Network’s economic policies.  Oversee financial audit and reporting.  Oversee treasury management and asset allocation.  Oversee financial analysis and strategies.  Oversee the design of Shyft Network’s economic policies.   Operations Committee   Set the goals, milestones, and channels within each DAO committee.  Create proposals for the formation of additional required committees, such as an R&amp;D committee.   Governance &amp; Oversight Committee   Maintain governance procedures via a Shyft DAO Charter (to be drafted by the Governance &amp; Oversight Committee)  Write and manage proposals (SIPs, DAO proposals, grant proposals, etc.) in close collaboration with the DAO members using the discussion forum.  Review, monitor, report, and provide DAO feedback.   Technology Committee   Strategic furtherance of Shyft Network’s technology.  Curation of technology development proposals.  Design of bug bounty programs.  Instantiation of Shyft Network’s developer community.   Ecosystem Business Development &amp; Partnership Committee   Identify and establish strategic partnerships that further expand Shyft Network’s use&nbsp;cases.  Outreach and liaison with 3rd party developers to encourage their development on Shyft&nbsp;Network.  Gather market intelligence and communicate market insights to the Technology Committee for strategic use case development.   Marketing and Community Committee   Develop various community-oriented initiatives, such as the Shyft Ambassador program.  Design various bounty programs in cooperation with the Technology Committee.  Organize community outreach, including updates; build and write reports, moderate and hold regular discussions.  Organize content, announcements, regular live AMAs, hackathons, blogs, and&nbsp;more.   What Tools Will Be Used in the Operation of the Shyft&nbsp;DAO?  1. Voting via&nbsp;Snapshot   The Shyft DAO will utilize Snapshot as a voting tool via a single voting system architecture. The first proposal the DAO will vote on is for the instantiation of the DAO itself. Voting will take place directly on the Snapshot portal (see below). As will be the case with all proposals, they will require five comments minimum on the forum before then going live on Snapshot for official&nbsp;voting.  <p>Below, see the necessary steps on how to vote for a proposal:</p><p>Step 1: Navigate to Shyft’s<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/shyftdao.eth"> Snapshot&nbsp;portal</a>.</p><p>Step 2: Click “join” on the Shyft DAO&nbsp;space.</p><p>Step 3: Connect with the wallet where you hold&nbsp;$SHFT.</p><p>Step 4: Sign in with the account you want to vote&nbsp;with.</p><p>Step 5: Select the active proposal to vote&nbsp;on.</p><p>Step 6: Browse through the proposal and see what options are available to cast a&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Step 7: Click on your preferred option then review and agree to the&nbsp;terms</p><p>Step 8: Confirm your vote by clicking on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Step 9: Sign the transaction with your account to complete the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Step 10: You have successfully voted!</p> 2. Multi-Sig Enactment (Shyft&nbsp;Safe)   This tool will be used to enact votes on the Shyft DAO. This will be deployed through two key sections:   1. Shyft DAO&nbsp;Treasury   The Shyft DAO Treasury will be managed by the Treasury and Economics Committee and deployed with instantiation of the Shyft DAO. The Treasury and Economics Committee will observe the aforementioned Shyft DAO charter to ensure full transparency regarding its actions. The committee will also be responsible for creating its own mandates aligned with this Shyft DAO&nbsp;charter.   2. Shyft DAO 7 Key&nbsp;Signers   Following voting on the substantiation of the Shyft DAO, the process will move forward with a vote to elect the seven key signers — two from Shyft Core, two from the Shyft Federation, and three from the Shyft Community. The first proposal will focus on the election of the three community key signers. A separate election will occur among the Shyft Federation and Shyft Core to elect the two key signers for those two sections.  The Treasury and Economics Committee will initially be composed of Shyft Community, Federation, and Core members. It will initially deploy via the DAO’s seven key signers, portfolio managers, financial analysts, and strategists. The expectations are that the committees will expand over time to fill its other various organizational roles.   3. Shyft&nbsp;Forum   The Shyft Forum acts as the primary communication platform for Shyft community members to discuss proposals — this is where you can find active proposals (in addition to on Snapshot), a forthcoming knowledge-based section, team support, community development information, and more. To access the Shyft Forum, click&nbsp;<a href="https://forum.shyft.network/">HERE</a>.   What’s Next <p>Following the close of Shyft Network’s <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/celebrate-the-lunar-new-year-win-a-fang-gang-nft-and-shft-603a892e56fd?source=user_profile---------3-------------------------------">latest community campaign</a>, there will be an AMA on Twitter Spaces to discuss feedback community matters and answer questions on the DAO formation and its proposal process. A portion of the AMA will be focused on discussing the proposal for electing the DAO’s seven key signers, primarily focusing on selecting its three community signers. The entire Shyft Core looks forward to sharing its excitement about the DAO, as well as answering any questions you may have on what’s&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>As always, feel free to reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">Discord</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>.</p><p>See you&nbsp;soon,</p><p>— Shyft&nbsp;Network</p>

  Governments world-wide are increasingly worried about the social unrest that could result from a cybersecurity compromise of critical infrastructure. This has highlighted the fact that the underlying operational technology (OT) is often inadequately protected, and that this must change.

Few things compare to ETH Denver. It is impossible to fully capture the experience of the crypto community at a massive gathering like this, but these two choice talks provide a snapshot of the vibes and ethos of the 2022 conference. Kevin Owocki and Erik Voorhees join to synthesize the respective merits of individualism and collectivism, and Andrew Yang stepped up to give an impromptu call to action for the community to rally around productive goals. <p>We are scaling out the crypto vibes, and that was abundantly clear this week. Far larger than any previous ETH Denver, this conference truly felt like a Schelling point for folks changing the world via novel, elegant mechanisms.

<p>Decentralised Identity is changing the world, one bit at a time, and it won’t be long before it becomes a wave that will encompass all of us. This concept is gaining a lot of ground quickly because it enables every entity to own his or her identity and use it just the way one&nbsp;chooses.</p><p>In other words, it is an approach where every individual stores his or her Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and shares it with only those organisations that the individual chooses to. This is a revolutionary concept as it takes away data from centralised databases and authorities and empowers users to own and control their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Since Decentralisation is a relatively new concept, we have many organisations like Affinidi that are working to make this a reality. The umbrella organisation that provides the necessary support and guidelines is called the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF).</p> What is&nbsp;DIF? <p>DIF is an organisation involved in developing a new identity ecosystem. To this end, it strives to create the foundational components that would provide an open and standards-based ecosystem for people and organisations to leverage for app development and interoperability across platforms and&nbsp;devices.</p><p>DIF members play a role in developing the specification and emerging standards for protocols, components, and data formats that would facilitate the adoption of decentralised identities. Along with shaping the standards, these members also create the technical components and protocols to advance the common interests of everyone in the decentralised space.</p> Affinidi’s Role in&nbsp;DIF <p>At <a href="https://affinidi.com/">Affinidi</a>, we value our association with DIF. Our mission is to empower users to own and control their data and in the process, enjoy the highest possible levels of privacy and security.</p><p>Our association with DIF is a natural extension of what we do at Affinidi. To further our mission, we have been creating the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-can-you-do-with-affinidis-sdk-1966f4fef042">building blocks</a> for empowering individuals and organisations to control their verifiable data and through this data, unlock value across platforms and geographies.</p><p>As a member of DIF, we have been playing an important role in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/">educating audiences</a> about the importance of owning their data. We have also been working with other DIF members and the decentralised community at large to understand the existing gaps and expectations and to shape the standards accordingly.</p><p>In particular, Affinidi has been at the forefront in building many components such as the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-affinidis-digital-wallet-1c2a52b4d13f">Affinidi Wallet</a>, Schema Manager, <a href="https://build.affinidi.com/">Consent Manager</a>, and more that have enhanced the adoption of decentralised identity among communities and individuals.</p><p>In continuation of our efforts in this space, we will be participating in the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/difcon-f2f-virtual-3-tickets-162786327287">DifCon F2F Virtual Community Meeting</a> happening on the 24th of February&nbsp;2022.</p><p>If you are curious to know more about Affinidi’s role as a member of DIF and its contributions in this space, join our sessions on Consent Management and Schema Manager.

   For large enterprise companies, boundaries around each team are crucial for maintaining systems that are owned by software engineers. This is accomplished by allowing individual teams to own their systems and expose them via APIs.

  <p>For large enterprise companies, boundaries around each team are crucial for maintaining systems that are owned by software engineers. This is accomplished by allowing individual teams to own their systems and expose them via APIs.</p>

<p>You also need to keep certain types of cross-cutting concerns centralized, like select security controls, logging, and routing. If you don’t, every API across different teams has to implement common controls like rate-limiting, logging, and authentication. This can lead to maintainability and consistency issues.</p>

<p>However, the <a href="https://engineering.salesforce.com/api-federation-growing-scalable-api-landscapes-a0f1f0dad506">API Federation</a> pattern keeps cross-cutting concerns located in one centralized lightweight API gateway. For example, by having a centralized place where rate-limiting is processed, and HTTP headers are returned for your company’s APIs, each API is kept consistent from the perspective of your clients.</p>

<p>The gateway also short-circuits requests that otherwise might use unnecessary resources. Protecting internal APIs and microservices from <a href="https://www.kentik.com/kentipedia/ddos-detection/">DDoS detection</a> can be added in one place, which safeguards backend services.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this article, you’ll learn how to build <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/aspnet/microservices-architecture">.NET microservices</a> that are federated via another .NET API gateway. You’ll see how using an API gateway can protect internal services from the outside world by allowing the gateway to handle authentication using <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta’s</a> authentication services. These are easily integrated into our .NET microservice.</p>

 What Is API federation? 

<p>APIs are foundational to modern software development. They enable distributed systems to communicate with each other in a way that allows different teams to build their own systems autonomously.</p>

<p>Larger organizations need to be able to keep cross-cutting and security concerns at a higher-level abstraction so that individual API teams don’t need to worry about them.</p>

<p>API federation addresses this need by centralizing cross-cutting and security concerns into a gateway. All incoming API traffic can have security controls applied such as <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-mitigation/">DDoS protection</a>, <a href="https://avinetworks.com/glossary/ssl-termination/">SSL termination</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting">rate-limiting</a>, and will proxy those requests to internal services.</p>

<p>In this article, you’ll be using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/federated-identity">federated identity</a> approach. This enables authentication and authorization to be handled by one team or system (i.e., API gateway) so that other internal teams and APIs don’t have to worry about cross-cutting concerns.</p>

<p>Other architectural patterns like <a href="https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/#bff">Backends For Frontends</a> use this same approach of placing API gateways in front of other internal microservices for similar reasons.</p>

 Before you begin 

<p>To proceed through this tutorial, you’ll need the following tools installed:</p>

 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a> 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio 2022 for Windows</a> 
   The latest version of the <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download">.NET SDK</a> (This should be installed by Visual Studio.) 
   <a>Postman Desktop App</a> 
   A free <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer account</a> 
 

 Build .NET microservices 

<p>Let’s start building the foundation of your .NET projects and solutions.</p>

<p>First, navigate to an empty folder where you will start building your .NET solution and projects. Create a folder named <code>/src</code> and navigate to <code>/src</code> in a terminal.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll create two internal microservices and the API gateway. To do this, execute the following commands:</p>

 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o Service1 --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o Service2 --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
   <code>dotnet new webapi -o ServiceGateway --no-https -f net6.0</code> 
 

<p>In order to build and link all the .NET projects together, you’ll need to create a new solution by running <code>dotnet new sln</code>.</p>

<p>To add all the projects to the new solution, run:</p>

 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add Service1/Service1.csproj</code> 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add Service2/Service2.csproj</code> 
   <code>dotnet sln src.sln add ServiceGateway/ServiceGateway.csproj</code> 
 

<p>To get the projects ready for the next steps, remove the <code>Controllers</code> folder and the <code>WeatherController.cs</code> file from all three projects.</p>

 Create a proxy gateway 

<p>The API gateway is a lightweight service that executes cross-cutting concern logic and then forwards the original request to the appropriate internal microservice API.</p>

<p>In your IDE, create a new file C# class named <code>ProxyExtensions</code> in the root of the  <code>ServiceGateway</code> project. This file will have a couple of extension methods to perform the logic needed to proxy HTTP requests to other microservices. Extension methods in C# are a great way to create reusable methods that are tucked away in their own file.</p>

<p>Replace its contents with the following:</p>

   <code>namespace ServiceGateway
{
  public static class ProxyExtensions
  {
    private static readonly int StreamCopyBufferSize = 81920;

    public static HttpRequestMessage CreateProxyHttpRequest(this HttpContext context, Uri uri)
    {
      var request = context.Request;

      var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage();
      var requestMethod = request.Method;
      if (!HttpMethods.IsGet(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsHead(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsDelete(requestMethod) &amp;&amp;
          !HttpMethods.IsTrace(requestMethod))
      {
        var streamContent = new StreamContent(request.Body);
        requestMessage.Content = streamContent;
      }

      // Copy the request headers
      foreach (var header in request.Headers)
      {
        if (!requestMessage.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(header.Key, header.Value.ToArray()) &amp;&amp; requestMessage.Content != null)
        {
          requestMessage.Content?.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(header.Key, header.Value.ToArray());
        }
      }

      requestMessage.Headers.Host = uri.Authority;
      requestMessage.RequestUri = uri;
      requestMessage.Method = new HttpMethod(request.Method);

      return requestMessage;
    }

    public static async Task CopyProxyHttpResponse(this HttpContext context, HttpResponseMessage responseMessage)
    {
      if (responseMessage == null)
      {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(responseMessage));
      }

      var response = context.Response;

      response.StatusCode = (int)responseMessage.StatusCode;
      foreach (var header in responseMessage.Headers)
      {
        response.Headers[header.Key] = header.Value.ToArray();
      }

      foreach (var header in responseMessage.Content.Headers)
      {
        response.Headers[header.Key] = header.Value.ToArray();
      }

      // SendAsync removes chunking from the response. This removes the header, so it doesn't expect a chunked response.
      response.Headers.Remove("transfer-encoding");

      using var responseStream = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync();
      await responseStream.CopyToAsync(response.Body, StreamCopyBufferSize, context.RequestAborted);
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>These two methods allow your gateway to forward/proxy requests and responses to the original client transparently. This code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/AspLabs/blob/main/src/Proxy/src/ProxyAdvancedExtensions.cs">AspLabs GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: a hand-built .NET-base API gateway could be beneficial when you need full control of how your gateway behaves (i.e.,  if you’re building a really complex internal API gateway), don’t want dependencies on third-party services, or as a proof-of-concept. In production scenarios, you may want to use a product like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/?cdn=disable#overview">Azure API Management</a> or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">Amazon API Gateway</a> instead of a hand-built .NET application API gateway. These tools come with common cross-cutting tooling like routing, rate-limiting, static content caching, HTTP caching, SSL termination, etc., so you don’t have to code them by hand. Often, you can leverage infrastructure-as-code tools like <a href="https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code">Terraform</a> to keep your API gateway easy to maintain and scalable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, replace the <code>ServiceGateway/Program.cs</code> file with the following (you’ll add more to this file later.):</p>

   <code>using ServiceGateway;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

// Expose the gateway via port "4300"
app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4300");

app.UseRouting();

// We're routing clients to internal microservices, which many times
// will have different public and internal URLs. Gateways can help to
// keep routing centralized as a cross-cutting and customer-focused concern.
app.MapGet("/warehouse", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri("http://localhost:4301/inventory"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.MapGet("/sales/sku/{sku:required}", async context =&gt;
{
    var sku = context.Request.RouteValues["sku"];
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();
    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"http://localhost:4302/sku/{sku}"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Your gateway service will now accept two routes, and proxy the requests to the appropriate internal microservice.</p>

<p>You’ll also need to configure these two services. Replace <code>Service1/Program.cs</code> with the following:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4301");

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/inventory", () =&gt; "Total inventory is 721 items");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Then, replace <code>Service2/Program.cs</code> with:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4302");

app.UseRouting();

app.MapGet("/sku/{sku:required}", (string sku) =&gt; $"You're looking at SKU {sku}!");

app.Run();
</code>   

<p>Both of these files make the services listen to traffic on a custom port so that all three microservices can run on your machine at the same time. These services return static content so that you can focus on the orchestration of the gateway and microservices.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to try to run it. Open up three separate terminals (any terminal should work). Navigate to the root directory for each of the .NET projects you created and execute <code>dotnet run</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To test the API gateway, run the following request in Postman:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see some HTTP headers and the HTTP body “You’re looking at SKU 1234!”</p>

<p>Here’s what the current topology looks like:</p>

<p></p>

 Add Okta auth to your API gateway 

<p>In the next steps, you’ll add authentication to your API gateway. By placing authentication in the gateway, any internal microservices or APIs can trust that requests coming from the gateway have already been authenticated.</p>

<p>Here, you’ll be using the API gateway to proxy requests for API access tokens to Okta behind the scenes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In these next steps, you’ll be utilizing your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta account</a>.</p>

<p>Once signed into <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta</a>, you’ll be at the home page/dashboard. Navigate to Applications on the left-hand menu, and click the Create App Integration button. Choose API Services, and create a name for your app.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Take note of your Okta domain, <code>client_id</code>, and <code>client_secret</code> for later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll need to create a dummy security scope for your API integration. On the left-hand menu again, click on Security &gt; API. In the list of authorization servers, click the Edit button for the default server. Then, click on the Scopes tab and the Add Scope button. Make sure the Default Scope checkbox is selected, and choose any name for your scope.</p>

<p>Copy the Okta domain that’s displayed and add it to your <code>ServiceGateway/appsettings.json</code> file:</p>

   <code>  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "https://dev-1234.okta.com"
  }
</code>   

<p>Next, navigate to the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project folder in a terminal and run <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore</code>. This will install the Okta .NET library that will help your gateway to authenticate incoming requests.</p>

<p>Finally, copy the following code and replace <code>ServiceGateway/Program.cs</code> with it:</p>

   <code>using Okta.AspNetCore;
using ServiceGateway;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

// Configure authentication middleware
AddAuthMiddleware(builder);

var app = builder.Build();

app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:4300");

// Federated Logging
app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Request for \"{context.Request.Path}\"");
    await next();
});

// Federated Rate-Limiting
app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;
{
    context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Rate-Limit-Limit", "infinite");
    await next();
});

app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

// Using Okta to generate tokens by forwarding the request.
// To your clients, if you strip out Okta specific response headers,
// they would have no idea that Okta is being used as the identity
// provider!
app.MapPost("/token", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"{builder.Configuration["Okta:Domain"]}/oauth2/default/v1/token"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});


app.MapGet("/warehouse", async context =&gt;
{
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();

    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri("http://localhost:4301/inventory"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
});

app.MapGet("/sales/sku/{sku:required}", async context =&gt;
{
    var sku = context.Request.RouteValues["sku"];
    var client = app.Services.GetService&lt;IHttpClientFactory&gt;().CreateClient();
    var message = context.CreateProxyHttpRequest(new Uri($"http://localhost:4302/sku/{sku}"));
    var response = await client.SendAsync(message);
    await context.CopyProxyHttpResponse(response);
}).RequireAuthorization();

app.Run();

void AddAuthMiddleware(WebApplicationBuilder builder)
{
    // This method is all it takes to use Okta to automatically test incoming
    // bearer tokens for authentication!
    builder.Services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultSignInScheme = OktaDefaults.ApiAuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddOktaWebApi(new OktaWebApiOptions()
    {
        OktaDomain = builder.Configuration["Okta:Domain"],
    });
    
    builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
}
</code>   

<p>Again, open up three separate terminals and navigate to the root directory for each of the .NET projects you created. Run all three services by executing <code>dotnet run</code> in each terminal.</p>

<p>You’ll have to provide a bearer token to the gateway service in order to access <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code> but <code>/warehouse</code> will not require any authentication.</p>

<p>To get an access token to access <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code>, you’ll need to execute the following request in Postman by using your own <code>client_id</code> and <code>client_secret</code> values:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should have a response with the <code>access_token</code> displayed. Copy the token and then issue the following request using Postman to replace the bearer token with your access token:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If implemented correctly, you should see a successful response!</p>

 Use Docker to run the solution 

<p>In Visual Studio, right-click each project and click on Add &gt; Docker Support. Then, choose Linux as the target OS. This will add a <code>Dockerfile</code> to each project that will be configured to build and run the .NET application with sensible defaults.</p>

<p>Right-click the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project and choose Add &gt; Container orchestration support. Choose Docker Compose and then Linux as the target OS. This step will add a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Replace the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file with the following:</p>

   <code>version: '3.4'

services:
  servicegateway:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}servicegateway
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ServiceGateway/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4300:80"
  service1:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}service1
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Service1/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4301:80"
  service2:
    image: ${DOCKER_REGISTRY-}service2
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Service2/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "4302:80"
</code>   

<p>This will configure each project to become exposed at the ports you used earlier, except now Docker is responsible for exposing the proper ports.</p>

<p>In the <code>Program.cs</code> file for the three .NET projects you created, remove the <code>Urls</code> code that looks like:</p>

   <code>app.Urls.Clear();
app.Urls.Add("http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;");
</code>   

<p>In the <code>ServiceGateway</code> project’s <code>Program.cs</code> file, replace the two URLs for the internal microservice routes with <code>http://host.docker.internal:&lt;port&gt;</code> instead of <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>For example, the code for the external <code>/warehouse</code> route will now become the internal URL of <code>http://host.docker.internal:4301/inventory</code>.</p>

<p>At the top of Visual Studio 2022, there will be a new launch profile available called “Docker Compose.”</p>

<p>Use the same Postman request as earlier to fetch your token:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, using that token, you can make requests to the <code>/sales/sku/&lt;sku&gt;</code> path:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now you can run all your microservices and the API gateway and test them.</p>

 What you learned about API federation in .NET 

<p>In this tutorial, you built the skeleton of the API gateway and two .NET microservices, which were all exposed on specific ports.</p>

<p>You also learned how to use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/clientcreds/main/">Okta’s Client Credentials API token endpoint</a> to retrieve a server-to-server access token by using your API gateway as a proxy. With Okta’s <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-aspnet">Okta.AspNetCore</a> library, you then enabled your API gateway to process and validate incoming access tokens.</p>

<p>In the end, you had the entire suite of services running in one click by using Docker Compose.</p>

<p>You can check out the completed project at <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-dotnet-microservices">this Github repository</a>.</p>

<p>Il 2022 è un anno cruciale per l’avanzamento del PNRR, in cui la “messa a terra” degli indirizzi di policy diventa il tema principale. </p>



<p>Di fronte a questa sfida sarà fondamentale concentrare gli sforzi organizzativi e operativi di tutti, facendo leva su alcuni fondamentali punti di snodo del Piano: il rapporto con il mondo economico; il rapporto della PA centrale con gli enti locali; il rapporto con l’Europa.</p>



 Mercoledì 23 febbraio dalle ore 11:00 alle ore 13:00, evento in live streaming. 







 



<p>Il prossimo 23 febbraio, Danilo Cattaneo – Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert – interverrà al webinar organizzato dal CED – Centro Economia Digitale, prendendo parte alla tavola rotonda dal titolo “Next Generation Italia – EXECUTION”. L’evento si svolgerà presso la Luiss Business School e verrà trasmesso in streaming.</p>



<p>L’obiettivo dell’evento è analizzare le sfide che dovrà affrontare il Paese per concretizzare delle proposte operative utili all’implementazione del Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza approvato dal governo, il quale metterà a disposizione di Imprese e Pubblica Amministrazione i fondi necessari per effettuare una svolta fondamentale su temi quali: Transizione Digitale, Transizione Ecologica e Mezzogiorno.</p>



<p>L’apertura dei lavori è affidata al Chairman dell’evento: Rosario Cerra – Fondatore e Presidente del Centro Economia Digitale, dopo il quale prenderanno la parola:</p>



  Adelaide Mozzi – Team Leader Affari Economici, Commissione Europea, Rappr. in Italia;  Paolo Boccardelli – Comitato Scientifico CED, Direttore Luiss Business School;  Francesco Crespi – Direttore Ricerche CED, Professore Economia Università Roma Tre.

<blockquote><p>“L’approvazione del PNRR sancisce non solo la disponibilità di ingenti risorse finanziare per il rilancio dell’economia, ma, soprattutto, un’occasione storica per realizzare un cambiamento strutturale fondato sulla capacità trasformativa dell’innovazione e della diffusione delle tecnologie digitali. Queste possono in particolare svolgere un ruolo cruciale per facilitare il passaggio da un modello produttivo basato sulla competitività di costo a uno basato sulla competitività tecnologica, che fa leva su investimenti continui in nuove tecnologie, attività di ricerca e innovazione. È questo secondo modello che deve diventare prevalente in Italia, poiché è quello in grado di fornire una spinta più forte e duratura alla dinamica della produttività e della crescita.”</p>Rosario Cerra – Fondatore e Presidente del Centro Economia Digitale</blockquote>
