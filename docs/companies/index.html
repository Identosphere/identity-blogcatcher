 Introduction <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a> is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ocean-lib/">Python library</a> to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume data, using <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-1-introduction-installation-530295c3d3b4">Part 1</a> of this series introduced ocean.py, and described how to install it. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-2-set-up-locally-e232dc8d8182">Part 2</a> described how to set up for local testing, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-3-set-up-remotely-a3cfec47a3fa">part 3</a> for&nbsp;remote.</p><p>This post is a fun one! We pick up where part 2 &amp; 3 left off, and walk you through the main&nbsp;flow:</p><p>In this post, you’ll publish a data asset, post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and consume it. We’ll closely follow ocean.py’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md">main-flow.md</a>.</p> Background: Ocean&nbsp;Basics <p>This post assumes a basic understanding of Ocean data NFTs and datatokens. If you don’t yet know about these, we recommend learning about those first, by text or&nbsp;video.</p>  To learn by text: start with the simple description at <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/data-nfts-and-data-tokens">oceanprotocol.com main site</a>. If you want to dive deeper yet, then check out Ocean docs on <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/architecture">architecture</a> and <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/datanft-and-datatoken">Data NFTs &amp; datatokens</a>.  Or, check out the video version&nbsp;👇.   Main Flow:&nbsp;Video <p>Here’s a video version this post 👇. Or, jump straight into the text content&nbsp;below.</p> Main Flow:&nbsp;Text <p>Steps in the&nbsp;flow:</p>  Alice publishes dataset  Bob gets access to the dataset (faucet, priced,&nbsp;etc)  Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset  <p>Let’s go!</p><p>(Note: this blog post is up-to-date as of Apr 2023, but if 2+ months have passed, we recommend using the READMEs directly for up-to-date instructions. )</p> 1. Alice publishes dataset <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4pp3qyq5tc&amp;ab_channel=Smokie-Topic">Alice! Alice! Who the f*** is&nbsp;Alice?</a></p><p>Well, for the steps below, you are Alice!&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/girl/">👧</a></p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> #data info<br>name = "Branin dataset"<br>url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trentmc/branin/main/branin.arff"<br><br>#create data asset<br>(data_nft, datatoken, ddo) = ocean.assets.create_url_asset(name, url, {"from": alice})<br><br>#print<br>print("Just published asset:")<br>print(f"  data_nft: symbol={data_nft.symbol}, address={data_nft.address}")<br>print(f"  datatoken: symbol={datatoken.symbol}, address={datatoken.address}")<br>print(f"  did={ddo.did}") <p>You’ve now published an Ocean&nbsp;asset!</p>  data_nft is the base (base&nbsp;IP)  datatoken for access by others (licensing)  ddo holding&nbsp;metadata  <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-publish-details">Appendix: Publish Details</a>.)</p> 2. Bob gets access to the&nbsp;dataset <p>If you’ve ever spent time in the world of crypto, or cryptography:</p><blockquote>Wherever there’s a Bob, there’s always an&nbsp;Alice</blockquote><p>OK, OK. So yes, there’s a Bob. He wants to consume the dataset that Alice just published. The first step is for Bob to get 1.0 datatokens.</p><p>Below, we show four possible approaches:</p>  A &amp; B are when Alice is in contact with Bob. She can mint directly to him, or mint to herself and transfer to&nbsp;him.  C is when Alice wants to share access for free, to&nbsp;anyone  D is when Alice wants to sell&nbsp;access  <p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> from ocean_lib.ocean.util import to_wei<br><br>#Approach A: Alice mints datatokens to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach B: Alice mints for herself, and transfers to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.transfer(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach C: Alice posts for free, via a dispenser / faucet; Bob requests &amp; gets<br>datatoken.create_dispenser({"from": alice})<br>datatoken.dispense(to_wei(1), {"from": bob})<br><br>#Approach D: Alice posts for sale; Bob buys<br># D.1 Alice creates exchange<br>price = to_wei(100)<br>exchange = datatoken.create_exchange({"from": alice}, price, ocean.OCEAN_address)<br><br># D.2 Alice makes 100 datatokens available on the exchange<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.approve(exchange.address, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br><br># D.3 Bob lets exchange pull the OCEAN needed<br>OCEAN_needed = exchange.BT_needed(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0)<br>ocean.OCEAN_token.approve(exchange.address, OCEAN_needed, {"from":bob})<br><br># D.4 Bob buys datatoken<br>exchange.buy_DT(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0, tx_dict={"from": bob}) <p>You may not realize it, but you just covered a crazy amount of ground!! You just went through four different ways to share data! Minting, transferring, faucets, and&nbsp;selling!</p><p>What made this possible is that the access control to the data is tokenized, via datatokens. Then you were basically using the tools of crypto to move those datatokens around.</p><p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-faucet-details">Appendix: Dispenser / Faucet Details</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-exchange-details">Exchange Details</a>.)</p> 3. Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset <p>Bob now has the datatoken for the dataset! Time to download the dataset and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> # Bob sends a datatoken to the service to get access<br>order_tx_id = ocean.assets.pay_for_access_service(ddo, {"from": bob})<br><br># Bob downloads the file. If the connection breaks, Bob can try again<br>asset_dir = ocean.assets.download_asset(ddo, bob, './', order_tx_id)<br>import os<br>file_name = os.path.join(asset_dir, "file0") <p>Let’s check that the file is downloaded. In a new&nbsp;console:</p> cd my_project/datafile.did:op:*<br>cat file0 <p>The beginning of the file should contain the following contents:</p> % 1. Title: Branin Function<br>% 3. Number of instances: 225<br>% 6. Number of attributes: 2<br>@relation branin<br>@attribute 'x0' numeric<br>@attribute 'x1' numeric<br>@attribute 'y' numeric<br>@data<br>-5.0000,0.0000,308.1291<br>-3.9286,0.0000,206.1783<br>... <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-consume-details">Appendix: Consume Details</a>.)</p> Conclusion / Next&nbsp;Step <p>You’ve now done a walk-through of the main flow, congrats! As Alice, you published a data asset, posted for free / for sale, and had that Bob guy dispense it / buy it and consume&nbsp;it.</p><p>Have questions? <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/720631837122363412">Here’s</a> the Ocean Protocol #dev-support channel on Discord.

<p>Identity, for the most part, is not natively digital. We have digital artifacts that refer to real-world physical credentials, like driver's licenses and passports. Identity, however, is at the core of most of our interactions in daily life, both physically and digitally, with ever-increasing dependency on digital interactions. </p><p>However, since the internet was built without an identity layer natively baked in, significant coordination and collaboration efforts are required to ensure what is built and adopted can serve use cases across the internet, spanning various industries across the public and private sectors.</p><p>Spruce participates in various working groups of global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. We have also implemented and architected multiple global emerging identity standards, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials, Sign-In with Ethereum, and more.</p><p>Here are non-exhaustive highlights from our participation in the first quarter of 2023:</p> Global Working Groups: <p>W3C Working Groups: We continued participating as co-editor in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group to work on the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) v2.0 standard</a> where we are also leading the holder binding discussion that will contribute to more secure digital credentials for pure online use cases and interactions with digital identity documents. Additionally, we are actively contributing to the definition of the formal semantics for the new RDF 1.2 quoted triples in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/08/rdf-star-wg-charter/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">W3C RDF-star Working Group</a>.</p><p>ISO Working Groups: We continued our participation in <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Cards and security devices for personal identification</a> in WG4 and WG10 as delegated experts to work on ISO 18013-7, a specification to securely exchange mobile Driver’s License (mDL) online, and on ISO 23220 which is a series of specifications for building blocks for mobile identity documents (mdoc).</p><p>OpenID Foundation Working Groups: We continued our participation in the OpenID Foundation AB/C Working Group as co-editor and contributors. We helped to publish the second implementer’s draft of <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)</a> and contributed to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Credential Issuance (OpenID4CI)</a> to get it closer to the first implementer’s draft.</p><p>Additional Working Groups: We joined the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Open Wallet Foundation (OWF)</a>, a project of the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member and are working to stand up its first Technical Advisory Committee with some of the world’s largest digital identity technology and solutions providers. You can learn more about the OWF here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">  Spruce Joins the OpenWallet Foundation  We’re pleased to announce that Spruce has joined the Open Wallet Foundation, a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member.  SpruceSpruce    </a> Ethereum Standards: <p>At the end of 2022, Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE), or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-4361</a>, moved from “Draft” to “Review” and we are currently incorporating feedback from the community to improve the specification. We are actively working on advancing the specification to the next stage.</p><p>After we authored and published a draft for Sign-In with Ethereum Capabilities, or ReCaps (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-5573</a>), we received significant interest from the Ethereum Magicians and Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA) communities. As one of the outcomes, we updated the specification to align it more closely with the User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) Specification for interoperability and composability reasons.</p> Authorship and Events: <p>In February, we finalized and published our <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/final-documents/identifier-binding.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) whitepaper</a> on holder binding from RWOT XI: The Hauge, which is co-authored by people from the Federal Printing House of Germany, TNO, Danube Tech, and other leaders in the identity standards community.</p><p>Across the world, there are various digital credential and digital identity guidelines currently being considered for various purposes, like official government-issued documentation, learning and employment records, and more. As contributors to many of the standards paving the way for global adoption, we are thoughtful in reviewing and submitting comments to improve specifications where feedback or formal comments are requested. </p><p>We recently submitted comments for the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/news/2021/national-technical-specification-for-digital-credentials-provide-greater-privacy-and-security-for?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Canadian National Technical Specification for Digital Credentials and Digital Trust Services</a>. We also intend to provide comments for the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">NIST SP 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, which had its latest major revision in 2017 to accelerate the adoption of the work that is happening across the other various working groups, such as ISO and W3C, that we participate in.</p><p>And last, but certainly not least, next week, we will have a live demonstration of interoperability with Microsoft and Ping Identity at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> in Mountain View, California. This quarter, we continued our engagement in the DIF JWT Interoperability Presentation Profile Initiative, and at IIW, we will demonstrate interoperability based on the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials specifications. We look forward to meeting you there!</p><p>We fundamentally believe this work to champion global standards is core to the success of further adoption of digital identity, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving, yet seamless interactions that build digital trust across the web. </p><p>If you're interested in discussing or contributing to any of our work outlined above, please contact our team. </p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p><br>
At Northern Block, our primary goal is to facilitate the orchestration of trust tasks as seamlessly as possible. We aim to make it easier for our partners, customers, and the entire world to engage in digital interactions with trust embedded into the fabric.</p>
<p>The concept of a “trust task” was first introduced to me in the Trust over IP Foundation’s Technical Architecture Specification, but the term was originally coined by Daniel Hardman, who describes it very nicely in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V3v3-g6pAR8oMhk0Az-pheFM7PRCxJO9OsonH7STi5I/edit#slide=id.g2082f750436_0_349">recent presentation of his</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trust tasks differ from applications in important ways: they are multi-party, and they should be composable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really liked how Daniel displayed trust tasks within the ToIP hourglass model, as it really showcases its composable nature. I’ve taken the liberty of adapting his slide in the context of Northern Block to showcase where we are focused within the large spectrum of digital trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll observe that there is a trust task called “ask trust registry.” To support this task, we have been dedicating efforts into developing the necessary supporting systems to ensure its smooth operation.</p>
<p><br>
What is a Trust Registry?<br>
</p>
 
 A trust registry essentially serves as a source of truth and authoritative information. The governance framework behind a trust registry is what makes it authoritative for its trust ecosystem. If there is confidence in the governance framework, it naturally leads to confidence in the authority imposed by the governance body within the trust registry or source of truth. 
 It’s crucial to recognize that a verifiable data registry (such as a blockchain or DLT) doesn’t always provide a source of truth. These registries can serve as storage for information related to a public entity’s decentralized identifiers, DID documents, schemas, credential definitions, and more. Although they offer immutable data storage with resolution and discovery capabilities, they may not always deliver authoritative information. 
 This is where the trust registry comes into play. By providing authoritative information backed by a strong governance framework, trust registries support the attainment of digital trust and ensures that the entities participating in an ecosystem are reliable and credible. If you’d like to learn more about the role of governance, I highly recommend listening to the insightful <a href="https://northernblock.io/governance-and-trust-with-scott-perry/">podcast conversation I had with Scott Perry</a>, a colleague in the digital trust space. Scott chairs the Governance Stack Working Group at the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation, and our discussion delves into this important topic. 
 
<p>​​Within a typical credential acceptance trust task within <a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise</a>, several sub-trust tasks may need to be orchestrated in order for a party to accept a credential offer. These may include peer connections, secure messaging, negotiations, and the consultation of external supporting systems such as trust registries.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>The holder receiving a credential offer may want to invoke other trust tasks to assist them in making the decision to accept the credential offer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Northern Block has been collaborating closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a>, Chief Technology &amp; Security Officer at the <a href="https://www.cira.ca/">Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA)</a>, which manages over three million .ca domains as the .ca top-level domain (TLD) registry. Together, we’ve been exploring how the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure can enable digital trust, particularly in the context of trust registries and their role in maintaining authoritative records for .ca domain owners. We recently co-published an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-latour-dns-and-digital-trust/">IETF Working Draft</a> of our work if you wish to have more information.</p>
<p>When an entity is presented with a verifiable claim, there are three things they will want to ensure:</p>
 
 That a claim hasn’t been altered/falsified at any point in time (cryptographic verifiability, verifiable data registries) ✅ 
 That a claim has accurate representation (DID authentication, accurate representation) 🤨 
 That a claim has authority (authorization, authority) 🤨 
 
<p>While cryptographic verifiability is a fundamental aspect of verifiable credential exchange protocols, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee the accurate representation or authority of a specific public key or decentralized identifier (DID).</p>
<p>To address this human trust issue, we’ve utilized the decentralized DNS infrastructure to create a flexible linkage between issuing bodies’ domain names and their DIDs, which doesn’t impose a specific DID method. By enabling issuers to edit their DID documents with pointers to their DNS records, our approach allows for various DID methods to leverage the DNS infrastructure for added assurance.</p>
<p><br>
Why DNS?</p>
 
 The Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure is considered global, unique, resilient, and highly secure, particularly when the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are utilized. As a global system, DNS operates across the internet, mostly known for ensuring that domain names are translated into IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites and online services. The uniqueness of the DNS lies in the fact that each domain name corresponds to a unique label such as trustregistry.nborbit.io, avoiding any confusion or conflicts. The DNS infrastructure is resilient, as it relies on a distributed hierarchical structure, which minimizes the risk of a single point of failure. Finally, the security of the DNS is significantly enhanced by the implementation of DNSSEC, which provides cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data within the DNS, preventing attacks such as DNS spoofing or cache poisoning. 
 The exclusive write access granted to domain name owners for their DNS records, coupled with the proper implementation of DNSSEC, enhances the records’ authoritative nature, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the information they provide. This write access is cryptographically verifiable through a chain of trust that, in the Canadian context, flows from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA), and then further down to the .ca domain owners. 
 Beyond the cryptographic trust, CIRA has established processes and agreements with domain name registrars to ensure that .ca domain names meet specific criteria, such as having a Canadian presence. The registry operated by CIRA can be considered sources of truth because they are authoritative in the context of .ca domain names and are connected to existing governance mechanisms managed by CIRA (more details on CIRA governance <a href="https://www.cira.ca/about-cira/board-and-governance">here</a>). This governance structure further reinforces the trustworthiness of the registries, making them reliable sources of information for .ca domain names and their associated entities. 
 
<p><br>
We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>A credential issuer can ensure that certain information is synced up with their DNS records.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two things that this implementation facilitates for parties are:</p>
 
 To authenticate the DID against a second source, to achieve greater assurance that the DID owner is indeed the same party that owns the domain. This added layer of trust strengthens the overall reliability and security of the system. 
 To get information related to trust registries that the DID claims to be listed in. This enables the discoverability of trust registries that may have been unknown prior. 
 
<p>Orbit Enterprise users can utilize the Trust Decision Helper to assist with the aforementioned points. In the screenshot below, you can observe how a holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records using the Trust Decision Helper. They are offered with information that can be used as inputs to inform their trust decision.</p> 
<p><br>
With hundreds or thousands of trust registries in existence, it becomes virtually impossible for a central entity to manage their locations and purposes. Furthermore, having a central entity overseeing all global trust registries is not ideal for promoting privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Currently, there are numerous identity systems functioning within specific ecosystems, each serving as a source of truth within their respective contexts. Centralizing the management of these systems is not practical. The challenge lies in discovering the presence of trust registries and understanding their associated governance frameworks. This is where DNS comes in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we trust that an entity is accurately represented by their DID, they should be able to guide us towards sources of truth or trust registries in which they are listed. This decentralized and privacy-preserving approach enables direct interaction with the entity, instead of relying on a central authority. By leveraging the widespread adoption and trust established within the DNS infrastructure, we can discover relevant trust registries and gather inputs to inform our trust decisions.</p>
 <p>The holder was able to validate that the issuer who offered them a credential has authority to offer said credential within a specific trust registry.</p> 
<p><br>
In the final screen which completes the flow, a few key points are evident. Firstly, additional assurance is achieved by validating the match between the DID written in the DNS system and the one presented, enabling cross-verification through two distinct trust systems. Secondly, verification is conducted within a trust registry that the issuer directed the holder to. A third check is performed against the same DID presented in the document, which is also listed in both the DNS records and the specific trust registry. The holder is also given the confidence that, based on this trust registry, the issuer possesses the authority to issue the credential they initially offered.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: we could have presented the holder with the trust registry’s referenced governance framework as well. Something to add in future iterations of the Trust Decision Helper.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these additional inputs, the holder can exit the Trust Decision Helper flow and return to their credential negotiation workflow. They may choose to engage in further trust tasks, such as sending secure messages to the issuing body if they have questions, concerns, or wish to negotiate further. Alternatively, they may be satisfied with the inputs received and feel comfortable making their trust decision and accepting the credential offer.</p>
<p>By incorporating the DNS and trust registry functionality into Orbit Enterprise, we aim to facilitate the scaling of trust registries while enhancing their discovery and usage. The joint presentations between CIRA and Northern Block at IdentityNorth and ICANN have garnered positive feedback, and we continue to actively participate in the Trust Over IP Foundation’s Trust Registry Task Force as well as the Identity Lab of Canada’s Trust Registry Community of Practice. </p>
<p>We will be presenting this work at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> next week, and look forward to engaging in interesting conversations and further advancing what we think to be an important initiative.&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">Leveraging DNS in Digital Trust: Credential Exchanges and Trust Registries</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.<p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">Leveraging DNS in Digital Trust: Credential Exchanges and Trust Registries</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Just recently, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>, a new security offering based on a combination of the GPT-4 language model, the well-known technology provided by OpenAI that also powers ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing, and Microsoft’s own technology, data, knowledge, and security-specific model from their ongoing global threat intelligence.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, the new solution, which is not publicly available yet, is positioned as a “copilot” augmenting the security analysts in SOCs (Security Operations Centers) / CDCs (Cyber Defense Centers) and empowering them.</p>
<p>A use-case specific application of GPT-4</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot resembles ChatGPT to a certain extent, but also vastly differs from it. The users can prompt the solution and receive answers. These answers are not just text, but also contain flowcharts/visuals that detail the anatomy of the incident that is researched. All or selected parts of the analysis can be stored in a pinboard that summarizes an investigation and that can be shared with others.</p>
<p>The solution also comes with predefined promptbooks. Promptbooks are pre-engineered collections of prompts for various use cases such as malware analysis. Thus, the user must not think about the right questions (or prompts) but can rely on preconfigured analytical steps. Microsoft provides promptbooks, but users can add their own ones and share them.</p>
<p>Log analysis, context, and resolutions</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot analyzes log files and uses the data from Microsoft’s global threat intelligence. It helps in identifying affected systems and accounts and reengineering attacks so that the accounts that had been compromised first can be identified. It currently works closely with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender, with other integrations to be added. With the multitude of security tools many organizations have deployed, openness for integration to other vendor’s solutions would be something I’d like to see in the future.</p>
<p>All that is done in a way that still requires some level of security skills, but way less than a manual analysis would require. While being somewhat skilled in security, I wouldn’t claim to be capable of doing threat analysis and investigation myself. However, in the demo I received from Microsoft, there was nothing in any of the responses I did not understand. In other words: The Security Copilot would have turned me into a security analyst, by augmenting me.</p>
<p>The tool can even create a PowerPoint file with the condensed results of an investigation, for instance, for reporting to the management. As mentioned, the solution will become integrated with all major Microsoft security services but remain a separate offering.</p>
<p>Augmenting Intelligence</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot, even while being just announced and, as of now, being integrated with only some of the Microsoft security products, is an impressive showcase for the benefit and business value AI can deliver. It can help in closing the skills gap in security and speeding up security analysis. This is done by using a specific model and a vast amount of global data and applying them to the concrete log information of a customer. The customer data is not shared and is not used for machine learning purposes. However, users can rate the quality of responses.</p>
<p>I must admit that I’m impressed by what I have seen so far: A solution delivering tangible benefits and empowering and augmenting human analysts instead of threatening to replace them. This is exactly what we should expect from emerging AI applications, in cybersecurity and in general.</p>

<p>There’s been some movement in state and federal data privacy laws in the United States. Here are three things to know about the regulatory landscape in 2023:</p>



 1. More states are introducing data privacy laws 



<p>The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">says</a>&nbsp;state-level momentum for comprehensive privacy bills is at an all-time high.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(CPRA) became fully effective on January 1, 2023. This Act is an amendment of the pioneering California Consumer Privacy Act which has been around since 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also on January 1, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a>&nbsp;came into effect, while the<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-190">&nbsp;Colorado Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB00006&amp;which_year=2022">Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act</a>&nbsp;both take effect on July 1 this year.</p>



<p>Utah will join the states leading the way on data privacy when the&nbsp;<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/SB0227.html">Utah Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;takes effect on December 31, 2023.</p>



<p>Follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">tracker</a>&nbsp;for a clear picture of the current state of play:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>We believe one reason for increased state momentum is probably the stalling on a federal data privacy law (see point 3). Some states have no doubt realized that their citizens can’t wait any longer. And that leads us to point 2 …</p>



 2. Protecting privacy through law is a growing priority for Americans 



<p>We’ll let the IAPP’s infographic speak for itself:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>Consumers globally have been growing louder in their demands for data privacy for some time.</p>



<p>In 2020 we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">reported</a>:</p>



 
 High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp; 



 Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp; 



 Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can. 



 Levels of consumer trust for brands is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>.&nbsp; 



 Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data. 



 The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers. 
 



<p>Indeed, privacy is the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue</a>&nbsp;of this decade that we predicted it would be. So it’s good news that …</p>



 3. A federal data privacy law is (finally) looking more likely 



<p>The US is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While hopes for a federal data privacy law in the US have been raised and dashed many times over many years,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/topics/adppa/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>&nbsp;has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two sticking points have been whether bills would pre-empt state law or enable enforcement of a private right of action. Democrats argue for a private right of action that will give consumers legal rights if government fails to enforce the federal law, while Republicans want a federal law to pre-empt state laws to end the patchwork of compliance obligations on business. A counterpoint on the Republicans’ pre-emption position is that some states with strong laws, such as California, may end up with weaker protections if a federal law pre-empts&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">CPRA</a>.</p>



<p>The ADPPA is a compromise position. It’s worth viewing the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf">IAPP’s Federal Data Privacy Tracker</a>&nbsp;to understand the details of ADPPA and each of the other privacy-related bills proposed in Congress to date.</p>

<p>“Please come into my office,” the boss said. “Sit down. I have some bad news…”</p>

<p>Getting fired is rough. So is getting laid off. RiFfed. Downscaled. Downsized…</p>

<p>Giving someone the news is also rough--but not as rough as getting it. The people reading this blog are more likely to be givers of that kind of news than getters. And, in particular, are likely to be responsible for the digital side of the process.</p>

<p>Seems like it should be easy. Your employee is no longer a part of your organization, and whoever is the unexpected admin just needs to go to the admin console and delete their account, which controls their corporate identity and access. You know, Google, GitHub, AWS, Intercom, HubSpot, Figma, Zoom, Slack, Datadog, PagerDuty, Notion, Zendesk, and on, and on.</p>

<p>Now, all you have to do is press one button… I mean, go app by app and press one button… I mean, go app by app, and in each app follow the process you created just for this time… Just as soon as you find out who the heck is the admin for half of those. </p>

<p>Once you figure that out, just go to the app, like Google Workspace, and click one button to delete the account… I mean, press a few buttons to first route all new emails going to that email address to someone else like the manager, and then another button (or two or three) to transfer ownership of the Google Drive files to the poor soul who might be running low on storage. Oh, and don’t forget - if things were bad, you need a few more buttons to keep the emails aside for a while. </p><p>GitHub is easy, too: Remove the user from the organization (which will automatically remove them from all teams and revoke access to private repositories). Update and secure any access tokens, deploy keys or secrets the user had access to, and monitor for unauthorized activities.</p>

<p>Now, as for Slack, Zoom, Notion – What? Ok, okay! It’s a blog, not a book. Sheesh.</p>

<p>By the way, if you gave someone access to email, you should know it may be considered personal information, and the employee can demand proof of deletion in some, well, many cases.</p>

<p>You’re here to save time, not get scared of how all your problems are because you didn’t buy some vendor’s software. We have a business to run! So, bottom line: there are a metric ton of regulations – GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PDPB, SLSA. It might seem too much but at the end of the day, we both care about privacy.</p>

<p>TL;DR? Here’s a 63-second clip of what happened to a CEO who delegated too much: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFf7QuauY60">,A weird administrator of the dungeon</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, back on topic: Sad day. You need to let someone go, and you want the digital process to be as smooth as the human process. Just make sure you log everything in one place, keep it up to date, don’t overshare it as it might be sensitive data, but also don’t be the bottleneck, and adjust it for every SaaS app you use. Here’s a checklist – GOOD LUCK!</p> 
   User Verification and Logging 
   Log the termination type (voluntary or involuntary). 
  
   Account and Token Management 
   Reset the user's password to a randomly generated password. 
   Remove all app-specific account passwords, delete MFA recovery codes, and delete all security keys and OAuth tokens. Generate a new set of MFA recovery codes for the user. 
   Remove all email delegations. 
  
   Email and Directory Settings 
   Remove all forwarding addresses, disable IMAP, disable POP, and hide the user from the directory. 
  
   Group Management 
   Remove the user from all groups they belong to. 
  
   Data Transfer and Retention - If suspend is selected. 
   Transfer Google Drive and Documents ownership to the employee's manager. 
   (Business and higher editions) Use Google Vault to set a retention policy or hold on the user's data (emails, chats, Drive files) for compliance, legal, or other purposes. 
  
   Account Suspension and Organization Management 
   Suspend or Delete the user's account. If the termination type is involuntary, grant email delegation access to the employee's manager and move the user to the 'Involuntary Terminations' OU. If the termination type is voluntary, move the user to the 'Voluntary Terminations' OU. 
  
   Device Management 
   (If using an MDM) Wipe device profiles and remove Google accounts from all mobile devices associated with the user using an MDM solution. 
  
   Third-Party Integrations 
   Deprovision the user in any third party app (Slack, Github, Zoom, etc.) 
  
 <p>If you don’t have all that centralized, documented, (automated?) and up-to-date - you are not alone. Let me tell you a secret: we didn’t have that either… Ok, ok, we’re still working on it! It’s all a spreadsheet now, and it’s probably already outdated (welcome, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yeshid_yeshid-ux-frontend-activity-7051569587129131008-hlvL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">,Harjeet</a>!)

<p>Predict-ETH Round 4 just completed and we’re ready to announce the winners — drumroll, please! First, second, and third places go to Soptq ($2500), Cheloco Barrios ($1500), and Jesus Valle ($1000) respectively. Each of the winning predictions showcases how to monetize data successfully using Ocean Protocol’s open source tools for the blockchain. Congratulations to&nbsp;all!</p><p>Predict-ETH is a recurring data challenge to predict the price of ETH and win prize money, using the ocean.py library. Accurately predicting ETH can be a valuable tool in buying and selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming, or DeFi protocol development. If your predictions are consistently on point, then you can sell them as a data feed on Ocean Market, earning you even more&nbsp;income.</p><p>Of course, predicting ETH is no walk in the park. It’s a complex task that requires skill, knowledge, and a bit of luck. But that’s exactly why Ocean Protocol hosts regular Predict-ETH competitions — to help you sharpen your machine learning skills, learn from others, and potentially make some cash along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>Predict-ETH Round 4&nbsp;Setup</p><p>Predict-ETH Round 4 kicked off on March 7th, 2023. The Round 4 README guided contestants how to make their submissions. <a href="https://desights.ai">Desights</a> was used to host the competition in a decentralized fashion. We held regular workshops with the community for anyone working on the Predict-ETH challenge who wanted facetime with the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The submission deadline was April 5th, 2023, at 23:59 UTC. Competitors had to make predictions for ETH price up to 12 hours into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Predict-ETH Round 4 Evaluation</p><p>We streamlined the evaluation criteria for winning in this&nbsp;round.</p><p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or NMSE). That’s all. There is no subjectivity.</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must have produced the outcomes that the README&nbsp;guides:</p><p>✅ Signed up to Desights platform, and registered for this competition</p><p>✅ Created an Ocean data&nbsp;NFT</p><p>✅ On the data NFT, set a value correctly: correct field label, correct # predictions, prediction values following correct formatting, predictions encrypted with proper encoding on judges’ public&nbsp;key</p><p>✅ Transferred data NFT to Ocean judges before the submission deadline</p><p>✅ Submitted txid of this transfer to the Desights&nbsp;platform</p><p>✅ All on Mumbai network, not another&nbsp;network</p><p>Predict-ETH Round 4&nbsp;Winners</p><p>We’re proud to announce winners for Predict-ETH Round&nbsp;4:</p><p>First place ($2,500) goes to&nbsp;Soptq.</p><p>Second place ($1,500) goes to Cheloco&nbsp;Barrios.</p><p>Third place ($1,000) goes to Jesus&nbsp;Valle.</p><p>Great work, Soptq, Cheloco Barrios, and Jesus&nbsp;Valle!</p><p>Round 3 Statistics: Table of NMSEs, Ranks,&nbsp;etc</p><p>The following table shows the NMSE and NMSE rank by competitor’s data NFT&nbsp;address.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Crypto price prediction can be an interesting and fun task — better yet, it can be monetized immediately!

 DID, GLN, DUNS, BIC, TIN, and LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers are essential tools in the modern business world where B2B value is high and trading across borders and supply chain management is complex. Such organisation identifiers help streamline transactions, communication, trust, and collaboration between different parties by identifying and connecting the parties involved. </p>
<p>This blog post will provide an overview of six common organisation identifiers: Decentralised Identifier (DID), Global Location Number (GLN), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS), Bank Identifier Code (BIC), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). We will also look briefly at their respective real-world use cases.</p>
<p>All these identifiers, except DUNS, are identified in the World Trade Organisation’s <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">Standards Toolkit for Cross-border Paperless Trade</a>.</p>
 Decentralised Identifier (DID) 
<p>DID is a framework and container for identity, but not an identity scheme. DIDs are often used in conjunction with distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain. It allows individuals, organisations, and things to be identified and connected without the need for a centralised authority, and enables privacy protecting systems.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DID can be used to store or reference verifiable digital identities for people, organisations, and devices, enabling secure and private communication, transactions, and authentication in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>
 Global Location Number (GLN) 
<p>GLN is a proprietary 13-digit unique identifier developed by GS1. GLN allow organisations to identify physical locations, legal entities, or functions within their organisation. The identification data is supplied by the entity.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: GLN is used to manage and track the flow of goods and services in the supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors to retailers. </p>
 Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) 
<p>DUNS is a proprietary nine-digit identifier assigned and managed by privately owned Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). The DUNS number is used to identify businesses, primarily being used to provide a method for tracking and assessing the creditworthiness and financial health of organisations. Once considered the “standard” for organisation identification, as of April 2022 the DUNS ceased being used by the US federal Government.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DUNS numbers are commonly used by businesses and governments to evaluate potential suppliers, partners, and customers. They help organisations make informed decisions about credit risk, procurement, and market research. </p>
 Bank Identifier Code (BIC) 
<p>BIC, also known as the SWIFT code, is an entity-supplied alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies financial institutions and sub-elements within the organisation. It is used for international wire transfers and messages between banks, ensuring accurate routing of transactions. </p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: BIC is crucial for cross-border transactions, such as international wire transfers, securities trades, and foreign exchange transactions. </p>
 Trader Identification Number (TIN) 
<p>Trader Identification Number (TIN) is a unique identifier assigned to Authorised Economic Operators. An Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) is a party involved in the international movement of goods that has been certified by a national Customs administration. TINs are assigned by national bodies, typically governmental, for the purposes of customs processing of import and exports. TINs are not publicly available or referenceable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">WCO Guidelines on Trader Identification Number</a></p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: TINs are used by importers to enhance the data quality of Customs clearance processes, improve the visibility and transparency of supply chains, and enable Customs to enhance supply chain security.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) 
<p>LEI is a 20-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities and group structures in a live, publicly accessible database. It was introduced by the supra-national not-for-profit Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) under the direction of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a single identifier to enhance transparency of “who is who” and “who owns whom”, to identify counterparties and reduce risk in transactions. Over 300 regulations require or recommend the use of LEI. LEIs are only issued by GLEIF-accredited LEI Issuers.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: LEI is used to identify parties involved in financial transactions, including banks, investment firms, and corporations. It helps regulators monitor systemic risks, reduce financial fraud, and increase transparency in financial markets. More recently the LEI has been incorporated into innovative new use cases including entity data management, digital signing, B2B Identity &amp; Access Management and others.</p>
 Conclusion – the case for the LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers evolved for jurisdictional or vertical markets, historically leading to an over-complex and confusing choice for businesses. The LEI is designed to simplify the concept of organisation identity by providing both accessible identity reference data, and acting as a “connector” to other specific-purpose identifiers. For example, a partnership between the GLEIF and SWIFT to publish BIC-to-LEI mapping demonstrates the flexibility of the LEI to co-exist alongside legacy identifiers, to simplify otherwise costly entity data management processes. </p>
<blockquote><p>The one global identity behind every business.<br>
LEI is the linchpin that connects the dots across the universe of entity identification.<br>
Global LEI Foundation</p></blockquote>
<p>Global trade needs a standardised organisation identifier, and fortunately the LEI is well on the way to making the case to be the one.</p>

<p>Dock has just released a Credential Template Builder in <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> that enables users to create custom credential templates to accommodate their specific needs and a variety of use cases. Before this feature was added, if users wanted to issue credentials using other than our pre-built templates such as University Degree and Proof of Employment, they would have to use the API to create a custom template (schema) and define the custom attributes they wanted a credential to have, which requires more technical knowledge. The Credential Template Builder is a no-code feature that allows anyone to choose which details they would like to add on their credential such as license number, area of concentration on a university degree, and membership type. </p><p>Nick Lambert, CEO of Dock said, “The Custom Credential Builder was added in response to the growing demand from our customers for a customizable and easy-to-use solution that accommodates a diverse range of use cases. Our team has worked tirelessly to create a solution that doesn't require technical expertise, enabling organizations of all sizes to build and issue custom credentials efficiently, cost-effectively, and for those credentials to be interpreted by any entity verifying them.”</p><p>This feature can be used to define custom attributes on documents that can be issued as <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials</a> for a variety of use cases, including:</p>  Identity documents  Professional licenses  Membership associations  Training certificates  Employment records   Benefits of the Credential Template Builder for Issuing and Verifying Organizations   Efficient: With a no-code credential builder, issuing organizations can create custom credentials without needing to know how to code. This makes it much easier for organizations to efficiently create and issue credentials.  Cost-effective: Using a no-code verifiable credential builder can be much more cost-effective than hiring developers to build a custom solution.   Reliable data from custom credentials: Verifying organizations such as employers or financial institutions can be assured that the data on the custom credentials is reliable, unaltered, and valid  <p>Complete Guide on the Credential Template Builder</p><p><a href="http://www.dock.io/guides/custom-credential-template-builder?ref=blog.dock.io">Click here to see the step-by-step guide</a> on how to use this feature.</p><p>About Dock</p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Emilio and I’m from&nbsp;Spain.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? Do you have any pets? What are your hobbies? What is your superpower? <p>I studied electrotechnical systems, but as I like everything related to new technologies, I have trained myself in different areas, as new technologies and innovations appeared. I like many different sports including kitesurfing, surfing, and snowboarding. I also love animals and I have a dog and two cats. If I had to think of a superpower I already have, it’s my ability to have a go at everything in any field, professional or personal, no matter how challenging it might be — although, sometimes I think this is also a weakness because I don’t focus my skills on any one thing in particular.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology at its inception therefore I had the opportunity to see the birth of its MainNet almost 5 years ago. Many projects were taking their first steps then around that time, and then the initial coin offering (ICO) fever arose and many of those projects disappeared. However, thanks to the continuous work of the Ontology team, the Ontology project is still going&nbsp;strong.</p><p>I work as an administrator for the Hispanic Ontology community. I resolve concerns within the community and keep the community informed of the progress of the project. I also look for synergies with other projects in the sector, to possibly integrate with Ontology solutions. I keep up to date with all the news and developments surrounding the crypto sector, so that I can inform the Ontology community of new updates and discuss these updates with other community members. Some of my day-to-day duties include monitoring and updating social networks, translating content, and looking for opportunities to cooperate with other projects to perform AMAs or integrate ontology solutions.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Contacting other blockchain developers and finding synergies and ways to integrate Ontology’s solutions is exciting, but at the same time very complicated. With that said, it’s something I do enjoy very&nbsp;much.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In five years, I expect massive adoption of Web3. I would like to see major companies choosing to integrate Ontology’s digital identity solutions (DID) and data (DDXF) solutions to achieve that adoption. It would be great if I could play a part in&nbsp;this.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-administrator-emilio-bur-d07338913bea">Meet the Team: Community Administrator, Emilio Bur</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork is a major milestone in the Ethereum<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain,</a> especially with its migration to proof-of-stake. This upgrade brings several benefits to the network like increased security, improved scalability and higher throughput, but the most important thing is the ability to pay ETH staking rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To become a validator on the Ethereum network, users must have at least 32ETH. Those who can’t afford that amount of Ether can join shared staking pools like Lido or Rocket Pool. In such pools, rewards are proportionally smaller but still profitable as long as users remain staked for an extended period of time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the biggest changes for validators introduced in Shapell is the ability to pay rewards for their work, which has not been possible since Merge.&nbsp;Rewards are now paid out to actual validators (instead of being split between them and end users). However, this doesn’t mean that end users won’t see any reward from their staked Ether – it simply means that their reward will come from the pool operators they stake their ETH with via smart contracts instead of directly from the Ethereum protocol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important feature of Shapella is that up to 1800 validators per day can fully unstake, which would equate to 57,600 ETH (~$113 million). This allows for a gradual release of rewards and prevents serious price drops due to drastic dumps by large investors. Additionally, in each block up to 16 validators can make withdrawals which creates even more liquidity on Ether and helps prevent bank-runs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The example below shows how ETH rewards payments are handled in Coinfirm Analytics Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its records, one specific address (0xcfc7E96Be27d836b034b37132052549611341108) received one reward which can be seen in its balance graph on the AML Report. It also affects the overall address balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As this is not a typical “transaction”, this transfer does not have a transaction<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/hash/"> hash </a>and was not sent from a regular ETH address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To handle this, all rewards made after Shapella, appear on Coinfirm Analytics Visualiser under the synthetic address 0x00000000000000000000000000000WITHDRAWALS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows how Coinfirm Analytics tools keep track of all transaction movements related to Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork, no matter if it comes from or goes into this synthetic address or other ETH addresses associated with participants in the network.&nbsp;</p>

 Takeaways from the webinar — The Implementers Guide: PDG Blueprint on Credentialing Spherity &amp; Legisym co-hosted webinar key takeaways<p>The PDG Blueprint is a functional design recommendation for the pharmaceutical industry to meet DSCSA compliance. But what does it mean for my DSCSA project? That’s what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-j%C3%BCrgens/">Georg Jürgens</a>, Spherity, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwkessler/">David Kessler</a>, Legisym, discussed in our co-hosted webinar.</p><p>As co-chairs of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative’s </a>Steering Committee, Georg and David explained the <a href="https://dscsagovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PDG-Blueprint-Chapter-6.pdf">PDG Blueprint chapter “Credentialing and User Authentication”</a> and demonstrated how using OCI-specified credentials can positively impact a trading partner’s DSCSA project. They also shared their practical experience and knowledge acquired over the years to solve the challenge for Trading Partners to authenticate and authorize their counterparties in DSCSA-related Product Verifications.</p><p>We’ve put together a few key takeaways from the&nbsp;webinar.</p> #1: A network of systems requires interoperability. <p>Each participant in the supply chain has the choice between a multitude of systems and solution providers. These must be able to communicate with each other to meet DSCSA requirements. We need to ensure that all the participants are interoperable with each other, from pharmacies to manufacturers to protect healthcare supply chain security. This is why PDG collaborated with various stakeholders on the ‘Foundational Blueprint for DSCSA 2023 Interoperability’ to address TI/TS data exchange, product verification and tracing, authorized trading partner authentication and other key DSCSA requirements.</p>Source: Partnership for DSCSA Governance, PDG Blueprint #2: Credentialing as a security and authentication layer in electronic interactions. <p>While GLNs are re-usable enterprise identifiers, they are publicly available and, thus, cannot sufficiently identify trading partners in electronic interactions on their own, nor do they prove “authorized” status. That’s where OCI-aligned credentialing comes into play and closes the compliance gap. Credentialing adds a layer of security without changing current standards and provides digital evidence of who the interacting trading partner is and that they have the proper license or registration to be considered an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) as defined by&nbsp;DSCSA.</p> #3: Compliance decision: Automated or manual ATP&nbsp;checks? <p>If you opt for manual checks, you should understand that these are not compatible with VRS-based interactions. That means, the response can’t go back through the VRS process and turns into a manual process for both sides, requiring emails, phone calls, or other methods to facilitate the line of questioning: Who is the Trading Partner? Is the Trading Partner authorized? Is it really the Trading Partner who’s interacting with me at this very moment? It can turn into a very labor-intensive method. In contrast, if you have a credentialing process in place, the verification happens within far less than a minute. The decision to choose between these compliance options is up to each trading&nbsp;partner.</p>Automated ATP checks through OCI Credentialing for DSCSA Compliance.<p>If you made it this far and would like to get more guidance on OCI-specified credentials in the context of DSCSA, you might want to watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/GbrVcIb7Bcg">webinar recording</a> for more insights.</p><p>If you’re curious to see how the OCI-aligned credentialing works in action, get access to our <a href="https://www.caro.vc/register">demo&nbsp;now</a>!</p> Further reading <p>If you’re already familiar with the Open Credentialing Initiative (<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">OCI</a>), Verification Router Services (VRS), <a href="https://dscsagovernance.org/blueprint/">PDG Blueprint</a>, <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, or <a href="https://legisym.com/">Legisym</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/how-centralized-atp-repositories-complicate-dscsa-regulated-product-verifications-dc51a8bc672e">this article </a>is valuable for you to learn more about ATP&nbsp;checks.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/takeaways-from-the-webinar-the-implementers-guide-pdg-blueprint-on-credentialing-a67b25fcbaac">Takeaways from the webinar — The Implementers Guide: PDG Blueprint on Credentialing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">With 2022’s global online gambling market valued at $63.53 billion</a>, online casinos want to guarantee that their players are practicing responsible gaming through developing information solutions that support and assist gamblers, safeguard the authenticity of gambling activities, and prevent fraudulent activities, thus giving players the assurance of using a safe online gambling site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there might come reservations from both parties that their time and efforts must be sacrificed in order to practice safe gaming, but that’s quite the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is responsible gaming and why is it important?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gaming is all about prevention. Players want to enjoy themselves, but sometimes things can go too far, or individuals might take advantage of the system. Instead, responsible gaming is a concept that encompasses several policies and requirements which apply to gambling stakeholders. These policies and requirements make sure operators adhere to the highest standards of quality, while offering a safe user experience that protects people from the potential negative consequences of online gambling.</p>



<p>The creation and maintenance of a socially responsible gambling environment and the provision of tools to support gamblers with their gambling behavior lays at the core of the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2022/02/Consumer-Protection-in-Online-Gambling-Regulation-Jan31-EGBA-Final.pdf">European Commision’s Recommendation</a> principles. Although it is up to the individual players to take advantage of the tools being offered, it is up to the Member States to ensure that appropriate tools that facilitate safer gambling practices are available. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, ”the Recommendation specifies that online gambling operators should be required to allow players to set their own financial and temporal limits, to offer time-outs, temporary breaks and long-term self-exclusion schemes, to provide gamblers with information regarding their playing and expenditure patterns, and to initiate engagement with any customers whose playing patterns give indication of the potential development of gambling problems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is suggested that gambling websites should display links to relevant support helplines and other details of support organizations in order to ensure responsible gambling. Furthermore, Member States are urged to&nbsp;create national self-exclusion registers that would enable players to exclude themselves from all online gambling operators licensed in that jurisdiction and to ensure that all operators have access to such registers.&nbsp;Through this encouragement, the number of Member States that offer national self-exclusion registers has actually increased over the past three years&nbsp;to a total number of 16. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus,&nbsp;gambling operators have the opportunity to give their customers all the tools they need to practice responsible gambling. However, it isn’t only through self-exclusion and monitoring gambling behavior that this will be achieved. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;entails a few more aspects on the side of the stakeholder. Here is a list that operators should be aware of and implement in order to establish responsible gaming:&nbsp;</p>



  Protecting vulnerable gamblers with responsible gaming tools and self-exclusion lists&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Preventing underage gambling</a>&nbsp;  Incorporating safety measures to fight criminal activities&nbsp;such as i.e. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/chip-dumping/">chip dumping as part of money laundering schemes</a>  Providing an information policy&nbsp;  Having an online payment protection&nbsp;  Maintaining a secure online environment&nbsp;  Complying with ethical and responsible marketing&nbsp;  



<p>The importance is therefore driven home through the above practices. Thus, companies in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">online gambling</a> sector who implement the above measures act as role models when it comes to this importance of responsible gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Underage Gambling and Fraud Prevention &nbsp; 



<p>Not only are vulnerable gamblers protected, as well as underage gamblers, but by having a safe online gambling site it allows the operator to fight criminal activities, which put not only the company in jeopardy, but also its players. With underage gambling becoming more popular, with <a href="https://www.roulettesites.org/blog/responsible-gambling/underage-gambling.php">nearly 40% of 11-16 year-olds wagering their own money</a> in the UK, this is one of the many reasons why <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">countries such as the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Germany place heavy restrictions</a> on online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the case of criminal activities, fraud is a serious problem in many aspects of the online world, not excluding online gaming. This is particularly the case when big sports events occur and operators see an increase in user activity. <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2022/04/29/62427-digital-gambling-fraud-rate-grows-50--in-q1-industry-marks-secondhighest-increase">Just in the first quarter of 2022, the global online gambling fraud rate grew to 50%</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In consequence, safe online gambling sites are required to verify the identity of their players in order to prevent such cases, both fraud and underage gambling alike, from happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What does responsible gaming or safe gambling mean for gambling operators? 



<p>No matter the jurisdiction, responsible gaming is at the core of all regulated operators. This means that operators must ensure that their customers gamble in a safe and controlled environment by implementing practices to prevent and combat gambling addiction.</p>



<p>Thus, when looking at responsible gaming from an operator’s perspective, KYC is an important part of the matrix due to getting an overall picture of the players on their sites. Without identifying a player, monitoring that individual’s gambling behavior would not be possible. As such, KYC is crucial when it comes to responsible gaming because it helps prevent addiction, protects vulnerable players, as well as reduces fraud all by identifying players before they start gambling. In short, responsible gaming with the help of KYC is a crucial aspect of gambling operations that emphasizes the need for safe and sustainable gambling practices and will help secure a company’s reputation.</p>



 Securing Players &amp; Platforms 



<p>With KYC a major part of responsible gaming, gambling operators need to secure not only their players but also their platform. Many operators face the challenge of performing the regulatory requirements correctly due to lack of knowledge or solutions. With jurisdictions having varied regulations such as those <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">across the EU</a>, it can be quite overwhelming to know <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gaming-regulation-in-europe-an-overview/">what needs to be included</a>. However, what responsible gaming comes down to is securing players and the platforms they use.</p>



<p>Thus, each market has different levels of importance for what triggers responsible gaming. Some may set more importance on Loss Limits, Deposit Limits or Time Limits with imposed monetary or time values. Some may focus on affordability of an individual player, multiple accounts, or regular changes in payment options. All of these data points tie into an overall player profile and from that an operator can assess if any interactions are required to either prevent a player from increasing their risk levels, a time-out (cool down period) is required, or changes in marketing towards a player (no bonus marketing, and more of a safe gambling marketing approach is required) or in some extreme circumstances closure of accounts.</p>



 How ID Verification can assist in responsible gaming&nbsp; 



<p>When it comes to online gambling and identity verification, many companies and players are turned off by the requirements. However, this need not be the case. Businesses can incorporate responsible gaming while keeping player conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to such success is through a user-friendly verification process that also prohibits fraud. By providing such an experience, huge sporting events such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qatar-2022-show-red-card-betting-fraud/">FIFA World Cup</a> or any gaming event can become perfect examples and opportunities for operators to showcase what they are able to do for their players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By giving players options on how to identify themselves, like with&nbsp;automated identity verification&nbsp;options provided by IDnow, it takes into consideration background checks that take place before the ID verification, and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">through the use of NFC</a>, operators are able to quickly scan an NFC document which requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. And not only that, it provides a higher level of security for the company through the reading of the chip, with more regulators accepting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This in turn uncovers a new wave of sophisticated crime that is only detected through ID verification. Because when visual security features on an ID document, like holograms and watermarks, are forged to perfection it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features, like with NFC.</p>



<p>In the end, ID verification is a win-win for both the gaming operators and sports fans alike by providing high levels of security for the company and a fast and convenient onboarding process for customers. In fact, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">83% of operators believe smooth digital transactions have become essential to business survival</a>. Trust is consequently forged between the operator and its players.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>13th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform and main contributor to the protocol, announced that the version 4.0 of the T-REX implementation of the ERC3643, the open source blockchain protocol for tokenizing real-world assets, underwent a thorough security audit conducted by the leading Web3 auditor, <a href="https://hacken.io/">Hacken</a>. The results of the audit yielded a flawless score of 10/10, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>

		 
	 
                      
	 
		 
			<p>The full score from Hacken builds upon the proven track record achieved by its previous version, which has received similar approval from the reputable third-party auditor, Kaspersky. Over the years, the protocol has undergone multiple developments to enhance its capabilities and cater to the needs of the tokenization ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ERC3643 is the leading token standard for permissioned tokens. It provides a comprehensive framework for token issuers to enforce compliance and control, making it the most suitable standard for tokenization of real-world assets and financial instruments. With its proven track record of five years, it has become the de facto standard for tokenization. In fact, more than $28B of assets around the world have been tokenized using the protocol, including open-ended funds (UCITs and REITs), alternative funds, asset-backed securities, debt, real estate, equity, trade finance, with much more in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The key enabler of the compliance framework is ERC3643’s built-in decentralized identity (DID) framework, ONCHAINID. It provides a reliable way to ensure compliance by verifying the identity of token holders via verifiable credentials. As a result, this solution allows users to retain full custody of their assets, providing a high level of security and control all within a compliant environment, even on a public blockchain. Notably, the ONCHAINID standard was audited in parallel and earned as well a 10/10 security score from Hacken’s audit.</p>
<p>Hacken’s position as a top tier security auditor for blockchain protocols is indisputable. Its extensive portfolio includes conducting security audits for numerous high-profile crypto exchanges, underscoring their profound comprehension of the security necessities of blockchain-based systems. With both protocols earning 10/10 security audit scores from Hacken, users can trust that they are reliable and secure options for asset tokenization and identity verification.</p>
<p>The release of ERC3643 V4 is Tokeny’s latest contribution to the standardization of tokenization for capital markets. These upgrades are also open source. By making sure that the main token standard for tokenized securities is always up-to-date with the latest innovations, Tokeny aims to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Munich, April 12, 2023 – IDnow, a leading European platform provider for identity proofing, has recorded an increase in transactions with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/produkte/idnow-eid/">German online ID function (eID)</a> by more than a factor of four for the year 2022. This means that eID usage at the Munich-based identity expert is growing much faster than the nationwide eID transaction figures, which increased by around 19% from 2021 to 2022, according to the <a href="https://dashboard.ozg-umsetzung.de/">OZGDB</a>. </p>



<p>When reading out sensitive eID data, IDnow can rely on its own eID authorization certificate, issued by the Federal Office of Administration (Bundesverwaltungsamt). The certificate allows IDnow, in cooperation with the Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei), to read out the eID online ID card function in accordance with the Identity Card Act (Personalausweisgesetz, PAuswG) for identity verification. </p>



<p>Electronic ID card: Advantages of NFC technology</p>



<p>At IDnow, growth has been driven primarily by the more highly regulated industries such as the financial and eGovernment sectors. It is in these sectors, in particular, that the electronic ID card with its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC-based (near field communication)</a> online ID function can show its strengths. Fraud prevention with this method is particularly high because the chip integrated in the ID card is extremely forgery-proof. Thanks to the high level of security, the solution is compliant with both the German Money Laundering Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/glossary/geldwaeschegesetz-gwg/">Geldwäschegesetz, GWG</a>) and the Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz, TKG).</p>



<p>As a sovereign-notified procedure, the eID online ID function offers the highest level of security among identification procedures. In addition, the identity check with the eID takes only a few minutes and is fully automated, i.e., it can be processed without service employees.</p>



<p>Only 8% of the population have used the eID</p>



<p>Despite the recent positive developments, the penetration rate of this identification method among the German population remains at a low level. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/digital-identity-index-2023-study-future-germany/">IDnow’s Digital Identity Index 2023</a> recently showed that even more than 10 years after its introduction, the eID function is hardly used on a broad scale. According to the YouGov survey, only 8% of the population has ever used it.</p>



<p>Private identification solutions such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">video identification procedures in a video chat</a> (38%) or on-site identification in a post office branch (40%) continue to dominate the German market.</p>



<p>One reason for this is the unfamiliarity of the eID solution – according to the Index, only 7% of the German population has any idea what the term “eID” means. The lack of use cases in everyday life, as well as the comparatively poor user-friendliness of the solution, also contribute to the fact that the method is used so little. Both a 6-digit PIN and an NFC-enabled smartphone are required. Data transmission via the NFC interface often causes users problems when reading it out.</p>



<p>“To counteract the low level of awareness of the solution, Germany needs extensive marketing and awareness campaigns by politicians and the private sector on the one hand. On the other hand, financial service providers, mobility providers, and telecommunications companies must dare to implement the solution in their onboarding processes. An increased range of use cases will automatically have a positive effect on awareness of the eID. All players, politics as well as businesses, must work closely together to make the eID a success after all,” explains Armin Bauer, co-founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow.</p>



<p>Platform approach allows integration of different identification solutions</p>



<p>In the future, IDnow expects a further increase in the number of eID users due to various political decisions such as the Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz, OZG), the introduction of the BundID in additional federal states and the flat-rate energy fee for students. The higher penetration rate of NFC-enabled smartphones and onboarding in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> planned by the EU will also have a positive impact on penetration in the future.</p>



<p>“We see ourselves very well equipped for these developments with our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">platform approach</a>. After all, there will never be one, dominant solution in identity verification, as the needs of younger, older, tech-savvy or less-savvy people differ greatly. Instead, we rely on a wide range of different identification solutions to address all citizens’ needs,” Bauer continued. “If the user has misplaced their PIN or the smartphone’s NFC interface doesn’t work, for example, they can seamlessly switch to an alternative identification solution like VideoIdent on our platform and reliably complete the onboarding process.”</p>

<p>After developing a machine learning model, you need a place to run your model and serve predictions. If your company is in the early stage of its AI journey or has budget constraints, you may struggle to find a deployment system for your model. Building ML infrastructure and integrating ML models with the larger business are major bottlenecks to AI adoption [1,2,3]. IBM Db2 can help solve these problems with its built-in ML infrastructure. Someone with the knowledge of SQL and access to a Db2 instance, where the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=learning-prerequisites-machine-in-db2">in-database ML</a> feature is enabled, can easily learn to build and use a machine learning model in the database.</p>



<p>In this post, I will show how to develop, deploy, and use a decision tree model in a Db2 database.</p>







<p>These are my major steps in this tutorial:</p>



 
 Set up Db2 tables 



 Explore ML dataset 



 Preprocess the dataset 



 Train a decision tree model 



 Generate predictions using the model 



 Evaluate the model 
 



<p>I implemented these steps in a Db2 Warehouse on-prem database. Db2 Warehouse on cloud also supports these ML features.</p>



 The machine learning use&nbsp;case 



<p>I will use a dataset of historical flights in the US. For each flight, the dataset has information such as the flight’s origin airport, departure time, flying time, and arrival time. Also, a column in the dataset indicates if each flight had arrived on time or late. Using examples from the dataset, we’ll build a classification model with decision tree algorithm. Once trained, the model can receive as input unseen flight data and predict if the flight will arrive on time or late at its destination.</p>



 1. Set up Db2&nbsp;tables 



<p>The dataset I use in this tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/blob/master/In_Db2_Machine_Learning/Building%20ML%20Models%20with%20Db2/Datasets/FLIGHTS_DATA_V3.csv">here</a> as a csv file.</p>



 Creating a Db2 table 



<p>I use the following SQL for creating a table for storing the dataset.</p>



 <code>db2start
connect to &lt;database_name&gt;

db2 "CREATE TABLE FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3  (

DISTANCEGROUP INTEGER ,                       
FLIGHTSTATUS VARCHAR(1) )
ORGANIZE BY ROW";</code> 



<p>After creating the table, I use the following SQL to load the data, from the csv <a href="https://github.com/IBM/db2-samples/blob/master/In_Db2_Machine_Learning/Building%20ML%20Models%20with%20Db2/Datasets/FLIGHTS_DATA_V3.csv">file</a>, into the table:</p>



 <code>db2 "IMPORT FROM 'FLIGHTS_DATA_V3.csv' OF DEL COMMITCOUNT 50000 INSERT INTO FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3"</code> 



<p>I now have the ML dataset loaded into the FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3 table in Db2. I’ll copy a subset of the records from this table to a separate table for the ML model development and evaluation, leaving the original copy of the data intact.&nbsp;</p>



 <code>SELECT count(*) FROM FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3</code> 



<p> — — — <br>1000000</p>



 Creating a separate table with sample&nbsp;records 



<p>Create a table with 10% sample rows from the above table. Use the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=functions-rand-sysfun-schema">RAND</a> function of Db2 for random sampling.</p>



 <code>CREATE TABLE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA AS (SELECT * FROM FLIGHTS.FLIGHTS_DATA_V3 WHERE RAND() &lt; 0.1) WITH DATA</code> 



<p>Count the number of rows in the sample table.</p>



 <code>SELECT count(*) FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA</code> 



<p>— — —&nbsp;<br>99879</p>



<p>Look into the scheme definition of the table.</p>



 <code>SELECT NAME, COLTYPE, LENGTH
FROM SYSIBM.SYSCOLUMNS
WHERE TBCREATOR = 'FLIGHT' AND TBNAME = 'FLIGHTS_DATA'
ORDER BY COLNO</code> 







<p>FLIGHTSTATUS is the response or the target column. Others are feature columns.</p>



<p>Find the DISTINCT values in the target column.</p>







<p>From these values, I can see that it’s a binary classification task where each flight arrived either on time or late.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Find the frequencies of distinct values in the FLIGHTSTATUS column.</p>



 <code>SELECT FLIGHTSTATUS, count(*) AS FREQUENCY, count(*) / (SELECT count(*) FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA) AS FRACTION
FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA fdf
GROUP BY FLIGHTSTATUS</code> 







<p>From the above, I see the classes are imbalanced. Now I’ll not gain any further insights from the entire dataset, as this can leak information to the modeling phase.&nbsp;</p>



 Creating train/test partitions of the&nbsp;dataset 



<p>Before collecting deeper insights into the data, I’ll divide this dataset into train and test partitions using Db2’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-warehouse?topic=functions-idaxrandom-sample-random-sampling">RANDOM_SAMPLING</a> SP. I apply stratified sampling to preserve the ratio between two classes in the generated training data set.</p>



<p>Create a TRAIN partition.</p>



 <code>call IDAX.RANDOM_SAMPLE('intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA, fraction=0.8, outtable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN, by=FLIGHTSTATUS')</code> 







<p>Copy the remaining records to a test PARTITION.</p>



 <code>CREATE TABLE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST AS (SELECT * FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_DATA FDF WHERE FDF.ID NOT IN(SELECT FT.ID FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN FT)) WITH DATA</code> 



 2. Explore&nbsp;data 



<p>In this step, I’ll look at both sample records and the summary statistics of the training dataset to gain insights into the dataset.</p>



<p>Look into some sample records.</p>



<p>SELECT * FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY</p>







<p>Some columns have encoded the time as numbers:</p>



<p> — CRSDEPTIME: Computer Reservation System (scheduled) Departure Time (hhmm)</p>



<p> — DepTime: Departure Time (hhmm)</p>



<p> — CRSArrTime: Computer Reservation System (scheduled) Arrival Time</p>



<p>Now, I collect summary statistics from the FLIGHTS_TRAIN using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=exploration-idaxsummary1000-summary-up-1000-columns">SUMMARY1000</a> SP to get a global view of the characteristics of the dataset.</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.SUMMARY1000('intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN, outtable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000')</code> 



<p>Here the intable has the name of the input table from which I want SUMMARY1000 SP to collect statistics. outtable is the name of the table where SUMMARY1000 will store gathered statistics for the entire dataset. Besides the outtable, SUMMARY1000 SP creates a few additional output tables — one table with statistics for each column type. Our dataset has two types of columns — numeric and nominal. So, SUMMARY1000 will generate two additional tables. These additional tables follow this naming convention: the name of the outtable + column type. In our case, the column types are NUM, representing numeric, and CHAR, representing nominal. So, the names of these two additional tables will be as follows:</p>



<p>FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_NUM</p>



<p>FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_CHAR</p>



<p>Having the statistics available in separate tables for specific datatypes makes it easier to view the statistics that apply to specific datatype and reduce the number of columns whose statistics are viewed together. This simplifies the analysis process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Check the summary statistics of the numeric column.</p>



 <code>SELECT * FROM FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_NUM</code> 







<p>For the numeric columns, SUMMARY1000 gather the following statistics:</p>



 
 Missing value count 



 Non-missing value count 



 Average 



 Variance 



 Standard deviation 



 Skewness 



 Excess kurtosis 



 Minimum 



 Maximum 
 



<p>Each of these statistics can help uncover insights into the dataset. For instance, I can see that DEPDEL15 and DEPDELAY columns have 49 missing values. There are large values in these columns: AIRTIME, CRSARRTIME, CRSDEPTIME, CRSELAPSEDTIME, DEPDELAY, DEPTIME, TAXIOUT, WHEELSOFF, and YEAR. Since I will create a decision tree model, I don’t need to deal with the large value and the missing values. Db2 will deal with both issues natively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, I investigate the summary statistics of the nominal columns.</p>



 <code>select * from FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN_SUM1000_CHAR</code> 







<p>For nominal columns, SUMMARY1000 gathered the following statistics:</p>



 
 Number of missing values 



 Number of non-missing values 



 Number of distinct values 



 Frequency of the most frequent value 
 



 3. Preprocess data 



<p>From the above data exploration, I can see that the dataset has no missing values. These four TIME columns have large values: AIRTIME, CRSARRTIME, DEPTIME, WHEELSOFF. I’ll leave the nominal values in all columns as-is, as the decision tree implementation in Db2 can deal with them natively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Extract the hour part from the TIME columns — CRSARRTIME, DEPTIME, WHEELSOFF.</p>



<p>From looking up the description of the dataset, I see the values in the CRSARRTIME, DEPTIME, and WHEELSOFF columns are encoding of hhmm of the time values. I extract the hour part of these values to create, hopefully, better features for the learning algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scale CRSARRTIME COLUMN: divide the value with 100 gives the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN SET CRSARRTIME = CRSARRTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale DEPTIME COLUMN: divide the value by 100 gives the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN SET DEPTIME = DEPTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale WHEELSOFF COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN SET WHEELSOFF = WHEELSOFF / 100</code> 



 4. Train a decision tree&nbsp;model 



<p>Now the training dataset is ready for the decision tree algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I train a decision tree model using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=functions-idaxgrow-dectree-build-decision-tree-model">GROW_DECTREE</a> SP.&nbsp;</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.GROW_DECTREE('model=FLIGHT.flight_dectree, intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TRAIN, id=ID, target=FLIGHTSTATUS')</code> 



<p>I called this SP using the following parameters:</p>



 
 model: the name I want to give to the decision tree model — FLIGHT_DECTREE 



 intable: the name of the table where the training dataset is stored 



 id: the name of the ID column 



 target: the name of the target column 
 



<p>After completing the model training, the GROW_DECTREE SP generated several tables with metadata from the model and the training dataset. Here are some of the key tables:</p>



 
 FLIGHT_DECTREE_MODEL: this table contains metadata about the model. Examples of metadata include depth of the tree, strategy for handling missing values, and the number of leaf nodes in the tree.&nbsp; 



 FLIGHT_DECTREE_NODES: this table provides information about each node in the decision tree.&nbsp; 



 FLIGHT_DECTREE_COLUMNS: this table provides information on each input column and their role in the trained model. The information includes the importance of a column in generating a prediction from the model.&nbsp; 
 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=trees-model-table-data-formats">This</a> link has the complete list of model tables and their details.&nbsp;</p>



 5. Generate predictions from the&nbsp;model 



<p>Since the FLIGHT_DECTREE model is trained and deployed in the database, I can use it for generating predictions on the test records from the FLIGHTS_TEST table.</p>



<p>First, I preprocess the test dataset using the same preprocessing logic that I applied to the TRAINING dataset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scale CRSARRTIME COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST SET CRSARRTIME = CRSARRTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale DEPTIME COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST SET DEPTIME = DEPTIME / 100</code> 



<p>Scale WHEELSOFF COLUMN: divide the value by 100 will give the hour of the flight arrival time:</p>



 <code>UPDATE FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST SET WHEELSOFF = WHEELSOFF / 100</code> 



 Generating predictions 



<p>I use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=functions-idaxpredict-dectree-apply-decision-tree-model">PREDICT_DECTREE</a> SP to generate predictions from the FLIGHT_DECTREE model:</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.PREDICT_DECTREE('model=FLIGHT.flight_dectree, intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST, outtable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_PRED, prob=true, outtableprob=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_PRED_DIST')</code> 



<p>Here is the list of parameters I passed when calling this SP:</p>



 
 model: the name of the decision tree model, FLIGHT_DECTREE 



 intable: name of the input table to generate predictions from 



 outtable: the name of the table that the SP will create and store predictions to 



 prob: a boolean flag indicating if we want to include in the output the probability of each prediction 



 outputtableprob: the name of the output table where the probability of each prediction will be stored&nbsp; 
 



 6. Evaluate the&nbsp;model 



<p>Using generated predictions for the test dataset, I compute a few metrics to evaluate the quality of the model’s predictions.</p>



 Creating a confusion matrix 



<p>I use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=evaluation-idaxconfusion-matrix-build-confusion-matrix">CONFUSION_MATRIX</a> SP to create a confusion matrix based on the model’s prediction on the TEST dataset.&nbsp;</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.CONFUSION_MATRIX('intable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST, resulttable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_PRED, id=ID, target=FLIGHTSTATUS, matrixTable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_CMATRIX')</code> 



<p>In calling this SP, here are some of the key parameters that I passed:</p>



 
 intable: the name of the table that contains the dataset and the actual value of the target column 



 resulttable: the name of the table that contains the column with predicted values from the model 



 target: the name of the target column 



 matrixTable: The output table where the SP will store the confusion matrix 
 



<p>After the SP completes its run, we have the following output table with statistics for the confusion matrix.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FLIGHTS_TEST_CMATRIX:</p>







<p>This table has three columns. The REAL column has the actual flight status. PREDICTION column has the predicted flight status. Since flight status takes two values – 0 (on time) or 1 (delayed), we have four possible combinations between values in the REAL and the PREDICTION columns:&nbsp;</p>



 
 TRUE NEGATIVE: REAL: 0, PREDICTION: 0 — The model has accurately predicted the status of those flights that arrived on schedule. From that CNT column, we see that 11795 rows from the TEST table belong to this combination. 



 FALSE POSITIVE: REAL: 0, PREDICTION: 1 — these are the flights that actually arrived on time but the model predicted them to be delayed. 671 is the count of such flights.&nbsp; 



 FALSE NEGATIVE: REAL: 1, PREDICTION: 0 — these flights have arrived late, but the model predicted them to be on time. From the CNT table, we find their count to be 2528. 



 TRUE POSITIVE: REAL: 1, PREDICTION: 1 — the model has accurately identified these flights that were late. The count is 4981.&nbsp; 
 



<p>I use these counts to compute a few evaluation metrics for the model. For doing so, I use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=me-idaxcmatrix-stats-calculate-classification-quality-factors-from-confusion-matrix">CMATRIX_STATS</a> SP as follows:</p>



 <code>CALL IDAX.CMATRIX_STATS('matrixTable=FLIGHT.FLIGHTS_TEST_CMATRIX')</code> 



<p>The only parameter this SP needs is the name of the table that contains the statistics generated by the CONFUSION_MATRIX SP in the previous step. CMATRIX_STATS SP generates two sets of output. The first one shows overall quality metrics of the model. The second one includes the model’s predictive performance for each class.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First output — overall model metrics include correction predictions, incorrect prediction, overall accuracy, weighted accuracy. From this output, I see that the model has an overall accuracy of 83.98% and a weighted accuracy of 80.46%.&nbsp;</p>







<p>With classification tasks, it’s usually useful to view the model’s quality factors for each individual class. The second output from the CMATRIX_STATS SP includes these class level quality metrics.&nbsp;</p>







<p>For each class, this output includes the True Positive Rate (TPR), False Positive Rate (FPR), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) or Precision, and F-measure (F1 score).&nbsp;</p>



 Conclusions and key takeaways 



<p>If you want to build and deploy an ML model in a Db2 database using Db2’s built-in stored procedures, I hope you’ll find this tutorial useful. Here are the main takeaways of this tutorial:</p>



 
 Demonstrated a complete workflow of creating and using a decision tree model in a Db2 database using in-database ML Stored procedures.&nbsp; 



 For each step in the workflow, I provided concrete and functional SQL statements and stored procedures. For each code example, when applicable, I explained intuitively what it does, and its inputs and outputs.&nbsp; 



 Included references to IBM Db2’s documentation for the ML stored procedures I used in this tutorial.&nbsp; 
 



<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2022/">O’Reilly’s 2022 AI Adoption survey</a>[3] underscored challenges in building technical infrastructure and skills gap as two top bottlenecks to AI adoption in the enterprise. Db2 solves the first one by supplying an end-to-end ML infrastructure in the database. It also lessens the latter, the skills gap, by providing simple SQL API for developing and using ML models in the database. In the enterprise, SQL is a more common skill than ML.</p>

Human &amp; automated moderation systems working together. Image generated by Midjourney.
<p>Moderation is a necessary feature of social spaces. It’s how bad behavior gets constrained, norms get set, and disputes get resolved. We’ve kept the Bluesky app invite-only and are finishing moderation before the last pieces of open federation because we wanted to prioritize user safety from the start.</p>
<p>Just like our approach to algorithmic choice, our approach to moderation allows for an ecosystem of third-party providers. Moderation should be a composable, customizable piece that can be layered into your experience. For custom feeds, there is a basic default (only who you follow), and then many possibilities for custom algorithms. For moderation as well, there should be a basic default, and then many custom filters available on top.</p>
<p>The basics of our approach to moderation are well-established practices. We do automated labeling, like centralized social sites, and make service-level admin decisions, like many federated networks. But the piece we’re most excited about is the open, composable labeling system we’re building that both developers and users can contribute to. Under the hood, centralized social sites use labeling to implement moderation — we think this piece can be unbundled, opened up to third-party innovation, and configured with user agency in mind. Anyone should be able to create or subscribe to moderation labels that third parties create.</p>
 An Ecosystem of Moderation Labeling 
<p>Here’s the way we’re designing an open, composable labeling system for moderation:</p>
 
 Anyone can define and apply “labels” to content or accounts (i.e. “spam”, “nsfw”). This is a separate service, so they do not have to run a PDS (personal data server) or a client app in order to do so. 
 Labels can be automatically generated (by third-party services, or by custom algorithms) or manually generated (by admins, or by users themselves) 
 Any service or person in the network can choose how these labels get used to determine the final user experience. 
 
<p>So how will we be applying this on the Bluesky app? Automated filtering is a commoditized service by now, so we will be taking advantage of this to apply a first pass to remove illegal content and label objectionable material. Then we will apply server-level filters as admins of bsky.social, with a default setting and custom controls to let you hide, warn, or show content. On top of that, we will let users subscribe to additional sets of moderation labels that can filter out more content or accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the layers here. Centralized social platforms delegate all moderation to a central set of admins whose policies are set by one company. This is a bit like resolving all disputes at the level of the Supreme Court. Federated networks delegate moderation decisions to server admins. This is more like resolving disputes at a state government level, which is better because you can move to a new state if you don’t like your state's decisions — but moving is usually difficult and expensive in other networks. We’ve improved on this situation by making it easier to switch servers, and by separating moderation out into structurally independent services.</p>
<p>We’re calling the location-independent moderation infrastructure “community labeling” because you can opt-in to an online community’s moderation system that's not necessarily tied to the server you're on.</p>
 Community Labeling 
<p>Community labeling can be done by automated systems, or it can consist of humans manually labeling things. The human-generated label sets can be thought of as something similar to shared mute/block lists.</p>
<p>Here’s how we think a manual community labeling system will work:</p>
 
 Anyone can create a label set, then add admins or mods to help manage it 
 Mods can add labels that the set defines to accounts or content (“rude”, “troll”, etc.) 
 Anyone can subscribe to the set and have the labels be applied to their experience 
 
 What's Ahead 
<p>We’re landing a first pass on automated filtering in the app today, and will improve it based on user feedback. Community labeling is still in the works. We’ll be publishing more details soon.</p>
<p>Through this approach of a composable, customizable moderation system, we aim to prioritize user safety while giving people more control. An open labeling system for moderation contributed to by both developers and users will allow for innovation, transparency, and agency in this critical piece of social networking infrastructure where technical and social systems collide.</p>

     <p>It was a power packed day for Digital Trust today with 22 speakers joining us from around the world to share the latest in the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>It was a big – dare we say exciting – day for our community. We shared that after more than 10 years of growing and building the IdentityNORTH community focused on identifying how digital ID technology might be able to solve issues by rolling out socially beneficial distributed Digital ID. While we still don’t have those systems, we realized that the digital ID systems themselves were just the tip of the iceberg, we needed to be having broader conversations, talking about what would inevitably be built on top of these systems, how society would evolve, and how to ensure that safeguards and values are built into whatever we allow to be built. Most importantly, we felt it important to be bringing more perspectives to the conversations than were present before. Technology and how it affects us is evolving at an incredible pace. Conversations about harnessing tech and regulating it need to evolve too.</p>
<p>Starting this June, EXCITE will be where thousands of change-makers come together to advance the future of digital trust and ignite innovation. With a focus on Advancing Digital Trust, EXCITE events and content will focus on three key streams:</p>
 
 Advancing New Models of Trusted Service Delivery 
 Advancing Cybersecurity 
 Advancing Digital Talent &amp; Inclusion 
 
<p>EXCITE SUMMIT events will continue to bring together professionals and experts from both public and private sectors to collaborate, learn, and innovate on critical issues arising from the increasing digitization of our world: privacy, cybersecurity, inclusion, skills development, identity and access management, and data protection.</p>
<p>With the move to EXCITE, we plan to continue the beloved traditions from our community – creating discussion and networking opportunities to provide time for learning, collaboration, seeing how we can support each other’s work across industry and government here in Canada and around the world, honoring the leaders in our shared efforts, and of course providing great swag…</p>
<p>We will start new traditions to support us on this path and welcome your ideas and referrals as we are expanding to bring more individuals and organizations from different sectors into our community.</p>

<p>Organizations are increasingly seeking more choice and flexibility as they modernize their mission-critical workloads. But each organization is at a different point and has different goals when transforming their businesses and modernizing their SAP environments. Some organizations are looking to improve business operations by moving from legacy ERP to SAP S/4HANA®, SAP’s next-generation ERP software, while others want to replace manual processes with AI and automation.</p>



<p>SAP, the leader in enterprise application software solutions, recognized the need for a flexible cloud-based solution and introduced <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/rise.html">RISE with SAP</a> to help organizations modernize their ERP, accelerate business transformation and drive innovation. Launched in January 2021, RISE with SAP is a subscription management solution that packages software, cloud platform, innovation and SAP expertise to help simplify, modernize and transforms client’s processes and operations using SAP.</p>



<p>To complement and help maximize the value of RISE with SAP, IBM introduced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/rise-with-sap">BREAKTHROUGH with IBM for RISE with SAP</a>, a portfolio that draws upon advisory, implementation, application and technical management services from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074472741157&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiArY2fBhB9EiwAWqHK6oay97Y0k1if48EqQ-dQZspnLf_rH-ncJojPa9y3kazk0e8GeOzHjBoCmKsQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM Consulting™</a>. These services leverage IBM Consulting’s deep industry expertise and experience to offer clients a simplified and unified approach toward modernizing their operations using rich data and integrating powerful AI technologies to deliver better business outcomes.</p>



<p>In addition to the leading management and consulting services of IBM Consulting, the company’s 50-plus year partnership with SAP makes the BREAKTHROUGH portfolio unique in:</p>



 
 Helping existing and potential SAP clients, no matter where they are on their journey 



 Accelerating and amplifying RISE outcomes that are specific to client needs 



 Supporting clients throughout their SAP modernization journey with IBM Consulting professionals, services and solutions 



 Advancing cloud migration, operational efficiency and continuous improvements 
 



<p>All companies need to develop new business models to stay ahead of market disruptions and improve automation, so they can innovate and create business value. Here are three considerations for adopting RISE with SAP and BREAKTHROUGH with IBM for RISE with SAP.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/rise-with-sap">Learn more about BREAKTHROUGH with IBM for RISE with SAP</a>



 Consideration 1: A strong business case 



<p>An actionable business case creates a clear roadmap for achieving your company’s goals and demonstrating value. This starts with looking at your individual business function and considering what areas need improvement. What are your current business process and operational challenges? Are there tasks that can be automated to increase efficiency and productivity? Do you need to move data to the cloud while ensuring its integrity, security and compliance?</p>



<p>One universal concern for companies is dealing with technical debt. In a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/demystifying-digital-dark-matter-a-new-standard-to-tame-technical-debt">McKinsey study</a>, 30% of CIOs&nbsp;believe that more than 20% of their technical budget for new products is diverted to resolving technical debt. The adoption of cloud-based services provided by RISE with SAP creates an opportunity to reduce technical debt by consolidating resources so companies can scale.</p>



<p>With assets spread throughout India, <a href="https://in.newsroom.ibm.com/2021-09-16-Virescent-infrastructure-embarks-hybrid-cloud-journey-with-IBM-and-SAP?utm_medium=OSocial&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_content=000039LO&amp;utm_term=10008436&amp;utm_id=GBS-ISA&amp;social_post=5493238132&amp;linkId=131852216">Virescent Infrastructure</a> was looking at ways to improve manual processes across functions for stock reports and inventory management, procurement and vendor management, pricing and tax calculation, and more. The organization also required a centralized and consolidated view of the entire operations to make faster business decisions with more insights.</p>



<p>To achieve its goals, they partnered with IBM Consulting to embark on a <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Virescent+Infrastructure+embarks+on+hybrid+cloud+journey+with+IBM+and+RISE+with+SAP+to+accelerate+sustainable+business+growth./1_omfnh6bb">hybrid cloud journey using RISE with SAP</a>, bringing in automation and improved governance across multiple levels of the organization in just seven months, thus streamlining the efforts of its employees who can now focus on core business goals.</p>



<a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Virescent+Infrastructure+embarks+on+hybrid+cloud+journey+with+IBM+and+RISE+with+SAP+to+accelerate+sustainable+business+growth./1_omfnh6bb"></a>



 Consideration 2: Business change management 



<p>Transformation is often seen as bumpy road rife with costs and business slowdowns. It doesn’t have to be that way. When designed and carried out well, a change management strategy keeps the business engaged and will mitigate the challenges with adopting the RISE framework.</p>



<p>Driven by the need to modernize processes and deliver better insights to support clients running in the cloud, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-05-11-IBM-Transforms-Business-Operations-with-the-RISE-with-SAP-Solution-in-Expanded-Partnership-with-SAP">IBM undertook its own business transformation with the RISE with SAP solution</a>. As part of their expanded partnership with SAP, IBM is migrating to SAP S/4HANA to perform work across more than 120 countries, 1,000 legal entities and numerous IBM businesses supporting software, hardware, consulting and finance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This business&nbsp;transformation will eventually move more than 300 SAP instances and consolidate 500 servers with the RISE with SAP solution on IBM Power on Red Hat Enterprise Linux on IBM Cloud.&nbsp;As a result, IBM will be positioned to provide the highest value of support and flexibility to its clients, allowing them to simplify and accelerate their business transformations while benefitting from the full value of RISE with SAP.</p>



 Consideration 3: The impact of RISE with SAP and BREAKTHROUGH with IBM for RISE with SAP on an IT Operating Model 



<p>To truly transform, companies need a holistic approach that leads to more sustainable outcomes and solutions. This is where the true value of IBM and SAP’s ecosystem partnership lies.</p>



<p>To help support clients with IT change management, SAP recruited IBM as its premium service provider for its RISE with SAP offering. The BREAKTHROUGH with IBM for RISE with SAP, Premium Supplier Option expands upon the BREAKTHROUGH with IBM portfolio of solutions, offering clients the choice of one partner—IBM—to manage everything within RISE with SAP, from software, support and infrastructure (IBM Power in IBM Cloud) to technical managed services.</p>



<p>As the first-of-its-kind business transformation as a service (BTaaS), RISE with SAP is impacting IT culture by offering companies the opportunity to holistically transform their businesses at their own speed and terms, regardless of their starting point. And BREAKTHROUGH with IBM for RISE with SAP provides the stewardship that helps clients recalibrate their IT models to maximize the value of RISE with SAP while preparing the IT organization for the possible impact to their processes.</p>

   Managing multiple tiers of identity can help boost brand management, yield security gains, and uncover revenue opportunities  

<p>Does the following sound anything like your organization? A complex, layered enterprise with many different business units (BUs). Inside these BUs are different departments. Inside of some of these departments exist different brands or products that need to be discretely managed to present unique digital experiences for customers.</p>

<p>If so, you are part of a growing cadre of organizations managing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/multi-brand">multi-brand</a> experiences.</p>

<p>Traditional approaches to identity and access management (IAM) tend to break down when faced with these types of advanced multi-brand identity hierarchies. In the following paragraphs, I’ll explain why — and what you can do to prepare your organization for next-level success</p>

 Managing identity in a multi-brand environment 

    
<p>The term "multi-brand experience" fits neatly at the intersection of IAM and customer success.</p>

<p>On the IAM side, the challenge is granting the right users (internal workforce users and end-user customers) access to the right digital properties or assets needed to do their job or to complete their purchases — and in a timely manner</p>

<p>Take internal users. If too much access is given — for example, you grant users in Brand 4 access to resources in Brand 1 — you can unnecessarily and unwittingly expose part of the business to employees who do not need those resources to do their jobs. Worse, you can potentially open up a greater footprint of your business to hackers or malicious insiders.</p>

<p>On the customer success side, knowing a user is a consumer of Brand 5 leads to all sorts of interesting possibilities for going deeper on that interaction and the customer’s user experience. You can, for example, present a highly personalized shopping experience on that preferred brand or introduce a loyalty program for users of a particular brand. You can even strategically micro-target products and services that the consumer may be interested in. Or do both, why choose? The key is all about having an elegant, frictionless experience that starts with identity</p>

<p>“Customers” can also be internal workforce users requiring access to new applications and services. Being responsive to their needs in a timely fashion is critical for maintaining a productive and satisfied workforce.</p>

 Why delegated administration has failed to address the multi-brand challenge 

<p>The way organizations have traditionally attempted to handle multi-brand experiences is through the use of groups.</p>

<p>The logic goes like this: when you onboard internal users, the admin assigns them to one or more groups. For example, one user gets assigned to human resources, another to marketing, and another to finance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Groups can cover the gambit, including location, projects, specialties, geography, and more. So, one user can be a member of the “Cleveland Plant” and another employee a member of the “Manchester Office.” Almost everyone is a member of multiple groups. Various admins (through delegated administration) then manage access to the groups, either allowing or denying the members of those groups access to various resources.</p>

<p>But then things get complicated. Companies grow, reorganize, and go through all manner of&nbsp; change over time, throwing the task of managing by groups and delegated administration into chaos. Groups are suddenly left without an admin. I have talked with customers who are managing up to 30,000 groups within their organization! Of course, nobody can actually manage 30,000 groups or do it well in any kind of fashion. What you end up with is the illusion of control without having any ability to drive the business forward.</p>

<p>The B2B2C business model (that is, business-to-business-to-customer) has moved to the fore. This means that multi-brand requirements now extend to business partners or vendors — intermediaries — who have contact with the end-user customers. Being able to control access to applications and services using this model, through the partner, and right on down to the end customer is imperative, and cannot be done effectively with groups and delegated admin</p>

 Addressing the multi-brand challenge with organizational model 

<p>A better way to manage complex hierarchical identity requirements, including B2B2C, is through the use of an organizational model</p>

<p>An organizational model is first and foremost a data model. It is a structure that mirrors the actual organization itself (hence, the term “organizational model”). Rather than diving right into the typical IAM minutia of what groups, roles, and entitlements an individual user should be assigned to (all very important, by the way), an organizational model starts at the business level. By mirroring the way your business looks and operates, this model allows you to use identity more effectively and strategically to help the organization meet its business objectives.</p>

<p>An organizational model starts with a single organization, the top tier of the hierarchy. Then other organizational units (locations, brands, sub-groups, business units) can be flexibly built, assigned, and re-assigned across the organization as circumstances change. An almost infinite number of sub-organizations can be instantiated. Administrators are then assigned to each organizational unit, with the admins above having total visibility and control of other admins and members in the sub-orgs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does an organizational model differ from delegated administration? Here are a few differences (a non-exhaustive list)</p>

  Utilization of non-technical admins – Typically, administrators need to have some IT and identity chops, or at least be part of the IT org. But with an organizational model, admins are presented with a simple portal to support access requests within their particular organization. This portal is convenient for assigning admin rights to a department owner who needs to make quick access decisions for direct reports. It also makes it possible to assign admin rights for onboarding users within a vendor, partner, or supplier. 
	 Supports full inheritance and visibility – Changes made to the top-level org, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-orgs without requiring admin intervention. This ensures that no group gets left behind, including B2B2C partners and vendors, when security decisions get made at the top. All access decisions are logged for visibility and assistance in passing audits and meeting compliance requirements down the road. 
	 Greater span of control – Who knows the access needs of users better than the application owner, business owner, or department head? An organizational model puts control into the hands of these users, while keeping IT in the driver’s seat. It can also speed decision-making.  
	 Better enforcement of least-privileged access&nbsp;– Rather than spraying broad access rights across the organization, members of each group are confined to just what is in their particular organizational area. In complex organizations with many BUs, this means reducing the surface area of a potential attack. 
	 Better support of a B2B2C model – In the past, extending access to partners and your partners’ customers was usually a one-off operation, with the necessary application sitting unmanaged within a department. With an organizational model, these projects are folded into the overall identity framework, meaning they are fully supported and secured within the same identity stack as the other users and applications.

<p>The past three months have been transformative for the IBM Ecosystem. Our investment in the ecosystem is deeper than ever before, and momentum is accelerating across all partner types as they continue to scale and innovate. This demonstrates their commitment to clients, deep expertise and hunger to collaborate and co-create with us. Thanks to each of our partners and the many IBMers working alongside them, we’ve accomplished some incredible things. Here are some key takeaways on just how far we’ve come together.</p>



 1. Programs for partners must be built with partners 



<p>The role of partnership is more important than ever today, especially when it comes to bringing client solutions to market faster. This is why we have accelerated the expansion of our ecosystem and taken major steps to make it easier for partners to work with IBM.&nbsp;Chief among these steps was the launch of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/">IBM </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/">Partner</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/partnerplus/"> Plus™</a> in January. IBM Partner Plus is the catalyst for our accelerated investment and growth in the IBM Ecosystem for 2023 and beyond.&nbsp;The program reimagines how we engage with partners by providing more access, enhanced support and benefits, and competitive incentives (whether they build, sell or service IBM technologies) across software and infrastructure. This was created for our partners, with our partners.</p>



<p>No matter a partner’s size or location, they will all experience an integrated and transparent program designed to give partners more control of their growth by deepening their technical expertise, accelerating time to market and winning with clients. For example, we are now giving our partners more expertise through skilling (providing the same training and sales enablement that IBMers have access to) at no cost to them. Gaining expertise or building solutions is core to the new program, which helps partners unlock specialized benefits and demand generation programs that offer up to a threefold increase in total investment from IBM.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Early numbers are encouraging 



<p>Part of getting “it” right for our new program was defining a focus, and our focus is our partners. To demonstrate, I want to share some highlights that have encouraged me:</p>



 
 It’s been one year since we introduced deal sharing, and since then, we have integrated partners into more than 23,000 deals valued at over USD 2.8 billion. 



 Our new skilling has created more opportunities for partners looking to grow their expertise, to the tune of almost 45,000 individuals starting their learning journey since launch. 



 We’ve also seen the addition of over 1,400 registered partners since the new program was announced. 
 



<p>These highlights are a powerful testament to the work our partners are doing to grow and create momentum for themselves and their clients.</p>



 3. This is a journey—with exciting updates along the way 



<p>This month we’re launching new parts of our program. Based on partner feedback, we’ve created a simple incentives stack across software and infrastructure that maximizes transparency and predictability. It provides a clear line of sight into how a partner’s business decisions impact the incentives they receive, including how to maximize incentives and eligibility.&nbsp;Partners can start earning in the new incentives program on day 1 of joining as an IBM partner, making it easier than ever to scale their growth. Partners can also maximize new program offerings through the new Value Seller Tool, which provides upfront discounts on infrastructure and services.</p>



<p>Partner Plus hasn’t just added to and simplified an existing partner program; it is a significant change in how we work together:</p>



 
 We’ve increased the resources supporting the IBM Ecosystem. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/qa_kate_woolley/">Last year we doubled the amount of brand-specialized resources and increased our technical resources by 35%. In January of this year, we increased resources by another 50%.</a> 



 We’ve amplified our marketing efforts by increasing the direct investments we’re making in the demand generation program campaigns and giving our partners access to our Demand Engine and our Marketing Kits. 



 The IBM Partner Portal rounds out the partner experience and is a critical tool for how we engage moving forward. Some recent updates that partners can enjoy include visibility into how they are scaling through the program tiers and access to a live dashboard that shows how much they are earning. 
 



 4. Our partners value transparency and simplicity 



<p>You’ve heard my thoughts on how the new program is coming to life, but I thought it’d be helpful to share perspectives from others in the IBM Ecosystem:</p>



<p>“IBM Partner Plus demonstrates that IBM listened to the partner experience and designed a modern program with us in mind. They are supporting partners through new avenues, such as upskilling our sales teams, increasing visibility into tier progression and earning opportunities, and providing access to new business that can help drive our growth. It’s clear that IBM is investing in its partners’ success, and I look forward to our continued work together.”</p>



<p>-Bo Gebbie, President of Evolving Solutions</p>



<p>“I believe that IBM Partner Plus, designed to help business partners to gain skills, grow faster and earn more, is a turning point in the relationship with IBM and their committed partners, like Integra … It is early still, but I believe that the new program is an important step in the IBM strategy of focusing on their ecosystem, simplifying and putting the partner as the pillar of the relationship with the customer. That’s something that partners like us were demanding from IBM.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>-Felix Gil, CEO of Grupo Integra</p>



 5. The best is yet to come 



<p>I’m really energized to share these highlights on behalf of my team. Investing in our partners’ sustained success is a priority to me, and I hope many partners will see that mirrored in IBM Partner Plus. The program is our way forward, from its interconnectivity to IBM’s company priorities, to designing it with partners in mind and partner feedback at the forefront. We are continuously updating, but I am confident that we’re on the right track and we’ve created something that will help many partners.</p>



<p>I am motivated to continue our journey and see what success we can achieve together this year. When our partners win, we win. And this is just the beginning.</p>

				  With ChatGPT 4 expanding its functionality through plugins, the emergence of AI virtual assistants capable of performing delegated tasks through text and voice input in a realistic human way is increasingly likely. In a new position paper, we look at a hypothetical “Chat Valet” booking a flight in order to illustrate why continuous verifiable identity is essential to managing the process.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The current inability to know how ChatGPT 4 formulates a specific answer to a specific question as it learns from answering questions successfully has created an outpouring of speculation as to what this all means for the future of business (the end of many jobs) to the future of humanity (the end, period).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as ChatGPT cannot give an account of its evolution in advance of evolving, we need to: anticipate how, realistically, the technology is most likely to be used in the near future, assess where problems may occur, and suggest solutions that, probably, should be adopted in advance of the problems occurring.</p>
<p>Here, the advent of plugins for ChatGPT gives us a useful prompt: If we combine the ability to “understand” text or verbal requests with a learning capacity to deliver successful responses and then add more ways to learn through plugins that <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/chatgpt-plugins-explained">expand functionality</a>, we can see how a chatbot could become a more adept <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-03/chatgpt-s-plugins-may-be-ai-s-iphone-moment-and-threat-to-google-search">virtual assistant</a> with the ability to act on its user’s behalf.</p>
<p>The following position paper explores this idea in more detail. It anticipates using a ChatGPT-like virtual assistant to book an airline flight in a fully delegated way that results in a “beautifully frictionless process.”</p>
<p>But it also imagines what “a compromised AI virtual assistant could do with access to all your accounts AND a predictive understanding of your behavior and preferences.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be able to take advantage of AI, this systemic risk needs to be addressed with some urgency; and to that end, we illustrate how open-source decentralized identity provides one way to tackle these problems. If we are to delegate tasks to an AI assistant, we need continuous, mutual verification between ourselves and the assistant. It must be able to trust that it is dealing with us as much as we must be able to trust that we, and we alone, are dealing with our assistant.</p>

  At Spruce, our core drive revolves around a world where users have full control over their identity and data in their digital interactions. What does it take to create a user-friendly "self-eject button" from applications on the internet?

<p>At Spruce, our core drive revolves around a world where users have full control over their identity and data in their digital interactions. However, this shouldn’t be at the expense of user experience in applications, or user experience around the control of said information. </p><p>To start with, let’s take a look at the web as it stands now. Current regulations governing user data protections have left us in the following state, which includes an illusion of choice - namely that one can leave, but not in any meaningful way.</p><p>For example, I can always export my data from Twitter or Google, but can I honestly do anything meaningful? I can scroll through endless machine-readable CSVs and marvel at my own witty fodder, but beyond that, there’s not much I can do with it. The goal for any system geared toward user control should be to answer the following questions:</p>  Can a user leave an app or service?  Can they have control over their information?  Can they user their information elsewhere?  <p>We believe that it all starts with a user being able to meaningfully leave a service.</p> Can I Leave an App or Service? <p><br>One of the first core tenets of user control is that, at any time, users should be able to eject from any system or application they don’t wish to use and have complete control over all of their generated data. Whether in the context of a social media platform, a banking website, or even productivity applications, the user, as the sole generator of information, should always be taken care of. </p><p>This is one of the cornerstones of the web3 movement regarding assets and identifiers. Your public key is an identifier under your control, and your on-chain activity translates across dapps.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/decentralized-identity-and-web3/">  Decentralized Identity and Web3  Decentralized identity is the continual catalyst that will unlock a new host of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Giving users control is not as easy as clicking a button to export data, as it will require various ways of representing different pieces of information that can be useful in other contexts. It will also require industry groups to coordinate and agree upon standard representations of different forms of data. Right now, the rights afforded to users mainly serve the purpose of not drawing the ire of regulators, by allowing users to export poorly formed files to let them know how they are being tracked. </p><p>Once granted control in the form of useful data exports and data custody, our goal should be to continually let users leave these existing platforms while granting the expectation that the experience will be nearly the same in a different context. </p><p>Thankfully, we’ve reached a point, especially with those working on the fediverse, web3, and more, that looks a lot like this:</p><p>Incredible steps have been taken across the space in key management, signing, and more to make this possible. We’ll always continue to commend those that came before us and those we collaborate with now on these complex problems. </p><p>However, the next step is the user experience around the control of this information.</p> Can I Have Control Over My Information?<br> <p>Now that we’ve established that the “can I leave” problem should always be answered with “yes,” the next question should be around how much control a user has over said exported information. Our goal as an organization is to never compromise on the user having the ability to take full control over their interactions but also to tip the scale in favor of user experience while we do it. Every organization philosophically aligned with this concept should be building toward this same type of outcome.</p><p><br>If a user could usefully export their data from an app or service but was limited to only using a large tech provider to continue to custody that data, then we haven’t really achieved user control and instead have just shuffled our trust assumptions. When thinking about decentralized data, it isn’t necessarily just about leaving that user at the whim of a decentralized network, but rather, giving the user control to specify where they custody their information and how they present it. </p><p>When considering this problem space, the following question should be the core litmus test of user control: can a user kick a custodian out and easily take custody of their own data? </p><p>We understand that some users will go with existing providers that they trust, but our goal is to also avoid situations where everyday users have to use complex systems to manage their own information. We want to see a world where a user can always control the governance of their data, specifying anything from a group of custodians to even the server in their basement as to where that data lives.</p><p>Additionally, as mentioned earlier, if a user were to ever self-custody their data, we want to avoid the situation where a user is forced to wrangle with a command line to get started.</p><p>And instead, have interfaces they recognize, while knowing users are storing and managing their own data:</p><p>Finally, now that we have exports that users can command, and custody users can achieve, we have to answer the final question.</p> Can I Use My Information Elsewhere?<br> <p>Finally, the last question in our for user-controlled data is, “Can a user now take this data under their control to different apps and services and use it there?” Users should be able to opt out of one service and replace it with a competitor. </p><p>This would result in a future where tech companies and services compete on user experience, rather than holding user content hostage as their primary competitive edge.</p><p>This is demonstratable in the world of social media. Content creators have built personal brand empires across social media platforms, including Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and more. These content creators are at the mercy of each independent social media platform, without a clear way to export their self-generated content, social graph, and brand relationships if one of those platforms shuts down (or becomes banned, as has recently been a concern with TikTok in the United States). This “profile hostage” situation happens across almost every service we use across the internet, but it requires a radical shift in how we collectively, across every industry, think about consumers’ relationships with companies.</p><p>This requires collaboration across public and private sectors to agree on common representations of specific data. User data could be anything from how a post is represented in the context of a user’s social graph, to even a credential linking a Twitter account to an Ethereum account. </p><p>At Spruce, we’re working on a lot of these core primitives, and want to build a world where all three questions aren’t just acknowledged, but answered.</p> <p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="https://discord.gg/spruce?ref=spruce"></a><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>

 How artificial intelligence is likely to affect the online world of crime,&nbsp;and why we must act now. 



 



<p>If history has taught us anything, it is that with every innovation and development, whether technological or otherwise, there comes a new criminal endeavour to exploit suddenly created regulatory gaps and legal loopholes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT, which seemed to appear out of nowhere from the Tech Gods at the latter end of 2022, has been met with unbridled excitement, cautious trepidation, and most recently in Italy, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">outright ban</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the weeks since the launch of ChatGPT 4.0, LinkedIn was quickly awash with ways that artificial intelligence could be used to supercharge operations; taking creativity to the next level by outsourcing the grunt work of actually doing it to AI, leaving humans with the important stuff like… erm… strategy, budget, and making a perfectly crafted coffee every time (although there are tools for those too).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media users on less business-focused platforms saw things less optimistically and stopped just short of predicting the imminent End of Days. Many argued that if we rely too heavily on artificial intelligence for creating content and take our hands off the wheel for too long, then this would weaken the argument for wrestling power back. Some even questioned whether we would even be capable after ceding generational creative control.&nbsp;</p>



 The next step in AI? 



<p>Despite such emotional public reactions, huge corporations including Apple, Microsoft, Google and HubSpot have all jumped on the ‘AI bandwagon’, or at least planning to embark very soon, and have announced that they will implement AI technology into its products in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to some tech titans and academics, however, humanity itself could be at risk if AI continues to advance too rapidly without proper and adequate guardrails. This could explain why many experts, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, are calling for a six-month ‘time out’ on the AI arms race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>AI labs [are] locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.</p><a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter</a></blockquote>



<p>They argue that rather than continue to build even more powerful AI systems, all parties should pause work on development, and instead shift focus to making systems more accurate, safe, trustworthy and loyal, while ensuring problematic forms of bias are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/31/uncovering-the-different-types-of-chatgpt-bias/?sh=4b9c53a571bb">eradicated.</a> It would also, of course, allow time for policymakers and regulators to roll out governance.</p>



 What is the AI Act? 



<p>The European Commision is the first major governing body to formally attempt to regulate AI. In its proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206">Artificial Intelligence Act</a>, it warns of the need to monitor and “curtail’ AI use in social scouting, manipulation, and some uses of facial recognition (referred to as ‘high-risk’ AI). It also mentions General Purpose AI (GPAI) large language models like ChatGPT, which have applications in a wide variety of use cases. EU lawmakers have thus proposed an amendment to the Act, which would require GPAI providers to comply with the same standards and restrictions as “high risk” AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>March 2023 also saw the release of Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Tech%20Watch%20Flash%20-%20The%20Impact%20of%20Large%20Language%20Models%20on%20Law%20Enforcement.pdf">‘ChatGPT: The impact of Large Language Models on Law Enforcement’</a> report, which detailed how artificial intelligence systems were currently being used by criminals and highlighted potential future misuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what exactly have regulators got to fear?</p>



 The corruption of innovation. 



<p>While there is clearly excitement regarding how ChatGPT can boost productivity and supercharge operations, it is only a matter of time before criminals start using AI for nefarious activities, such as fraud, impersonation and social engineering. In fact, scammers are already utilizing the powerful technology on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing">phishing</a> to churn out avalanches of fake documents (invoices, financial statements, contracts, transaction records) that are often more personalized and accurate than man-made documents (which often contain grammatical and other semantical errors). GPAI models can also be used to reproduce realistic language patterns to replicate the idiosyncrasies of individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Europol, one of the other major misuses of ChatGPT, and other artificial intelligence systems, is the potential for criminals with little technical knowledge to engage in cybercrime. This is because as well as being able to draft human-like language, AI can quickly produce (and correct) code in different programming languages. With relatively little effort, bad actors can easily create malware, malicious VBA scripts, and realistic AI chatbots that can assist in priming victims for the scammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Over the last decade, AI-powered software has achieved significant progress, taking the technology to the next level and offering increasingly robust solutions in many aspects of our daily lives. However, these advancements have also created opportunities for malicious use.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>With the rapid improvements in generative AI (a type of artificial intelligence that can create a wide variety of data, such as images, videos, audio, text, and 3D models), it is not inconceivable that we are only a few months away from scammers using AI to create realistic looking passports and official sophisticated documents in any language, with correct letterheads and security features, such as holograms at scale, within a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verifying which documents are authentic, and in the case of deepfake technology, which people are real, are likely to cause problems for companies without the most rigorous of Liveness checks and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">facial recognition technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT also poses clear concerns over data and privacy, as evidenced in March 2023, when Italian Data Protection Authority provisionally took the platform offline until it <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">“respected privacy”</a> and fixed a bug where other users’ chat history, and personal identifiable information (PII) was visible. Some major banks, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, have also broken ranks and taken steps to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/02/24/workers-chatgpt-use-restricted-at-more-banks-including-goldman-citigroup/?sh=281cac676cf4">limit staff utilizing ChatGPT</a> and similar platforms until research can be carried out on ways of ensuring “safe and effective usage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Controlling who has access to information, and whether that information is a) accurate and b) unbiased will be a top priority. Of course, this has always been a concern when using the internet, but the danger of unsubstantiated “fake news” is likely to grow exponentially alongside the increasing volume of content. For example, according to a recent ChatGPT enquiry, Aung San Suu Kyi was sanctioned by the European Union. Companies are therefore advised to not soley rely on ChatGPT for Sanctions and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> checks.</p>



 Knowledge is power: Fighting fire with fire. 



<p>There are clearly dangers when ChatGPT is in the wrong hands. However, in the right hands, AI can also be used for good, and to battle digital fraud, and other types of financial crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasing numbers of organizations, including IDnow are utilizing artificial intelligence to help digitize their Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and help to prevent fraud. Whether your business is in the Mobility, Financial Services, Gaming, or Crypto sector, if you need to onboard customers and need verify their identity, then there are major benefits of implementing an AI-enabled identity proofing service:&nbsp;</p>



  The most important step for any organization that wishes to protect its business from monetary and reputational harm is its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC process</a>. AI can help automate much of the analysis, including the processing of customer data, personal information, and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  AI can process huge swathes of information and verify customer identities, quickly, effectively, and securely. By automating tasks, bottlenecks in customer onboarding can be removed, allowing the company to scale at an unprecedented rate.  



  Check customers against sanctions and PEP lists (using a dedicated sanctions or PEP platform).<br>  Using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, AI can flag potential fraud in real-time. For example, AI can detect suspicious user behavior and alert the a platform’s security team, such as someone with the same identity using different gambling platform accounts to place bets at the same time.<br>  Multinational organizations can focus on servings its international audience, safe in the knowledge that they re compliant with complex and disparate regulatory requirements.<br>  By combining AI with anti-fraud technology, organizations can analyze vast volumes of data, including transactions, locations and times to identify suspicious patterns and activity.&nbsp;  



<p>The coming years will be crucial regarding the development, use and regulation of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Concerning KYC, the primary danger is identity theft and obfuscation. Specifically, generative models have enabled the creation of relatively user-friendly tools for generating more and more realistic attacks on both identity documents and biometric characteristics. This same technology is an important asset that we consider fighting efficiently against different kinds of fraud.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Dystopian days. Utopian bytes. 



<p>The threat posed by artificial intelligence is likely to be less Terminator, more Wall-E, so we shouldn’t necessarily be worrying about losing our clothes, boots and motorcycles, but more our creativity, autonomy and will to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, there is no putting the ChatGPT genie back in the bottle now, even if we wanted to. We must learn to live with it, and learn from it, like it learns from us. Only then will we realize its [and our] true potential.<br></p>

 🇺🇸 U.S. Department of the Treasury 



<p>On April 6th, the U.S. Department of the Treasury published <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf">a report</a> on illicit finance risk assessment conducted on DeFi.</p>



<p>The report starts off by explaining key terminology and aspects of the virtual asset market such as technical elements used in DeFi, types of DeFi services and intrinsic characteristics and levels of decentralization of DeFi services.</p>



<p>It carries on by listing facets of DeFi that attract criminals to support their activities:</p>



  DeFi services that aid Money Laundering techniques:
  DEXs and Cross-Chain Bridges 



 Mixers 



 Liquidity Pools 
  



 Move funds obtained from Ransomware attacks: 



 Steal funds by exploiting:
  vulnerabilities of smart contracts 



 low-security levels used by companies and individuals 
  



 DeFi services proved to be lucrative in committing Fraud 



 Laundering proceeds from Drug Trafficking 



 Exploiting DeFi services to sustain a flow of funds destined for financing the acquisition and development of weapons of mass destruction 
 <p>DeFi services are found to be vulnerable to criminal use mainly because a link between the individual using them and the virtual asset transactional activity cannot be made. Reasons for this are:</p>



  DeFi services are not obliged entities due to their technical nature and AML/CFT regulations do not apply to them, thus users cannot be KYC’ed. 



 Direct peer-to-peer transactions are possible as there is no need for an intermediary due to the lack of a need for an account or custodial relationship. 



 Some DeFi services fall under FATF’s definition of a VASP. Jurisdictions with gaps in their AML/CFT regime are a safe heaven for such DeFi services which have no intent to abide by AML law. Topped with the cross-border and almost instantaneous nature of VA transactions some of such services are structure from the get-go as a front for money laundering or service created to assists criminals. 



 Some DeFi services are prone to fall victim of cyber-attacks due to the lack of requirements for cybersecurity and audits in the DeFi space. 
 <p>A set of Mitigating measure for the identified vulnerabilities are laid out surrounding:</p>



  Regulatory Frameworks 



 Public<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> Blockchain </a>Transparency 



 Use of Centralized VASPs as On- and Off-Ramps 



 Other Potential Industry Solutions 
  🇦🇺 Australian Supervisory Authority revokes Binance’s license 



<p>In Australia, Binance faced a targeted review conducted by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) which resulted in its financial services license for derivatives being withdrawn on April 6th as <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-091mr-binance-australia-derivatives-afs-licence-cancelled/">related by the Authority</a>.</p>



<p>ASIC opened the investigation into Binance’s local financial services business and discovered that some retail investors were misclassified as wholesale. Oztures Trading Pty Ltd is the legal entity trading as Binance Australia Derivatives. On April 5th the Authority received a license cancel request from the entity which was accepted and will come into effect on April 14th 2023. As a result, “clients will not be able to increase derivatives positions or open new positions with Binance; Binance will require clients to close any existing derivative positions before 21 April 2023; on 21 April 2023, Binance will close any remaining open positions.”</p>

<p></p>  TBD’s pilot with Yellow Card establishes proof-of-concept to facilitate cross-border payments and fiat off-ramps to benefit the financial lives of people in the Global South  Yellow Card signs on as a launch partner for Web5 and the tbDEX liquidity network  <p>Block’s TBD, a developer platform focused on making the decentralized financial world accessible for everyone, today announced a partnership with Yellow Card to unlock a network of global fiat on- and off-ramps that bridge traditional payments rails to stablecoins and bitcoin. This partnership builds towards TBD’s vision of developing global on- and off-ramps — alongside open standards and open source technologies — with the goal of enabling the mainstream adoption of bitcoin and stablecoins in commercial and financial applications at scale. Yellow Card, which offers payments via stablecoins and bitcoin to banks and mobile money operators in 16 countries across Africa, will be one of TBD’s first partners to enable global payments and fiat off-ramps for end consumers to send U.S. dollars (USD), stablecoin, or bitcoin and receive payments in local fiat currencies.</p><p>Despite significant volume in the region, cross-border payments to and amongst countries across the continent incur fees of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2021/03/15/keep-remittances-flowing-to-africa/">nearly 10 percent on average</a> and can take several days to clear. TBD, in partnership with Yellow Card, has designed infrastructure that leverages the benefits of bitcoin and stablecoin to make cross-border payments and liquidity exchanges more accessible and affordable to the African diaspora, while designing for compliant cross border payments and fiat off-ramps. In a proof of concept that took place in March 2023, TBD and Yellow Card successfully tested payment rails from the United States to Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya, in real time.</p><p>In the background, TBD provides API(s) and developer services that abstract away the complexity and make it easy for app developers to embed functionality that enables these transactions to happen in real time for their end consumers. Senders are able to initiate a remittance in USD and their intended recipient is able to receive local fiat currency in real time into bank accounts or mobile money wallets, such as M-PESA and MTN. In the background, TBD converts the USD into bitcoin or stablecoin, and works with a network of partners to create liquidity between digital assets and local fiat currencies.</p><p>Alternatively, recipients may choose to forgo conversion into local currency and hold their value in bitcoin or USD stablecoins. This is particularly valuable if they live in regions impacted by local currency volatility or hyperinflation. When the holder of digital assets seeks to off-ramp into local currency (e.g., in order to pay rent or purchase food), TBD facilitates these exchanges via its fiat off-ramps. This process is accomplished in partnership with a value chain of regulated, compliant entities</p><p>TBD’s next goal is to establish decentralized identity, trust, and transaction protocols that enable a ubiquity of decentralized and trusted exchanges to happen, streamlining payments and commerce globally. These protocols - including <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects">Web5 and tbDEX</a> are currently under development, with releases scheduled over 2023 and 2024.</p><p>"We're thrilled to work with TBD and the Block team on tbDEX and their global payments initiatives,” said Chris Maurice, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Yellow Card. “The international payments space, especially in Africa, is in dire need of the innovative solutions we are building together, and this is the culmination of the vision behind Block’s initial investment in Yellow Card in 2021."
“We’re focused on advancing Block’s purpose of economic empowerment by breaking down the barriers to financial access across the Global South,” said Emily Chiu, TBD’s Co-Founder &amp; Chief Operating Officer. “For TBD, this starts with driving more affordable cross-border payments and commerce to bring us closer to a more efficient and inclusive global economy. Yellow Card’s shared passion and expertise across the African continent makes them a partner we’re excited to accomplish this with.”
For wallets, fintech applications or liquidity platforms looking to connect with TBD to participate in an ecosystem of global on- and off-ramps that bridge the worlds of digital assets and fiat, please contact <a href="mailto:partnerships@tbd.email">partnerships@tbd.email</a>.</p> <p>About TBD</p><p>As one of four businesses at Block (fka Square), TBD is focused on creating a decentralized future that returns ownership and control over your finances, data, and identity. Guided by this vision, TBD is building an open source developer platform and infrastructure that enables everyone to access and participate in the global economy.</p><p>About Yellow Card</p><p><a href="https://yellowcard.io/">Yellow Card</a> is the largest and only licensed cryptocurrency exchange on the African continent. Operating across 16 countries, Yellow Card offers exchange, easy cross-border payments powered by crypto, and an API suite for companies to on-and-off-ramp anyone on the continent into the crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p>We're making progress on IPVM! Learn more about our project to bring open and decentralized compute to IPFS.</p> What is IPVM? <p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a protocol and P2P file-sharing network that leverages content addressing for file identification and verification. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, is Fission's effort to bring computation to IPFS using Wasm, SPKI, and object capabilities. Furthermore, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p> How Does IPVM Work? <p>Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a>, gave an introductory presentation at IPFS Thing 2022. She explained how content-addressed data yields hashes, known as CIDs. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. This means we can compute over that data without needing a centralized server. And when combined with <a href="https://ghost.fission.codes//Wasm">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm), mobile compute even becomes possible. </p><p>And that's not all. The IPVM structure paves the way for several exciting features, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a>, allowing us to work more efficiently. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> How Does it Differ from Other Decentralized Compute Options? <p>Unlike other VMs, consensus is not required because no two machines running IPVM have to know that the other exists, which tasks they're running, or what the results were. IPVM lets the knowledge of the result of a computation propagate just to the other machines that ask for the results directly (unlike a blockchain where everyone is entirely up to date on all of the data). </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a></p>  Extends IPFS with computation  Runs anywhere, including the edge, locally, and in the browser  No consensus required  Its primary use case is running Wasm and enabling interoperable services  Asynchronous  <p><a href="https://fvm.filecoin.io/">FVM - Filecoin Virtual Machine</a></p>  Runs computations for Filecoin  It’s blockchain-based and runs to consensus  Its primary use case is smart contracts and bringing user programmability to Filecoin  Synchronous  <p><a href="https://fluence.dev/docs/learn/overview">Fluence</a></p>  Serverless platform and computing marketplace  It's blockchain-based  Runs in-browser  Off-chain compute with on-chain validation  It's not designed for large-scale data persistence  Its primary use is for data caching, indexing, processing, and querying  <p><a href="https://docs.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a></p>  Compute over Data using Docker containers and Wasm images as tasks  It's main use case is running compute over large datasets by sending most jobs to providers across the network  Can't run in-browser   What is IPVM's Current Status? <p>Since IPFS Thing 2022, Fission has been hard at work making IPVM a reality. In October of last year, we <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">updated the spec's README</a>. </p><p>In Q1, we focused on research and design and began to develop an MVP. Named <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar</a>, this open-source implementation of IPVM (and an IPVM runtime) is geared toward Wasm execution in Rust and the browser. In February, we also held a three-day in-person IPVM workshop for our working group collaborators. </p><p>Entering Q2, we're working on discovery, first-class effects, and finalizing spec-level interop with several providers. We're also spreading awareness about IPVM at conferences like IPFS Thing, Causal Islands, and CoD Summit^3.</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Speaking of conferences, Brooklyn will present IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World as part of the Decentralized Compute and AI track at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing 2023</a> and Seamless Services for an Open World at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/brooklyn-zelenka">Causal Islands</a> (Fission's first-ever conference!). </p><p>IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>Curious about the latest from the IPVM WG? This talk presents updates from the working group: a high-level overview of IPVM, standards to date, the latest roadmap, and lessons learned so far.

Thanks to new technical and social innovations, we now have the building blocks for the next generation of open services: location-free verifiable data and computation.</p><p>‍Verifiable computation opens the door to content-addressed function invocations, results, and workflows. This radically lowers the complexity of historical architectures (e.g. the LAMP stack), networked, and distributed systems. Not only is this easier to reason about, but it also (paradoxically) enables superlinear scaling: the more it gets used, the more efficient it becomes!</p><p>This talk presents UCAN Invocations and the Interplanetary VM (IPVM). Code in this model can run anywhere (even offline), respects data privacy, and services interoperate seamlessly out of the box without pre-negotiation. Since computation doesn't happen in a vacuum, we will also describe how the workflow planner interacts with existing services and how to lift them into this seamless paradigm.</p><p>Zeeshan Lakhani will also present on Homestar at IPFS Thing. </p><p>Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale with Zeeshan Lakhani</p><p>At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery (UCAN capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at runtime and aim to achieve a legitimate write once, run anywhere ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal of fault-oblivious computing.</p><p>Brooklyn and Zeeshan will present at <a href="https://www.codsummit.io/">CoD Summit^3</a> as well, with more details to come. </p> <p>If you are attending these conferences, we look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on IPVM!

<p>By Jess Turner, Executive Vice President of Global Open Banking and API at Mastercard&nbsp;</p>



<p>So much has changed over the last 20 years in payments that it’s hard to imagine the way the world used to be. A world where booking a trip or shopping for everyday needs required visiting a local travel agent or a grocery store in person, using paper currency for every transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we’ve become used to an ever-expanding menu of payment choices. Different circumstances call for different types of payments — the convenience of cards for everyday purchases and extended payment terms; bill pay and account-to-account for recurring payments; installments plans for larger purchases spread over a few months. All of these options have emerged as money has become an increasingly digital or data-driven experience, and they are only expected to become more popular in the coming years. According to the results of <a href="https://www.finicity.com/blog/five-key-trends-to-consider-when-integrating-digital-payments-into-fintech-innovations/">Mastercard’s 2022 New Payment Index Report,</a> 85% of consumers made at least one digital payment in the past year and 93% expect to in the next 12 months. Consumers are also increasingly adopting alternatives such as digital wallets (35%), digital credit or debit cards (32%) and digital money transfer apps (31%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>We all saw the impacts of COVID when we needed to be socially distanced. Electronic payments played a key role in keeping life and the economy running. Now, those digital experiences are supercharging other activities. Open banking lets people and businesses safely share their financial data with forward-thinking organizations in order to access new and improved financial experiences like digital payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going forward, consumers will likely have access to even more sophisticated payment solutions. Mastercard’s 2022 Index Report also showed that:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Nearly 60% of consumers are open to connecting their bank account to other financial services to enable automatic repayments for installment plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 More than half of consumers have already used a merchant-specific currency, including loyalty points, store credit or “in-game” money.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Younger generations are more likely to explore payments in emerging spaces – 48% of Gen Z and millennials are interested in being able to purchase virtual products in the metaverse.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The financial data that’s now delivered from open banking was historically available to the consumers themselves – on a computer screen or a paper statement – but traditionally has been cumbersome and complex to use. Yet, with open banking, consumers can now take advantage of new services that make their daily lives easier and with higher levels of safety by opting to share their data with a host of financial institutions and third parties, ranging from billers, merchants, fintechs and digital platforms.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking can help build an economy that works for everyone. Data is at the heart of every financial experience, from lending to money management to payments and beyond. It can also help the under-banked or those with thin or no credit files by providing easier access to financial data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world is still in the early days of open banking. As an industry, we’re connecting to additional financial data types (sometimes referred to as Open Finance) such as investments, retirement, payroll, and utilities. Financial institutions and fintechs are continuing to innovate financial experiences. In the ecosystem of payments, we’re dramatically expanding choices for consumers and businesses to pay or get paid how, where and when they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>As an industry, we’re increasing payment choice, but we’re also optimizing these experiences. Our Smart Payment Decisioning Tools integrate consumer-permissioned data in the account-to-account payment experience, providing billers with indicators of payment success likelihood. Then enhancing payment processing options based on factors like speed and confidence. We are working with our partners to modernizing account-based payments to provide the best outcome for consumers, banks and merchants. It can ensure a higher level of completed payments, supporting stronger impact for consumers and operational efficiencies for banks. Some of these data services are delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As open banking-enabled financial services proliferate and their use impacts our daily lives, we as consumers and businesses will expect the same security, protections, and confidence we’ve come to expect of our other financial experiences. We will also see that our ability to control and safely share our data using bank accounts, Pay-by-Bank, blockchain, cards and digital wallets will be transformational to our money experience – making it easier to understand our financial fitness and gain the insights needed to make the best financial decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To deliver on its promise, open banking requires the most advanced principles and technology in data privacy and security — to provide an easy and effective way to verify account ownership and identity. The open banking ecosystem is rapidly expanding, ushering in the next wave of systems that scale. Players with deep expertise are injecting further trust for even greater adoption. Early results indicate that we’ve got a bright future ahead – more choice in lending and payment types, more control over our financial data and more insights to help us achieve our financial goals.&nbsp; Learn more about our Mastercard Open Banking solutions for <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">payments</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/secure-account-opening/">account opening</a>.</p>

<p>After diving into the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">science of quantum computing</a> in the second episode, the Entrust Engage podcast moves toward the world of blockchain and the impact of quantum computing on it in the third episode. Providing commentary on this topic was Jon Geater, Chief Product and Technology Officer at RKVST, and Pali Surdhar, Director of Product Security at Entrust. The intersection of blockchain and quantum computing is quite fascinating, and that’s exactly what this episode explores. Here are the four key things I learned from this conversation:</p>
<p>#1: What is blockchain? </p>
<p>Before we go further into how quantum computing impacts blockchain, it’s important to have a foundational understanding of just what this technology is. As this episode explains, blockchain is ledger-based, decentralized, and built on high-integrity cryptography. It features two crucial properties: Control is spread around to a number of participants, and accountability is shared and decentralized. Built on the foundation of cryptography and fair-access principles, blockchain ensures fair access, good control, and knowledge of trustworthiness of the data.</p>
<p>#2: Is blockchain at risk from quantum computing?</p>
<p>In blockchain, the threat from quantum computing has more to do with the integrity of historic ledger records than the decryption of data. If a bad actor was able to back-date data and effectively rewrite history by leveraging quantum computing, it would break the blockchain principle of ensuring the truthfulness of data.</p>
<p>While this could be a potential vulnerability in the future, at present blockchain happens to be partially quantum-resistant already. Even if the technology were to be compromised, it could only happen at one point in time, in one place, on one computer, and in one piece of memory. And then after that, the computer must convince the other participants in the consensus that this is the correct version of history to accept. In a sense, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks has some built-in quantum resistance.</p>
<p>#3: In that case, does blockchain need to be prepared to mitigate risk?</p>
<p>There’s a significant overlap between what’s being required by regulatory bodies and the capabilities of blockchain-based architecture. Since there’s already some resistance in blockchain to quantum attacks, is there any urgency to transition to quantum-safe techniques? This can depend on the use case, but the answer is probably yes.</p>
<p>In blockchain, if the use case involves a confidentiality requirement, key exchanges are occurring, and there exists the same vulnerability as in the wider internet. Another important consideration is the data inside the blocks themselves; users need to make sure the chain references or digests can’t be faked. That’s another situation in which it is useful to have quantum-resistant algorithms deployed.</p>
<p>#4: When should blockchain prepare for the quantum threat? </p>
<p>To paraphrase our experts: Prepare now but know you’re not alone. Blockchain creates accountability for its shared infrastructure. Blockchain users would be wise to update their cryptography and transition their algorithms to <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">quantum-safe options as outlined by NIST</a>. They exist in a community; the best advice is for users to come to a consensus about protecting assets and joint histories for the road ahead.</p>

To address the network data value tree successfully, we must address the complexities of these three layers, which are essential for automated operations in telco. In the next part we will discuss the complexities of each of the layers.</p>



 Three layers of complexity 



<p>As a recap, we identified the three layers of complexity on the way towards automated operations:</p>



 
 Data Layer:&nbsp;Collecting the data and making it accessible and understandable to all interested consumers 



 Analytics Layer:&nbsp;Analyzing the data for the various Use Cases to provide actionable insights 



 Automation Layer:&nbsp;Acting upon the actionable insights in an automated way 
 



Figure 1 Three-Layered Model for Network Data Monetization



<p>The main idea behind the data layer is&nbsp;data democratization. Data democratization is based on two concepts. First, collected data should never be monopolized by the entity that collected it. Second, everyone in the CSP’s organization must be able to leverage the data,&nbsp;irrespective of their technical know-how (of course with the prerequisite that the data access policies allow the access). The analytics layer comes on top of the data layer. It is initially an empty but pluggable layer, with management capabilities, that can&nbsp;host analytics functions&nbsp;as&nbsp;data consumers&nbsp;and providers of actionable insights. Finally, the top layer is the automation layer. It hosts various functions that&nbsp;consume actionable insights&nbsp;from the analytics layer to automate operation and optimization processes in the network.</p>



 The key complexities of the network data layer: 



 
 Completeness of the data – Some networks produce so much data that often in classical systems for practical reasons many data is simply ignored. An example can be found in the Fault Management domain: if the focus is on major and critical events, warning and informational events may not be stored, while these are very useful for the prediction of major and critical events. 



 Meaning of the data&nbsp;– Network data is far more abstract than for example credit card data. The nomenclature of the data points that are produced by the network is not necessarily intuitively clear. Often there are several data points that collectively describe a specific network behavior. For example, in Radio Access Networks details about radio access bearer setup procedure are delivered over tens of different parameters. This typically requires establishing assets such as data catalogs to help data interpretation. Finally, understanding the meaning of the data is the first step in knowing if all the data relevant to an observed use case is available. 



 Volume of the data&nbsp;– Network entities produce very large amounts of data which, when collected, requires enormous storage capacities, resulting in increased energy consumption. At the same time, there is a sparse usage of data for the valuable Use Cases as not all collected data is consumed by the analytical modules. Hence, only the consumed data must be collected. Otherwise, the data layer wastes energy on collecting and storing non-consumed data, which raises serious environmental concerns. 



 Velocity&nbsp;of the data&nbsp;– Collection intervals need to be very short to meet the real-time requirements of the Use Cases. In fact, the standards for the modern state-of-the-art networks suggest 10 ms collection interval for the near-real time Use Cases. Given that the typical collection period in the legacy networks is 15 minutes (900.000 ms), data collection speed must become 90.000 times faster. And the volume of the data increases by the same factor. 



 Variety of the data&nbsp;– Millions of unique KPIs are collected in a real network as each network element produces many data points. In addition, the operators usually have network equipment from multiple vendors, each of them publishing its data points using their own nomenclature and formatting, which needs to be aligned. The challenge is to consolidate these differences such that the Data Analyst does not have to be the expert on the specifics of each vendor. 



 Selection of data for usage&nbsp;– Some network elements produce 10.000 unique KPIs and the challenge is to identify which are the one that can add value in a Use Case. 
 



 The key complexities of the analytics layer: 



 
 Complexity – Analytics use cases vary from simple KPI aggregates or threshold-based analysis to advanced AI/ML-based algorithms that predict future values of datapoints. Predictive capabilities are needed to improve quality of the services provided and enable proactive operations that are essential for achieving the stringent SLAs of the modern services such as ultra-low latency or enhanced mobile broadband. 



 Latency requirements – Analytics use cases have various latency requirements, which further impose requirements on their physical placement – some can run in the central network locations, while some require extreme data proximity to be able to analyze data in near-real time. 



 Chaining of analytics modules – Insights from one analytics module can trigger another module.&nbsp;The insights must be stamped and refer to UTC so that they are distinguishable when consumed. 



 Correlation of datapoints from different network elements – Network elements deliver services together, hence datapoints from them needs to be analyzed together. 
 



 The key complexities of the automation layer: 



 
 Automate reactions on actionable insights – The actionable insights from the analytics layer are not very useful unless we automate reactions on them. However, the main question here is how to ensure that automated responses are aligned to the operator’s operations goals. For this the set of global policies must be defined to govern the generation&nbsp;and execution&nbsp;of automated responses. 



 Conflict detection and resolution – The analytics modules may in fact send&nbsp;conflicting insights and conflicting automated reactions to the insights. This imposes the existence of the&nbsp;policy conflict management that can detect conflicts and resolve them such that the operator’s global policies are not violated. For example, energy saving automated actions may conflict with automated actions for improvement of degraded service performance. In such a scenario, the latter action must be prioritized and approved, while the former action must be denied. 
 



 Foundational and aspirational use case examples 



<p>Below are some common examples of foundational use cases:</p>



 
 Automatic root cause analysis for the Network Operations Center (NOC) 



 Energy saving in the Radio Access Network 



 Predict network outages to minimize customer impact 



 Analyze call drops in the network to find their root causes 



 Analyze cross domain impacts (core, transport, access domain) 
 



<p>While these use cases are common in demand, the implementation may be challenging.</p>



 
 Example 1: A fiber cut will cause hundreds, if not thousands of events, while the fiber itself is a passive element and does not provide any event. The fiber cut event class can be easily recognized by the sudden flood of similar events, however the determination of the fiber cut location is more complex and may require additional network topology information (Completeness of the data). 



 Example 2: A 15-minute interval may not be granular enough to detect anomalies accurately, and more granular collection intervals may not be possible due to system limitations (Velocity of the data). 



 Example 3: Syslog data is typically very voluminous, while the information contained in these messages is very cryptic and not very self-explanatory (Volume of the data and Meaning of the data). 
 



<p>Examples of aspirational use cases:</p>



 
 Analysis of potential correlations between seemingly unrelated domains 



 Analysis of traffic patterns that precede outages 



 Analysis of potential traffic redistribution possibilities for optimized resource utilization 



 Analysis how changes in user and traffic dynamics impact network’s ability to fulfill the user SLAs 
 



 How you can delivery successful network analytics projects 



<p>To deliver successful network analytics projects, it is important to focus on the value that you want to drive, while not forgetting the essential enablers.</p>



<p>Many network analytics projects struggle because of the poor accessibility and understanding of the network data by data scientist. Once the data issue has been overcome, the possible lack of automation capabilities may prevent the monetization of the insights derived.</p>



<p>A good starting point is a holistic Network Data Assessment, covering all three layers:</p>



 
 How well is network data accessible? 



 What is the network data being used for, and what other usages are not exploited? 



 How well is network data understood by people outside the network domain? 



 What types of analytics are applied on the network data to obtain insights that are valuable for your organization (and can be acted upon)? 



 What is done with these actionable insights? What level of automation is associated? 
 



<p>The IBM approach for this assessment is vendor agnostic; this means we can work with IBM Technology components, as well as with technology components from other suppliers and hyperscalers.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage">IBM Garage</a> approach can help you to optimize the value from your current capabilities. Together with your stakeholders, we can help you create the Network Data Value Tree and establish a roadmap to drive more value from your network data, addressing the complexities in each of the three layers (data, analytics and automation) at the same time in an incremental way.</p>

				 <p>DIDComm — short for Decentralized Identifier Communication —&nbsp;is a new protocol for anyone or anything with a Decentralized Identifier to communicate directly with another Decentralized Identifier — and it has the capacity to change how we interact and create digital relationships</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>DIDComm is catching on. Just like when the internet was just becoming widely available and few were even aware of it — let alone knew what to fully expect — we are seeing similar potential in the way we securely communicate digitally.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identifier Communication (DIDComm), is a method for creating a direct, encrypted line of communication between the owners of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs, are a recent W3C standard, and can be thought of as global digital addresses for identity, though they are more than that. The key point is that they are decentralized — unlike the centralized identifiers we presently use in the form of emails or user accounts with logins and passwords. In these centralized forms of identity, your data is stored and managed by a third party from whom you “lease” an identity. You don’t actually own your email address. By contrast, you do own and control your DID; you can create any number of them; they are permanent for as long as you wish, and they can refer to organizations and things as well as people.</p>
<p>Because you can prove you are the controller of a DID, digital identity no longer needs centralizing authorities to prove your identity online, a process that has proven highly susceptible to hacking, impersonation and fraud. identity has been decentralized, and in this process, many of the problems around digital privacy and security disappear because you can now use a DID to share information that is held and controlled only by you.</p>
<p>The channel that does this sharing is created by DIDComm. In short, it’s a way for the owners of DIDs to communicate directly with each other.</p>
<p>New ways to digitally interact create new kinds of digital relationships</p>
<p>Here’s what makes DIDComm powerful: It allows a mobile device to function in a way that is currently impossible — as if it had a highly secure API that it could interact with in a highly available, highly efficient way. This liberates mobile devices — and their users — to interact with servers (We explain the significance of this in greater detail in “The DIDComm Economy”). Second, DIDComm is transport agnostic, meaning communication can be through a website, email, mobile push notifications, QR codes, or a text message. Third, each owner of a DID must agree to accept a connection to enable communication along that channel. This means you will always have confidence in the identity of who you are interacting with.</p>
<p>Comparing DIDComm to the internet</p>
<p>The focus of both DIDComm and the Internet is communication and relationships. The internet enabled people anywhere in the world to interact with one another without ever needing to meet or even exchange contact information. Unfortunately, no one anticipated just how successful the Internet would become as a way of networking billions of people, companies, and entities — and why, at scale, identity verification would be essential to trusted interaction online.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials were introduced to solve this problem, allowing you to store all of your personally identifiable information locally, under your control, and to share it as you see fit to prove who you are in a decentralized, frictionless way.</p>
<p>Too often when we discuss decentralized identity the focus is on these verifiable credentials, which is not unwarranted, as they are the means by which we store and share information in verifiable ways; but it is important to remember that, just like the internet, they are a means to an end, not the end. The end is a variety of rich activities that become possible once you have created a trusted digital relationship — such as messaging, video chatting, and file sharing. DIDComm is what truly enables these end-goal activities, and while messaging is where DIDComm is finding its footing, it is useful for so much more.</p>
<p>How will it impact you and when?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been several recent events to support the idea that people are taking notice of decentralization technology, and more specifically, DIDComm. Last year, <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/w3c-launches-decentralized-identifiers-as-a-web-standard">W3C launched Decentralized Identifiers as a web standard</a>, meaning that there will be more support for the solutions across the internet, and they note that some integrations are already underway. <a href="https://www.lissi.id">Lissi</a> also <a href="https://twitter.com/lissi_id/status/1639182249475313664">recently announced</a> that they are hard at work on adding a messenger feature based on DIDComm to their digital wallet. And lastly, Indicio is also proud to say that our wallet, <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, allows for secure messaging through DIDComm. As more people become aware of what this powerful technology can provide we expect to see more solutions looking to make use of DIDComm very soon.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying this technology for yourself you can find Holdr+ in the app store now on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.indicio.holdrplus">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holdr/id1620628623">Apple Store</a>.</p>

<p>Automated operations in the modern state-of-the-art telco networks, such as 5G Core, O-RAN and SDN, all follow the same pattern. The main enabler is the entity that streamlines collection and consumption of the network state. This is Network Data and Analytics Function (NWDAF) in 5G Core, Radio Intelligent Controller (RIC) in O-RAN and SDN Controller in Software Defined Networks. Each of these entities applies a three-layered approach to network data monetization. While the functionality of these network state consumers is very similar, their implementations are different. This results in vendor specific solutions, silos per network domain, and more importantly, less opportunity to monetize the potential of network data.</p>



 Identifying the three layers of complexity 



<p>Modern telco networks produce a lot of data. Each of the above-mentioned network entities first&nbsp;collect the network data&nbsp;and exposes it to the interested network state consumers. The network state consumers are various analytical modules that may vary from a simple threshold-based algorithms that&nbsp;analyze the current network state&nbsp;to very complex AI/ML-based algorithms that&nbsp;predict the future network state. Finally, based on the insights from these algorithms different&nbsp;actions are pushed towards the network, depending on the implemented automation use cases, and thus the loop is closed.</p>



<p>Let us now take the example of a European CSP which has a lot of ideas on how to improve their network operations. They have performed many different Proof-of-Concepts, all focusing on the Analytics part of the model. The data- and automation aspects were neglected in these PoC’s, resulting in very sub-optimal results. Many use cases yielded disappointing results, due to data limitations, and when the results were good, the required automation capabilities were not (yet) available, which significantly reduced the business benefits of the use case. In one other case, an energy saving use case was not deployed, because the required policy management function was not available.</p>



<p>IBM advocates to disaggregate data and analytics functions and combine them with automation capabilities, as actionable data-driven analytical insights without automation do not bring the full business value.</p>



<p>Here we identify three layers of complexity, where each of the three proposed layers brings specific value: Data Democratization in the Data Layer, an open “plug &amp; play” AI/ML module in the Analytics Layer, and finally the ability to act directly on the actionable insights in the Automation Layer.</p>



 
 Data Layer:&nbsp;collecting the data and making it accessible and understandable to all interested consumers. 



 Analytics Layer:&nbsp;analyzing the data for the various Use Cases to provide actionable insights.&nbsp; 



 Automation Layer:&nbsp;acting upon the actionable insights in an automated way. 
 



<p>A lot of the industry hype today is around AI/ML and Automation. However, when it comes to Telco Networks the complexity of the Data layer is often overlooked.</p>



Figure 1 Three-Layered Model for Network Data Monetization



<p>Data is the new natural resource; however, this does not imply that it is easy to use and to have it monetized. To get the maximum benefit from it, the&nbsp;right&nbsp;data must be&nbsp;efficiently&nbsp;mined from its hiding places and only afterwards&nbsp;valuable insights&nbsp;can be produced out of it. In addition to this, network data is generated all the time and everybody has it – indeed, each CSP has an abundant unlimited data source that never stops. Therefore, data mining is the business of every CSP nowadays. The question is – how to ensure that your data mining is efficient and that it allows you to unlock the power of your data?</p>



 Use cases on how to get started 



<p>Automated operations opened a world of possibilities for the telco operators. The concept came at the same time as the&nbsp;necessity in the era of technological evolution&nbsp;towards disaggregation which enormously increased the complexity of modern telco network operations, but also as the&nbsp;main enabler for the continued evolution of telco services&nbsp;towards SLAs never seen before, such as ultra-low latency or enhanced mobile broadband. From today’s perspective more and more operations in telco will be automated as manual operations cannot cope with the challenges. However, it is yet not clear what are the winning use cases that will bring the best monetary values to the operators. We call this the Business Value Hypothesis. Today we can distinguish the two categories:</p>



 
 The obvious or foundational use cases where the business value hypothesis is intuitively clear. Examples of such use cases are energy saving, anomaly detection, automated root cause analysis, failure prediction. The value of these use cases has already been proven by others, the task at hand is to develop and deploy these use cases in the own environment, which may not always be easy to do. 



 The less obvious or aspirational use cases where the business value hypothesis is yet to be proven. Data can be combined from network, customer domains and call data records as well as transactions that go over the network to arrive at novel insights that are of value, e.g., unsuspected correlations. We refer here to the ideas, internal gut feelings, etc. of combining network data with other sources of data that may yield results but their exact value and monetary of achieved quality improvements has yet to be proved. 
 



<p>The above elaboration on the still existing uncertainty of the monetary values of the data-driven analytics use cases in telco underscores the need for the CSPs to host their very own&nbsp;playgrounds for analytics. In fact, CSPs need an open platform, in which they can easily develop and deploy their own analytical modules but also deploy 3rd party best of breed analytical modules, as CSPs are unlikely to create all analytical models by themselves.</p>



<p>It requires the easy access to network data in an understandable way, to avoid massive time loss in trying to find the right network data sets. Having readily available data models can reduce time and effort to implement use cases by 30 to 50%.</p>



<p>The first step towards the monetization of your Network Data is to create a Value Tree. In this process, it is necessary to recognize what are the various categories of value that can be identified and to specify these categories in more and more detail. The Network Data Value Tree is not static, it continues to evolve as new ideas emerge, and successfully implemented use cases spark new ideas.</p>



Figure 2 Network Data Value Tree Example



<p>In the analysis of which use case to develop, it is important to assess the availability of the right data, and what you want to do with results of the data analytics: what is the required automation to act upon based on these newly obtained insights. Insights that cannot be acted upon have far less value than insights that can be acted upon in an automated way.</p>

<p>At IBM, we strive each day to achieve our purpose; to be the catalyst that helps makes the world work better. We endeavor to be at the forefront of groundbreaking changes in the industries we serve and the global community at large. None of this would be possible without skilled and talented IBMers.</p>



<p>Businesses should make equity in the workplace a priority. Corporations have a vested interest in doing so because it leads to greater innovation and better outcomes for customers. Today, I want to share some examples that highlight IBM’s 2022 progress in the area of social impact.</p>



 Laying the foundation with skills 



<p>As members of a global community, we recognize the need to drive systemic change that prepares people for jobs of the future. That is why we take our commitment to providing career training, learning opportunities and career growth very seriously. Educational pathways are critical to opening windows of opportunities for all people, regardless of age or education level. In 2022, we put this into practice by supporting IBMers and our external communities with comprehensive training programs.</p>



 
 In 2022, we increased the hours of learning per employee. This year, we are working on refreshing our programs, to accelerate skill growth and bring more relevance and personalization. Through our learning resources, Your Learning and Your Career at IBM, IBMers are positioned to accelerate skill growth and gain more relevant skills to gain efficient and personalized manner. This can allow for deeper learning in less time. 



 IBM has invested in apprenticeship and new-collar programs globally. We are committed to investing $250 million by 2025 across the world. We have hired over 900 apprentices through our U.S. program, and we are bolstering the program around the world in 2023. Since the start of the IBM Apprenticeship Program, 90% of all program graduates have started full-time careers at IBM. 



 Taking our education philosophy externally, we had over 7 million learners enrolled in free IBM courses through our combined education initiatives, putting us on track to meet <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-10-13-IBM-Commits-to-Skill-30-Million-People-Globally-by-2030">our goal to skill 30 million people by 2030</a>. To achieve this, we have announced more than 250 partnerships around the world in the last two years, including collaborating with over 20 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to establish IBM Cybersecurity Leadership Centers. 
 



 Continuous investment on DEI 



<p>At IBM, we are continuously building a culture of conscious inclusion and active allyship, where every IBMer can make a positive impact on society while bringing their authentic selves to work. This culture is underpinned by strategies to reinforce our focus on improving the diverse representation of our workforce. Some examples of our work in 2022 include:</p>



 
 Championing all diverse communities of IBMers, including Women, LGBTQ+, Diverse Ability, Black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, and Veteran, and over 200 Business Resources Groups, adding 22 last year. 



 Increasing year-over-year representation across all levels for women globally, and Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Pan-Asian communities in the U.S. 



 Progressing towards our commitment to 4 million volunteer hours by 2025, with over 437,000 volunteer hours logged last year. In addition, we are ramping up our volunteerism efforts with the implementation of the new IBM Community Engagement Portal to enhance our IBMers volunteering experience. 
 



<p>We believe the strength of our workforce hinges on creating a diverse and inclusive culture. As such, we actively curate an inclusive environment that encourages learning and exploration of new ideas that foster a culture of conscious inclusion and active allyship. In addition, we build Diversity Equity and Inclusion programs to support hiring and retaining members of historically underrepresented communities. For example, the IBM Pathways program created in 2011 to increase the diversity of our technical leadership and executive teams. Also, the License to Hire, a 90-minute online training program designed to promote a more inclusive hire and selection process.</p>



 Positive impact through our suppliers 



<p>Finally, IBM requires first-tier suppliers to create and maintain a management system to address their social responsibilities within a year of starting to do business with us. In 2022, we worked with over 10,000 suppliers of hardware, software, and services, and continued to promote social responsibility among our global supply networks.</p>



<p>IBM is a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and requires our first-tier suppliers of hardware, software, and services to adhere to the <a href="https://www.responsiblebusiness.org/code-of-conduct/">RBA Code of Conduct</a>, which contains provisions on labor, health and safety, environmental requirements, ethics, and management systems. IBM helps suppliers meet our requirements by providing and facilitating education, which we regularly update.</p>



<p>Last, but not least, we recognize that having a diverse supplier base is integral to our company’s profitability and strategic objectives, and a way to cultivate new ideas. That’s why we require our first-tier suppliers to report their own diverse supplier expenditures, and we are making progress towards our commitment to have 15% of our first-tier supplier diversity spending dedicated to Black-owned businesses by 2025. By leveraging the power of people, technology, and resources, we can maximize our equitable impact worldwide.

<p>Emerging technologies and the rapid development of innovations are raising questions and challenges in today’s marketplace. At IBM, we’ve been bringing new technologies into the world responsibly and with clear purpose for more than a century.&nbsp;And we know that nobody can address these challenges alone. Along with policymakers, researchers, clients and other stakeholders, we proactively seek to understand these changing scenarios and develop technological and policy safeguards.</p>



<p>As reflected in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/2022-ibm-impact-report">IBM Impact Report</a>, we are working hard to serve as an example for our industry peers, partners, and fellow leaders on how to build a positive impact by implementing technology ethics and committing to trust and transparency in our practices and products on a global scale. Here are some of the ways IBM is working to have a lasting, positive ethical impact.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/2022-ibm-impact-report">Read the 2022 IBM Impact Report</a>



 Embedding ethics across practices 



<p>For IBM, it starts by creating a culture of ethics across the company. From our AI Ethics Board and our Trust and Transparency Principles and Pillars, to our data privacy and security efforts, we prioritize ethical and transparent practices.</p>



<p>At the center of IBM’s<a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence/ethics"> trustworthy technology</a> efforts is the AI Ethics Board, made up of a diverse set of stakeholders from across the company, brought together to make decisions based on our principles and put them into practice. This board infuses the company’s principles into business and product decision-making.</p>



<p>Moreover, another major way IBM is prioritizing tech responsibility is by applying the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/policy/trust-principles/">IBM Principles for Trust and Transparency and our pillars for trustworthy AI</a> to the products we design, develop and use. We’re also working to establish industry best practices as a member of the Data &amp; Trust Alliance, which issued useful tools and resources like the <a href="https://dataandtrustalliance.org/our-initiatives">Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for Workforce and Responsible Data &amp; AI Diligence for M&amp;A</a>. In addition, we have created tools to help ensure that AI systems are aligned with ethical principles. For instance, we have developed frameworks and products such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/practices/design-for-sustainability/">IBM Design for Sustainability</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/openpages-with-watson">IBM OpenPagesTM with Watson</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-knowledge-catalog">IBM WatsonTM Knowledge Catalog</a> and <a href="https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/factsheets-model-inventory.html?audience=wdp">IBM AI FactSheets</a>.</p>



<p>Our work also extends to our data privacy and security efforts. For example, IBM maintains a multifaceted risk-management approach to identify and help address cybersecurity risks. This includes policies and procedures upon which IBM manages its infrastructure and data, as well as assessments of technical controls and methods for identifying emerging risks. For example, our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/#search-result">IBM Data Security and Privacy Principles</a> is a comprehensive set of security and privacy commitments to our clients that considers industry standards, IBM standard practices and regulatory requirements.</p>



 Impact through others 



<p>No one can create a better future for next generations alone. That’s why IBM is going beyond our own company and enabling our ecosystem partners while advocating for policies that will set positive precedents for technology ethics and can help our society and communities thrive.</p>



<p>In 2022, we exceeded our target to train 1,000 ecosystem partners in technology ethics. Now, IBM is committing to training 1,000 technology suppliers in technology ethics by 2025. Additionally, IBM is working to engage its suppliers on sound practices, including social and environmental responsibility, ethics, and risk planning/management.</p>



<p>IBM is focused on driving this ethical impact forward even further. We engage policymakers and leaders globally to promote ideas that can help spur growth and innovation with new technologies or address societal challenges. For example, some of our advocacy highlights for 2022 include advocating for the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and supporting passage of the Cybersecurity Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act in 2022, which enables a whole-of-government approach to prepare and respond swiftly to cyber threats. These are just some examples of how IBM is working to make an ethical impact.

<p>At IBM, we have been working for many years to continually build a more environmentally sustainable future for all. This year is the 33rd consecutive time in which IBM has publicly reported its environmental performance. Since issuing its first environmental policy over 50 years ago, IBM has been committed to environmental leadership with both concrete goals and demonstrable results. Under our IBM Impact framework, we plan to continue to do this for the years to come.</p>



<p>Over time, innovation across IBM has enabled us to use evermore sophisticated solutions to help address the most complex sustainability challenges. We also know that building a more sustainable world will require strong partnerships. That’s why we are also working with partners and clients to turn sustainability ambition into action. This extends to our work with communities around the world through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a>.</p>



<p>Today, the talented people of IBM are using our cutting-edge technologies, including hybrid cloud and AI, to keep transforming not only our own operations for increased sustainability, but also the operations of our clients and partners.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">Learn more about the IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a>



 Sustainability as a consistent practice 



<p>While setting ambitious goals is important, we emphasize goals that are transparent and authentic, with near-term targets that help support present-day execution and accountability. In fact, we have comprehensive goals involving energy and climate change; conservation and biodiversity; pollution prevention and waste management; supply chain and value chain; and our own global environmental management system. Here is a snapshot of some current results:</p>



 
 We continued making progress towards our goal of net-zero operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030, underscored by energy conservation; use of renewable energy; and GHG emissions reduction.  We completed 1,455 energy conservation projects avoiding 161,000 MWh of energy consumption since 2021, on track towards our goal of 3,000 energy conservation projects avoiding 275,000 MWh by 2025.    As of year-end 2021, 64.2% of the electricity we consumed across our global operations came from renewable sources, on track towards our goal of 75% renewable by 2025.  
 
 Also through year-end 2021, we reduced operational GHG emissions by 61.6% since 2010, on track towards our goal of 65% operational GHG emissions reduction by 2025 versus 2010. In June 2023, we will publish year-end 2022 progress against our goals for GHG emissions reduction and renewable energy purchases. 
 
 



 We’re working hard to efficiently manage our facilities and buildings. That’s why in 2021 we set a goal to pursue third-party sustainability certifications for major office construction and renovation projects. Five major projects have recently earned third-party certifications and now 29 IBM-owned and leased facilities are certified to a sustainability certification program. 



 In 2022, we diverted 93.8% (by weight) of our total nonhazardous waste from landfill and incineration. We are also working to reduce the amount of diverted waste sent to waste-to-energy processes from the 11.9% achieved in 2022 to less than 10%. 



 We continually aim to reduce water consumption in water stressed regions, achieving a slight reduction during 2022 even as IBMers increasingly returned to offices. 
 



<p>These are just some examples of how IBM is setting goals and executing against them. As a company, we are constantly building solutions to help uncover new opportunities that are good for both business and the environment.</p>



 Our work with partners 



<p>In 2022, we also continued to work with partners and suppliers. IBM has long committed to using our leadership position to advocate for meaningful changes around the world, while doing business with partners and suppliers who conduct themselves with high standards of environmental responsibility. Some examples:</p>



 
 We were named technology partner of the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP27, where we showcased how our technology and expertise are helping business and government align sustainability goals to organizational objectives. 



 We continued working with The Climate Registry to support the development of the recently launched Net-Zero Portal, and the UN Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment to demonstrate how data and advanced information technology can underpin new solutions to persistent environmental problems. 



 Since 2010, IBM has required first-tier suppliers to establish their own environmental management systems, as well as set quantifiable goals in the areas of energy management, GHG emissions reduction, and waste management. In 2021, we established an additional requirement for key suppliers in GHG emissions-intensive business sectors to set goals aligned with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommendations. Through 2022, 96% of them have done so. 



 In 2022, we also held our first annual Supplier Sustainability Leadership Symposium to celebrate our suppliers’ achievements and share knowledge. It focused on energy efficiency – an area that touches all businesses and is important for mitigating GHG emissions. 
 



 Enabling others 



<p>IBM also helps its clients and partners align sustainability goals to business objectives. In 2022, we enabled others through innovative collaborations and a shared commitment to pursue a better, more sustainable, future for all. For example:</p>



 
 Companies around the world are using our technology to help scale their sustainability efforts. From establishing roadmaps to transforming their day-to-day operations, companies such as Hera, GPT Group, Downer, Bosch and Farmer Connect have relied on IBM’s capabilities to turn their sustainability ambition into action. This is because our approach operationalizes sustainability end-to-end with data-driven innovation through a comprehensive portfolio of technology, software, and consulting capabilities. 



 For instance, in 2022 IBM introduced the latest generations of its enterprise servers, IBM z16TM and IBM® LinuxONE Emperor 4. Both systems continue to improve the compute capacity per kilowatt of electricity consumed versus comparably configured previous generation systems. 



 The IBM Sustainability Software portfolio offers software tools such as Envizi, Turbonomic, Maximo, and Tririga to help operationalize sustainability by capturing, consolidating, analyzing and reporting insightful data. 



 Furthermore, in 2022, we also launched the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a pro bono social impact program that applies IBM technologies and expertise to enhance and scale solutions for nonprofit and government organizations, helping populations especially vulnerable to environmental threats. 
 



<p>These are just some examples of what IBM is presently doing to make a positive environmental impact. You can learn more about what the company is doing in pursuit of a more sustainable future in our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/2022-ibm-impact-report">IBM Impact Report 2022</a>.</p>

			<p>11th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://www.cofund.ai/">CoFund</a>, a pioneering marketplace in the field of real estate tokenization, has announced its partnership with <a href="http://www.tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform. The collaboration enables CoFund to leverage Tokeny’s innovative platform to bring institutional-grade real estate assets to the masses, issuing ERC3643 security tokens on the Polygon network.</p>
<p>CoFund is determined to establish itself as a premier marketplace for real estate tokenization by enabling a global investor base to invest in top-tier real estate assets, earn passive income, and engage in secure peer-to-peer trading on the blockchain. With a deep commitment to compliance, CoFund has chosen the ERC3643 standard for permissioned tokens.</p>
<p>CoFund’s flagship offering is a $10 million luxurious hotel situated in the heart of Bali, where investors can participate with as little as $1,000. Bali is a renowned vacation destination and a hub for tourism, with a remarkable 9.2 million international visitors in 2019, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism.</p>
<p>For decades, Bali’s thriving tourism industry has captivated millions of visitors worldwide, yet investment opportunities in this sector have been inaccessible to many. Through tokenization, CoFund allows individuals worldwide to participate in this flourishing industry.</p>
<p>CoFund’s primary focus is currently directed towards Bali. However, the company has plans to expand to other regions worldwide, enabling a greater number of investors to access a wider range of real estate investment opportunities.</p>
<p>By partnering with Tokeny, CoFund has leveraged its SaaS tokenization solution to effortlessly issue and manage security tokens, enabling fully auditable and immutable cap tables on the blockchain and providing investors with direct ownership and complete transparency. Moreover, CoFund is able to conduct real-time operations such as distributing and recovering tokens to investors with ease.</p>

		 
	 
    Our ultimate goal at CoFund has always been to democratize real estate investment by making it accessible and profitable for everyone. With Tokeny's proven platform, we can create a secure and accessible real estate investment market that meets the needs of all types of investors while ensuring compliance. This collaboration takes us one step closer to realizing our vision of a global real estate investment market that's open to all and we are extremely excited in starting our journey with the amazing island of Bali.  Giri KayogiswaraCEO CoFund       We are thrilled to be working with CoFund to help upgrade the real estate investment market. With the tokenization market accelerating, serious projects like CoFund are realizing that simple ERC20 tokens and NFTs don't meet compliance needs. Our technology platform leverages the ERC3643 token standard to ensure our partners can enforce compliance, even on a permissionless blockchain. CoFund's real estate expertise and our technical capabilities make for a powerful combination, bringing accessibility to real estate investment.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny

<p>The move towards monitoring HR tools and applications for bias is gaining traction worldwide, driven by various global and domestic data privacy laws and the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In line with this trend, the <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4344524&amp;GUID=B051915D-A9AC-451E-81F8-6596032FA3F9&amp;Options=ID%7cText%7c&amp;Search=">New York City Council has enacted new regulations</a> requiring organizations to conduct yearly bias audits on automated employment decision-making tools used by HR departments.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/new-ai-hr-talent-laws-get-the-attention-of-the-c-suite/">The new rules, which passed in December 2021 with enforcement</a>, will require organizations that use algorithmic HR tools to conduct a yearly bias audit. As per the new law, noncompliant organizations may face fines ranging from no less than USD 500 to no more than USD 1500 for each violation.</p>



<p>To prepare for this shift, some organizations are developing a yearly evaluation, mitigation, and review process. Here’s a suggestion for how that might work in practice.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/subscribe?formid=urx-51898">Read the AI governance e-book</a>



 Step one – Evaluate 



<p>To have their hiring and promotion ecosystems&nbsp; evaluated, organizations should take an active approach by educating its stakeholders on the importance of this process. A diverse evaluation team consisting of HR, Data, IT, and Legal can be crucial to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape that deals with AI. This team should become an integral part of the organization’s business processes. Their role is to evaluate the entire sourcing-to-hiring process, and examine how the organization sources, screens and hires internal and external candidates.</p>



<p>The evaluation team should assess and document each system, decision point, and vendor by the population they serve, such as hourly workers, salaried employees, different pay groups, and countries. Although some third-party vendor information may be proprietary, the evaluation team should still review these processes and establish safeguards for vendors. It is crucial that proprietary AI is transparent, and the team should work to include diversity, equity, and inclusion in the hiring process.</p>



 Step two – Impact testing 



<p>As governments around the world implement regulations regarding the use of AI and automation, organizations should evaluate and revise their processes to address compliance with new regulations. This means that processes utilizing algorithmic AI and automation should be carefully scrutinized and tested for impact according to the specific regulations in each state, city, or locality. With numerous rules varying in degree, organizations should stay informed and comply with the requirements to avoid any potential legal and ethical consequences.</p>



 Step three – Bias review 



<p>After the evaluation and impact testing are complete, the organization can start the bias audit, which should be conducted by a neutral algorithmic institute or third-party auditor and can be required by law. It is important to choose an auditor that specializes in HR or Talent and trustworthy, explainable AI, and has RAII Certification and DAA digital accreditation. Our organization is ready to assist companies in becoming data-driven and addressing compliance. If you need any help, feel free to contact us.</p>



 Data and AI governance’s role 



<p>A proper technology mix can be crucial to an effective data and AI governance strategy, with a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator/data-architecture">modern data architecture</a> such as data fabric being a key component. Policy orchestration within a data fabric architecture is an excellent tool that can simplify the complex AI audit processes. By incorporating AI audit and related processes into the governance policies of your data architecture, your organization can help gain an understanding of areas that require ongoing inspection. </p>



 What’s next? 



<p>At <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/talent-management">IBM Consulting,</a> we have been helping clients set up an evaluation process for bias and other areas. The most challenging part is setting up the initial evaluation and taking inventory of every piece of technology and each vendor the organization works with to find automation or AI. However, setting our HR clients up on a data fabric can help to make this step smoother. A data fabric architecture offers transparency into policy orchestration, automation and AI management, while monitoring user personas and machine learning models.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/nyc-puts-ai-on-notice-how-a-new-hr-regulation-in-nyc-is-impacting-global-processes/">Organizations should understand that this audit is not a one-time or isolated event</a>. It’s not just about the regulations a single city or state is enacting. These laws are part of a continuing trend of governments stepping in to mitigate bias, establish ethical AI use, make sure private data stays private, and to reduce the harm done when data is mishandled. Therefore, organizations must budget for compliance costs and assemble a cross-discipline evaluation team to develop a regular audit process.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 3rd–9th&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we focus on IOSCO’s upcoming crypto regulation consultation paper, the US Treasury’s report emphasizing AML compliance for DeFi, the Indian government’s update on crypto regulations and fraud prevention, and ECB’s Elizabeth McCaul calling for strengthening MiCA provisions.</p><p>Before we move forward, let’s pledge to safeguard the ecosystem’s true ethos amid increasing calls for regulating the nascent crypto sector. This applies to both the industry stakeholders and the regulators, as only by working together can we ensure a balanced, secure, and thriving future for the world of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Let’s collaborate and make crypto a force for&nbsp;good!</p> IOSCO to Launch Crypto Regulation Consultation in Q2&nbsp;2023 <p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) plans to release a consultation report on regulating crypto assets in Q2 2023, with the final recommendations to be published by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/AleksandarRitt4/status/1644582437832499203?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>IOSCO’s Fintech Task Force has dedicated two major workflows to decentralized assets, covering digital assets and DeFi, focusing on investor protection.</p><p>The Commission has previously published reports on DeFi, stablecoins, and influencers, recommending national regulators acquire supervisory capacities such as regulatory channels for consumer complaints and evidence-tracking processes.</p><p>The organization also urged regulators to take a granular and holistic understanding of the DeFi market to create relevant legislation. IOSCO is an association of securities and futures regulators with a board of 35 regulators and top executives, including heads of the US CFTC, the US SEC, and the UK&nbsp;FCA.</p><p>This development will likely have significant implications for crypto users and the broader ecosystem. For instance, it can increase transparency, accountability, and investor protection, which may help mitigate risks associated with fraudulent activities, scams, and market manipulation, providing a more secure environment for investors.</p><p>However, some crypto enthusiasts fear that stringent regulations could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Compliance with new rules may also impose additional costs and administrative burdens on projects and startups, potentially leading to market consolidation, with smaller players struggling to&nbsp;compete.</p><p>Ultimately, the impact of IOSCO’s recommendations on the crypto ecosystem will depend on how national regulators implement and enforce these guidelines, with the potential to either strengthen investor confidence or inadvertently limit the industry’s potential.</p> US Treasury Department Emphasizes AML Compliance for DeFi in Risk Assessment Report <p>The US Treasury Department has released a report on the risks associated with DeFi, calling for implementing AML compliance under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). While the report does not establish new supervisory expectations, it highlights that even truly decentralized services should implement AML controls under existing BSA obligations.</p><p>The Treasury underscores that all individuals or entities providing financial services are subject to the BSA and its AML regulations.</p><p>The report calls for industry input and engagement as regulators seek to build potential industry guidance on AML for DeFi. The Treasury also suggests using emerging technology solutions, such as blockchain intelligence tools, digital identity, and zero-knowledge proofs, to support compliance with AML/CFT obligations while maximizing user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>This push for compliance may also have unintended consequences for the ecosystem.</p><p>For instance, smaller players in the DeFi space may face difficulties meeting the requirements, which could lead to consolidation and decreased innovation in the market. Moreover, the added compliance costs could deter new entrants and pressure existing projects.</p><p>With the Treasury seeking industry input and engagement, the extent of these challenges will depend on how flexible and accommodating the eventual guidance is and the effectiveness of emerging technology solutions in striking the right balance between AML/CFT obligations and user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Indian Government Provides Updates on Crypto Regulation and Fraud Prevention Efforts <p>India’s Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, addressed two sets of inquiries concerning crypto in the Lok Sabha, the country’s lower house of parliament.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/business_today/status/1503921022986514432?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The first set asked whether the government planned to legalize crypto and what impact it would have on the common people, to which the minister responded that crypto is currently unregulated. Any legislation for regulation or banning would require significant international collaboration.</p><p>Regarding crypto-related fraud, the minister said they are dealt with under existing laws against fraud and cybercrime, and he added that the Ministry of Home Affairs had launched a portal for the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Moreover, the Enforcement Directorate has been investigating cases related to crypto assets under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Foreign Exchange Management Act.</p> ECB Official Calls for Stronger Crypto Asset Safeguards <p>European Central Bank (ECB) supervisory board member Elizabeth McCaul has said that the European Union’s proposed regulations for crypto assets are insufficient and that safeguards need to be strengthened to address the risks involved.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1644325011107266561?s=20">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>The Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) bill, set to be voted on by the European Parliament later this month, is an important milestone but is not enough on its own, McCaul said in a blog&nbsp;post.</blockquote><p>She suggested that significant crypto-asset service providers should be subject to both stricter requirements and enhanced supervision and that new quantitative metrics are needed to consider the type of business.</p><p>McCaul also argued that thresholds needed to be measured at the group level rather than at the individual entity level to address the complexity of operations.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule: Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">The Block Perspective: European Crypto Regulatory Climate and its Impact on Crypto Ecosystem — March&nbsp;2023</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

We're exploring the future of computing with experts in AI, programming language theory, computational media arts, and more.</p> Causal Islands: The Origin Story <p>Fission co-founders Boris and Brooklyn have been working together for quite a while on computing, distributed systems, and encryption in an effort to create developer tools that make building applications more accessible.</p><p>After attending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6fvZA0L-ok&amp;list=PLFkGFMxuCsI2hwxF0TjUVGq-iLmn3MkIb">BlueYard's EthCC side event</a> in 2022, they were inspired by the speakers and attendees who brought their diverse research interests and areas of expertise into the conversation. They realized that being able to connect with folks outside of their regular circle was invaluable, and decided that they wanted to hold a conference of their own. One where everyone could learn from each other and share their knowledge while working on the future of computing. </p><p>The name "Causal Islands" comes from physics. It refers to how information traveling at the speed of light hits a physical limit. In our distributed systems, we experience this physical limit as latency - a function of our proximity to data centers and the quality of our connectivity. Brooklyn has used this concept in several of her talks to highlight how edge compute plays a part in reducing latency.</p><p>As we thought about it, it seemed like a good metaphor: we can think of us as all existing on our own islands of information: building our tech stacks and pursuing research into different areas of the future of computing, each in our own direction.</p><p>The Causal Islands conference is designed to bring together and engage everyone interested in the future of computing, both to share what they're working on, and to learn and be inspired by cross-disciplinary approaches on other islands of focus.</p><p>Now that you know the origin and purpose of the conference, let's jump into some frequently asked questions!</p> Who is behind Causal Islands? <p><a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a> created Causal Islands with the generous support of <a href="https://www.blueyard.com/">BlueYard Capital</a> and <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>.

<p>Our founders attended the inaugural <a href="https://www.apacdigitalid.org/">APAC Digital Identity unConference</a> that took place in Bangkok, Thailand. It was an exciting one as expected that aimed to promote innovation and collaboration among new digital identity businesses and initiatives in the APAC region. Open Space <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unConferences</a> is a participatory event where attendees co-create the agenda together live each day of the event. The focus is on discussing the subject with professional colleagues from a variety of identification sectors, there are no keynotes or&nbsp;panels.</p><blockquote>Secure and interoperable identity is necessary for engaging with people to benefit on the problems in today’s world such as tracking trade, supporting labour markets, and crossing borders for a variety of reasons. Significant investments have been made into the development of interoperable standards, protocols, systems application layers, conceptual use cases, and more.<br>APAC Digital unConference is one such newly initiated forum where people from the region have a platform come together, brainstorm on such problems to find solutions to with the emerging trends &amp; technologies and most importantly, to collaborate — eventually, get benefitted.</blockquote> People behind the idea — unConference - <p>The people behind the idea of the APAC Digital Identity unConference are passionate professionals who believe in the importance of digital identity and its impact on society. The Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>) had a major inspiration for the APAC Digital Identity Conference. The APAC event was organised and hosted by the two IIW facilitators and producers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young (Identity Woman)</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-nobantu-saul-0291941/">Heidi Nobantu Saul</a>, in partnership with a nearby business, Newlogic. IIW is being facilitated &amp; organised since year 2005 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Phil Windley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/docsearls/">Doc Searls</a> besides these two veterans.</p><p>The opportunity was to conduct an event for the APAC region in the same Open Space unConference style as the Internet Identity Workshop.</p> The new way of ‘Being Involved’! - <p>The new way of being involved is what makes the unConference unique. Unlike traditional conferences where attendees sit through pre-planned sessions, the unConference is a participant-driven event that empowers the attendees to take ownership of the agenda. It is a platform to share knowledge, ideas, and best practices in an open manner. All the sessions were led by experts in the field and moderated by volunteers from the community. The unConference is an event where the participants have the freedom to create their own agenda and ask questions, connect with others, and contribute to the conversation.</p> Glimpses of the topics covered&nbsp;- <p>The sessions were highly interactive, and participants had the opportunity to exchange answers to questions and get feedback.</p><p>Glimpses of the topics covered at the UnConference:</p><p>Day 1, Thursday, March 02,&nbsp;2023:</p>  Standards for Distributed ID for&nbsp;Asia  Sri Lanka Digital&nbsp;ID  Open Discussion: Navigating, Recognition Across&nbsp;Borders  What Constitutes Indigenous ID in SSI Approaches  Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF) Ecosystem  Pictures as Identifiers  How Cloud Wallet could act as a bridge in the SSI&nbsp;space  DCDR — Data-Centric Digital&nbsp;Rights  Singpass — Singapore’s National Digital&nbsp;ID  “Not QR” Codes + Civil Registration + Vital Statistics  <p>Day 2, Friday, March 03,&nbsp;2023:</p>  (ToIP) Digital Trust Ecosystems  Identity &amp; Domain&nbsp;Names  Whiteboard Session: Elements That Make APAC Trust Framework  Building Open Source Communities + New&nbsp;Ideas  Verifiable Identity: Social Media — “The Bali Process”&nbsp;Context  Blue Economy and Regional paperless trade  NFTs as an Identifier — Pro’s Con’s Is it worth&nbsp;it?  Verifiable Credentials — Exchange Protocol and Wallet Interaction   Key Takeaways - <p>There have been several key takeaways from the unConference. However, some of the key ones include&nbsp;-</p><p>1. There was a unanimous vote to have APAC level collaboration to draft a APAC Digital ID Trust Framework. This group can have the participants of the working group shared diverse operating realities, their learnings and interests in building a coherent method to trust each other’s <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital identity systems</a>. As a key conclusion on this, it was agreed to house meetings for this group under one of the Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) working&nbsp;groups.</p><p>2. It was encouraging to see that a few countries in the APAC have already embarked on the journey of building Digital Identities infrastructure for the nationwide benefit of its citizens. Couple of the examples were&nbsp;-</p>  Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of <a href="https://www.dhi.bt/">Druk Holding and Investments Limited</a> (DHI) — Bhutan’s investment arm, updated about Bhutan just launched a new national digital ID system (NDI). Bhutan NDI is Bhutan’s new National Identity System, developed by Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) for GovTech Bhutan. The NDI will have citizens eight years old and above enrolled into it. Apart from the ID card, the NDI wallet will carry other information including health, tax filings, education and census records as well as revenue and bank statements, and business documents.  Singapore (they are implementing <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/">SingPass</a>). The representatives from the Singapore government who attended the unConference stated that with SingPass, the citizens can access over 2,500+ services by over 800+ government agencies and businesses at their fingertips  Sri Lanka government also leveraged an India based open source platform, MOSIP, to implement Digital identity management for its citizens.  <p>3. Decentralised Identity Foundation (<a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>) and Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) are the forums where most of the innovation is happening — innovation in terms of tech stack&nbsp;, frameworks, libraries and standards for Decentralised Identity, Trust Frameworks, Governance Frameworks, Trust Ecosystems, et. al. It was an opportunity for the first time attendees of such Digital Identity unConference to get first hand update about these two&nbsp;forums.</p><p>4. We urged the facilitators that the next APAC event should be hosted in India. Considering the vast diversified demography spawning across technology enthusiasts to unicorns to startups to government representatives to people from all walks of life, there will potentially be a huge attendance for the&nbsp;event</p> Benefit to participate in future&nbsp;- <p>Everyone should participate in the UnConference, especially those who are interested in digital identity, including individuals, practitioners, researchers, regulators, implementers, government leaders, technologists, digital and privacy rights activists. The UnConference is an excellent opportunity where individuals representing various standards, initiatives, and businesses can congregate, exchange knowledge, form relationships, and advance the&nbsp;cause</p> Proud Sponsors&nbsp;- <p>AyanWorks was honoured to be one of the sponsors of the inaugural APAC Digital Identity unConference. Companies that sponsored the event besides <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a> included <a href="https://gluu.org/">gluu</a>, <a href="https://newlogic.com/">Newlogic</a> and <a href="https://opendevelopmentmekong.net/">Open Development Initiative</a>. Over the past 4 years, AyanWorks has been working in the core <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">Decentralised Identity solutions</a> space and delivering solutions to our global clients. With this experience at our strength, we strongly believe that such events are essential to bring awareness, do more evangelising and move forward in the new digital era followed by innovation, building digital identity infrastructure and developing secure, dependable digital identification ecosystems.</p> Summing it&nbsp;up! <p>To summarise, the APAC Digital Identity unConference is a great place to network, learn, and add to the conversation about digital identities. We invite everyone to take part in upcoming activities, all future APAC Digital Identity unConferences and keep promoting innovation in the Digital Identity&nbsp;space.</p><p>See you all in the next such event in APAC.. hopefully in India&nbsp;🙂!!</p>

</p><p>Blockchain technology offers huge benefits – decentralization, transparent interaction, high levels of security, and immutable record keeping. It has enabled a thriving crypto ecosystem to grow and support continuous technological innovation. However, one of the main problems with many blockchain networks is their scalability. Scaling is an issue when the amount of data passing through the blockchain hits a limit due to the insufficient capacities of the blockchain.</p>



<p>In an ideal case, a blockchain would be able to process countless transactions per second, also known as throughput or with the acronym TPS. However, the Bitcoin main chain can only handle about 3-7 TPS. By comparison, Visa can process more than 20,000 TPS using the VisaNet centralized electronic payment network. The difference is in the level of decentralization and privacy that Bitcoin and other blockchains aim to provide.</p>



<p>Similarly, Ethereum is coming to a point where it faces scalability challenges. As of summer 2022, Ethereum is processing an estimated 500,000 transactions per day, which equates to 30 transactions per second. By comparison, Visa's payment system can process up to 150 million transactions per day and 65,000 transactions per second. This far exceeds the processing power of Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 is expecting it to increase to 20,000-100,000 transactions per second however it will take few years to reach that maximum capacity.</p>



 What Are Layer-2 Scaling Solutions? 



<p>Layer 2 refers to secondary frameworks or protocols that build on top of existing blockchain systems. The main purpose of these protocols is to solve the transaction speed and scaling problems faced by major cryptocurrency networks. It not only reduces workload on main net, but maintains the same security and decentralization standards as the underlying blockchain.</p>



 Layer-1 v/s Layer-2 Blockchains 



<p>Layer 1 blockchain refers to the underlying blockchain network architecture and protocols that serve as the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based use cases. It is the core layer of a blockchain system and consists of the basic building blocks that enable data storage, transaction processing, and consensus mechanisms.</p>



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions are technologies that build on top of existing layer 1 blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, to increase their scalability and efficiency. Layer 2 solutions allow for off-chain processing of transactions, which helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its scalability.</p>



<p>One of the key differences between layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain technology is scalability. Layer 1 blockchain networks have limited transaction processing capacity, which can result in slow processing times and high fees during periods of high demand. Layer 2 solutions address this issue by reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its capacity.</p>



 Advantages of layer 2 blockchain solutions 



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages, including:</p>



 
 Scalability: Layer 2 solutions can help increase the transaction processing capacity of existing blockchain networks, making them more scalable and able to handle higher volumes of transactions. By offloading transactions from the main blockchain, layer 2 solutions can reduce congestion and increase throughput. 
 



 
 Speed: By processing transactions off-chain, layer 2 solutions can significantly reduce transaction processing times, resulting in faster and more efficient transactions. 



 Lower fees: Layer 2 solutions can help reduce the fees associated with blockchain transactions by reducing the workload on the main blockchain and reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on it. 



 Improved privacy: Layer 2 solutions can enable privacy-preserving transactions by using techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and state channels to keep transaction data off the main blockchain. 



 Interoperability: Layer 2 solutions can enable interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing for the seamless movement of assets and data between them. 



 Flexibility: Layer 2 solutions can be tailored to specific use cases and can be designed to work with a variety of blockchain networks, making them a flexible and versatile solution. 
 



<p>Overall, layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages over traditional layer 1 blockchain networks, including improved scalability, speed, privacy, and interoperability, making them an essential component of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 What Types of Layer-2 Solutions Out There? 



<p>There are several types of Layer 2 scaling solutions, each with its own approach to increasing the scalability of blockchain networks. Here are some of the most common types of Layer 2 solutions:</p>



 
 State Channels 



 Plasma 



 Rollups 
 



 State channels blockchain solution 



<p>State channels are a layer 2 blockchain solution that allows for off-chain transactions between two parties. State channels enable fast and cheap transactions by keeping most of the transaction data off the main blockchain.</p>



<p>Projects - Lightning Network, Celer Network, Trinity</p>



<p>Here's how state channels work:</p>



 
 Two parties create a contract that defines the rules of their transaction. 



 They deposit their cryptocurrency into a shared channel, which is a smart contract on the blockchain. 



 They then conduct their transactions off-chain, using the rules defined in the contract. 



 Once they are finished, they close the channel and settle their balances on the main blockchain. 
 



<p>State channels are useful for microtransactions, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive. They can also be used for real-time, interactive transactions, such as online gaming or instant messaging.</p>



 Plasma layer 2 solution 



<p>Plasma is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon in 2017. The goal of Plasma is to enable the Ethereum network to process a large number of transactions, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plasma chain projects- Polygon, Loom Network</p>



<p>Here's how Plasma works:</p>



 
 A smart contract is created on the Ethereum network that serves as the root chain. 



 Child chains, also known as Plasma chains, are created off of the root chain. These Plasma chains are fully functional blockchains with their own validators, but they are connected to the Ethereum network. 



 Transactions on the Plasma chains are processed off-chain, and are only submitted to the Ethereum network when a block is finalized. 



 The finality of blocks on the Plasma chains is enforced by the root chain, which acts as a final arbiter for any disputes that arise. 
 



<p>Plasma is useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. It can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main Ethereum network would be prohibitive.</p>



 Rollups 



<p>Blockchain rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that aim to improve the scalability of blockchain networks by grouping multiple transactions together before submitting them to the main blockchain for verification. There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups, which assume that most transactions are valid and only require minimal verification, and ZK-rollups, which use zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions off-chain before submitting them to the main chain.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Optimistic Rollups 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution for blockchain networks that offer several advantages over traditional on-chain transactions. Here's how they work:</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then validated by a small group of validators who check for fraudulent or invalid transactions. 



 Once the batch is confirmed, it is sent to the main blockchain and added to the ledger. 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are useful for applications that require high transaction throughput, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. They are also ideal for micropayments, where the transaction cost on the main blockchain would be prohibitively expensive.</p>



<p>Optimism and Arbitrum are popular optimistic rollup projects</p>



 
 Zero-Knowledge Rollups 
 



<p>Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups) are a layer 2 blockchain solution that enables fast and efficient transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain network.</p>



<p>Projects- Minaprotocol, immutableX, loopring, ZK Sync</p>



<p>Here's how ZK Rollups work:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then verified using zero-knowledge proofs, which enable the network to verify the transactions without revealing any of the transaction data. 



 The verified batches are then submitted to the main blockchain, where they are added to the ledger. 
 



<p>&nbsp;ZK Rollups are useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. They can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive.</p>



<p>To sum up, the implementation of layer 2 scaling solutions is paramount in overcoming the scalability and usability limitations of blockchain technology. These solutions allow for increased transaction throughput, decreased fees, and enhanced functionality, all while maintaining the security and decentralized nature of blockchains. As more projects adopt layer 2 technologies, we can anticipate remarkable progress in the blockchain industry, along with the emergence of fresh use cases for decentralized applications.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our upcoming articles, where we will dive deeper into various layer 2 projects and provide detailed insights into their technical details, advantages, limitations, and potential use cases.&nbsp; Whether you are a blockchain enthusiast, developer, or investor, our articles will provide valuable insights into the latest developments in blockchain scaling solutions. </p>

<p>Cyberattacks continue to increase at an alarming rate, and many security breaches can be traced back to an authentication issue. Whether a password or a password plus an additional authentication factor, attackers are adept at bypassing them at scale. For example, over 100 million multi-factor authentication (MFA) attacks <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/Ways-to-overcome-multifactor-authentication-vulnerabilities">were recorded in Q1 2022</a>, whereas such attacks were virtually non-existent in 2019.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Just this month, law enforcement agencies in Europe and the U.S. announced the seizure of a major online <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation">marketplace that offered over 80 million stolen login credentials</a>, giving cybercriminals access to accounts in the financial sector, critical infrastructure, and government agencies, among others. This hasn’t put them out of business, however, as the group’s admins announced the marketplace would soon be available <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seizes-stolen-credentials-market-genesis-in-operation-cookie-monster/">through other channels</a>.</p> 
<p>The pressure on security teams is showing no signs of abating, and against that backdrop, we compiled our <a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless Security report</a> for a third consecutive year. For this report, we asked 1,000 IT/IS security decision-makers from around the world about the state of cybersecurity in their organization and where passwordless security currently fits into their defense strategy.&nbsp;</p> 
 Authentication Is Still Highly Vulnerable  
<p>As has been the case in our <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-state-of-passwordless-security-in-2022ss-security">previous two reports</a>, authentication remains the greatest weakness in enterprise cybersecurity. Of the professionals we interviewed, 60% said their organizations had suffered breaches through authentication-based attacks across the last 12 months. These breaches can then be used as launchpads for further attacks, such as ransomware or data theft.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ability of attackers to automate phishing processes, including buying easy-to-deploy kits on the dark web, make any authentication process featuring passwords and other shared secrets high-risk. This ease of access means that even low-skilled attackers can launch successful assaults on major corporations. However, despite these clear and obvious risks, most organizations don’t make any changes to their authentication processes after a successful attack. Even worse, a majority still deploy passwords in some form, with 57% using the most basic username and password combos for some systems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Since credential theft is still the easiest and most successful method for attackers, major industry groups and the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">federal government</a> have advised organizations to deploy phishing-resistant, passwordless methods.&nbsp;</p> 
 Global Cyber Defenses: New Avenues of Attack  
<p>Virtually every organization has suffered some form of cyberattack over the last year. The main vectors for these attacks are common threats such as phishing and ransomware, but one, in particular, has shown noticeable growth. Nearly 30% of organizations were hit by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a>, which have more than doubled their prevalence since the 2022 report (12%).&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This increase relates to how organizations have tried to counter their greatest cybersecurity weakness (passwords) with multi-factor authentication. MFA requires a user to authenticate themselves using two or more factors based on knowledge (i.e., password or PIN), possession (i.e., device or hardware security key) or inherence (i.e., fingerprints or face scans).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the general acknowledgement that passwords are easily phished or cracked, MFA in the form of a password plus an additional factor, has been widely considered a possible solution. However, as our report shows, this has not proven to be an effective security measure. For example, attackers can bypass push notification MFA by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">spamming users with push requests</a>, aka MFA prompt bombing, hoping the user will accept.&nbsp;</p> 
 Passwordless Security: A Multi-Problem Solution  
<p>The most tangible consequences of authentication-originated breaches are monetary, costing organizations an average of $2.95 million annually. This doesn’t factor in the longer-term financial impacts of losing business to rivals and reputational damage.</p> 
<p><a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report"></a></p> 
<p>The problems with passwords, however, extend beyond their serious security implications. From a user-experience perspective, passwords are the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">root cause of significant frustration</a>. Our report reveals that 81% of respondents experienced occasions where they could not access critical information because they’d forgotten a password. Along with the time spent logging in with passwords, password resets and account lockouts significantly impact employee productivity and, consequently, their bottom line.</p> 
<p>The costs are also very real at the IT support desk. Our report uncovered some thought-provoking insights into how much upholding password-based authentication costs organizations yearly. Enterprises spend 32% of their IT helpdesk budget on password-related issues, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-much-does-a-password-reset-cost">such as resets</a>. This equates to $465,645 annually, or $375 per employee per year, wasted on password issues.</p> 
<p>While passwordless security has its own implementation costs, it is generally far cheaper than maintaining password-based systems.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Short-Term Future of Passwordless Security  
<p>Despite the clear and obvious problems using passwords causes on an annual basis, many organizations have yet to adopt full passwordless security. Even though the security leaders interviewed were almost unanimous in their belief in passwordless security benefits, organizations still face significant obstacles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These obstacles range from fears around integration with their current technology stack to lacking the internal knowledge to implement a new system, to general misunderstandings of what exactly constitutes phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA. Only 3% of organizations that state they use passwordless solutions are using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. This means that 97%&nbsp;of the “passwordless” solutions deployed are susceptible to phishing and push attacks.</p> 
<p>Our State of Passwordless Security Report 2023 gives an in-depth insight into exactly how much authentication weaknesses are costing organizations every year. We also look at the global state of passwordless security and how organizations respond to the biggest threats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As soon as the Biden administration released its new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a>&nbsp;on March 1, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/about">Hyperledger Foundation</a>&nbsp;responded with this truth bomb:&nbsp;Open source&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity technology</a>&nbsp;will not only achieve the strategy’s goals, it’s available right now.</p>



<p>It’s an opinion we wholeheartedly applaud.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a>&nbsp;centres on this theme: “We must&nbsp;ensure the Internet remains open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure — anchored in universal values that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/03/13/the-role-of-decentralized-identity-in-implementing-the-white-house-national-cybersecurity-strategy">statement</a>&nbsp;responding to the strategy, Heather Dahl, Hyperledger Foundation governing board member and Indicio CEO, pointed out that the problems the strategy is addressing don’t require a “moonshot to solve” because they have been “a central concern among open-source technology communities like those at the Hyperledger Foundation for many years. And they—we—have found solutions.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl explained:</p>



<p>“Decentralized identity has provided a way to provide a verification layer for digital interaction; we have ways to prove who we are and know who we are interacting with; we have ways for people to hold their data and share it in a way that preserves their privacy.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to overstate the importance of the next point: These aren’t paper solutions or future ware; industries are leading the adoption of this technology. The prospect of secure, seamless travel—which would take a passenger from online check in to boarding, through border control, and all the way to unlocking their hotel room—is driving the creation of a verifiable digital travel credential.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl drew on examples in decentralized identity applications from&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/about/">Indicio</a>, the company she heads up, which span “everything from employee identification to auditing devices monitoring emissions to tracking supply chains. We’ve used Hyperledger Foundation technologies to develop verifiable credentials that manage financial transactions, from passwordless proof of account ownership to reusable KYC.”</p>



<p>Importantly, Ms Dahl said the solutions are ready and universally available: “The future is happening now. And because so much of this work has been built on open source codebases (meaning many developers, companies, and even governments passionate about the technology have contributed code), the future is available to everyone.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl specifically called out&nbsp;Strategic Objective 4.5 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in which the White House notes “the human cost of inaction and inertia” as being data breaches that affected nearly 300 million people in 2021 alone and which stem from the lack of secure digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She welcomes the Federal Government’s desire to “encourage and enable investments in strong, verifiable digital identity solutions that promote security, accessibility and interoperability, financial and social inclusion, consumer privacy, and economic growth,” saying:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the remarkable things we have seen with open source verifiable digital identity is that it has been embraced by businesses and governments alike: everyone who sees the technology in action immediately sees how it is the building block for digital transformation: a way to upgrade web2 and tangible infrastructure for creating web3. With verifiable credentials, anything can be given an identity and that identity and the data associated with it can be verified seamlessly. Decentralized Ecosystem Governance — a machine-readable way of managing roles, rules, and trust within a verifiable identity ecosystem — solves the problem of governance, elegantly.</p>



<p>The ability to implement seamless verification transforms every aspect of digital interaction. If you can trust the data, you can devise processes, products, and services that are frictionless and trustworthy, whether it be proving you own a bank account or want to share your health records or cross a border. Again, this is already happening.”</p>



<p>Read Anonyome Labs’ co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley’s explanation of why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials are the “killer feature of DI.”</a></p>



<p>The Hyperledger Foundation is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation. Anonyome Labs is an active member of the Hyperledger Foundation and has been contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community for some time. Hyperledger hosts the decentralized identity based Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa projects and Anonyome Labs contributes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent (ACA-PY)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">aries-vcx</a>&nbsp;projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See all the additional ways Anonyome Labs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">actively contributes to decentralized identity development</a>.</p>



<p>Clearly, we agree with Ms Dahl’s commentary on the new national cybersecurity strategy finding its legs in decentralized identity, so we’ll leave you with her final quote: “As the White House and the Federal Government move forward, we hope they will recognize the enormous progress that has been made, that the moonshot worked, and now we’re ready for the stars.”</p>

 In this vlog, 1Kosmos VP of Product Marketing, Robert MacDonald, is joined by our VP of Product Management, Javed Shah, and our Marketing Manager, Abigail Edwards, to discuss their experience at Gartner IAM. 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 Abigail:<p></p>
 
<p>Gartner IAM. Woo woo. What a good time.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>It’s a great time. It’s always a great time.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>It is fun. We have fun.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Hello.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I’m going to ask you some questions about it.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>All right, fire away.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I mean, to start, what’s Gartner IAM ?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Well, from my perspective, I’ll let Javed talk from PMA side, but from a PMM side, it’s the preeminent identity and access management event that happens every year. So if you want to know what’s going on in the IAM space and what the trends are, what the emerging technologies are, where the market industry is going, you go to this event. And it’s been like that since I’ve entered the IAM space about 20 years ago. It’s also a good opportunity for me to go check out and see what some of my competitors are doing.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Like Rob said, yes, absolutely. It’s a gathering place, annual gathering place of all things identity. Identity professionals, vendors, customers, and of course analysts. It’s also a place to discover stuff. There’s a lot of discovery going on every single day. And I think as much as we are learning from what the analysts are thinking about their research, I believe that the analysts are learning from us as well. Especially the one-on-one sessions where you put an arcane requirement from a bunch of customers you heard about in front of an analyst, you put them in a deep think mode, right? So it’s really useful. And it obviously works the other way where the analyst will drop some piece of information. This quote comes to mind, “You’re either orchestrating or you’re being orchestrated.” Remarkable in my opinion because that’s kind of the drift we’ve been on here at 1Kosmos for a while now, really trying to make things easier and add value on top of passwordless, add security to passwordless. So really important Session held once a year.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We liked Texas. Texas was Fun.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>And now it’s going to be in Texas apparently. So used to the Vegas life-</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>And we had a booth.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>But that’s history. All good.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We had a booth.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>We loved Texas, yeah.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We had great conversations and engagement, but why and where does 1Kosmos fit into this event?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, it’s a good question. Again, from my perspective, and Javed, you may have a different one. But there’s a lot of trends that are taking place within our industry right now. One of those is passwordless, right? And another one is actually identity verification, funny enough. How to prove an identity online. And being that we play in both of those spaces and is really the only vendor to bring both of those capabilities together, we fit into that space quite nicely. If we look at just a lot of the conversations, Abigail, you were in the booth. When we talked about what we did, it aligned very well to what customers were trying to solve. Especially when we brought into the fact that they came in looking for passwordless.</p>
<p>We say, “Oh, by the way we do that is building a verified identity so you can ensure you know the user behind the device.” And at the end of the day, that’s what people are trying to do. There’s lots of technologies that are laying on top to try to make that happen, but at the end of the day, what we bring to the table is a concept of, and it’s one of the things that Akif talked about, is this concept of identity plus selfie. Is it identity plus selfie? ID plus selfie, yeah, thank you. To ensure you know who that user is by the device. So if you combine the identity, I did it again, the ID plus selfie, you end up on a path that puts you in a position of security that hasn’t been available until 1Kosmos, to be frank.</p>
<p>And when customers see it, and this event for us was better than the last time we were there because the market continues to evolve and people are starting to understand what we’re doing. It’s a very interesting conversation and one in which we are leading the conversation in, which is also fun. We had a couple of people show up at our booth because of Javed, talked about meeting with the analysts, they met with a couple of analysts. They’re looking to do some specific things and they left that meeting and came directly to our booth to learn more because we’re the only ones that can do an IAL or AAL level two certified authentication. Nobody else can do that. We’re the only ones that can do that. So it’s a very different conversation for us than I think it is from some of the other people that are attending that show. Right Javed? What do you think?</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely, we have to be there. We’re going to educate the market about how to do Passwordless correctly, Passwordless securely. We are the only NIST certified IAL2 authenticator on the planet. We have to be there. We are the ones who are helping educate the market. The analysts are learning from us and they’re kind of repeating a little bit of our sentiment now. It has picked up that construct of ID plus selfie, it’s something we’ve been saying for four years now. It’s been on our website for three years now.</p>
<p>You do passwordless because you know who the person is, not who the device is. That’s the right way to do passwordless. Every other exhibitor in the passwordless space prefers to use final authentication, bring a device. Well, we demonstrated we could use seven touch IDs on one phone to unlock a demo. That’s not knowing the identity to open the demo. That’s knowing the device and that’s a shared device. That’s not how we do it. So I think it’s really important for us to be there and for this, I guess, dissemination of information that we are very good at. And I think the market’s really not very good at it yet because it’s still learning.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>Love that. What would you say in terms of all these conversations that happened in our booth, did anything throw you off? Any questions or unique conversations that really stuck, that felt different than our typical conversations at these types of events?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>For me, the big one, as I mentioned, we had an organization come straight to our booth after talking with one of the analysts. They were curious about what a digital identity wallet was. “Tell me about how that works.” And that’s not typically a question we get. Normally it’s like, “Tell me how you do passwordless.” Or, “Tell me how you do identity verification.” But the concept of an identity wallet may not be new. The way in which we deliver it, certainly is. And they were interested in the way we bring all of that together.</p>
<p>How do we build that wallet? What’s behind it? What’s the supporting technologies for us to make that work? The fact that we can support the concept of bring your own identity was a very hot button for them. And they spent about an hour in our booth learning more about our technology and how all of this stuff comes together. And that conversation didn’t happen the last time we were at this show because customers just didn’t quite understand it. But the market is moving such that it’s evolving so quickly that we’re starting to have those conversations now. That’s a big one for me.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, and I would agree obviously, and for me it was interesting. Folks are showing up at these events. The IRS was there, Costco was there, so many different large companies. Navy Federal was there. Folks are taking a look at what they’ve been doing for the last 20, 30 years, which has been the paper-based onboarding of new hires, whether they’re full-time or they are contractors. It’s interesting how they are suddenly looking to digitize everything as if that’s going to be possible. But there is this impossible dream. Everyone comes up in shows, “Well, my help desk receives a phone call. Can you digitize that for me? I do this manually and it’s a process. Can you digitize that for me?” Those are impossible problems to solve as the technology in the phones and the onboard biometrics with your laptops and all. The state-of-the-art doesn’t support the impossible use cases, but folks are asking the question anyway, and I think that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad thing just because it’s an impossible or a difficult problem to solve, doesn’t make it a bad thing. It means that there are discussions happening behind closed doors and the doors have opened. Now those discussions are in our booths, and I think that’s where you tend to get that expansion of that circle, that knowledge domain, which is just starting to happen. I did not get questions like that in the last Gartner event, but this time around there were questions like that, and of course there were difficult answers to those and sometimes there was comfortable silence as well. Where everybody realized, “Well, I just asked an impossible question,” but they’re there. They have your number and I feel that can lead to only good things. So that was kind of a standup for me because it was different.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I mean, great conversations, unique questions. What overall, sessions, booth, other vendors being there, the analysts that were present, the attendees walking around, what are your overall thoughts of how this event went?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Well, again, for me, this is the first event I’ve been to since, not that I want to say that word again, but COVID, right? It’s the first time that I’ve been on a show floor in three years almost. So it was good just to get back out and meet people face-to-face. Not to mention, I mean, listen, this is a very small space. It’s fun to see past coworkers and past customers that you’ve worked at or with at other companies that you may have been part of. But at the end of the day, there’s always takeaways. There’s always things that you’re going to learn.</p>
<p>And this event is absolutely no exception to that. And it’s a very beneficial show if you can get there. There are lots of things that you are going to learn no matter how experienced you are. There’s always going to be something that is going to make you stop and think about whatever you just saw, watched, heard, whatever that might be. It’s always a great event. There’s always things that I’m learning, whether it be from customers or from analysts or even some of the other vendors around the show floor, but it’s always a very good event and always a very good time. Always time very well invested going to it.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>It was good to catch up with friends from, what, 20 years? Folks still in the business. You enter this industry, you don’t leave it because it’s the identity business, as we said in the session, we are truly the only providers of our own identity. Hopefully people are starting to learn that, understand that. That’s been our value prop for nearly half a decade now. The analysts are starting to speak what we are speaking and imagine meeting all of those individuals, those folks at the same place. I was quite pleased with the venue, to be honest. I was not sure what to expect after Vegas.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, I was too.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>But it was good.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>I think it’s better than Vegas, personally.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I liked it. At the Gaylord in Grapevine.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Yep.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p><br>
Identifiers are a crucial part of our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have both private and public identifiers. On the private side, examples include Social Security numbers and Driver’s Licence numbers, and there are many private or closed identity systems that manage private identifiers for us. Sometimes, they give us these identifiers in the form of cards or tokens. On the public side, we use public identifiers every day, such as Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, Domain Names, and Usernames.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these identifiers, both private and public, are created and managed by central authorities, such as governments, financial institutions, telcos, email providers, domain name registrars and most service providers. This centralization means that we don’t really have ownership and control over our identifiers or identities, leaving them vulnerable to fraud and misuse.</p>
<blockquote><p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/J1AQUlvdz4I?t=2043">podcast episode 45</a>, Drummond Reed makes the point that the email address is still the most widely used identifier, but the most valuable for newer systems and where the Social Web is going is your mobile phone number. The mobile phone number is the most valuable identifier on the dark web because, with mobile phone number portability, it’s your address across multiple systems. It’s also the one you’re likely to hold on to because it’s a pain to change it. Some people have more than one, but a lot of folks only have one of those, whereas it’s very common for us to have multiple email addresses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before recording this podcast, I watched a presentation called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/809258916/92b420d98a">AI Dilemma.</a> The presentation was made by some of the same people who created the <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">Social Dilemma</a> documentary on Netflix. In this presentation, they talked about how content-based authentication is dead. With certain advances in AI, deep fakes can be done so easily through both voice and video. You could perfectly mimic someone’s voice with just three seconds of audio, which is kind of scary. It made me think about all these telephone scams that happen and how it’s going to become easier and easier to scam people.</p>
<p>How can we better authenticate things in a world where identity takeovers continue rising, and spoofing is becoming practically impossible to detect? Unpacking identifiers is a good place to start.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a>, or a new way of managing our identities could be an example of something that could help solve these problems. There’s a growing need for decentralized identifiers that put ownership and control back into the hands of individuals, enabling secure/private/confidential conversations, interactions and relationships.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 An overview of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) – how DIDs came about, their history and evolution. 
 The core properties of DIDs – what sets them apart from other types of identifiers. 
 DID Methods. As of this post, there are 160+ DID Methods listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">this registry</a>. Are they all decentralized? Why are there so many? What are some popular ones that have been adopted? 
 What things to consider in your selection criteria for the right DID Method(s). 
 When would one use DIDs for abstraction purposes vs vanilla public-key cryptography? 
 DID Documents – what can be stored in them? How are they linked to a DID? What are some examples of things you can store in the authentication and service endpoints. How do you interact with them? 
 Using blockchain vs non-blockchain (e.g., DNS server) implementations for storing DID Documents. What are some key elements to take into consideration when looking at these different options? 
 Do DIDs disrupt or enhance existing certificate business models? 
 The power of DID Resolution – how has it evolved, how does it work? (see video ⬇️ for a great explainer)

<p>Fission can't wait to return to IPFS Thing. We're presenting nine talks and will share progress on some of our most anticipated projects, including IPVM, RhizomeDB, and a Passkeys + UCAN integration.</p> What is IPFS Thing? <p><a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing</a> is a week-long gathering for the IPFS implementors community featuring talks, workshops, discussion circles, hacking time, and more.</p><p>Last year the conference was held in Reykjavik, Iceland. Here's a quick recap:</p>IPFS Thing 2022 Recap<p>Fission attended in 2022 and gave four talks about our work in the IPFS ecosystem. You can watch a playlist of those talks here (click the image to navigate to the playlist):</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey9Np7ZYwDjA32w5of3JWKId"></a>A Playlist of Fission's 2022 IPFS Thing Talks (CLICK TO PLAY) Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 <p>This year IPFS Thing will be held in Brussels, Belgium, April 15-19, and Fission is thrilled to return for another year. We look forward to connecting and collaborating with many innovators in the space and are incredibly honored to be giving nine(!) talks throughout the week. </p><p>Here are the talk abstracts:</p> Interplanetary Databases Track <p>Querying Decentralized Data in Rhizomatic Systems with Quinn Wilton</p><p>Shifting storage and compute toward the far edge reflects an extreme departure from traditional cloud-based architectures, bringing with that shift a new set of challenges for application developers. Rhizome is a decentralized database for InterPlanetary Linked Data that embraces these challenges to open up new ways of thinking about consistency, interoperability, and privacy. This talk introduces the ideas underpinning Rhizome, and demonstrates how they come together to empower developers to build and reason about new types of peer-to-peer and decentralized applications.</p> Data Transfer Track <p>CAR Mirror Reflections with James Walker</p><p>CAR Mirror describes a method for efficiently diffing, deduplicating, packaging, and transmitting IPLD data from source to sink. In this talk, there will be an introduction to the CAR Mirror protocol followed by a review of the current state of the Go implementation.</p><p>Data Transfer Batching Techniques Featuring Blake3, CAR Mirror, and More with Phillip Krüger</p><p>Batching block transfer is the main way to optimize DAG exchange compared to bitswap. This talk discusses current proposals for batched data transfer, such as blake3 with bao, sending CAR files, CAR mirror, and GraphSync. We’ll look at what use cases they do and don’t solve and which techniques from one protocol could be applied in others.</p> IPFS On The Web Track <p>The Name Name Service – Discoverable, Verifiable Names for Decentralized Infrastructures with Blaine Cook</p><p>NNS is a new approach to providing distributed discovery for human-readable names. NNS builds upon DIDs and UCANs to allow permissionless delegation and service discovery, emphasizing improving end-user UX for IPFS and related services. This talk will overview the approach, discuss use cases, and explore anticipated challenges.</p><p>WNFS: Versioned and Encrypted Data on IPFS with Phillip Krüger</p><p>The WebNative File System (WNFS) empowers users with extensible metadata, file and directory history, conflict resolution, and encryption with fine-grained access levels. We show a rough outline of its design goals, how it works, our roadmap, and possibly a demo of our new Rust implementation.</p> Integrating IPFS Track <p>Decentralizing Auth, and UCAN Too with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>UCAN is a decentralized auth format used by several DWeb, web3, and IPFS projects. Much like how IPFS uses content addressing to liberate data from centralized hosts, UCAN uses CIDs and OCAP to liberate apps from centralized auth servers. Learn how UCAN can help throughout the IPFS stack, from block-level access to user permissions to application interop.</p> Community &amp; Governance Track <p>Starmaps: A Cross-Team Roadmapping Tool with Bastien Dehaynin</p><p>I would like to share Starmaps, a tool Protocol Labs developed for roadmapping based on Github issues. It is especially good for rendering cross-teams/projects roadmaps, which is perfect for improving visibility inside the network and communicating dependencies more easily. We have started using it at Fission, and our goal is to have as many PLN projects as possible rendered in a single Starmap where you can navigate and look at the dependencies between projects. </p> Decentralized Compute &amp; AI Track <p>IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>Curious about the latest from the IPVM WG? This talk presents updates from the working group: a high-level overview of IPVM, standards to date, the latest roadmap, and lessons learned so far. This includes invocation and workflow models, a (pluggable) effect system, a principled approach to partial failure, open interop, kernel functionality, private data handling, and the most common question: what IPVM is *not*!</p><p>Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale with Zeeshan Lakhani</p><p>At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery (UCAN capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at runtime and aim to achieve a legitimate write once, run anywhere ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal of fault-oblivious computing. </p> UCANs + Passkeys <p>In addition to these exciting talks, our newest Fissioneer, <a href="https://twitter.com/hugomrdias">Hugo Dias</a>, will offer demos of a prototype he built that uses a combination of Passkeys and UCANs to authenticate users signing into Webnative apps. </p><p>As you know, we at Fission love <a href="https://webnative.dev/">passwordless authentication</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Passkeys</a> are a fantastic opportunity to onboard more users into apps without them needing to create a password, Ethereum wallet, or use a browser extension. Currently, Passkeys work best for Web2 use cases because they need to connect a server and the user's device for validation purposes. However, we want a local-first solution - one that is native to the browser. </p><p>That's where UCANs come in! UCANs can act as a source of truth for authorization, where servers would typically come into play. To utilize UCANs and have decentralized auth, you need a DID and a private key. Passkeys can use face scanning, fingerprint touch, or hardware authenticators to seed DIDs and cryptographic signatures. This is what we're working on implementing at Fission.</p><p>If you want to see Hugo's demo, find him at IPFS Thing!</p> Stay Informed <p><a href="https://lu.ma/ipfsthing2023">In-person tickets</a> are still available for IPFS Thing 2023, but if you can't make it to Brussels, don't worry! All talks will be recorded, and we will be sure to share them on the blog (with a deeper dive into each talk) when available.</p><p>On that note, be sure to <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/">subscribe to our newsletter</a> so you can receive our blog posts and Fission news directly in your inbox.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, check out our previous update here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-developer-update-29/">  Spruce Developer Update #29  At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything), is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Currently, we're working on adding support for working with user-controlled data in SSX. If you're curious about this work, message us in our Discord! We hope to have more announcements about changes to the library later this quarter.   We released a new package supporting Auth.js, NextAuth's spiritual successor. We've also updated our tutorials to reflect the new changes and plan on creating additional guides around its usage (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/76?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #76</a>).  We've added an update to revalidate sessions when users change accounts using their wallet to ensure that the currently selected wallet is attempting to establish a session with a given application (<a>ssx #88</a>).  We've pushed numerous fixes to our Gnosis Safe login extension, including a fix for the modal flashing when there's no active delegation for a multisig, a fix for the SSX instance freezing if the modal is closed during the sign-in process, and some additional housekeeping (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/98?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #98</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/100?ref=blog.spruceid.com">100</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/103?ref=blog.spruceid.com">103</a>).  Additionally, we've added a fix for any login failures if <code>resolveEns</code> is set to <code>true</code> and a user is on a network that isn't supported by ENS (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/102?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #102</a>).  We've added callbacks on SSX server middleware routes to increase flexibility for executing additional code during the authentication process &nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/105?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #105</a>).  Finally, we made several additions and updates to our documentation and a few fixes for our end-to-end tests for the library.   <p>We would also like to thank everyone who beta-tested SSX Quest, a credential issuer built on SSX and Kepler during ETHDenver. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/plant-a-tree-and-control-your-data-with-ssx-at-ethdenver/">  Plant a Tree and Control Your Data with SSX At ETHDenver  We’re happy to announce that we are demoing an app called SSX Quest that shows how Sign-In with Ethereum can extend user control into interactions with user-controlled data, beyond just identity.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>We're happy to announce that we'll be planting 100 trees for all the folks who obtained and presented credentials within the application. To learn more about SSX Quest, check out the article above. </p> Sign-In with Ethereum Core Libraries <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-integrates-sign-in-with-ethereum-into-metamask-for-better-user-experience-and-safety/">  Spruce Integrates Sign-In with Ethereum Into MetaMask for Better User Experience and Safety  We’re now happy to announce a significant step forward in Sign-In with Ethereum adoption with a direct integration into MetaMask.  SpruceSam Gbafa    </a>  We're extremely excited to announce our collaboration with MetaMask to bring native Sign-In with Ethereum support to the MetaMask extension wallet! Now, when a user signs in with Ethereum using MetaMask, they will be presented with a neatly formatted "sign-in" request along with domain binding which protects users from phishing attacks. For more information on this integration, check out the article above.   We're in the process of making numerous updates and security improvements to our <code>siwe</code> core TypeScript library. Stay tuned for more information on these changes.   The ReCap specification (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ERC-5573</a>) has been updated to reflect new developments in the distributed capabilities space (EIPs <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6654?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#6654</a>, siwe-recap <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-recap/pull/14?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#14</a>), bringing it in line with the UCAN specification to enable integration between SIWE-based applications and applications using UCANs and CACAOs.   Kepler <p><br>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your existing keys.</p>  CORS support has been improved and made configurable via a simple boolean, making testing and deployment easier for those not using a load balancer (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/138?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#138</a>)  We're currently working on replication in Kepler and configurable storage limits in orbits. If you're curious about our work on Kepler, please reach out to the team.    SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims at describing both the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  We are currently working on TreeLDR being able to define a trait definition for each RDF class (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/124?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #124</a>).    Rebase   In Rebase, we've now added PRs for a finalized version of flows for credentials that attest ownership of NFTs and POAPs (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/53?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #53</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/54?ref=blog.spruceid.com">54</a>).   Additionally, we've added several PRs that simplify integration times, and we're currently adding TypeScript bindings to its client for a much better developer experience in the frontend (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/56?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #56</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/57?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#57</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/58?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#58</a>).   <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web. Spruce provides an ecosystem of open-source tools and products for developers that let users collect their data in one place they control, and show their cards however they want.</p><p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="https://discord.gg/spruce?ref=spruce"></a>

  The FATF Travel Rule raises privacy and data protection concerns, as it mandates VASPs to share sensitive user information while facilitating crypto transactions.  Adhering to the FATF Travel Rule while maintaining data privacy requires a fully automated and P2P-enabled Travel Rule Solution, such as Shyft Veriscope.  The FATF insists that widespread international adoption of the Travel Rule is crucial for mitigating risks and achieving uniformity in combating fraud, illegal transfers, and illicit crypto&nbsp;trails.  <p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule is a global regulatory requirement for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to collect and transmit customer information during cryptocurrency transactions. It aims to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by increasing transparency and accountability in digital asset transfers.</p><p>While the FATF Travel Rule is touted as essential in promoting financial integrity and preventing illicit activities in the crypto space, it also raises concerns about privacy and data protection in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>Therefore, balancing the need for financial security with the right to privacy and data protection in implementing the FATF Travel Rule is&nbsp;crucial.</p><p>VASPs must take measures to ensure that the information collected and transmitted is secure and only used for its intended purpose. Likewise, when providing guidelines, regulators must implement measures to safeguard personal&nbsp;data.</p> Here’s What we are covering&nbsp;today:   The FATF Travel Rule and Personal Information  Types of Personal Information Collected Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule  Risk of Personal Information Exposure  Compliance Challenges for&nbsp;VASPs  Technical Challenges in Implementing the Travel&nbsp;Rule  Balancing Compliance With Privacy Requirements  Jurisdictional Differences in Privacy and Data Protection  Challenges in Harmonizing Global Compliance Efforts  Shyft Veriscope: Fully Automated &amp; P2P Data Transfers  <p>Let’s not wait any further and take a deeper look into what the FATF Travel Rule is all about and its implications on the ecosystem’s future!</p> The FATF Travel Rule and Personal Information <p>In order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, the FATF Travel Rule imposes transparency and accountability measures on digital asset transfers, requiring VASPs to handle sensitive personal data. This information, however, could be targeted by hackers and cybercriminals. Therefore, it is essential to rigorously assess the types of personal data collected and the risks involved.</p> Types of Personal Information Collected Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Under the FATF Travel Rule, VASPs are required to collect and transmit originator and beneficiary personal information and their transaction details.</p><p>And although the information that VASPs collect helps authorities track the flow of funds and detect suspicious activities, collecting and transmitting sensitive personal information could also pose significant risks to individuals’ privacy and data protection. In the next section, we will explore these risks in more&nbsp;detail.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Anwered</a></p> Risk of Personal Information Exposure <p>The collection and transmission of personal information under the FATF Travel Rule come with inherent risks to individuals’ privacy and data protection, such as data breaches, hacking incidents, unauthorized access, and data&nbsp;misuse.</p><p>Data breaches and hacking incidents are among the most significant risks associated with collecting personal information by VASPs, as cybercriminals could hack into the VASPs’ systems and steal personal information. This can put the originator and beneficiary at risk of identity theft and financial fraud.</p><p>Another risk is the unauthorized access and misuse of data by VASPs’ employees or third-party service providers. To prevent that from happening, VASPs must ensure that only authorized personnel have access to personal information and that it is only used for its intended purpose. If VASPs fail to do so, their users’ personal information could be misused or sold to third parties, leading to a breach of trust and potential harm to individuals.</p><p>Moreover, the collection and transmission of personal information by VASPs could lead to the centralization of personal data. This could make it easier for governments and law enforcement agencies to conduct surveillance on individuals, violating their privacy and data protection rights.</p> Compliance Challenges for&nbsp;VASPs <p>VASPs face numerous compliance challenges when complying with the regulatory requirement while safeguarding individuals’ personal&nbsp;data.</p> Technical Challenges in Complying With the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>The most significant challenge while complying with the FATF Travel Rule is interoperability, as it mandates VASPs to transmit customer information. To achieve this, VASPs must ensure their Travel Rule Solution can communicate seamlessly with the counterparty VASPs’ systems. However, this is easier said than done, as there are no standardized protocols or formats for transmitting customer information.</p><p>Another big technical challenge is the secure transmission and storage of customer information. VASPs must ensure that customer information is transmitted and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access or misuse. This requires robust security measures, such as encryption and multi-factor authentication, to protect customer information from cyber-attacks and data breaches.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs must comply with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to safeguard customer information. This includes ensuring that customers have control over their personal data and that VASPs do not share their data with third parties without their explicit&nbsp;consent.</p><p>Not to mention, it can be costly and resource-intensive for VASPs, particularly for smaller or less established firms. They may need to invest in new technology, hire additional staff, or seek external support to ensure compliance.</p> Balancing Compliance With Privacy Requirements <p>While VASPs are required to comply with the Travel Rule’s regulatory requirement to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, at the same time, they need to adhere to global data protection regulations and respect individuals’ privacy&nbsp;rights.</p><p>These global data protection regulations include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and more. These regulations require VASPs to obtain customers’ explicit consent before collecting their personal information, ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date, and provide customers with control over their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Achieving a balance in collecting customer information while preserving their privacy requires implementing robust security measures and privacy-focused technologies to safeguard personal data and prevent unauthorized access or misuse. This also requires VASPs to work with regulators to ensure compliance with the Travel Rule does not violate individuals’ privacy&nbsp;rights.</p><p>In the following table, we compare the different factors affecting FATF Travel Rule compliance and privacy/data protection laws in general, shedding light on the complexities VASPs face while striking a right balance between the&nbsp;two.</p> Jurisdictional Differences in Privacy and Data Protection <p>The challenge to balance Travel Rule compliance and data protection laws is compounded when dealing with different laws across jurisdictions.</p><p>When it comes to data protection regulations across countries and regions, the GDPR in the European Union (EU) and the CCPA in the US are the most prominent ones.</p><p>The EU’s GDPR is among the most comprehensive and stringent data protection regulations globally. It applies to all companies processing the personal data of EU residents, regardless of their location, and requires companies to obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their personal information.</p><p>Meanwhile, the CCPA is another comprehensive data protection regulation that applies to companies operating in California. The CCPA grants California residents the right to know what personal information businesses collect about them, the right to request that their information be deleted, and the right to opt out of the sale of their information.</p><p>Other countries and regions also have their own data protection regulations, such as the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore and the Privacy Act in Canada. These regulations may differ in their scope, requirements, and penalties for non-compliance, creating additional compliance challenges for businesses operating globally.</p> Challenges in Harmonizing Global Compliance Efforts <p>As we discussed above, there are varying data protection regulations across countries and regions. This can create significant compliance challenges for businesses due to differences in cultural norms, legal frameworks, and technological capabilities. Further, it creates challenges for cross-border data transfers and the enforcement of data protection requirements, making it difficult to harmonize global compliance efforts.</p><p>Cross-border data transfers are particularly challenging as data protection regulations may vary significantly between countries, making it difficult to ensure that personal data is adequately protected when transferred between jurisdictions.</p><p>For example, the GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries that do not have adequate data protection regulations in place. This can create compliance challenges for companies that operate in multiple jurisdictions and must transfer personal data between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Enforcement of data protection requirements is another challenge in harmonizing global compliance efforts. Different countries have different enforcement mechanisms, ranging from government regulators to private lawsuits. This can create confusion and uncertainty for businesses operating across different jurisdictions, as they may face different penalties and consequences for non-compliance.</p><p>Furthermore, data breaches can occur in any jurisdiction, and companies may face legal and reputational consequences from regulators and customers in multiple jurisdictions. This creates a complex legal landscape for businesses to navigate, as they must comply with the data protection requirements of multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>To address these challenges, businesses must adopt a proactive privacy and data protection approach that considers each jurisdiction’s unique requirements. This may involve implementing robust data protection measures, conducting regular privacy assessments, and working with legal experts to navigate the complex legal landscape of data protection regulations.</p> Shyft Veriscope: Fully Automated &amp; P2P Travel Rule Data Transfers <p>To protect user experience and privacy while complying with the Travel Rule, VASPs have the opportunity to use Shyft Veriscope — the only frictionless Travel Rule Solution.</p><p>Even Ironman recommends the Shyft Veriscope.

<p>A well-designed data architecture should support business intelligence and analysis, automation, and AI—all of which can help organizations to quickly seize market opportunities, build customer value, drive major efficiencies, and respond to risks such as supply chain disruptions. A well-designed data foundation can also be a game-changer when it comes to managing ESG (environmental, social, and governance) commitments. Fortunately, business benefits and ESG benefits are not mutually exclusive: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/sustainability-transformation">sustainability efforts can help boost business value</a> for organizations that are committed and effective in execution.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/the-data-differentiator">Explore the Data Differentiator, a guide for data leaders</a>



 Integrating data and using insights to help drive environmental initiatives 



<p>Having fact-based data can help with understanding performance and measuring progress against broad-based ESG goals; insights generated from this data can help organizations further their ESG programs as well as drive operational efficiency; and credible environmental reporting should be supported by factual data. To further the above, organizations should have the right foundation that consists of a modern data governance approach and data architecture. By implementing a modern data architecture, you can set your organization up to gain insights quickly since users have self-service access to data relevant to their roles regardless of where it resides.</p>



<p>Once you have identified your data requirements, you might need to acquire data from various operational systems and applications, integrate them and organize them for easy access by stakeholders across your organizations. These stakeholders may include real estate, finance, HR, and procurement teams as well as the sustainability team. Everyone would be using the same data set to make informed decisions which may range from goal setting to prioritizing investments in sustainability.</p>



 Supporting the increasingly important social and governance pillars 



<p>Certain reporting obligations bridge organizational risk and human impact and are thus classified under the social pillar of ESG. As AI may inform more and more decisions within HR such as hiring, evaluation and promotion, an organization’s need to respond to new and expanding regulation will increasingly intersect with its need to address ESG standards.</p>



<p>It’s becoming critical that organizations should adopt a data architecture that <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/journey-to-ai/2022/09/from-principles-to-actions-building-a-holistic-approach-to-ai-governance/">supports AI governance</a>. That is, it should support both sound <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">data governance</a>—such as allowing access only by authorized processes and stakeholders—and provide oversight into the use and trustworthiness of AI through transparency and explainability. The approach should be designed to provide enough metadata that key HR decision makers can identify which processes and decisions are informed by AI while maintaining anonymity and privacy in the data itself. Using an architecture like data fabric can enhance an organization’s ability in key governance and oversight areas, while building a company’s ability to understand and manage many forms of risk.</p>



 How a data fabric architecture can support ESG efforts 



<p>Delivering on ESG initiatives can be enhanced by a data architecture that supports gathering, integrating, and standardizing data from a variety of sources and making it available to a wide variety of organizational stakeholders. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/journey-to-ai/2022/03/what-is-a-data-fabric-architecture/">data fabric is an architectural approach</a> designed to simplify data access to facilitate self-service data consumption at scale. Data fabric can help model, integrate and query data sources, build data pipelines, integrate data in near real-time, and run AI-driven applications. This architecture can also deliver reliable data through enhanced data observability and steward data quality by automating tasks across data platforms using machine learning. Given the wide scope of ESG data elements that encompasses so many departments in a company and extends to its partner and supplier ecosystem, a data fabric can help accomplish governance, integration, and data queries and insights at scale.</p>



<p>Reporting on all three pillars of ESG should begin with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/DNPZ0JLZ">evaluating your framework</a> and the kinds of data needed to be included to support a credible and transparent disclosure report. The simplified data access that comes with a data fabric architecture can make it easier for teams to both evaluate and update their ESG reporting framework and to efficiently deliver upon a report.</p>



 In conclusion 



<p>Many successful organizations have long depended on fact-based, consistent, unified data to drive growth, manage costs, and optimize resource allocation. A similar correlation holds true in leveraging data to drive leadership performance in the ESG areas. A modern data fabric architecture can help tackle organizational challenges around capturing, accessing, and operationalizing this data for calculation of impacts in all three pillars of an ESG reporting. This data foundation is crucial for truly effective ESG strategies that can help boost business value and manage evolving sustainability regulations around the globe. Important stakeholders such as employees, business partners, investors, customers and government regulators are all expecting ESG programmatic progress and accurate reporting. The time for data professionals to meet this challenge is now.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dr. Kendall Mao and I am the Chief Scientist for Ontology.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am very interested in cryptography and I also play basketball and football, among other sports. I had two pets when I was a child, a cat, and a dog, and now I have a pet&nbsp;snail.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I have been the Chief Scientist for Ontology since July 2018. My duties include conducting technical research on the underlying technology of blockchain, Ontology’s decentralized identity system, and zero-knowledge proof mechanisms. I also research how we can combine elements of the blockchain and identity&nbsp;system.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>In my opinion, there are three things that make Ontology stand out from other blockchains. Firstly, the efficient confirmation of the Ontology blockchain. The Ontology chain adopts the VBFT consensus algorithm, which can support high concurrent TPS and fast confirmation of blocks. Secondly, Ontology’s multi-virtual machine system currently supports three types of virtual machines: NeoVM, WasmVM, and EVM, enabling developers familiar with different programming languages to quickly develop dApps. Finally, Ontology’s decentralized identity system sets it apart. Ontology was the first team to realize the importance of the decentralized identity system and has been exploring this technology for quite some&nbsp;time.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The most exciting part of the Ontology project is its decentralized identity framework.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The moment when I really decided to devote myself to the blockchain field was by far the most critical and career-defining moment in my&nbsp;career.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited to see how the expansion of decentralized applications into the mainstream industry brings about real and much-needed autonomy for users, over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the next five years, in the field of Web3, decentralized collaboration and decentralized social networks may be a trending use of DID frameworks. Ontology will continue to do a good job in building the infrastructure for Web3, not only providing an easy-to-use blockchain but also continuing to provide Web3 with a decentralized identity system and related content, such as decentralized reputation, which is the cornerstone of Web3 applications.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-chief-scientist-dr-kendall-mao-9dc77c5d82da">Meet the Team: Chief Scientist, Dr. Kendall Mao</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Despite their ubiquity, passwords have become – at best – an anachronism and, at worst – a gaping security blindspot for organizations and individuals alike. To put it simply, passwords are bad. They represent one of the weakest links in security, are a leading cause of breaches, and are both difficult and frustrating to manage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll say it again. Passwords are bad. Bad for security and bad for user experience. Bad across the board. Bad bad bad. One can even argue that they are the most prevalent and broadly accepted (albeit irrationally) global vulnerability. They offer practically zero redeeming qualities whatsoever and you should stop using them immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, passwords suck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, since you are on the Ping Identity website, I’m likely preaching to the choir on the shortcomings of password security. Most of us already know this all too well. We also know that adopting passwordless authentication can solve all these problems through enhanced security, better user experience, and streamlined access management:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>For customers, passwordless authentication improves engagement while also lowering abandonment rates. These seamless experiences ultimately drive higher revenues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>For employees, passwordless authentication results in less time entering and resetting login credentials. In turn, this equals higher productivity and less strain on helpdesks.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While increased profits should be motivation enough to embrace passwordless, the security benefits are also glaringly obvious. Case in point, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2020/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">80% of breaches involve brute force attacks or the use of lost or stolen credentials</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, the pros of going passwordless drastically exceed the cons of sticking with the status quo. So – this begs the question – why the heck are we still using passwords?!?!</p>

In DF Main, weekly rewards will grow to 1M+&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>The article <a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">“Ocean Data Farming Main is Here”</a> has the full details of DF Main. In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards stakers with OCEAN who allocate voting power to curate data assets with high&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">DF&nbsp;dapp</a>.</p><p>DF31 counting started 12:01am Mar 23, 2022 and ended 12:01am Apr 6, 2023. 75K OCEAN worth of rewards were available. Those rewards are now ready for claiming. You can claim them at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF32 is live and will conclude on Apr 13,&nbsp;2023.</p><p>DF Round 32 (DF32) is the third week of DF Main.

This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%.

<p>In this post we will learn what SBTs are and how they can be applied in our daily&nbsp;lives.</p> What are&nbsp;SBTs? <p>Soulbound tokens, or SBTs, are publicly verifiable and non-transferable <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/nonfungible-tokens-for-beginners/what-are-nfts-and-why-are-they-revolutionizing-the-art-world">non-fungible tokens (NFT)</a> representing an individual’s identity and credentials using blockchain technology. The concept was first introduced in 2022 by Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, Puja Ohlhaver, strategy counsel at FlashBots, and E. Glen Weyl, political economist and social technologist in a paper titled “Decentralized Society: Finding Web3’s&nbsp;Soul.”</p><p>SBTs may consist of employment history, medical records, and any piece of information belonging to a person or entity. The wallets or accounts to which SBTs are permanently bound are called “Souls,” and people could potentially have multiple of them describing different parts of their lives. For example, people could have a “Credentials Soul” for their curriculum vitae and a “Financial Soul” for the records of their transactions, allowing them to build a confirmable digital Web3 character established on their experiences and preceding actions.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most powerful aspects is that SBTs owned by one Soul can be issued or attested by other Souls who are counterparties to these relationships, like other individuals or institutions. For example, a company can distribute SBTs to employees, or a school can issue SBTs to students who completed specific courses or&nbsp;majors.</p> SBTs and&nbsp;NFTs <p>Nowadays, most NFTs are ownership certificates for digital art or collectibles. People buy, trade, or display NFTs as a symbol of wealth and status. The goal of SBTs is to transform NFTs into an object beyond wealth, a unique and untransferable token.</p><p>NFTs portray capital and ownership, whereas SBTs represent an individual’s or entity’s reputation. SBTs do not consist of financial value and cannot be traded once distributed to someone’s wallet. The table below shows a summary of the difference between SBTs and&nbsp;NFTs:</p>[Source: Cointelegraph] SBTs and DAO&nbsp;voting <p>Trust is one of the main challenges involving the Web3 industry. How can a person’s reputation be trusted in a system made to be trustless? In the financial sector, SBTs can be used to represent someone’s credentials, where reputation will act as collateral to get a loan, in contrast with the current way of checking the borrower’s bank account balances and credit&nbsp;scores.</p><p>Another use of SBTs is in decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting. As an alternative to the current governance model, based on the number of tokens a member holds, DAOs could provide SBTs assigning voting power dependent on users’ interactions with the community. This model would prioritize voting power to the most dedicated users with a strong reputation.</p><p>Additionally, SBTs can improve the integrity of DAO voting, defending it in particular against Sybil attacks, where an individual or a group of bad actors take over a DAO by purchasing the majority of governance tokens. This way, voting proposals can be manipulated, and the project’s direction can be influenced by those with majority voting power. The public and verifiable nature of SBTs can help distinguish and prevent bad actors from entering the DAO and, therefore, halt corruption and Sybil attacks from taking&nbsp;place.</p> SBTs’ possible use&nbsp;cases <p>SBTs have a broad spectrum of possible usage in everyday life; a few examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Education records: certification as proof of completion of the required courses. A university could issue SBTs storing the credentials and confirming the relevant qualifications and university membership to graduated students.  Credit history: SBTs can be used to represent traditional credit reports, allowing lenders to access the borrower’s credit history. As a result, people cannot hide or ignore their obligations.  Job applications: Job applicants can submit SBTs representing their educational credentials and professional certifications provided by universities and past employers.   Which SBTs are&nbsp;active? <p>SBTs are quite new, but there are some already in&nbsp;action:</p>  The <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/BABT?source=header">Binance Account Bound (BAB)</a> is the first SBT issued on the BNB chain by Binance. The BAB token is the credential Binance users get when they have passed the KYC process and has no monetary&nbsp;value.  Pangea, one of Metadium’s partners,<a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-partnership-with-pangea-inc-promises-further-expansion-in-the-metaverse-ba29a6a8322c"> launched SBT.PIZZA</a> in collaboration with Yonsei University, a top university in Korea. The project allows Yonsei to issue SBTs to students who satisfy qualifications like attending specific lectures, seminars, or activities.  <p>With SBTs being so new, there is still much to be learned. For now, it seems unlikely they will completely replace the NFT system but they could serve as an alternative to identity&nbsp;control.</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>오늘은 SBT가 무엇인지, 그리고 SBT가 우리의 일상 생활에 어떻게 적용될 수 있는지에 대해 자세히&nbsp;알아보겠습니다.</p> SBT란? <p>Soulbound Token(소울 바운드 토큰), 혹은 SBT는 블록체인 기술을 사용하여 개인의 신원과 자격 증명을 나타내는 공개적으로 검증 가능하고 양도가 불가능한 NFT(Non-Fungible Token)입니다. 이 개념은 2022년에 이더리움의 공동 설립자인 Vitalik Buterin과 FlashBots의 전략 고문 Puja Olhaver, 그리고 정치 경제학자이자 사회 기술자인 E. Glen Weyl이 발표한 &lt;탈중앙화 사회&nbsp;: 웹3의 영혼을 찾아서(Decentralized Society&nbsp;: Finding Web3’s Soul)&gt;라는 논문에서 처음&nbsp;소개되었습니다.</p><p>SBT는 근무 경력, 의료 기록 및 개인 또는 단체에 속하는 모든 정보로 구성될 수 있습니다. SBT가 영구적으로 귀속된 지갑이나 계정은 “Soul(소울)”이라고 불리며, 사람들은 그들의 다양한 삶의 모습을 표현하는 소울 여러 개를 가질 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 자신의 이력서를 위한 “자격증명 소울”과 거래 기록을 위한 “금융 소울”을 가질 수 있으며, 이를 통해 자신의 경험과 이전 활동을 바탕으로 확인 가능한 디지털 웹3 캐릭터를 구축할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>SBT의 가장 두드러지는 특징 중 하나는 한 소울이 소유한 SBT가 다른 개인이나 기관처럼 관계의 상대역인 다른 소울에 의해 발행되거나 증명될 수 있다는 것입니다. 예를 들면, 회사는 직원들에게 SBT를 배포할 수 있고 학교는 특정 과정이나 전공을 이수한 학생들에게 SBT를 발급할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT와 NFT <p>요즘 대부분의 NFT는 디지털 아트 또는 수집품에 대한 소유권 인증서입니다. 사람들은 부와 지위의 상징으로 NFT를 사고, 거래하고, 전시합니다. SBT의 목표는 NFT를 고유하고 양도할 수 없는 토큰, 부 이상의 객체로 변환하는&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>NFT는 자본과 소유권을, SBT는 개인 또는 기업의 평판을 나타냅니다. SBT는 금전적 가치를 포함하지 않으며 한 번 누군가의 지갑에 분배되면 거래될 수 없습니다. 아래 표에서 SBT와 NFT의 차이점을 확인할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT와 DAO&nbsp;투표 <p>신뢰성은 웹3 산업이 직면한 주요 과제 중 하나입니다. 신뢰할 수 없게 만들어진 시스템에서 어떻게 사람의 평판을 신뢰할 수 있을까요? 금융 분야에서 SBT는 대출자의 은행 계좌 잔액 및 신용 점수를 확인하는 현재 방식과 달리 평판이 대출을 받기 위한 담보 역할을 하는, 누군가의 자격 증명을 나타내는 데 사용될 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>SBT의 또 다른 용도는 탈중앙화 자율 조직(DAO, Decentralized Autonomous Organization) 투표입니다. DAO는 한 유저가 보유한 토큰의 양을 기반으로 하는 현재 거버넌스 모델의 대안으로, 유저와 커뮤니티의 상호 작용에 따라 투표권을 할당하는 SBT를 제공할 수 있습니다. 이 모델은 강력한 평판을 가진 가장 열정적이고 활발한 유저에게 투표권을&nbsp;우선시합니다.</p><p>또한 SBT는 DAO 투표의 무결성을 향상시켜 특히 개인 혹은 위험인물들이 거버넌스 토큰의 대부분을 구매하여 DAO를 인수하는 시빌 공격(Sybil attack)으로부터 DAO를 방어할 수 있습니다. 이러한 공격 방식은 투표 제안서를 조작할 수 있으며 프로젝트의 방향은 다수결 권한을 가진 사람들에 의해 영향을 받을 수 있습니다. SBT의 공개적이고 검증 가능한 특성은 위험인물이 DAO에 진입하는 것을 구별하고 방지하는 데 도움이 될 수 있으며, 부패와 시빌 공격이 발생하는 것을 막을 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT의 사용&nbsp;사례 <p>SBT는 일상 생활에서 광범위하게 사용될 수 있습니다. 몇 가지 예는 아래와&nbsp;같습니다.</p>  교육과정 기록: 필수 과정을 이수했다는 증명. 대학은 졸업한 학생들에게 자격증을 저장하고 관련 자격과 대학 구성원 자격을 확인하는 SBT를 발급할 수&nbsp;있습니다.  신용 기록: SBT는 전통적인 신용 보고서를 나타내는 데 사용될 수 있으며, 대출 기관이 대출자의 신용 기록에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 즉, 사람들은 그들의 법적 의무를 숨기거나 의도적으로 무시할 수&nbsp;없습니다.  입사 지원: 입사 지원자는 대학 및 이전 근무 기업에서 제공한 학력, 전문 자격증을 나타내는 SBT를 제출할 수&nbsp;있습니다.   SBT의 실제 적용&nbsp;사례 <p>SBT는 상당히 새롭지만 이미 사용 중인 경우도&nbsp;있습니다.</p>  <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/BABT?source=header">Binance Account Bound (BAB)</a>는 Binance가 BNB 체인에서 발행한 최초의 SBT입니다. BAB 토큰은 Binance 사용자가 KYC 프로세스를 통과했을 때 받는 자격 증명이며 금전적 가치가&nbsp;없습니다.  메타디움의 파트너 중 하나인 판게아는 국내 최고 대학인 연세대학교와 협업하여 <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-partnership-with-pangea-inc-promises-further-expansion-in-the-metaverse-ba29a6a8322c">SBT.PIZZA</a>를 출시했습니다. 이 프로젝트는 연세대학교가 특정 강의, 세미나 또는 활동에 참석하는 등 일정 자격을 갖춘 학생들에게 SBT를 발급할 수 있도록&nbsp;합니다.  <p>SBT는 완전히 새로운 개념이기 때문에 아직 배울 것이 많습니다. 현재로서는 SBT가 NFT 시스템을 완전히 대체할 것 같지 않아보여도, 신원 제어의 대안으로 작용할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> Sources:   <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-soulbound-tokens-sbt">What Are Soulbound Tokens (SBT)? | Binance&nbsp;Academy</a>  <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-soulbound-tokens-building-blocks-for-a-web3-decentralized-society">What are Soulbound Tokens?

				 <p>The Indicio Network Consortium is a community for advancing decentralized identity technology through enterprise blockchain. Here’s how it delivers value to its members—and why you should join!</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By France Donegan-Ryan</p>
<p>Indicio is building a community for organizations and businesses who want to be the leaders in the Enterprise Blockchain Community —and we want you to be a part of it. The Indicio Network Consortium is open to all, and there are many benefits to joining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is community important?</p>
<p>Community is a fast growing and strategic initiative for companies, and, contrary to what you might think, it’s not just a strategy for the big B2C brands, it’s an increasingly important strategy&nbsp; for B2B and startup organizations as well. In fact, nearly <a href="https://cmxhub.com/community-industry-report/">80% of founders</a> reported building a community of users as important to their business with 28% describing it as critical to their success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Communities play a vital role in building customer loyalty, driving brand evangelism, and delivering customer satisfaction. A <a href="https://peerboard.com/resources/online-community-statistics">2021 survey</a> found that 84% of companies that worked to improve their customer experience through community programs reported an increase in revenue. The same survey also revealed that customer-centric companies with branded online communities are 60% more profitable than companies that don’t focus on their customers.</p>
<p>Successful and supportive communities are built with the needs and wants of members at the forefront of their mission. When we were designing the Indicio Network Consortium we worked closely with customers, industry leaders, and community management data to create a meaningful program. We found that people, most of all, wanted to have a platform or space to connect with others with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the Indicio Network Consortium?</p>
<p>Consortium members can be Node Operators, Transaction Endorsers, or both. Node Operators support the Indicio Network by volunteering to run a copy of the Indicio ledger on a server that is under their authority. Each copy of the ledger is a node on the network, and multiple copies of the ledger distributed across multiple nodes and geographical locations forms a decentralized network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consortium members can also be Transaction Endorsers, which means taking on the process&nbsp; of approving writes to the network by other companies and organizations according to network governance rules. Node Operators can also be Transaction Endorsers, but only Node Operators can serve as Trustees for the Indicio Network, ensuring that the network meets its mission parameters.</p>
<p>Consortium benefits</p>
<p>There is no fee to become a Consortium Node Operator. Once approved you receive complementary decentralized identity and business training, professional technical support in operating your node, and have access to promotional opportunities provided via Indicio media channels and events. Also, there is a dedicated Slack space for all members to ask questions, get updates, and network. You’ll receive regular technical and community updates and have the chance to attend quarterly summits. Through these community activities you’ll have opportunities to build mutually beneficial relationships with peers, share how your business is using decentralization technology, learn from others, and highlight your progress and achievements.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>All Node Operators are eligible to apply to be a Transaction Endorsers on the Indicio MainNet, or you can sign up directly and not operate a node. Being a Transaction Endorser provides you with additional revenue opportunities for your decentralized identity business model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several Transaction Endorser ledger write (e.g., DIDs, schema, credential definition etc.) packages you can choose from. Additionally, if you’re a Node Operator you receive a 25% discount:</p>
<p>Unlimited ledger writes&nbsp;</p>
<p>$5000 on time fee | $3750 with Node Operator discount</p>
<p>100 ledger writes and unlimited recovations&nbsp;</p>
<p>$995 annually | $746 with Node Operator discount</p>
<p>Make your life easier with the Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">Transaction Endorser Wizard</a>!&nbsp;</p>
<p>$5000 one time fee | $3750 with the Node Operator discount</p>
<p>Consortium goals</p>
<p>We want the consortium to be a catalyst for business growth and for decentralized identity technology to reach new audiences. To do this, we will ensure there are regular opportunities to learn about what’s happening in the space, to hear from Indicio engineers and executives about technical and business developments, and to share in technical advancements that benefit us all.</p>

<p>User account access is a foundational form of cybersecurity, addressing both internal and external threats.</p>
<p>How does Privileged Access Management (PAM) aid security? PAM centralizes privileged data access control to support protection against unauthorized access.</p>
 What Is Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Privileged Access Management is a set of technologies and processes to control and monitor access to privileged accounts that control or touch sensitive or mission-critical data. These accounts will have “elevated” privileges or more access to information or processes that could, in the wrong hands, represent threats to security and compliance.</p>
<p>Account access is one of the oldest security concerns in computing, due in no small part to the fact that the first line of user security is ensuring strong and effective account access that prevents untrained or malicious users from stumbling on important system information.</p>
 Standard Versus Privileged Account Access 
 
 Standard accounts are non-privileged accounts typically held by everyday users who only need limited system resource access. Standard accounts can be used to access apps like shared files, email, or productivity suites but can’t get into global systems that handle metrics, configuration files, or executable files. 
 Privileged accounts have elevated permissions and access to critical IT systems. These accounts are typically used by admins that need to make changes to core files or systems, including configuration files, databases, or even data used by operating systems. Depending on the type of system, admins can perform various operations like deleting and moving files or installing programs. 
 
<p>PAM is an approach that allows administrators to delineate users and functions and promote system integrity and security. This is especially true for organizations following the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">Principles of Least Privilege</a> (PoLP), which states that users should have minimal access necessary to complete their tasks.</p>
 What Are Common PAM Controls? 
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/password-management/">Password Management</a>: PAM will include controls that protect passwords from attack, require complex passwords, rotate passwords regularly, and use controls to prevent common password attacks. This can consist of centralized <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-management-service/">identity management</a> like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/federated-identity-management/">federated identity</a> or Single Sign-On (SSO) approaches. 
 Access Control: Common forms of control like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can centralize rules to ensure that access to resources is limited to those with a reason, a necessity, or clearance to do so. 
 Auditing and Monitoring: PAM solutions will provide auditing capabilities that enable organizations to demonstrate compliance with regulations, policies, and security guidelines. This includes monitoring user account activity and maintaining reports of those activities for predictive security or forensic purposes. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Implementing PAM? 
<p>Perimeter security isn’t just about protecting a system from external threats. Internal security typically involves perimeter protection around different resources. This is particularly true in zero-trust systems where no user is inherently trusted and must be re-authorized at every access point. PAM is the very foundation of navigating these approaches to security.</p>
<p>Organizations use PAM for various reasons, including:</p>
 
 Reducing Attack Surfaces: PAM solutions will typically use heightened authorization and authentication measures (multi-factor authentication, biometrics, etc.) for privileged accounts. Since these accounts are often targets of attacks, then this approach helps focus security on critical system access. 
 Compliance: Many regulatory frameworks require specific control over private or sensitive data access. PAM is a critical component in meeting these compliance requirements. 
 Principle of Least Privilege: There is only one way to effectively implement PoLP, and that’s clearly understanding and managing privileges accounts and access controls within a system. As such, if you expect to leverage least privilege as a security priority, PAM is necessary. 
 Auditing: Part of a PAM system is using audit logs to determine which user accounts can access privileged information and how they do it. Not only are audit logs critical for security in general, but reviewing logs can help security determine if a threat is imminent–for example if odd behavior from a privileged account suggests that it has been compromised. 
 
 What Are the Challenges of Implementing Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Implementing a PAM system can be a complex process. The combination of data flows, applications, and users makes proper account management a challenge.</p>
<p>Some of the common challenges of implementing a PAM system include:</p>
 
 Integration: If you have existing authentication and security systems in place (like logging systems, SIEM solutions, account management software, etc.), then additional PAM controls must be integrated in a way that doesn’t disrupt any workflows or overall system integrity. 
 Applications and Environments: Many businesses use different environments spread across cloud systems and providers. PAM solutions must support different protocols and access methods to remain effective in complex IT environments. 
 Usability: PAM policies, improperly implemented, can also impact user productivity and experience, leading to frustration and resistance among users. 
 Compliance: Not all access policies are created equal. It’s integral that PAM policies meet compliance requirements, especially if your operations fall under different jurisdictions. 
 
 Is Privileged Access Management the Same as Identity and Access Management (IAM)? 
<p>While these two security approaches may overlap in practice, they are two distinct practices in user security. IAM and PAM are related, but they differ in their scope and applicability to different user accounts.</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-iam/">IAM</a> provides centralized user management services. These solutions are used to manage access to non-privileged accounts within an organization. 
 PAM, on the other hand, is focused on managing access to privileged accounts–that means administrator, IT, or executive accounts. 
 
 Support Your PAM Infrastructure with 1Kosmos 
<p>Integration is a major issue with PAM systems. You need an authentication system that works with principles of least privilege while maintaining strict security and usability for employees. That means strong biometrics bound to the privilaged user,, decentralized user management, and a consistent user authentication experience regardless of risk. .</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you get these benefits, along with the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.

<p>#BendNotBreak</p><p>In this series of 4 blogs we will explore the emerging work that we are undertaking in partnership with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a>. The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. A major component of this journey is to identify innovative individuals and organisations who are working in this space. For Laudes, building and supporting a community of changemakers who are working to achieve outcomes such as fair work and green, affordable housing is a critical element of the transition ahead. We hope that these first thoughts will prompt discussions and questions and we would welcome your views and critiques. Please do get in touch if you would like to contribute.</p> Blog 1 (of 4): Considering the fundamental ecological, physical and social constraints of the Built Environment  Applying a new conceptual filter to old challenges <p>The reality is a kaleidoscope of upstream factors and if we fail to address a single one then there is a real danger that we fail at everything.</p><p>If you are reading this blog then you almost certainly understand how to think in terms of systems. Ideas such as looking upstream of the crises to identify root causes and the interconnected nature of the world’s wicked problems will be familiar. You probably have a particular area of interest or expertise. You might be working on education because you sense that if we could encourage a new generation of systems thinkers then our future would be transformed. Or you might be certain that the core problem is the embedded growth obligation of our economic system. Perhaps your focus is on biodiversity and preserving life’s ecosystems, because without these the economy and education are both meaningless. In these (and many other) convictions we would agree. Each is arguably ‘the’ underlying cause and each requires a response. The reality is a kaleidoscope of upstream factors and if we fail to address a single one then there is a real danger that we fail at everything. Following this logic, it seems that we need an ecology of responses rather than multiple upstream solutions.</p><p>This kind of framing can make us feel individually powerless but if we can allow ourselves to lean into the uncertainty and complexity of what is unfolding, then new opportunities surface. An alternative frame is to shift our focus from trying to enact solutions (for example, a Europe wide retrofit rollout or building a certain number of green homes) and to think instead about the dominant forces that are acting on the sector. What do these trends mean in terms of the constraints we must operate within and around? An obvious example is the current spike in electricity prices which is putting enormous pressure on household budgets. If prices are set to rise into the future, will it even be viable to achieve our current comfort levels of heating and cooling by electrifying the existing infrastructure? Even if energy prices fall, existing global mineral reserves are insufficient to manufacture even one generation of renewable technology units (EV’s, H-cells, batteries, wind turbines and solar panels)¹.</p><p>With this in mind, we would like to propose a conceptual tool to help think through the constraints and identify strategies that could help to navigate them. Imagine an image filter that you apply to a familiar landscape. The basic features are unchanged, but the perception is altered so that some objects are in sharper relief and others are hardly visible. Or perhaps like the artist<a href="https://www.oliverjeffers.com/maps-and-globes"> Oliver Jeffers</a>, you turn the image (and the political motivations behind it) on its head to expose a different story. What do you notice that you didn’t consider before? If this type of perspective shift related to the operating space in which you work rather than to a nondescript image, how would you respond? Would it feel exciting, threatening, opaque or simply more than you have time for this&nbsp;week?</p>Oliver Jeffers — This way up, 2018 [oliverjeffers.com]<p>We, like many of you, have considered the cascading and multiplying threats of the 21st Century across many aspects of our work. After a wide review of the literature and some spirited dialogues (both internal and external) we have narrowed these trends down to four bottleneck filters; factors that we consider to be the most significant in analysing the constraints of Europe’s built environment decarbonisation challenge. These filters are intended as thought prompts rather than definitive conclusions and we are curious to hear how they sit with you. Do any of them intuitively ring true or do you think we are missing some fundamental elements? Is this kind of framing useful or do you view it as an unnecessary distraction?</p> The constraints: 4 bottlenecks that will shape the future of Europe’s built environment <p>The scope and scale of the transition ahead is unprecedented in terms of the human, physical and financial resources that will be required. In the EU, it is estimated that retrofitting the existing building stock will demand an estimated EUR 275 billion of additional investments per year to achieve EU climate targets by 2030². Despite the scale of this requirement, raising and managing this level of financial investment will only be part of the challenge.</p><p>We would therefore like to invite you to think about four additional constraints and how they apply to the work you are doing at the moment. How might they shape the strategies, design options and pathways that you think will be optimal for the transition of the built environment? What are you doing already that recognises and addresses these converging limitations? What might you need to lean further into or away&nbsp;from?</p><p>1. Labour constraints</p><p>Labour shortages combined with an insufficiently skilled and ageing workforce, means that resourcing sustainable building activities (for both modernisation and construction) is already a major problem for the building sector³. If we don’t make this sector more engaging and inclusive, we will simply not attract the volume or quality of labour required. This dynamic will be further complicated by migration patterns that will not necessarily correlate to labour needs (in timeframe or geographical spread). Climate and war refugees will not neatly arrive in areas earmarked for planned renovations or green building programmes. Even if they did, there will be other escalating labour priorities such as providing care or improving food security. As these pressures intensify it is likely that the allocation of labour to building renovation versus other critical missions will become a significant strategic issue.</p><p>To add fuel to the fire, across much of Europe, the shift from rural to urban areas is intensifying (in Romania and Slovenia for example the vacancy rate of dwellings in rural areas exceeds 20%⁴). If these and other transitioning geographies around the world continue to urbanise using modern technologies, then the pressures on carbon, material and energy budgets will be far greater than currently estimated.</p><p>2. The energy&nbsp;crisis</p><p>The labour constraints above will be further accentuated by a reduction in the so-called ‘fossil workers’ who have boosted our productivity over the last century. Globally we currently use around 100 million barrels of oil per day (c. 36 billion barrels per year) but this resource is becoming harder and more expensive to obtain, even if we put aside the carbon considerations. To put this into perspective, one barrel of oil is equivalent to the amount of physical labour that a human can produce in 4.5 years⁵. The annual consumption of around 8 billion humans is therefore 4.5 barrels per person (36bn barrels divided by 8bn humans) which equates to 20 years of equivalent human labour per person (4.5 barrels * 4.5 years = 20 years). This is an extraordinary statistic that has profound implications for our future living standards.</p><p>The renewable energy sector is growing rapidly but still only represents around 11% of global energy consumption⁶. Since 2000, the use of electricity by the building sector has increased almost five times faster than the corresponding improvements in the decarbonisation of the electricity generation⁷. Unless we shrink other areas of the economy the additional energy requirements of building decarbonisation may not even be possible within our current economic&nbsp;system.</p><p>3. The material&nbsp;crisis</p><p>This brings us onto the material crisis where energy shortages will collide with a requirement to power the mining of staggering quantities of additional materials. Take copper for example, which is an essential component for retrofitting⁸. Prior to 2020, humanity mined 700 million tons of copper back to 4,000 BC, but to keep up with current copper demand (excluding additional requirements from decarbonisation or electrification) we will need to mine that volume in the next 22 years i.e. we will compress 6,000 years of extraction into just&nbsp;22⁹.</p><p>Threaded through this bottleneck are geopolitical tensions that will almost certainly further intensify material resource pressures. Turkey for example, currently sources 35% of its aluminium (which is a critical building material) from Russia¹⁰. Other minerals used in construction (for example nickel as a component of stainless steel) are starting to be extracted from the deep sea beds of the global ocean. Here too tensions are rising as the frontiers of extraction expand, with China holding more contracts issued by the <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/11/geopolitics-deep-sea-mining-and-green-technologies">International Seabed Authority</a> than any other&nbsp;country.</p><p>4. Ecological dynamics</p><p>In 2021, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957292/Dasgupta_Review_-_Abridged_Version.pdf">Dasgupta review</a> on the economics of biodiversity was commissioned by the UK Treasury and concluded that ‘we are currently damaging it [the natural world] so profoundly that many of its natural systems are now on the verge of breakdown’. Declining biodiversity levels are a tragedy in their own right but without careful management will also limit the availability of biomaterials for green building technologies. Added to this are the intensifying severe weather patterns that will require huge improvements in the resilience of buildings, thus putting further pressure on natural stocks. If we aspire to reconfigure the built environment using green materials we must first reconceive the relationship between our buildings and living resources such as timber. Imagine a future where the shape and quantity of our buildings must be defined by the regenerative potential of our forests, rather than the other way&nbsp;around.</p><p>To put the above into context of the built environment, we did some rough calculations based on the global 96% carbon emission reduction requirement to stay within planetary boundaries and a per capita allocation of that budget per country¹¹. Our assumptions were also based on the current allocations of carbon to the construction industry in Europe (39% overall and 11% to pure construction) and an average emission figure of c.50 tonnes of carbon per new build. Using these high level figures, we estimate that the maximum number of houses that can be built within the carbon budget per year, would be around 176,000 for the whole of Europe and just 15,000 for the UK. To be clear, this is before we consider climate reparation budgets which will further restrict that number. In the context of 700,000 people being reported homeless per day in Europe¹² and an annual target of 400,000 new homes to be built in Germany alone, these numbers are shocking.</p> Strategies and design options: flipping our perspective to meet the future&nbsp;halfway <a href="https://uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/lyon-metropole">Home Silk Road Project,</a> Lyon [Urban Innovative Actions]<p>Building on the bottlenecks above we have been thinking through strategies that are either implied or invited by these constraints. This is our equivalent of drawing the map upside down and re-evaluating how to navigate the changing landscape. There are many possibilities; some are already being used to triage existing issues, some are quietly coalescing to power the next generation of responses, some are still conceptual. The following prompts summarise the strategic design principles that we have been thinking&nbsp;about:</p><p>Consider a no (or low) build future for Europe: There is no question that people need safe, green homes but can we realistically and ethically plan to build and renovate them with resource and energy pressures escalating? If we can’t build the required homes then we will need to intensify our use of the existing building stock. This could include a radical repurposing of Europe’s vacant buildings (including the 16% of homes that are currently unoccupied¹³) and reconfiguring how we equitably share&nbsp;space.</p><p>Embrace low-tech dematerialisation: If we can’t mine or recycle the materials needed we will simply need to use less of them. Some of these resource savings may come from technological improvements, but we can also look at strategies that simplify our lifestyles? Do we really need to keep our houses at 20 degrees year round? Could we instead move to zonal heating where areas of the building are subdivided into smaller compartments for heating according to seasons? For example, it might be possible to think about radiant heating panels for targeted heat requirements such as over a work&nbsp;desk.</p><p>Think upstream of the solutions as well of the problems: We might think of plentiful materials with low levels of embodied carbon as providing uncontroversial solutions, but what if we widen the boundary of our risk assessments? For example, bamboo is considered to be a low-carbon material with strong mechanical qualities, but without careful management bamboo invasion can negatively impact native plant diversity¹⁴. Seeking multiple perspectives on any response being proposed will be essential if we are to prevent today’s solutions from becoming tomorrow’s escalation pathways.</p><p>Embed a culture of care: The working conditions and social status of those who are currently working in the industry is worrying. In 2020, more than 20% of fatal work accidents in the EU occurred within the construction industry¹⁵. In the UK, the <a href="https://www.ciob.org/industry/research/Understanding-Mental-Health-Built-Environment#:~:text=Mental%20ill%2Dhealth%20is%20a,professionals%20their%20thoughts%20and%20experiences.">Chartered Institute of Building </a>has recently reported that ‘Mental ill-health is a silent crisis within the construction industry’, with male construction workers three times more likely to die from suicide than the national average. These are deeply disturbing statistics on a human level that fuel the subliminal narratives that percolate into every decision. How can we expect a worker appraising a development project to meaningfully embrace wellbeing outcomes, when their lived reality of achieving financial targets is in such stark contrast?</p><p>Re-common housing as a universal basic service: Since the 2008 financial crisis investor-owned housing in Europe has increased by 700 percent¹⁶. On average across Europe 18% of dwellings are overcrowded, 35% are under occupied¹⁷ and 16% are not occupied at all¹⁸. The situation is so absurd that a group of activists in Brussels have created an entirely fictional district (<a href="https://www.leegbeek.brussels/">Saint-Vide-Leegbeek</a>) to highlight the 6.5m m2 and 30,000 units of empty properties in the city alone. Housing cannot legitimately remain subject to price speculation and wealth protection in a fair and sustainable future. How could the narrative of housing as an asset (together with the financial practices around it) be reframed, to spark a wide-scale public debate about what housing means in a resource constrained future?</p><p>Ignite imaginative thinking: What if an alternative resource-light architecture is predominantly constrained by a failure of our collective imagination rather than by a lack of viable alternatives? After Covid restrictions were lifted in Europe, many people expressed their wish not to return to their old patterns of living and working. This is obviously a dramatic example but does highlight the power of people viscerally experiencing alternative ways of living, in terms of shifting value perceptions. This is an idea being playful explored by the <a href="https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/index_en">New European Bauhaus</a> which invites Europe’s citizens to co-create a ‘sustainable and inclusive future that is beautiful for our eyes, minds, and&nbsp;souls’.</p><p>Build the politics of transition: Many of the required strategies and capabilities will not be politically acceptable at present but everyday politics will be a powerful driver in meeting the future halfway. How for example would our responses differ if citizens felt empowered to shape and design their own futures? Would residents of a district or city accept skyrocketing levels of inequality and homelessness if they felt there were realistic alternatives? How would working conditions change if organisations agreed to operate under a revocable social licence, that was periodically audited by a random selection of local stakeholders?</p><p>Move on from impossible: If the transitions we were expecting are moving further out of reach then we must stop chasing the impossible and think about responding to the difficult. Taking retrofit as an example, if the materials and energy will not be available to insulate the entirety of Europe’s housing stock, then perhaps we can also create houses within houses using tent-like removable heat capture. Similarly, if we cannot mine the minerals of choice to power our heat pumps, then we will need to start investing in alternative battery technologies powered by plentiful elements such as sodium and fluoride.</p><p>Strategies Xn&nbsp;: Whilst we are happy to share our thinking, we feel strongly that our work will only be robust and meaningful if we begin building on it in community with Laudes and the wider network of built environment practitioners. This is an evolving area and we are committed to holding time and space within it to hear and support your&nbsp;ideas.</p>Co-Hab Athens [<a href="https://cooperativecity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ozanam-1.jpg">Cooperative City Magazine</a>] Closing thoughts <p>In a collaborative workshop between DML and Laudes in December 2022, we discussed the 4-filter constraint framework described above. One concern that was raised was that inequality seemed to be a fundamental omission. If we are applying the filter of labour then thinking through the inequality implications of any goal or strategy would also seem important. Spiralling inequality is undisputedly a destructive and undesirable dynamic in our current socio-economic system. It should and absolutely must be addressed. However, we see this as a structural constraint of the wider economic system in which the built environment is nested, rather than as a specific barrier to inclusive decarbonisation strategies. We will explore and unpack this distinction in our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Finally, this initiative will be hollow without input from the people working towards these common goals. Our wish is to amplify your voices, to learn from you and critically to take your feedback on board to improve our own work. All thoughts, questions, critiques and suggestions are warmly welcomed.</p><p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (<a href="mailto:emily@darkmatterlabs.org">emily@darkmatterlabs.org</a>), Aleksander Nowak (<a href="mailto:Aleks@darkmatterlabs.org">Aleks@darkmatterlabs.org</a>), Vlad Afanasiev (<a href="mailto:vlad@darkmatterlabs.org">vlad@darkmatterlabs.org</a>) and Indy Johar (<a href="mailto:indy@darkmatterlabs.org">indy@darkmatterlabs.org</a>)</p><p>References:</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.simonmichaux.com/">https://www.simonmichaux.com/</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/renovation-wave_en">https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficient-buildings/renovation-wave_en</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-confronted-with-lack-of-skilled-labour-to-support-building-renovation-wave/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/eu-confronted-with-lack-of-skilled-labour-to-support-building-renovation-wave/</a></p><p>[4] <a href="https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-construction.pdf">https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HM1-1-Housing-stock-and-construction.pdf</a></p><p>[5] This is based on performing 40 hours of physical work per week all year at an average output of 600 watt-hours.

				<p>Trinsic has written extensively on IDtech products and their importance to the future of identity. In this post, we include a brief explanation, but if you would like to dive further, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-idtech-and-why-does-it-matter/">check out our blog posts</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we talk about IDtech products, we’re talking about applications that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. These products aren’t necessarily decentralized, though we believe decentralized identity solutions will eventually win because they are better for users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve purposefully not included infrastructure platforms (you’ll note that Trinsic is not on the map), open source libraries, or blockchains on this list. While these things enable the creation of IDtech companies and their products, they are not categorized as IDtech in and of themselves. The reason being is that IDtech refers specifically to products and applications that help consumers manage their identity and data.</p>

				<p>IDtech products are opening a new world of digital experiences for both people and businesses. We believe IDtech is on the verge of breakthrough growth that will be compared to the Fintech boom that brought the means for businesses, both large and small, to provide financial services directly to customers like never before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Trinsic is an IDtech infrastructure company. IDtech companies build on top of Trinsic, so they can spend the majority of their time focused on bringing their product to market instead of building complex, underlying infrastructure. We have chosen to build our infrastructure with decentralized technologies, because as we mentioned above, we feel that decentralized identity (often called SSI) provides the most optimal experience for end users to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The number one factor that will influence the adoption of decentralized identity is amazing IDtech products that users love. IDtech products that solve real problems for users. We are excited to see the continued success of the IDtech products listed in the market map and look forward to the development of many more!</p>

 AyanWorks won “FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 - India: Go Passwordless with FIDO Authentication” <p>We at AyanWorks, have always been moved by challenging ourselves with the complex problems in the Blockchain space, be it exploring &amp; evaluating new stacks, contributing to complex open source projects, taking challenges head on to build solutions for, participating in the hackathons to build solutions with cutting edge technologies. Continuing with this DNA, AyanWorks team participated in the ‘FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 — India’ hackathon event. Theme for this challenge was ‘Go Passwordless with FIDO Authentication’. More details can be <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-2022-india/">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p><blockquote>We are thrilled to announce that AyanWorks has made it to the top 3 finalists in the challenge. We are honoured to be recognised for our innovative work in the field of digital identity and verifiable credential management (see <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-awards-winner-and-top-finalists-of-developer-challenge-india/">official announcement</a> from FIDO Alliance).</blockquote><p>Demo Day</p><p>The final demo and awards event was held at the Samsung Research Institute in Noida and it provided us with a fantastic opportunity to meet and network with various individuals and developers in the field. It was an great platform for us to showcase our SSI (<a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>) mobile wallet app, powered by <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO Passkeys</a>, which stores user’s credentials securely using advanced cryptography, thus preserving the privacy of the individual and the data in her wallet. As they call — ‘Privacy-by-Design’ and ‘Privacy-by-Default’.</p><p>Our team worked tirelessly to develop the solution that is not only secure but also user-friendly and easy to use, making it accessible to everyone. We believe that <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital decentralised identity</a> and cryptographically signed &amp; digitally verifiable credential management is an important step towards a more secure and reliable internet ecosystem. Our SSI mobile wallet app, implements the authentication method using FIDO Passkeys, provides a solution to some of the most significant challenges faced in the space today, such as security vulnerabilities and data breaches.</p><p>At <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a>, our primary focus has always been on creating innovative solutions that serve the best interests of our clients and users. That’s why we’re proud to say that our SSI mobile wallet app is designed with greater preference to the highest security and user privacy standards, while providing an unparalleled user experience.</p><p>Our recognition as a finalist in the FIDO developer challenge is a true testament to the dedication of our team. We’re thrilled to have had the opportunity to showcase our work on this platform, and we’re grateful to the FIDO Alliance &amp; FIDO India Working Group team for providing us with this opportunity. We’re excited to continue driving positive change in the digital identity space and helping our clients and users navigate the complex digital landscape with confidence.</p><p>Why Passwordless?</p><p>Cybercrime damages the world economy $2.9 million every minute, with 80% of cyberattacks targeting passwords. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has warned that online users in the country are being targeted by phishing scams, which involve an attacker fooling a victim into clicking malicious links in order to steal sensitive data like passwords, login information, and One Time Passwords (OTP). In India, the National Crime Record Bureau reported 4,047 cases of online banking fraud in 2020, with 1,093 of those cases involving OTPs. The recent global epidemic has increased enterprises’ readiness to adopt password-less FIDO Authentication, making it easier to solve than ever before thanks to the rising number of devices supporting FIDO and the availability of a public WebAuthn&nbsp;API.</p><p>To summarise</p><p>At <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a>, we remain committed to delivering innovative <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital identity solutions</a> that meet the needs of our users, while prioritising security and privacy. Our recent recognition as a top finalist in the FIDO developer challenge validates the quality of our solutions and motivates us to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation further. We believe that building strong relationships with our fellow developers and industry leaders will enable us to drive positive change in the digital identity space. If you’re interested in learning more about our solutions or partnering with us, please visit our website or reach out to our team. We will be happy to share the details and also arrange for you a quick demo of our solution.</p><p>You can contact us <a href="http://www.ayanworks.com/contact-us/">here</a>. You can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ayanworks/">follow us</a> for all future&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Until then, happy hacking the solutions..!</p><p>:: More about Passkeys: <a href="https://passkeys.dev/">https://passkeys.dev/</a></p>

While last-gen identity solutions based on passwords, emails, devices, and wallet addresses are still prevalent, people are paying for this convenience with one of their most valuable assets — personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>The emerging Web3 makes the problem of data security and fraud more immediate, but it also provides solutions.</p><p>Decentralized identity systems promise to empower users to verify themselves and conduct online transactions without disclosing their personal information. However, many existing platforms can’t offer a holistic solution that addresses critical aspects like digital identity, interoperability, user data security, compliance, and payments — that’s where Nuggets makes the biggest difference.</p><p><a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a> is the only product that enables organizations to comply with regulations whilst maintaining their privacy, guaranteeing data security, and remaining fully decentralized. As a super-wallet, Nuggets also enables multi-rail payments and provides a convenient cache for crypto assets — all tied to a verified decentralized identity.</p><p>Best of all, Nuggets is available globally right&nbsp;now.</p> More power to&nbsp;you <p>Requiring just one-time onboarding during sign-up, Nuggets focuses on providing a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable experience across Web2 and Web3. The solution provides a merit-based reputation and prioritizes protecting users’ data — enabling them to navigate the digital world with confidence and&nbsp;ease.</p><p>By leveraging a combination of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), auditable nuggets of data, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), peerDIDs, and verifiable credentials, Nuggets has created a state-of-the-art solution that puts privacy and security at the heart of its&nbsp;design.</p><p>Users’ identification is linked to W3C verifiable credentials and ZKP proofs, allowing them to confirm their status without revealing any private information.</p><p>Nuggets is also a fully customizable, ready-to-deploy solution that supports real-world use cases. As such, brands can seamlessly integrate Nuggets into existing infrastructures, compliance processes, payments, and customer experience immediately or offer Nuggets as a standalone identity solution.</p><p>One of the most critical challenges facing Web3 is complying with regulations without requiring users to hand over a litany of personally identifying information to a centralized third party. Until now, there has been no decentralized way for Web3 protocols to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Solving this issue, Nuggets features built-in tools to ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, without compromising decentralization, privacy, or autonomy. Whether you’re an individual, DeFi protocol, exchange, or DAO Nuggets creates a frictionless, secure experience and reduces the risk of cybercrimes while simultaneously ensuring users’ privacy and security and increasing operational efficiency. Nuggets’ self-sovereign identity solution also serves as a critical entry point for DeFi, as it allows users and service providers to operate in a verified, compliant environment.</p> Cultivating a Vibrant Web3 Ecosystem <p>Nuggets’ vision goes beyond creating a cutting-edge identity solution — it is committed to nurturing collaboration and adoption within the Web3 ecosystem. Companies like <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/collab-land-3-5-million-154500218.html">Collab.Land</a> and <a href="https://yieldly.medium.com/yieldly-inks-deal-with-nuggets-to-bring-secure-private-ids-to-ylaunch-platform-3ecd1e3d99c0">Yieldly</a> have already embraced Nuggets’ vision in its pursuit of a safer, more private digital&nbsp;future.</p><p>These partnerships highlight how Nuggets is being harnessed to boost user control, interoperability, compliance and privacy across a wide array of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to Web3 communities.</p><p>Nuggets’ solution has the potential to spark a profound transformation in industries as diverse as e-commerce and healthcare, allowing everyone — people of all ages, backgrounds, and businesses — to benefit from its identity solution.</p><p>By incorporating Nuggets into their systems, companies can simplify onboarding processes, elevate user experiences, and protect sensitive information without compromising on convenience.</p><p>Together, we are building a future where digital identity is private, secure, user-centric, and empowering.</p><p>If you’re looking to enable identity, compliance, or payments, we’d love to work with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Request a demo with Seema at partner@nuggets.life</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/nuggets-the-only-decentralized-identity-merging-identity-compliance-and-payments-effedd74396b">Nuggets: The Only Decentralized Identity Merging Identity, Compliance, and Payments</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 CircuLaw — using existing laws and regulations to accelerate the transition to a circular&nbsp;economy <p>CircuLaw is an open public service that is aiming to accelerate the circular economy transition by enabling policymakers to make more and better use of existing laws and regulations.</p><p><a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a> is a digital platform that presents opportunities within the existing legal and regulatory framework in the Netherlands in an accessible, digestible and ultimately implementable way. Over the past two and a half years, we (Dark Matter Labs) have been working alongside the City of Amsterdam, and various knowledge and funding partners to conduct research, design, develop and launch alpha and beta versions of <a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a>. The platform currently enables policymakers to explore opportunities around 3 themes: sustainable timber construction, wind turbines and mattress production chains. More themes will&nbsp;follow.</p>CircuLaw.nl — English&nbsp;page Introductions, and some&nbsp;context <p>CircuLaw builds upon Dm’s work supporting regulatory innovation in <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Legitimacities-Toward-a-network-of-city-based-regulatory-experimentati">Montreal (Canada</a>), Madrid (Spain) and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Civic-City-Exploring-future-regulatory-infrastructure-and-digital">Copenhagen (Denmark</a>). In 2019, we engaged with the City of Amsterdam as part of EIT Climate-KIC’s Deep Demonstrations programme. In Amsterdam, we have an innovative and forward-thinking partner, the city has <a href="https://time.com/5930093/amsterdam-doughnut-economics/">embraced the doughnut economic model</a> and has a relatively large and growing number of staff devoted to innovation and accelerating its <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/policy/sustainability/circular-economy/">circular economy transition.</a></p><p>The Netherlands is aiming for a fully circular economy by 2050. Setting targets is a vital first step, but meeting such targets requires immediate and drastic changes in the way that we produce, build, manufacture and consume. According to the <a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022">Circularity Gap Report (2022)</a> increased material extraction means our economies are becoming even less circular — shockingly, global circularity has shrunk from 9.1% in 2018 to just 7.2% in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Research from the <a href="https://www.pbl.nl/publicaties/integrale-circulaire-economie-rapportage-2023">Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency</a> states that the drastic changes we now need cannot rely only on policy aiming to support and facilitate circularity initiatives of parties that are mainly experimenting, but also if we are serious about reaching circularity goals, then we cannot exclusively focus on making changes in laws and regulations; the public sector must use current regulatory powers much more effectively to compel rapid change across wider&nbsp;society.</p><p>Making and implementing new regulations is time-consuming, so back in late 2019 and early 2020, Amsterdam was already pondering how it could make better use of existing ‘hard’ instruments — the components of its current legal, regulatory or taxation systems — to begin accelerating change. Even among municipalities leading the battle against climate breakdown, these existing hard instruments remain largely underutilised. According to <a href="https://www.royalhaskoningdhv.nl/nl-nl/challenges/duurzaamheid/circulaire-economie#downloadrapports">Royal HaskoningDHV’s 2022 research</a> such directive use of regulations accounts for only 1% of activity.</p>Circular Activities of local and regional authorities (Royal Haskoning, 2022)<p>Having spent almost two and a half years working around policymakers in Amsterdam and the wider Netherlands, we recognise how incoherent the legal and regulatory system can seem. Firstly and fundamentally, pivoting towards a circular future requires the use of a regulatory system that was never developed to drive the transition to a circular economy. For policymakers with circular economy goals, navigating this regulatory system forms a formidable obstacle.</p><p>Accessing and evaluating the relevant information and policy options takes a lot of time and requires expensive legal expertise, so when a return on that investment is uncertain, policymakers are often deterred from exploring possibilities. In instances where legal support is sought, it also tends to be highly specialised, because the different parts of the regulatory system are so fragmented. Even in the rare instances where a legal or regulatory instrument is successfully used to bring about policy change in a municipality or province, information about the outcome tends to remain localised and knowledge is rarely passed on. As a consequence, policymakers across the Netherlands still opt to pursue change via more voluntary agreements (covenants) and innovation subsidies, irrespective of their chances of making the necessary impact. Assertive use of legal and regulatory opportunities remains ‘too damn difficult’, even though we won’t get much further without&nbsp;it.</p> CircuLaw’s solutions <p>In response to this, CircuLaw attempts to piece the fragments together; to make the Dutch regulatory system more easily accessible to its policymakers by quickly directing them towards relevant instruments and information.</p><p>Behind the scenes, we’re analysing existing laws and regulations, extracting relevant instruments and then translating the findings into understandable, readable, shareable, applicable insights; policymakers in all levels of government can use these as starting points for shaping actionable policies.</p><p>By combining this analysis with a breakdown of innovations that did (and didn’t) work, CircuLaw aims to provide an overview of the current systems and practices. To do the legal analysis we created the following replicable methodology:</p> CircuLaw’s methodology for law&nbsp;analysis Methodology for law&nbsp;analysis<p>1. Choosing theme<br>We’re choosing themes or product groups (e.g. wind turbines) based on impact, influence, momentum and existing opportunities.</p><p>2. Researching theme<br>Defining how the chain of the product is put together, understanding who plays a role in this, which circular processes are already in place, etc. This analysis helps us to see which (technical and policy) solutions are already available for some problems and which ones still need to be developed, leading to a set of operational goals.</p><p>3. Demarcating laws<br>Identifying laws and regulations that can help us achieve the operational goals.</p><p>4. Analysing laws<br>We’ve developed an analysis key to thoroughly examine laws and regulations at local, provincial, national and soon also EU level to identify relevant instruments and opportunities.</p><p>5. Ranking opportunities<br>Based on the influence of an instrument in practice and its legal feasibility we rank the instruments.</p><p>6. Translating legal language<br>To be readable and understandable by policymakers without a legal background we present our content without using&nbsp;jargon.</p><p>7. Creating overviews<br>Our overviews allow policymakers to explore findings according to authority level, the way the instruments interrelate or as a filterable list.</p>Different instrument overviews based on authority level, how instruments interrelate and as a filterable list. For the interactive overviews see <a href="http://www.circulaw.nl">circulaw.nl</a> Some things we have learned so&nbsp;far <p>The shift towards a systemic policy focus on the circular transition is only really getting started, though there’s increasing appetite for the work and it’s taking place with a growing sense of urgency across all layers of government in the Netherlands. But when it comes to learning and measuring impacts, there’s still vast terrain left to explore. CircuLaw is among several initiatives working across the Netherlands to accelerate change. It’s still early days, but we’ve been given the space to co-create a flexible, iterative tool to best serve the particular requirements of its end users. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned over the past two and a half&nbsp;years.</p><p>1. We need to be sensitive towards existing policymaking and implementation processes</p><p>When we began working with policymakers in different parts of the municipal organisation, we were aiming to closely witness — and perhaps map — their policymaking processes. Almost immediately, we started to realise the sheer diversity of policymaking and implementation processes. Each policy domain relevant to the circular transition (and there are more than one might imagine) has its own practices and logic; and all policymakers bring their own knowledge, experiences, networks and approaches. Every potential instrument has its own implementation journey requiring expertises scattered across several departments and teams, and this work all takes place within differently structured municipal organisations with their own hierarchies, internal politics and working cultures.</p><p>As a result, policy making is both relational and non-linear, so working out how to help at a generalised level presents a challenge. Top down, one-size-fits-all approaches are doomed to&nbsp;fail.</p>A simplified illustration of the context of a policy maker timber construction — drawing by Yvonne de Meij van Streefkerk (Team CircuLaw)<p>2. We’re focusing on the policymaking frontrunners</p><p>Amsterdam has a team devoted to its circular economy transition, positioning the city at the vanguard amongst global capitals. As our work has expanded across the Netherlands, we’ve opted at this stage to cater to those municipal practitioners prepared to experiment and take greater risks in their policy-making decisions. Some of the approaches and discoveries might not be immediately applicable in a municipality with 0.5 FTE working towards a circular economy, but we’re aiming to establish precedents amongst frontrunners that then show a growing body of evidence to inspire and enable colleagues in organisations with less in-house capacity. By demonstrating and documenting a wide range of cases at the edge of current practice, we hope to create a real shift in what is considered possible within the current rules and regulations in cities across — and beyond — the Netherlands. And we hope it will contribute to a better shared understanding of where actual changes in the law are needed to further accelerate change.</p><p>3. We need to support both replication and innovation</p><p>There’s still plenty of potential for change using the existing regulatory system. Identifying and mapping relevant legal and regulatory instruments around different themes and product groups will begin to increase navigability and coherence, but then successfully utilising those instruments to change outcomes is a different matter. When an existing legal instrument has been implemented, <a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a> can provide a step-by-step walkthrough of how change has been achieved, with examples and shared lessons. This approach could stimulate replication and greater uniformity across the Netherlands — critical for shaping e.g. the investments of suppliers of goods and services to the government.</p><p>While there is definite value in documenting previous successes, we also need to establish ways to support policymakers who are looking to do unprecedented things; to give them the tools and confidence to innovate using (existing) legal instruments that might have been previously overlooked or underutilised.</p><p>4. We’ll need help to monitor and measure impact in a complex, adaptive&nbsp;system</p><p>There are so many factors involved in any policy making process that claiming impact or attributing causality can be difficult. At some level we need metrics to establish whether we’re doing the right things, but, however effective, regulatory instruments are only ever a part of the policymaking picture.</p><p>Some impacts of CircuLaw might be relatively straightforward, others might take ten years to take full effect. It’s never going to be as simple as measuring the increase in % of instruments used, because a single instrument might account for repeated change. So we’re exploring the best way of working with the City of Amsterdam’s Monitoring team to look at material flows, such as concrete or food, to establish what would be most useful to&nbsp;measure.</p><p>CircuLaw is also about increasing shared awareness about possibilities in law and regulation. We’ve already seen an example of a circular economy team hiring a legal policy expert, recognising it’s important to have this knowledge within their team, or hearing people say, “OK, we’ve seen what you are doing, we are going to see how we can work more like that”. This shows the kind of early impact that can lead to later successes, and any measurements of impact will have to be a mixture of qualitative and quantitative findings.</p><p>5. The value of working in an ecosystem</p><p>In co-creating CircuLaw, we’re working in an expanding ecosystem. We’re not just developing ideas internally and then encouraging their adoption within a municipality. Instead we’re forming a team between organisations. The collaboration started between Dm and the city of Amsterdam, but has now expanded to include a variety of public institutions, legal experts and funding partners from across the Netherlands. Together, we’re developing a platform and testing ideas with and for experienced policymakers.</p><p>As a small organisation Dark Matter Labs is able to move with greater agility than a large municipality, but developing CircuLaw requires a range of expertise and experiences. Dm brings strategic designers, system thinkers, developers, visual designers and user experience designers, and CircuLaw requires us to orchestrate an ecosystem of people with deeper policymaking expertise, greater experience of governmental operations, legal expertise and context-related circular economy knowledge.</p><p>We’re still thinking uncompromisingly about what needs to happen, and how it might be possible, but alongside policymakers who’ll work with it every day because if CircuLaw is to have any impact then it needs to be&nbsp;used.</p><p>6. Public tech has to be created with and for&nbsp;humans</p><p>While we began this blog by stating that more assertive approaches are required — top-down, government-led public tech projects cannot expect to be fully embraced. Successful public tech needs to recognise human experience in all of its messiness. While this might occasionally require non-linear co-creation processes, it will ultimately result in products that better reflect the end users’ reality. By entering a process of consistent user testing and iteration, we’ve not only developed a clearer understanding of how policymakers approach their work, but also the transition their work is having to&nbsp;undergo.</p> Next Steps <p>So far, we’ve co-created a small, manageable platform, but to demonstrate viability beyond the Netherlands, CircuLaw will need to cover many more themes, incorporate wider legislation (e.g. EU), and develop a more sophisticated taxonomy of relevant legal instruments. Our ambition is to pass the hosting and running of CircuLaw to a national organisation by the end of 2024, but before that’s possible, there’s still lots of work to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>1. A continuous dialogue with Dutch policymakers</p><p>In order to make CircuLaw part of the Netherlands’ wider circular economy policy landscape we’re collaborating with a community of practice to better understand how policymakers go about their work, to help more fully recognise the practical barriers that policymakers tend to run into when attempting to use instruments, and to create an avenue for feedback. From this we’re looking to establish whether policymakers want extra information, whether they want courses, or workshops or templates to give them increased confidence when navigating the legal and regulatory system.</p><p>2. More themes in more&nbsp;places</p><p>Amsterdam provided a very suitable environment to initiate the CircuLaw platform, but to stand any chance of accelerating the wider circular economy, CircuLaw needs to exist beyond the confines of a single municipality or country. A lot of the regulation currently on the platform also applies to the wider Netherlands but the next step is to begin incorporating EU Law. We’ve already authored <a href="https://openresearch.amsterdam/nl/page/90992/europese-wet--en-regelgeving-circulaire-economie">three white papers</a> on this subject. We’re currently exploring food, solar panels and other product groups as additional themes.</p><p>3. Maintaining the CircuLaw&nbsp;platform</p><p>While we’re still testing and continuously improving the platform, we can be highly responsive in adapting the design and implementing required changes. Once more fully embedded, CircuLaw will require regular maintenance in order to expand thematically, ensure that information is kept up to date, and allow users to submit feedback and access support when required. In order to remain open and accessible to public sector users and other circular economy actors, we imagine the type of organisation that would host CircuLaw for the long term needs to maintain a non-commercial model, and without a&nbsp;paywall.</p><p>4. Improving the methodology and its execution</p><p>The current execution of the legal analysis methodology requires time and capacity; it’s human endeavour. No doubt much of this will always remain the case; but for the CircuLaw approach to be replicable, scalable and easy to update we’re looking to see what parts of this methodology could be done in more efficient ways; we are hoping to explore possibilities in AI and Natural Language Processing to improve and accelerate legal analysis and translation capabilities, alongside the more creative research&nbsp;work.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you’d like to know more, or have suggestions, questions or thoughts then get in touch with <a href="mailto:Romy@darkmatterlabs.org">Romy@darkmatterlabs.org</a> — as this project is part of a collective endeavour to accelerate the transition to a more circular economy (and to transitioning to a just, regenerative economy more in general), we are keen to hear any feedback that can help us and others learn to achieve these goals together.</p><p>The current platform is mostly in Dutch, but we’re working on translating it into English.

     <p>For consumers, organizations and companies alike, the topic of digital security has become increasingly paramount in recent years, especially with the rise of digital fraud and scams. With this in mind, Allan Foster’s upcoming session, “Does Trust Matter?” at the <a>IdentityNorth 2023 Spring Symposium</a> is generating significant interest.</p>
<p>As a retired identity and digital security professional with a career spanning 40 years leading and guiding teams at Apple, Netscape, AOL, Guru Associates, Microsoft, Intel and Sun Microsystems, Foster has an extensive background in the field. He most recently served as the Vice President of Global Partner Success at ForgeRock, a leading provider of digital identity solutions. His wealth of knowledge and experience make him well-equipped to discuss the key trends and tactics impacting the digital environment on a global scale.</p>
<p>One of the main issues Foster will address at the <a>virtual two-day event</a> is the importance of securing digital identities. As more people conduct business and social activities online, it is becoming more crucial to protect against scams and social engineering. This is especially true in Canada, where digital fraud is on the rise. Foster will provide insights into the tactics and technologies that can be used to protect consumers and organizations in this critical time.</p>
<p>Additionally, Foster will also delve into the darker side of identity. As he has noted in the past, “One of the problems of identity is that it has a very dark side in as much as it enables authoritarianism.” This statement underscores the importance of understanding the complexities of digital identity and the need for responsible practices.</p>
<p>Foster’s session is <a>just one of the many compelling presentations</a> being offered at the symposium and the event as a whole promises to be an engaging and informative learning and networking opportunity for digital security professionals &amp; experts and anyone interested in digital security and identity.</p>
<p>Attendees can expect to gain valuable insights into the current state of digital security, as well as practical strategies for protecting their businesses, and personal digital properties and platforms against fraud and scams. In addition to Allan Foster’s session, there is a full stream during the Spring Symposium dedicated to Safeguarding Digital Infrastructure/Cybersecurity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/2023-spring-symposium-registration-474869566657">Register for the IdentityNORTH Spring Symposium</a> to hear Allan Foster and other Canadian and international leaders driving Canada’s digital future.</p>

 Why Trade&nbsp;Crypto? <p>While there are many reasons that people become interested in trading cryptocurrencies, the following are three main reasons that attract investors:</p>  portfolio diversification from traditional financial assets  high volatility opportunities  around-the-clock 🕚 24/7 trading activity.  <p>Algorithmic trading can help you stay solvent in this non-stop financial market. Why? Because algorithms can trade at all times, even while you are sleeping! 😴 To start your algorithmic trading journey, we offer you a momentum strategy using the Simple Moving Average (SMA). We will also introduce Ocean Protocol, an open-source data sharing ecosystem of tools that can allow traders to sell the output price predictions of their algorithms!</p>Figure 1. Golden and Death Cross technical indicators are shown on a time series chart of BTCUSD&nbsp;prices. What are Golden &amp; Death&nbsp;Crosses? <p>What does SMA have to do with golden and death crosses in trading? What are they? A golden cross is a bullish indicator that happens when the SMA 50 crosses above the SMA 200. Why is that bullish? <a href="https://emojipedia.org/ox/">🐂</a> Because the SMA 50 moves faster relative to recent price changes than the SMA 200, so this cross shows that the latest prices are moving upward. 📈 The opposite case, when the SMA 50 moves below the SMA 200, is a death cross and is a bearish indicator 🧸 that indicates a downward trend in the latest prices.&nbsp;📉</p><p>Golden and Death crosses are shown in Fig&nbsp;1.</p> The Simple Moving Average Explained Simply!&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/teacher/">🧑‍🏫</a> <p>So how is the SMA calculated? SMA is the average of a time series of prices in a window of a fixed length. The technique is called “moving” because the window slides in accordance with the time series. A time window of 200 days is typically used for computing the “historical trend” and a window of 50 days is used to compute the “current trend” in golden/death cross strategies. Of course, it is possible to form a golden or death cross interpretation on different SMA indicators, such as the SMA 5 versus the SMA 20 for higher frequency trading decisions for example. In this tutorial, however, we will stick with the traditional SMA 50 and 200 day indicators. We’ll show you how this works in the code&nbsp;below!</p> Let’s Trade! <p>Using the SMA 50 &amp; 200 day indicators, we show you a quick algorithm to detect that glorious Golden cross buying signal 💰 and ominous Death cross selling signal 💀. Check it out&nbsp;below:</p> <br># Get 201 days of data<br>eth = get_ethereum_201_days_data()<br><br># Use 200 days to compute SMAs from the day before<br>sma_day_before_200 = sum(eth[:200]) / len(eth[:200])<br>sma_day_before_50 = sum(eth[:50]) / len(eth[:50])<br><br># Use 200 days to compute SMAs from the current day<br>sma_current_day_200 = sum(eth[1:]) / len(eth[1:])<br>sma_current_day_50 = sum(eth[1:]) / len(eth[1:])<br><br># Detect Cross<br>day_before_diff = sma_day_before_50 - sma_day_before_200<br>current_day_diff = sma_current_day_50 - sma_current_day_200<br><br># Golden Cross<br>if day_before_diff &lt; 0 and current_day_diff &gt; 0:<br> advice “buy”<br># Death Cross<br>else if day_before_diff &gt; 0 and current_day_diff &lt; 0:<br> advice “sell”<br># No Cross<br>else:<br> advice “do nothing”  On Maximizing Profit <p>Did you know that you can tune the window length for the SMA calculation to optimize your&nbsp;profits?</p><p>We show you how to do a grid search using different SMA time windows over the last 6 years of historical ETH data to find optimal buying and selling points. This way, we select the time window with the highest returns for the trading strategy.</p><p>The Grid Search Algorithm:</p>  Select multiple combinations of time windows to compute historical and current trends. The historical trend window should range from 10 to 210 days with a step of 10 days, while the current trend window should range from 5 to 50 days with a step of 5&nbsp;days.  Perform the trading strategy for each combination. Simulate transactions for a year, from January to December, at the beginning of which the trading return and investment are zero. Execute purchases and sells during the year based on the algorithm signals, and calculate the return on the last day of December for each&nbsp;year.  Obtain a return value for each combination of time window. Analyze the results by averaging the returns per year and per window combination to determine which window size combination consistently yields the highest returns across&nbsp;years.  <p>The colorful Figure 2 below shows all the different time windows we tried in our grid search for trading over 6 years. The brighter the color, the higher the percentage of total return. And guess what? We found out that the sweet spot for computing the current trend is between 10 and 20 days, while for historical trend it’s between 30 and 50 days. Time to put our findings to good use and capitalize on&nbsp;them!</p>Figure 2. Percentage return of trading with given different SMA window combinations. Monetizing Your Asset with Ocean Protocol&nbsp;🌊 <p>Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem of open-source tools that share datasets and algorithms on the blockchain. 🐙🐬 In this tutorial, we’ll publish our algorithm as an NFT with metadata on the blockchain and a corresponding “datatoken” to gate access to the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>Learn more about Ocean Protocol in the <a href="https://www.oceanacademy.io/">Ocean&nbsp;Academy</a>.</p> Minting an algorithm “dataNFT” <p>It’s trivial to mint your trading strategy algorithm on the blockchain as a “dataNFT’’ using Ocean Protocol’s Python library, ocean-lib! At the same time we mint the NFT, ocean-lib will also create a datatoken that controls access to this NFT. We’ll be able to sell copies of this datatoken on the blockchain to immediately monetize our algorithm!</p><p>First, we pip install the Ocean Python&nbsp;Library.</p> $ python -m pip install ocean-lib <p>Type ‘python’ in your terminal to open up the Python console. Let’s code some&nbsp;Python!</p> $ python <p>Then, we’ll import all the libraries we need &amp; setup our blockchain as Polygon’s Mumbai test network for this tutorial:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.web3_internal.utils import connect_to_network<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; connect_to_network("polygon-test") # mumbai is "polygon-test"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from brownie.network import accounts<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.example_config import get_config_dict<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime, timedelta<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; from ocean_lib.models.compute_input import ComputeInput<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import pickle<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; import os <p>Next, you can choose whether to connect your wallet to your system’s environmental variables so that you can use it to pay for the gas fees. Or, you can use Bob to act as the wallet’s owner, as shown in the below code. Note that if you use Bob, then you will have to give him fake Matic to pay for gas. You can put his address in at <a href="https://faucet.polygon.technology/">https://faucet.polygon.technology/</a></p> &gt;&gt;&gt; config = get_config_dict("polygon-test")<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ocean = Ocean(config)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; accounts.clear()<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; bob_private_key = os.getenv('REMOTE_TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2')<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; bob = accounts.add(bob_private_key) <p>Upload your SMA cross strategy algorithm to an open repository (for a full SMA algorithm example, please see the Addendum). The public URL to this file will be encrypted by Ocean so that purchasers of the NFT only get the output of the algorithm instead of the algorithm itself.</p><p>To publish the algorithm NFT + Metadata + datatoken using the algorithm’s URL, do the following:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_url = "YOUR_PUBLIC_URL_HERE"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; name = "golden_death_crosses_recommender"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; (ALGO_data_nft, ALGO_datatoken, ALGO_ddo) = ocean.assets.create_algo_asset(<br>    name,<br>    ALGO_url,<br>    {"from": bob},<br>    image="pandas/pandas",<br>    tag="pip-all",<br>    checksum="sha256:f85d01f3455431325b7b5b7b18ff26d88c0ca9f9f45383b9147fe596e90917ce",<br>    wait_for_aqua=True<br>)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f"ALGO_ddo did = '{ALGO_ddo.did}'") <p>Once your algorithm is published as an asset on the blockchain, we’ll create a compute service to run your algorithm on a dataset. At the end, we will only sell the output of your algorithm, rather than the algorithm asset&nbsp;itself.</p><p>For this tutorial, you can use the Data asset referenced in this <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0dac5eb4965fb2b485181671adbf3a23b0133abf71d2775eda8043e8efc92d19">link</a> which is free to&nbsp;use.</p><p>Side note: This data asset provides 1000 hours of ETH price, meaning that the algorithm is not going to be able to use windows greater than 42&nbsp;days.</p><p>To add a compute service to the data&nbsp;asset:</p> &gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_did = "ALGORITHM_DID_HERE"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; DATA_did = "DATA_DID_HERE"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; DATA_ddo = ocean.assets.resolve(DATA_did)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; ALGO_ddo = ocean.assets.resolve(ALGO_did)<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compute_service = DATA_ddo.services[1]<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; compute_service.add_publisher_trusted_algorithm(ALGO_ddo)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; DATA_ddo = ocean.assets.update(DATA_ddo, {"from": bob}) <p>Whichever data asset you use, make sure to have permissions for the Data asset to attach a compute service to it.

<p>Sharing about the March online developer training and student experiences.</p> What <p>This March the Holochain Foundation, collaborating with our education partner Mythosthesia, hosted a four day, online developer training. This training focused on giving developers the skills needed to develop Holochain applications in a clean, simple, and robust manner; and it taught them to reason about distributed systems from an agent-centric perspective.</p><p>The weekend following the training we held a two day build event where the newly minted Holochain devs could test their skills and demo their projects.</p> Who <p>Holochain partnered with Mythosthesia, the new venture by Marcus Philips who co-founded <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hack Reactor</a> and experienced dev educator Muhammad Meigooni, in order to provide world-class instruction to our community. Marcus and Muhammad are really passionate about Holochain and it has been a pleasure working with them to develop this course. </p><p>Attending the event was an experienced cohort of 18 developers, which ranged from folks who had been developing on Holochain for years to those totally new to the community. Preparing for this training we conducted extensive tech checks (including a solid grasp of the Rust programming language) and culture interviews to ensure that everyone taking the course would be able to get the most from it and that they could grow into valuable community members.</p> What Was Built <p>Our build weekend was short. With only a day and a half of build time before the demo, none of the projects demonstrated had reached an MVP status. However, this is only partially due to the limited time. The developers also chose large and potentially impactful projects that were never meant to be completed in a weekend, ones they all seem dedicated to continuing work on. Their thinking and progress on these projects is inspiring. </p><p>While we could gush about how incredible this cohort of developers is, we would prefer to simply show you. The following are some highlights from the demo.</p> Short Demo Descriptions <p>Harlan Wood has been working on the <a href="https://github.com/trustgraph?ref=blog.holochain.org">TrustGraph</a> technology for Holochain over the last year, but at the build days he got it working with a live application. TrustGraph is a reputation system built for platform interoperability that leans into peer-to-peer networks through its transitive trust algorithm which can be used for things like feed filtering. <br><br>Watch this quick video to learn more about how TrustGraph might be used:</p><p>John Hopkins started mapping out a DID implementation for Holochain. We won’t speak about this too much right now because identity is such a huge topic and we have separate updates about that coming, but it was encouraging to see a dev, new to the framework, who was thinking about a lot of the same things we have been.</p><p>Matt Gabrenya started creating a registry of composable app elements that developers could use to create unique arrangements, easily pulling these elements together. This reminded us of the composable applets of We but for the development layer rather than the user layer.</p><p>Without there being a direct connection between the two projects, we can already imagine how this might interface with <a href="https://www.generativeobjects.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Generative Objects</a> (GO) founder Walter Almeida’s work. He came to this training with the express intent of integrating Holochain into GO’s Meta Modeler so that it is possible to generate custom Holochain applications in a low code environment. Customizable Holochain applications that anyone can build and publish without needing years of developer experience? Yes please. We’ll definitely keep you up to date as these projects progress.<br><br>There was also a crop of projects focused on financial applications.<br><br>Joshua Vial and Nicholas Stebbings designed the fundamentals of an app that would make it easy to bootstrap an authority list, based on social trust structures, that would serve to authenticate cross chain and cross DHT transactions, ensuring that ledgers on both sides of an exchange were updated appropriately. Meanwhile Julien Lucca, Ross Eyre, Ché Coelho, and Leo Proechel worked on a credit clearing algorithm that uses agent-centric methods to find debt cycles in B2B contexts and cancel them out. Even the course instructor Marcus Philips spent time refining the design for a protocol he started for a Transitive Favor Network. This would be a radically peer-to-peer currency protocol where each individual would only need agreed-on systems of value exchange with their direct neighbors, but which would allow strangers to still exchange with each other by finding connections through the social graph. </p><p>Watch this video of Julian, Ross, Che, and Leo describing their Credit Clearing Algorithm:</p> Course Reviews <p>How did the course turn out? Rather then trying to explain a group’s shared experience, we’ll just quote a few of the responses from the students’ course feedback forms:</p><blockquote>“I thought this was a really excellent way to gain an introduction to Holochain, and it definitely left me with a thirst to learn more. I think the curriculum is well thought out and gives the perfect HDK 101.” —John Hopkins</blockquote><blockquote>“A very cohesive bunch of minds gathered with a yearning for more knowledge and discovery — which makes for a refreshing classroom experience. It is clear that the choice of cohort and instructors was very well considered and this has led to a wealth of knowledge in the room, and excellent coordination throughout.” —Nicholas Stebbings</blockquote><blockquote>“I can't think of another class or training I've been in where I enjoy the community as much as I have in this class. I have learned so much from the questions and side conversations.” —Patrick Winfield</blockquote><blockquote>“This course has been invaluable and incredibly empowering. It has also been a super-collision of incredibly competent and fascinating folk.” —Ché Coelho</blockquote><blockquote>“Super fun and useful! Definitely exceeded my expectations. The course is super grounding and down to earth — getting all the way down to DHT ops and all the way up to capability claims.” —Anon</blockquote><blockquote>“The course is great. It provides a thorough grounding in the conceptual building blocks of Holochain, along with the practical tools and experience to build working apps. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how Holochain works, what it can do, and how to make it do those things.” —Anon</blockquote><blockquote>“The Holochain developer immersive has been exceptionally stimulating. It's helped to solidify my understanding of distributed systems in general and has led to a deeper appreciation of the HC architecture and its potentially integral role in bringing digital technologies into alignment with the human-social organism. Our studio intends to become active developers and supporters of the ecosystem.” —Ross Eyre</blockquote><blockquote>“This is an excellent technical deep-dive for developers who wish to write Rust code based directly on the HDK. It is well-constructed, descriptive, paced excellently, and presented by very knowledgeable and passionate people.” —Acea Spades Black</blockquote> A Self-Paced Online Course <p>We expect to have more dev training sessions in the future, but in the meantime we are producing a self-paced, online course available to anyone who wants to learn to develop on Holochain. </p><p>This course will consist of recordings from the March dev training so that you get the same information and education that we provided to this past cohort. You’ll need to know some Rust, and there won’t be the hands-on element, but by supplementing your experience with online build events, Discord office hours, and the support of our thriving developer community, we think that this course will help you grow as a Holochain developer.<br><br><a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/QQoJ4s3D?ref=blog.holochain.org">Fill out this interest form</a> and we’ll let you know when the course is live.</p>

<p>Not only that, but with SelfKey iD, users may have complete control over their digital identities and they might exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> rights more easily than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 How does SelfKey iD work? 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD is a smooth and hassle-free process that prioritizes user convenience without compromising security and privacy. The streamlined procedure may ensure that users have access to a secure and private digital identity that they can trust.</p>
 The process&nbsp; 
<p>By following the simple steps outlined by the platform, users can obtain a SelfKey iD quickly and with ease. The steps are as follows:</p>
 
  Users must first log in with their wallet and pay an entry fee.&nbsp; 
  The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
 
  Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved. 
  The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It might serve as proof of identity and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
 Attaching NFT series to SelfKey iD 
<p>SelfKey continues to prioritize user-friendliness with the introduction of a unique feature that may enable users to attach a distinct NFT series to their SelfKey iD profile picture. This feature may add a touch of personalization and uniqueness to the user's digital identity. Even more, it might reflect the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may also enhance the user's experience by providing them with more options to personalize and showcase their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform reflects the platform's continued focus on user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
 Access to SelfKey DAO 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD may provide users with numerous benefits that enhance their experience on the platform and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits may include:</p>
 
 access to the governance of the SelfKey Protocol. 
 the ability to mint SELF tokens. 
 participating in staking. 
 exclusive access to member-only channels on Discord. 
 obtaining exclusive collectible NFT packs. 
 registering for KEY.ETH ENS domains. 
 enjoying instant login to partner apps. 
 
 Minting SELF tokens 
<p>Having access to the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. The token might then be used for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may add value to the user's experience and may provide them with more control over their digital identity.</p>
 Staking 
<p>By staking KEY tokens on their KYC credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Staking on credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials. Users may withdraw tokens at any time, although this will result in the termination of SELF token generation.</p>
 Exclusive Discord Channels 
<p>Access to member-only Discord channels may be another perk of having a SelfKey iD. It may provide users with a community to engage with other DAO members through a designated channel. DAO members may also discuss proposals for the governance of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
 NTF packs 
<p>Exclusive collectible NFT packs may also be available to SelfKey iD holders. This may add a unique and personalized touch to their digital identity. These collectibles are released by the SelfKey DAO, further enhancing their customization and originality.</p>
 KEY.ETH ENS domains and SelfKey iD 
<p>Moreover, SelfKey iD holders may register for KEY.ETH ENS domains. This might enable them to create unique and easily identifiable domains for their online identity.</p>
 Instant login to partner apps 
<p>Instant login to partner apps may be another advantage of having a SelfKey iD. This may provide users with a seamless and secure login process across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of having a SelfKey iD express the platform's commitment to providing users with a comprehensive, valuable experience. It may enhance their ability to navigate the crypto space with ease and confidence.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In theory, SelfKey iD may be a strong and reliable form of digital identity that might be used for a broad range of use cases in the crypto world. With its focus on user-friendliness, security, and privacy, the SelfKey iD may be well-suited to the needs of decentralized societies and Web3 applications.</p>
<p>However, SelfKey iD may also be suited for traditional Web2 platforms that want to benefit from security and anti-bot features inherent to the SelfKey iD system.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may not only empower the governance of the SelfKey DAO but it may also provide a model for other decentralized governance systems. By offering powerful, privacy-preserving identity credentials, the SelfKey iD might enable more fair and democratic governance. This way, users may have greater control over their data and identities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to provide new forms of decentralized governance, which may allow members to experiment with different approaches and explore the full potential of the SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the crypto world continues to evolve, the SelfKey iD might play an increasingly important role in enabling secure and transparent transactions across a wide range of platforms and applications.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 27th March to 2nd&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we delve into South Dakota’s unsuccessful attempt to pass a crypto regulation bill, the SEC Chairman’s concerns over cryptocurrency compliance in the market, the EU’s implementation of a 1,000 Euro ceiling on crypto transfers, and the Central Bank of Bahrain’s updated crypto asset framework.</p><p>Let’s dive into this week’s recap without forgetting that along the ever-evolving regulatory landscape, we need to safeguard the ecosystem’s true&nbsp;ethos.</p> South Dakota Fails to Pass Crypto Regulation Bill <p>The South Dakota House could not overturn Governor Kristi Noem’s veto of a proposed bill to establish government regulations for utilizing cryptocurrency within the state. This means there are no changes to South Dakota’s regulatory approach towards cryptocurrency, resulting in the state maintaining its current&nbsp;policy.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1640760891367981078?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Although the bill had made its way through the legislative process, it faced opposition from some who perceived the proposed regulations as a means of enabling government surveillance and overstepping boundaries.</p><p>The opponents argued that they require more time to observe the outcomes of similar legislation in other states before making a final decision.</p> SEC Chairman Cites Cryptocurrency Compliance Concerns in the&nbsp;Market <p>Speaking at the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, US SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said that rules for the crypto market already exist and are called securities regulations. However, the industry is still “rife with noncompliance.”</p><p>He also reiterated his stance that the majority of coins should be classified as securities.</p><p>In its dealings with the cryptocurrency industry, the SEC has adopted a “regulation by enforcement” strategy, targeting firms and projects dealing with what the agency deems as unregistered securities.</p><p>Gensler further emphasized that the SEC needs new tools, expertise, and resources to address misconduct in emerging and new areas, including the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>He added that the additional staff would allow the SEC’s Enforcement Division to investigate wrongdoing on a larger scale and accelerate the pace of enforcement investigations to resolution.</p> EU Implements 1,000 Euro Ceiling on Crypto Transfers <p>The European Parliament is implementing a large-scale overhaul of money laundering laws with the approval of three new draft&nbsp;bills.</p><p>The first adopted text requires crypto asset managers to identify their customers and associated risks, limiting anonymous crypto transfers to 1000&nbsp;euros.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1640700969955602434?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>Lawmakers have approved limits on payments by unverified crypto users as part of the money laundering overhaul.</p><p>The second text requires EU member-states to establish a financial intelligence unit to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>The third text establishes a new supervisory and investigative money laundering authority to directly supervise the riskiest crypto service providers in the EU&nbsp;bloc.</p><p>The upcoming MiCA bill will complement these new bills, introducing a new legislative framework for cryptocurrency businesses and incorporating the FATF’s Travel Rule for crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Central Bank of Bahrain Updates Crypto Asset Framework <p>The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) has introduced updates to its Crypto-assets (“CRA”) Module. The amendments were made after due consultation with industry stakeholders to cater to ongoing developments in the crypto market and comply with industry best practices.</p><p>Their objective is to bolster investor protection and align the crypto-assets market’s development with the Kingdom’s Economic Recovery Plan, as outlined by the&nbsp;CBB.</p><p>The amendments expand the scope of the framework to include digital token offerings, which the CBB will regulate if they exhibit the characteristics of security.</p><p>The CBB will determine whether a digital token qualifies as security by examining its underlying economic purpose, structure, characteristics, and rights attached to the&nbsp;token.</p><p>The amendments also outline new requirements to enhance safeguarding clients’ assets and allow crypto-assets licensees to engage in additional activities after obtaining the CBB’s approval.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/australias-latest-crypto-bill-explained">Australia’s Latest Crypto Bill Explained</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1641855759720775710?s=20">Monthly Overview — March&nbsp;2023</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Was GDPR v1.0 the data protection solution everyone hoped for? Let’s explore how General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) didn’t live up to our expectations. And let’s also ask the important question; will GDPR v2.0 be able to solve the issues?</p>
<p>After a near decade of pulling back and forth, the balance in the tug-of-war between monetising personal information and safeguarding it took a major step towards the latter. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and its enforcement from 2018 was a watershed moment in global technology regulation. It forced even multinational organisations to take personal information seriously or risk possible penalties reaching up to 4% of annual global turnover. Overnight, the GDPR became Brussels officials’ poster child of powerful legislation. One that could show that all organisations need to abide by the law just as much as one-person start-ups. However, in the five years since the GDPR entered into force, it has become clear that the GDPR wasn’t the solution we thought it was. Serious concerns and numerous loopholes have been discovered by privacy activists, technology experts and even national privacy watchdogs alike.</p>
 Current issues with GDPR 
<p>The core problem is that under the GDPR, all companies, including the tech giants, are overseen by the national regulator in the EU country in which they are headquartered. In practical terms, this so-called “one-stop shop rule” directs most of the major compliance investigations run through the Irish and Luxembourgian systems, because the largest technology companies, such as Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, have all set up their European headquarters in one of these two countries (due to favourable taxation and other legislation). This in return results in EU-wide precedents that reflect the political climate of only two countries, not 27.</p>
<p>Both Ireland and Luxembourg have faced mounting criticism in the recent years for slow, and even lax, enforcement which they officially deny. However, claims of lax enforcement does not equal no enforcement, the Irish data authority has recently imposed a &gt;$200M <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/irish-data-protection-authority-gives-eu-397-billion-present-meta">fine against Meta</a>. Meta however earns a million dollars every 15 minutes, and therefore we are back at the same problems we had before the GDPR. That ignoring the law can be very profitable, and private individuals still have little leverage to safeguard their privacy online.</p>
<p>To my mind this brings us to a very unpleasant question – is the GDPR really a tool for safeguarding EU residents’ privacy, or a tool for punishing US-based multinationals?</p>
<p>It is 2023, and year after year there is talk about EU-wide class actions and seemingly widespread support for them. Yet the actual legislation fails to materialise again and again. Retaliating against the big US-based multinationals for disregarding the European Commission is one thing. But making me, as a private individual, decipher corporate structures and hunt for the correct competent authorities is another problem.</p>
 Evolution of the GDPR 
<p>The European Union is finally taking concrete steps in fixing the dysfunctionalities of its poster child. The solution? More legislation.</p>
<p>The now 7-year-old law will get a facelift before summer 2023. The solution seeks to correct its glaring problem: the extremely lop-sided way that Irish, and to a lesser extent Luxembourgian, data protection commission and courts can steer the entire 27-country bloc.</p>
<p>The details are unfortunately scantly available. The official take is that the new legislation will “harmonize some aspects of the administrative procedure” in cross-border cases and “support a smooth functioning of the GDPR cooperation and dispute resolution mechanisms”, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13745-Further-specifying-procedural-rules-relating-to-the-enforcement-of-the-General-Data-Protection-Regulation_en">as the Commission explains</a>. Simply put, it seeks to end the jurisdiction shopping inside the 27-country bloc.</p>
<p>However, fixing failed regulation with more regulation can often end up doing the opposite. So why not take the chance to simply state that; EU Data Subjects may choose to use their home jurisdiction. While proceeding to combine the GDPR, the ePrivacy directive (aka the “EU cookie law”), and even the 3Q2023 Data Governance Act, to ensure that there are no conflicting requirements. One could possibly dare to wish for a plethora of improvements from the perspective of private EU residents, but so far, the silence is deafening.</p>
 How the improvements will help individuals/businesses 
<p>It is clear that the precedents cannot rest solely on two countries’ shoulders in a union of 27 countries. For us private individuals, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction. Any organisation that is clearly GDPR compliant will not face any issues, and ending jurisdiction ­shopping will level the playing field between local organisations and big multinationals. It will be interesting to see what, if any, effect the new legislation will have on the EU-US relations regarding privacy protections as well. But we might have to wait until the, seemingly inevitable, Schrems III case goes through the court system to find out whether the EU-US data protection tug-of-war will finally end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one should keep hybrid (cloud + on-premises) solutions in mind when deciding where and how to process any personal data. Hybrid solutions can bring the best of the two worlds, geographically determined identity data residency with cloud-based IAM capabilities, as explained in more detail in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/understanding-hybrid-cloud/" title="Understanding hybrid cloud">Understanding hybrid cloud</a>.</p>

			 Crisis Resilience: How Tokenization Could Empower Banks 
<p>The recent bank crisis has sparked concerns and uncertainty in the financial world. With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, and the collapses of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank. We want to share some of our views on the role tokenization may play in the future of banking.</p>
 Bank Runs: Crisis Calls for Transparency and Trust 
<p>Countless bank runs have occurred throughout financial history, as&nbsp;no bank can survive a situation where a large number of depositors demand repayment simultaneously. Banks mostly generate income by lending deposited funds at higher interest rates; they cannot maintain enough cash reserves to cover all deposits at once.</p>
 The Twitter-era Bank Crisis Spreads Contagiously Faster Than Ever 
<p>Swift information dissemination via social media and mobile banking accelerates the potential for bank runs. In a single day, Silicon Valley Bank’s customers withdrew $42 billion, far exceeding the largest bank run in modern U.S. history, which happened at Washington Mutual in 2008 and totaled $16.7 billion but took 10 days to transpire.</p>
<p>As the banking crisis continues, people are increasingly distrustful of keeping their money in banks, as illustrated by the following chart.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/templatedata/article/generic/data/en/CIO/032023/230327CIOP.xml?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8o29LGsAwykYDlGGDppfQnYM6HnQ1ZRTOiXAwCM4rCWbn3Vtey9nrrBfAM5sg7Zo-C8_m8">According to DBS</a>, in 2023, US commercial banks experienced their largest deposit drop in four decades, surpassing even the 1981 Volcker-era decline.&nbsp;This situation calls for banks to enhance risk management and transparency to regain depositors’ trust.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Money Moves To Money Market Funds 
<p>Depositors are shifting money to money market funds&nbsp;due to concerns about banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank, investing in long-term government bonds, which experienced losses when sold to meet depositor demands. Additionally,&nbsp;money market funds offer attractive yields,&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">some are over 4%</a>, significantly higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">0.37% FDIC-reported rate&nbsp;</a>for bank deposits. Financial Times reported that money market funds have received over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/032523bc-3b92-4b94-b6b8-ebbe1d606b2c?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">$286 billion in inflows during March</a>, as depicted in the chart below. It marks the largest month of inflows since the Covid-19 crisis began.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;money market funds can tokenize their assets to rapidly gain market share&nbsp;and even take it a step further by allowing tokenized funds to be used as collateral. This is precisely what J.P. Morgan and BlackRock achieved l<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/jpmorgan-finds-new-use-for-blockchain-in-collateral-settlement?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">ast May</a>, settling their first transaction using tokenized money market funds as collateral, paving the way for bridging Traditional Finance (TraFi) with Decentralized Finance (DeFi).</p>
 Tokenization: Steering Institutions Towards Crisis Resilience 
<p>The internet has revolutionized the way we exchange information, but the transfer of value has remained relatively unchanged, especially in private markets.&nbsp;Tokenization provides the solution to allow value to be exchanged efficiently and securely, empowering banks and institutions to navigate financial crises. Let’s list a few benefits:</p>
 
 Transparency: Tokenization offers an immutable and publicly accessible record of asset ownership and movement, boosting investor confidence and accountability in banks’ portfolios and balance sheets. We saw a similar trend in cryptos post-FTX with the emergence of “proof-of-reserves” by exchanges and new services from data providers such as Chainlink. 
 Real-time rebalancing: Tokenization enables the atomic settlement of securities, granting banks greater flexibility and resilience during liquidity crises by enabling rapid asset trades. 
 Dynamic Portfolio:&nbsp;Tokenization allows banks to create extensive, diversified portfolios. Private assets have been overperforming public assets for years. Tokenization is transforming private markets with a shared infrastructure that enables seamless global trading of private assets. Consequently, banks can strengthen risk resilience by investing across various regions and markets. 
 24/7 Automated Risk Management:&nbsp;Tokenized securities enable banks to deploy smart contracts for automating risk strategies and processes, providing continuous monitoring and automatic adjustments to portfolios when predefined conditions are met. 
 DeFi Bailouts:&nbsp;As blockchain-savvy investors move towards DeFi for its transparency and code-based approach, banks could potentially leverage DeFi for refinancing and assistance during crises in the future, once massive adoption is realized. 
 
<p>The recent bank crisis has exposed the weaknesses in traditional banking systems and the need for change. As the future of securities is tokenization, it would certainly play an important role in the future of banking crises; as we explore, the benefits and challenges will be more clear.</p>

<p>The proposed changes focus on actions to be taken by competent authorities in the following areas:</p>



  cooperation between authorities, other stakeholders and prudential supervisors; 



 supervisory expectations should follow a consistent approach when supervision of institutions is the subject of multiple authorities; 



 train their staff to have all necessary expertise and technical knowledge to properly conduct their tasks for the supervision of crypto-assets service providers. 
 <p>They also expand on:</p>



  sources of information available to competent authorities when supervising crypto-asset service providers (CASPs /VASPs); 



 „how competent authorities should determine the type of guidance needed within the sector and how to communicate this guidance in the most effective manner” 
 <p>Amendments in the following areas are proposed:</p>



<p>1. ‘Subject matter, scope and definitions’</p>



<p>2. Guideline 4.1 ‘Implementing the RBS model’</p>



<p>3. Guideline 4.2 ‘Step 1 – Identification of risk and mitigating factors’</p>



<p>4. Guideline 4.3 ‘Step 2 – Risk assessment’</p>



<p>5. Guideline 4.4 ‘Step 3 – Supervision’</p>



<p>6. Guideline 4.5 ‘Step 4 – Monitoring and updating of the RBS model’</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020, many organizations were forced to digitize at a speed exceeding their security capabilities. Remote work meant that employees accessed company networks from potentially unsafe end devices. Today, many in the e-commerce business work in a hybrid mode – partly from home, partly from the office – and are thus potential insider threats.</p>
<p>According to today’s guest in our Speaker Spotlight, Rajan Barara, Director of Product Management for Identity at Entrust, Zero Trust can help mitigate the risk of insider threats. At its core, Zero Trust stipulates that trust should never be the default setting and that access requests should always be verified. This can also mean, that employees should in most instances have the least possible access privileges and be granted access just in time (JIT).</p>
<p>Together with Wolfgang Goerlich, Advisory CISO for Cisco Secure, Gerald Horst, Partner Digital Identity EMEA at PwC, and Michael Jones, Identity Standards Architect at Microsoft, Rajan will discuss the future of Zero Trust in a panel entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5335/2">Zero Trust: Where do We Want to be in Five Years?</a> at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023.</p>

<p>Do you know who your customers are? This sounds like a trick question, but it isn’t. Although organizations are required to have Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks baked into their interactions with customers, the degree of certainty around a customer’s identity isn’t always as high as it should be. Identity theft is a pervasive problem, and it leads to many challenges for banks, lenders, insurance carriers, and other financial institutions. Reported instances of fraudsters using stolen identity information to open new bank accounts under a victim's name grew by 32% in 2022 in the U.S. according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/CSN-Data-Book-2022.pdf">FTC</a> to over 110,000 cases – in each of these situations, the bank’s KYC/AML process failed. Meanwhile, in the UK, instances of credit card ID theft, where a criminal either opens a new card using a stolen identity or takes over a genuine account in good standing, were up 101% YoY midway through 2022 according to <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-10/Half%20year%20fraud%20update%202022.pdf">UK Finance</a>, with a reported gross loss of £21.4m in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These financial crimes are costly to consumers and financial institutions alike. For financial services organizations, a failure to verify their customers’ identity in situations such as these carries a reputational cost, too – so it’s important to get it right.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Adding authentication to public clients such as Single Page Applications (SPA) and JavaScript applications can be a source of confusion. Identity Providers like Okta try to help you via multiple support systems. Still, it can feel like a lot of work. Especially since you’re responsible for way more than authentication alone in the applications you work on!</p>

<p>As part of authentication, your client application makes multiple calls to an authorization server, and you get back several strings, which are tokens. Let’s demystify what’s going on behind the scenes and closely examine what those tokens are and how you use them within your client application.</p>

 Authentication and Authorization using OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC) 
<p>OAuth 2.0 with OIDC is the best practice for adding authentication and authorization to your software applications. Authentication verifies the identity of who you claim to be, and authorization verifies you have access to data you want to see or actions you want to perform. It is lightweight with less effort to set up and use than Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an alternate authentication and authorization mechanism that pre-existing systems may use. For newer systems, you’ll want to use OAuth 2.0 + OIDC.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OAuth 2.0 handles authorization to resources, such as when your front-end application gets data from a backend API by making an HTTP request. OAuth 2.0 standards have the flexibility to support authorization across your entire application system through different flows and grant types. For example, different OAuth 2.0 flows support JavaScript-based front-end applications, for your APIs and back-end services to communicate, and even for IOT devices in your home automation system. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer on OAuth 2.0 that provides standardized identity information.</p>

 OAuth 2.0 + OIDC for JavaScript clients and SPA 
<p>SPAs and other JavaScript front-ends are public clients, which means they can’t maintain secret information for authorization, unlike a confidential client. A confidential client (such as a traditional server-rendered web app) can keep super secret information such as a Client Secret for authorization. In both application types, we should use a flow called Authorization Code and an extension to the flow called Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).</p>

<p>Let’s see how this flow works step-by-step following what happens when a cute dinosaur named Sunny prepares to sign in to the “Rawr” app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The client application starts the process and generates a random, long string — the code verifier. Then it creates a code challenge from the code verifier. This step is part of the PKCE extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The client application holds on to the code verifier. It then makes an authorization code request to your authorization server, in this case, represented by Okta. The authorization code request includes the code challenge along with some critical pieces of information, such as</p>
 
   Client ID 
   Scopes, including at least the following:
     
       <code>openid</code> required for specifying the app uses OIDC in verifying the user’s identity 
       <code>profile</code> for accessing the user’s profile information, such as their name 
       <code>offline_access</code> to request a Refresh Token as part of this call 
     
   
   Redirect URI for the callback location within the client application when sign-in is complete 
   A random alphanumeric string for preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
 

<p></p>

<p>The authorization server redirects the user, Sunny, to a web page it hosts to sign in and provide authorization consent.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yay! Sign-in success! The authorization server returns an authorization code to the client application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that there’s an authorization code, the client application makes a request to the token endpoint of the authorization server and sends the authorization code and the code verifier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To process the token endpoint request the authorization server ensures the authorization code is still valid and that the code verifier matches the code challenge sent in the authorization request. This step is part of the PKCE extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yay! Success! The authorization server returns three tokens:</p>
 
   Access token 
   ID token 
   Refresh token 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now that Sunny successfully signed in, they can continue their rawring lessons!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have these three tokens let’s better understand what each one is for.</p>

 Auth tokens in OAuth 2.0 + OIDC 
<p>These three tokens provide crucial information about your identity, access to resources, and the ability to stay authenticated securely.</p>

 ID token 
<p>The ID token is about the user, so information about Sunny in this case. This authentication token is returned from the OpenID Connect layer. It contains standardized identity information such as email, name, and issuing party, called claims. The ID token may include extra claims for information critical to Sunny’s identity, such as their dinosaur family, which is a Smileasaur of course.</p>

 Access token 
<p>The access token is a key that grants access to data or to perform an action. This authorization token is returned from the OAuth layer. The token has metadata about the token itself, such as the issuing party, information about requested scopes made in the original request, and the expiration time. Access tokens are intentionally short-lived for public clients and are a safety mechanism since it guards access to resources, and it’s dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands!</p>

 Refresh token 
<p>The Refresh token allows us to exchange it for new, shiny tokens. This optional <code>offline_access</code> scope we added in the original authorization code request allows the access token to be short-lived but does not require Sunny to authenticate to get a new token repeatedly. Refresh tokens can be longer-lived than access tokens, but for public clients, the lifetime of Refresh tokens should also be short. We want to make sure bad actors can’t get a hold of a Refresh token to gain access to an access token! For public clients like SPA, it’s a best practice also to use Refresh Token rotation, which improves security by rotating refresh tokens after each use.</p>

<p>While each step of this OAuth flow to get the tokens is critical to ensure a secure authentication and authorization process, let’s inspect the two requests in more detail.</p>

 Create an OAuth 2.0 + OIDC Compliant Authorization server 

<p>We’ll start by setting up an authorization server in Okta and use the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> tool to inspect the Network requests. This authorization server is OAuth 2.0 and OIDC compliant so we can use it within applications that conform to those specs.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code>. In the upcoming steps, you’ll need those values to configure Okta in your SPA client.</p>

 View the well-known endpoint for OIDC Discovery 

<p>Authorization servers have standard, public endpoints for discovery by clients. Let’s take a peek at the OIDC discovery document.</p>

<p>The OpenID Connect specification requires a standardized mechanism for client discovery. You can find it at <code>{Issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>. Open up a browser tab to the OIDC discovery endpoint. It is also JSON formatted data that looks something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the discovery response, we have the endpoints for the authorization and token requests which we’ll use in the following steps. We also have a user info endpoint to query for user information and endpoints to validate the ID token. If you find the property for <code>claims_supported</code>, you’ll see the claims cover various identifying information about the user.</p>

 Debug the authorization code and token requests 

<p>We can see this OAuth flow using the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> tool. Open the site on a browser with good developer debugging capabilities. You’ll see something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Some fields are pre-populated, which is helpful. Add the other key information needed:</p>
 
   Authorize URI (required) - the authorize endpoint from the discovery doc 
   Client ID (required) - the Client ID value from Okta CLI 
   Scope (required) - <code>openid</code> is already added for us. Add <code>profile</code> and <code>offline_access</code> with spaces in between. The form field should look like <code>openid profile offline_access</code>. 
   Response type (required) - select “Use PKCE?” to unlock a few new fields, but everything is auto-populated. The debugger discovers the token endpoint automatically for us. 😎 
 

<p>Open debugging tools in your browser to watch for redirection and network requests. You’ll want to make sure you’re preserving logs between page refreshes.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page, you’ll see how the authorization code request is formed. Press Send Request to start the flow.</p>

<p>First, you’ll authenticate using Okta if you still need to sign in by redirecting to an Okta-hosted sign-in page. Redirecting to the Identity Provider’s hosted sign-in page is the best practice for security, so it’s also a common practice you’ll see across Identity Providers. Completing sign-in redirects you back to the OIDC debugger with a success message. You’ll see the authorization code automatically exchanged for tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The token format for ID tokens is JSON Web Token (JWT). The access token from Okta is also a JWT. JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that allows systems to exchange information in JSON format securely. They are compact and safe from modifications, but our tokens contain public information. Don’t worry! They are secure, just not confidential.</p>

<p>You can copy the access token or ID token value from the response and read the contents using a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT debugger</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So this is cool, but what do we do with the tokens in our SPA? Let’s bring these concepts into our front-end application.</p>

 Add authentication to your SPA 

<p>First, we need an Okta OIDC application supporting our SPA’s redirect URI. We could edit the existing OIDC debugger application we created previously, or we can use a handy Okta CLI command to set everything up for us and to scaffold out a sample application in our preferred framework.</p>

<p>Use the following command in the terminal to get going quickly. There’s a separate command for each Angular, React, and Vue.</p>

<p>Angular</p>
   <code>okta start angular
</code>   

<p>React</p>
   <code>okta start react
</code>   

<p>Vue</p>
   <code>okta start vue
</code>   

<p>Follow the instructions in the terminal to start the application. You should be able to sign in and sign out. Additionally, you can watch network requests for the calls it makes.</p>

<p>We don’t have a refresh token by default. You can enable that in the Okta Admin Console. Navigate to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer site</a> and sign in to your Okta organization. In the Admin Console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and select the Okta application for the SPA you created. Edit the settings to enable Refresh Token. It automatically adds Refresh Token Rotation. Save your changes.</p>

<p>If you still need to, open the SPA code in your favorite IDE. Depending on your framework, navigate to the <code>config.js</code> or <code>app.config.ts</code> file. You’ll see the OIDC config and property for <code>scopes</code> where you will add <code>offline_access</code>. Your OIDC config looks something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
    issuer: ISSUER,
    redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
    scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access']
}
</code>   

<p>Now try rerunning the SPA. If you inspect the network request, you’ll see the refresh token too. You can see the tokens by looking at the contents of your local storage too.</p>

 Use auth tokens in SPAs 

<p>Now that we have these tokens in our SPA, what do we do with them? Let a trusted OIDC library, such as the Okta SDKs, handle all the token requests and refresh them for us. Behind the scenes, the OIDC library is hard at work exchanging tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We’re primarily interested in the contents of the ID token and using the access token.</p>

 How to use the access token 
<p>The access token gives us access to resources. That means we use access tokens in outgoing API requests that our application needs, like for Sunny to get their next rawring lesson.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll send the access token as a Bearer token in the HTTP call’s Authorization header. So in the case of Sunny, the outgoing HTTP call looks like this.</p>

   <code>GET /lessons
Authorization: Bearer access_token_value
</code>   

<p>You’ll want to ensure you’re not adding the access token to calls outside your system by maintaining an allowlist of origins that should include the token.</p>

<p>A great way to manage adding the Authorization header and the logic to verify the call matches the allowlist of origins is using an interceptor. Interceptors sit between your application and outgoing (or incoming) HTTP requests. Angular includes the concept of interceptors within the framework, and if you use Axios in Vue or React apps, you can configure interceptors there.</p>

<p>You can see access tokens in action within the SPA you previously created. If you navigate to Messages in the application, it will make a call to a resource server and add the access token to the Authorization header. If you want to see the messages request succeed, you’ll need to run the resource server in Okta’s <a href="https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4">samples-nodejs-express-4 repo</a>.</p>

 How to use the ID token 
<p>Since the ID token contains user identity information, you can use it to start populating your user store and for supporting identifiers you need immediately, such as their name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the SPA you previously created, you can see all your claims if you navigate to Profile.</p>

<p>The Okta SDK automatically decodes the ID token so that we can use the claims without decoding the payload ourselves. But before we jump right into using the claims, the Okta SDK first validates the token signature, which helps ensure the token’s integrity and that it hasn’t been altered. Let’s take a quick peek under the covers at what happens during this validation process.</p>

<p>Since this token is a JWT, we can rely on standard validation for JWTs for the validity of the token itself. Next, it will validate some claims in the payload, including:</p>
 
   <code>iss</code> - the issuer, which should match the original request. In the OIDC Debugger tool, we passed this in as the “Authorize URI” 
   <code>aud</code> - the audience, which should match the client ID of your Okta application 
   <code>nonce</code> - an arbitrary one-time value that should match the original request. In the OIDC Debugger tool, it was pre-populated for us. 
   <code>exp</code> and <code>iat</code> - the expiry time and issued at times, respectively. Only non-expired tokens with an expected issue time here, please! 
 

<p>Once you have the access token, you can also make a request to the OIDC Discovery document’s User Info endpoint, which may contain more information about the user than what is available in your ID token. You may also need to add any user information and user settings from API calls within your system into your user store since the SPAs we write have complex user information.</p>

 Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2022. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with over eight million records breached in the field in Q3 of 2022.

<p>Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence/">suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2022</a>. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1329989/us-number-of-records-exposed/">eight million records breached</a> in the field in Q3 of 2022.</p> 
<p>Data breaches don't just affect the institution that's compromised but also affect confidence in the sector as a whole. The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/03/global-cyber-threat-to-financial-systems-maurer.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> has highlighted the significant threat that weak financial services cybersecurity poses to the industry and the world. Potential outcomes range from a loss of confidence in financial services to widespread economic instability.</p> 
<p>That's why global cybersecurity regulations have been ramped up over recent years, as they strengthen the security posture of individual firms and the industry overall. Here we'll look at the most important financial services cybersecurity regulations in 2023.</p> 
 New York — NYDFS Part 500  
<p>One of the US's most important pieces of cybersecurity legislation is the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-nydfs-multi-factor-authentication-requirement">New York Department of Financial Services cybersecurity bill</a>, technically known as 23 NYCRR Part 500. The bill affects any firm that operates under the Banking, Insurance or Financial Services laws out of New York, which will be most financial services firms in the US.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It requires firms to implement a cybersecurity policy over data governance, access controls and consumer privacy. It also obligates the introduction of more robust security methods, such as the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">deployment of multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for protecting non-public information.</p> 
 US — Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  
<p>The original Sarbanes-Oxley Act was instrumental in codifying the disclosures companies must make to current or potential investors, as well as the penalties that are due for breaches (with executives being directly on the line for up to $1 million and ten years in prison).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It has since been <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5069/text">updated to include cybersecurity considerations</a>. It now obligates all publicly traded companies in the US and their wholly-owned subsidiaries to declare adherence to cybersecurity best practices in areas such as authentication and data safety. They are also required to report any data breaches publicly.</p> 
 California — California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)  
<p>Introduced to help protect the privacy rights and consumer protections of Californians, <a href="https://support.hypr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044300832-Does-HYPR-support-the-California-Consumer-Privacy-Act-CCPA-">the CCPA </a>affects any company which does business with Californians and meets one of the following:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Has a gross revenue of over $25 million  
  Buys, sells or receives personal data on 50,000 consumers  
  Makes over half its revenue from selling consumers' personal information&nbsp;  
  
<p>The fines can be up to $2,500 for unintentional violations and $7,500 for intentional violations, which will be multiplied per record stolen in the case of a data breach.</p> 
 US — Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)  
<p>The GLBA has a specific <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/how-comply-privacy-consumer-financial-information-rule-gramm-leach-bliley-act">Privacy of Consumer Financial Information Rule</a> that directly affects financial services cybersecurity. This concerns non-public personal information (NPI) that a company will collect when informing about or providing a financial product or service. Fines for non-compliance can be up to $100,000 per violation and five years in prison for complicit directors.</p> 
 EU — General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
<p>All companies processing the data of European Union citizens are affected by the GDPR. The law determines how data is used and protected and governs how consent must be used for collecting it. Along with data usage, timely reporting of breaches is also obliged if it affects EU citizens.</p> 
<p>For financial services cybersecurity, adhering to GDPR in 2023 is essential. Failure to do so can lead to fines of $20 million or 4% of global revenue, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach">Amazon receiving the biggest fine so far of $888 million</a>.</p> 
 UK — Data Protection Act  
<p>After the UK left the EU, it kept the GDPR which it passed into law as the <a href="https://uk-gdpr.org/">Data Protection Act (2018)</a>. It is roughly the same as the EU-GDPR (just amended for UK citizens) but still carries the same requirements around data safety, consent and reporting, and fines for non-compliance.</p> 
 EU — Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2)  
<p>The PSD2 was introduced to make it easier for financial services companies to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/open-banking-psd2-and-achieving-strong-customer-authentication">integrate and securely share data</a> while making payment systems safer. In addition, the law set specific technical standards for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-guide/strong-customer-authentication-psd2">strong customer authentication</a> and improving security measures.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The measures affect all companies catering to consumers in the EU and any payments that start, travel through or end in the EU. This puts clear obligations on financial services cybersecurity, even for firms outside the EU.</p> 
 Global — Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)  
<p>The PCI-DSS covers the processors of payments from major credit and debit card companies. To achieve compliance, financial services cybersecurity programs must meet several obligations, such as protecting cardholder data, encrypting data in storage and transmission, and authenticating access to all system components. Breaches of the PCI-DSS may result in fines and restrictions in using major credit cards.</p> 
 Singapore — Monetary Authority of Singapore Notices on Cyber Hygiene  
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates financial institutions in the banking, capital markets, insurance and payments sectors. The <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/cyber-security">MAS has issued </a>a collection of notices on cyber hygiene, which are a set of legally binding requirements that financial institutions must take to mitigate the growing risk of cyberthreats. The cyber hygiene notices cover six key areas, which include securing administrative account access, regular vulnerability patching and mitigation controls for systems that cannot be patched, written and regularly tested security standards, perimeter defense systems, malware protection and multi-factor authentication for any system used to access critical information.</p> 
 Canada - Bill C-11  
<p>Expected to be passed into law in Canada in early 2023, <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2022/op-c11_addario/">Part 1 of Bill C-11</a> will introduce the Consumer Privacy Protection Act (CPPA) into law. The regulations are heavily based on the NYDFS Part 500 and give recommendations on securing systems and data, as well as obligations on the collection, usage and storage of data.</p> 
 US — FFIEC Standards  
<p>The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is an interagency body that sets standards for all federally supervised financial institutions, including their subsidiaries. The FFIEC cybersecurity best practices includes guidance on effective <a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/press/pdf/Authentication-and-Access-to-Financial-Institution-Services-and-Systems.pdf">authentication and access risk management practices</a>. The <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ffiec-endorses-passwordless-mfa">FFIEC authentication standards</a> emphasize multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a critical security control against financial loss and data compromise, similar to the PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication mandate. It includes references to NIST standards SP 1800-17 and SP 800-63B, which provide implementation guidelines for passwordless MFA based on FIDO specifications.</p> 
 US — FTC Safeguards Rule  
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">FTC Safeguards Rule</a> requires non-banking financial institutions, such as mortgage brokers, auto dealers, and payday lenders, to implement a comprehensive security program to keep their customers’ information safe. The FTC Safeguards Rule was recently updated, with the compliance deadline set for June 9, 2023. Among the new provisions is a mandate for multi-factor authentication for anyone accessing customer information. It should be noted that this includes <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktop and server access</a>, not just applications.</p> 
 Protect Data and Systems with Strong Authentication  
<p>The financial services sector is at high risk of cyberattacks due to the value of successful data breaches or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">account takeover attacks</a>. To combat this, state, national and supranational governments and industry groups have introduced several financial services cybersecurity regulations to ensure best practice is deployed throughout the industry.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A common thread throughout much of the financial services cybersecurity regulations worldwide is the protection of data and stronger authentication systems. HYPR's True Passwordless MFA solution uses FIDO2, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-fido2-authentication">the "gold standard" of phishing-resistant MFA</a>, to help companies secure their systems and achieve regulatory compliance.

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, most individuals operate in a digital environment where transactions and communication are made online. As a result, digital identity verification has become a very important aspect of online security and compliance.</p>
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is one of the most widely used methods for verifying the identities of users and clients. While KYC has been effective in assuring security and regulatory compliance, it has some significant drawbacks. KYC can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult for users, potentially resulting in losing customers and missing business opportunities.</p>
<p>SelfKey addresses this issue by proposing a potential solution to these issues with SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is a revolutionary approach to identity verification that could be faster, more secure, and less costly than traditional KYC methods. It uses the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts to potentially offer a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process.

 KYC: Potential Issues to Consider 
<p>Even though KYC has become a commonly used procedure in many industries, it has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Here as some examples:</p>
 
 The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for KYC purposes comes with legal responsibilities and storage costs, which can take a toll on companies.&nbsp; 
 Users have a tendency to dislike KYC checks, finding them intrusive and time-consuming. This can lead to lower conversion rates and a negative first impression for potential customers.&nbsp; 
 Implementing KYC can be a difficult and expensive process, further adding to its disadvantages.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Perhaps the time to explore alternative ways of verifying customer identities has come. With SelfKey iD, you can explore methods that are less tedious for all parties involved.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD 
<p>As stated above, KYC processes can be inconvenient for both companies and customers alike. However, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Ai-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> method along with SelfKey iD can potentially become a better alternative to KYC.</p>
<p>Here are some of SelfKey.iD’s benefits:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The overall process is easier and less costly, making it more accessible for users.&nbsp; 
 The onboarding process is quick. 
 Ongoing monitoring makes sure that customer data remains accurate. 
 Existing KYC checks are reused, thus the need to collect and store PII repeatedly is no longer an issue. 
 Costs for companies are reduced, but also improves customer privacy and security. 
 It provides powerful compliance tools, ensuring that companies remain in compliance with regulations and laws.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can streamline their KYC processes, reducing costs, enhancing customer privacy, and improving compliance. Ultimately, this results in a better experience for customers and a more efficient and secure system for companies.</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss some of SelfKey iDs benefits more in depth.</p>
 High-Level Flow 
<p>SelfKey iD enables zero-knowledge interactions between individuals, making sure that users' data is kept private and secure. With SelfKey iD, the user's data does not reach your server. This adds to user privacy and prevents potential data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the onboarding process is quick and simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user with a SelfKey iD visits your server, they are checked to determine if they match your filter. If they do, they can be onboarded instantly, simplifying the process and reducing the time and resources required.</p>
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can provide a secure and efficient onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security. The zero-knowledge interactions and instant onboarding features make it a better alternative to traditional KYC processes.</p>
 Quick Relying Party Onboarding 
<p>To streamline the onboarding process, the following steps are required:</p>
 
 Sign up at SelfKey iD to create your user filters. 
 Add these filters to your smart contracts. 
 When a user attempts to run your smart contract function, the system will check if they have a SelfKey iD NFT. If they do not have one, they will be prompted to get one. 
 If the issuer has a SelfKey iD NFT, they will then be able to verify whether the user matches the filter that you have set for the transaction. If they do, the user will be granted access to your server. If not, the user will be denied access. 
 
<p>Following these steps, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system ensures that only authorized users are given access to the company's services. This reduces the risk of relying parties allowing access to unauthorized individuals to their services.</p>
 The Issuance: SelfKey iD NFT User Flow 
<p>The issuance process for SelfKey iD is outlined below:</p>
 
 The user visits your project and is redirected to SelfKey iD, in case they do not already have one. 
 The user pays for the verification check. 
 The user goes through the verification process, and the issuer stores their data. Ongoing monitoring of the account begins. 
 If the user passes the checks, the issuer releases a credential that verifies the user's humanity, uniqueness in the database, and verified data. 
 The user then mints their own SelfKey iD NFT. 
 
<p>By following these steps, users can obtain a SelfKey iD NFT that verifies their identity and potentially provides access to various projects that use the SelfKey iD platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verification process ensures that only authorized users are granted access, providing enhanced security and privacy for both users and companies.</p>
<p>Enhanced security offers several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Anti-bot security. This measure prevents automated attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious or malicious bot traffic. 
 Fraud protection. Bots are often used for fraudulent activities like creating fake accounts or generating false clicks to generate revenue. Implementing anti-bot security measures helps to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities, keeping the business and customers safe. 
 Improved user experience. Bots can significantly hinder the user experience by slowing down websites or making it difficult for users to access information. Anti-bot security measures ensure that legitimate users can access the website or service without interruptions or delays. 
 
 The Verification: SelfKey iD User Onboarding 
<p>The onboarding process for SelfKey.iD is as follows:</p>
 
 A user with a SelfKey iD visits your project. 
 You request that the SelfKey iD issuer checks the user's information. 
 The issuer verifies whether the user's data matches your filters. 
 The issuer sends a signed message confirming the user's status.&nbsp; 
 If the user is verified, they can be onboarded, and the signed message can be used to authorize transactions. 
 The relying party (issuer) is billed for the verification check. 
 
<p>Through this process, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding method that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system makes sure that only authorized users are granted access to the company's services. The use of a signed message adds an extra layer of security, offering further assurance that the user's data has been verified by the relying party.</p>
 Reusable KYC and SelfKey iD 
<p>The benefits of using reusable KYC with SelfKey iD are as follows:</p>
 
 Your project subscribes to SelfKey iD. 
 Your project can be featured on the SelfKey iD website. 
 A user with a SelfKey iD NFT visits the SelfKey iD website. 
 The user scrolls through the list of projects that support SelfKey iD. 
 The user can potentially choose your project from the list. 
 The user quickly onboards to your project using their existing SelfKey iD NFT. 
 Your project profits from the seamless onboarding experience. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's reusable KYC system could provide companies with a more streamlined onboarding experience for users. Users can easily access multiple projects without having to go through the time-consuming and costly process of verifying their identity each time.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies benefit from increased user adoption and loyalty, as the reusable KYC system encourages users to choose projects that support SelfKey iD. Overall, this system offers a win-win situation for both companies and users alike.</p>
 SelfKey iD New Project Setup 
<p>Setting up a new project with SelfKey iD is quite easy. Below, we will detail a few steps which you need to consider.</p>
 The project onboarding process is as follows:&nbsp; 
 
 Go to the SelfKey iD website. 
 Register for a new account. 
 Add your company privacy policy to your account. 
 Choose a subscription pack that suits your needs. 
 Set up filters to verify your users' identity. 
 Your project is now ready to implement the filters into your system. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's easy-to-use platform could offer companies a quick and efficient way to set up their project's identity verification process. The platform provides a range of subscription plans to choose from, depending on your business's specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ability to customize filters for your users, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, enhancing security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, SelfKey iD's new project setup process offers a simple and effective solution for individuals looking to integrate identity verification into their systems</p>
 The Library Implementation

 Implement the backend library onto your server. 
 Prepare the front-end to handle calls for authorization. 
 Implement the SelfKey iD smart contract into your own smart contract. 
 Your project is now ready to onboard users. 
 
<p>By following these steps, you can integrate SelfKey iD into your project's system and take advantage of its powerful identity verification capabilities. With the backend library in place, your server will be able to communicate with SelfKey iD to authorize user access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By integrating the smart contract into your own contract, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, boosting security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD's library implementation process offers a robust solution for businesses looking to enhance their identity verification capabilities.</p>
 How the Profile Builder Functions: 
<p>SelfKey iD's Profile Builder is a tool that allows you to create customizable filters for your project. These filters could be used to sort and manage users based on specific criteria.</p>
<p>The Profile Builder allows you to create multiple filters, which can be implemented separately on your project. This means that you can have different filters applied to different sections of your app or website, depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 You could create a filter that accepts citizens of Country A for one section of your app, but another filter for the same project that excludes citizens of Country A from another section.&nbsp; 
 This level of detailed filtering allows you to match regulatory requirements while also boosting the benefits of your app. 
 
<p>To set up the Profile Builder, you would first define the standards you want to filter by, such as citizenship, age, or profession. You can then apply rules and conditions to each filter to create a customized sorting system.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Profile Builder in SelfKey iD could provide a flexible and powerful tool for managing user data and creating a tailored experience for your app's users.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey aims to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the needs of both businesses and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of SelfKey iD could include efficient, secure, and cost-effective KYC checks, streamlined onboarding, and better conversion rates. Additionally, SelfKey iD's approach to privacy ensures legal compliance and reduces costs associated with PII storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, with a user-friendly one-time KYC process and access to multiple projects on the website, SelfKey iD offers convenience and ease of use for users. SelfKey iD's project features and powerful user filtering tools could enable businesses to match rules and increase profitability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Establishing a new legislative structure for the digitalisation of commercial trade documents and enabling digital identity for corporates are the most discussed trade transformation topics of 2022.</p>
<p>In an episode published on the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/electronic-trade-documents-bill/" title="Ubisecure Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast">Ubisecure Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast</a>, the relationship between digital identity and the trade business, as well as the legal reforms regarding data driven trade, are discussed very articulately. Chris Southworth, Secretary General of ICC United Kingdom, and Oswald Kuyler, former director of the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, both leading names in this industry, clearly convey the work done in the direction of digitalisation of trade and the roadmap for removing barriers.</p>
<p>Significant and major legal reform steps have been taken, continuously and decisively, in the UK, Germany, France, China and further G7 countries for the digitalisation of international trade.</p>
<p>What needs to be understood about digitalisation is not just the conversion of paper trade documents into a digital format like PDF, but also the gathering of data from papers with AI technology.</p>
<p>The legal reforms such as the UK’s Electronic Trade Documents Bill&nbsp;allows for certain trade documents to be digital, such as bills of lading, bills of exchange, promissory notes, warehouse receipts, and insurance documents. These currently must be on paper and physically possessed. Under the Bill, digital trade documents – in other words, trade data – will be on the same legal footing as their paper-based equivalents.</p>
 Why do we need this legal reform? 
<p><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2022-11-07/debates/EFDEB437-4656-42AA-B3FF-0531B0DFA9BB/ElectronicTradeDocumentsBill(HL">The problem is pretty simple</a>: to have possession of goods—if they are under a bill of lading, for example—you must be able to possess that document. It is much more than a contract of terms, but it is a possessive document. Possess the paper and you possess the goods. How is it possible to take this ownership into a digital and intangible, and yet in so many ways so contested, world?</p>
<p>With the standardisation of the trade data used by the main stakeholders of international trade, who are logistic providers, banks and insurance sectors, we will experience a kind of digital revolution similar to that of the inclusion of internet usage in the 1980s, which caused the information age and globalisation of the world. Today, for example, the ICC’s Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) and the United Nations Centre for trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) lead these standardisation efforts in cooperation with sectors such as logistics and banking towards a new world age.</p>
 Cornerstones of Digitalisation 
 Enabling Wide Usage of Digital Identities 
<p>The main two cornerstones that will ensure digitalisation in trade are enabling wide usage of digital identities by corporates and transacting with electronic transferable records.</p>
<p>Digitalisation decisions of leading countries eventually will help to relax anti-terrorist regulations and KYC processes of bankers which tied them up in knots in terms of operational processes, with the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA and then the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>In addition, with digital identity, it will be easier for SMEs to access new supply chain networks but also financial resources. The trade finance space of SMEs is calculated to close the 1.5 trillion USD financing gap.</p>
<p>In supply chain management, it is not easy for a buyer company to onboard a reliable supplier that will provide goods to the production line. In order to ensure trust in trade transactions, these problems should be figured out, who the supplier company is in real life and whether it actually produces what it says or its trade partners or references are really their partners as claimed by the supplier, and more importantly, which staff are authorised to sign on behalf of the corporate. For this reason, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are carried out in the processes of carrying goods, sharing information and transferring payments between the parties of the trade.</p>
<p>As trust and transparency cannot be provided, aside from the operational costs, the rapidly growing supply chain financing gap of SMEs can’t be tackled. Clearly, there has been great potential in the field of finance.</p>
<p>Additionally, if trade business can reduce operational costs, paperwork can be shifted to make our world a better place in the sense of sustainability.</p>
 Transacting with Electronic Transferable Records 
<p>Another main cornerstone of digitalisation is aligning national legal frameworks to run on electronic transferable records. Which means handling of data, instead of paper, in trade transactions.</p>
<p>Recently, when I asked why an SME owner doesn’t export, they said “I don’t have the time and resources to trade with a ‘red tape’”. Imagine that there are no bureaucratic processes in an export! With the widespread use of digital identity, a supplier can trade without needing bank intelligence or references. What a great potential!</p>
<p>In order to tackle the rapidly deteriorating climate problem of the world, complying with the international legal regulations of ESG and 0-Carbon is not a “nice to have” situation, but it has become an inevitable necessity. This means that legal authorities should reach sensitive commercial trade data of the corporates.</p>
<p>In order to carry out legal inspections, transparent data on trade is crucial; not the information that companies, customs, terminal operators and banks try to collect one by one from papers stuck in data silos.</p>
<p>In this case, the most important technological need is to provide data confidentiality, which will provide the element of trust between the trade parties. The privacy of commercial data is almost even more important than the privacy of individual data. Individuals have been sharing their personal information, private stories, and photos every day for years. After fearlessly sharing it on social media such as Facebook and Instagram, the world started to discuss and take precautions on personal data privacy.</p>
 Data Confidentiality in Digital Identities for Legal Entities 
<p>In commercial life, neither companies nor logistics providers nor banks can scatter their data as boldly as individuals, saying “it’s good to go digital”. It is very important which information will be disclosed to whom in the digital identities of legal entities.</p>
<p>The legal presence, name and address information of the company in the country where it is located may be public and available to all trading partners, but for example, its balance sheet, profitability, credibility in banks, trading partners or signatories with which it does business cannot be public.</p>
<p>Similarly, the data on the bill of lading, which includes, for example, the buyer of the exported goods, must be confidential. This data, which cannot be processed because it is stuck in papers at the moment, provides a kind of “confidentiality” indeed. However, to make world trade of this size sustainable, we must change all paper-based processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the decreasing trust in central structures as a result of financial crises, the only technological solution that can pave the way for central structures that are insufficient to manage the world trade exceeding 22 trillion USD, seems to be Blockchain and DLT today.</p>
 Tackling digitalisation 
<p>Will the efforts of the country’s customs to facilitate trade solve the problem of digitalisation and transparent data? I think it will be insufficient. Because the main data owner parties that carry out international trade are corporates, and it seems like the only way to focus on companies’ needs is to evolve digitalisation.</p>
 The Impact of ICC Regulation 
<p>The latest regulation of the ICC, such as the URDTT (Uniform Rules for Digital Trade Transactions), is one of the most concrete steps taken on this path. For the first time in its history, the ICC Banking Commission has published a set of rules that focuses on corporates, not Banks. Even the word “Bank” is not mentioned in the URDTT, and financial service providers are included as a secondary source for risk mitigation or financing.</p>
<p>UNCTAD- #MLETR (Model Law on Electronic Records) is also the best example of this as a draft model law. This Model Law has succeeded in drafting a legal text that stipulates providing commercial data privacy as the top priority of transacting with electronic trade data. Now there is a need for neutral entities such as the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>The trade industry is struggling to form neutral and interoperable entities of digitalisation which are valid internationally and in cooperation with local (legal) structures. I think this is the right form of governance of digitalisation.</p>
 Benefits of the Digitalisation 
<p>With the digitalisation journey, not only will the problems in the management and financing of supply chains will be resolved. But also, the smuggling, fraud, corruption and VAT losses that countries face will be mostly controlled. The fraudsters, who know the commercial documents and banking process, are now living a good life thanks to the run-down structure based on paper.</p>
<p>Not to mention the VAT losses; in the UK alone, the VAT deficit is estimated at £9 billion. If we make a rough calculation considering the VAT leakage amount in the total imports of goods and services (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-trade-in-numbers/uk-trade-in-numbers-web-version#import-statistics">£609 billion</a>) of the UK in 2020, we can say that the VAT loss of all countries in world trade is about 2.3 trillion USD. Such a huge amount!</p>
<p>It is time to start global cooperation in the field of digitalisation and international digital identity. It would be beneficial to roll up our sleeves for cooperation in the field of digitalisation and international digital identity. By controlling this kind of fraud, we can use revealed sources for SME’s finance and complying with ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) rules or tackling the climate crisis.</p>
 Global Digitalisation Growth 
<p>There are 53 countries in the UK’s commonwealth and the most prominent countries which meet the same basis with English Law are India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. With the adoption of the electronic trade document law, which is currently in the “fast track” stage in the UK legislative process, great impact on the commonwealth area will be seen. Moreover, the adoption of English law in international trade agreements and letters of credit is a centuries-old tradition in the world.</p>
<p>Germany, France and the USA have made significant progress in the adoption of the electronic trade document law. China, on the other hand, is taking firm steps forward in this area. These countries have a large area of influence and the potential for the acceleration of data-driven digital electronic trade is quite high in the coming years.</p>
<p>Therefore, digital supply chain documents and finance operating platforms such as the Bolero International (WiseTech Global Group), Contour, Essdocs, which have managed Rulebooks, will find themselves a great commercial opportunity with digital data-based trade that has become law. Although technology provider platforms based on blockchain technology experienced “winter conditions” in 2022, they will be able to scale rapidly from 2023 with the availability of legal infrastructures.</p>
 How should organisations prepare for digitalisation? 
<p>So, what should companies and banks do for the upcoming digitalisation era?</p>
<p>Is it wise to wait for these developments to mature?</p>
<p>Especially small companies and local banks seem far from creating a vision to prepare for the effects of the big change coming. Some large companies think that they can adapt to digitalisation by relying on their size, but if they do not prepare their workforce, which is their most valuable resource in their medium-term business plans, they will not only be more vulnerable to negative impacts like COVID, but also may lose their competitive advantage in their own sector. In the view of that what should companies do? Watch out for upcoming articles.</p>

<p>After some of the basics of quantum computing are explored in the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/introduction-to-quantum-computing-and-post-quantum-cryptography-pqc/">introductory episode of the Entrust Engage podcast</a>, episode two takes listeners deeper into the science behind this topic with an <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">interview featuring Dr. Carmen Palacios-Berraquero</a>, award-winning quantum physicist and CEO of Nu Quantum. &nbsp;Many interesting areas were covered – from a brief history of quantum computing to what the future benefits of this field might be. Here are the 6 key takeaways from this episode:</p>
<p>#1: The episode kicked off with a concise history of quantum computing, which goes back to the ’80s when people first began to look at how to apply quantum theory to computing. Then in the ’90s, Shor’s algorithm was developed, which significantly sped up the calculation of factorization problems and was the first step in potentially breaking RSA encryption. Experimental physicists also found new hardware in which you could encode quantum information. Progress in quantum computing continued to exponentially accelerate in the 2000s and 2010s and led to a kind of modern-day space race of different hardware approaches. In these earlier years the field was still largely an academic endeavor, whereas in the past seven years the academic pioneers of this race moved into the industry to set up startups. In 2019, Google declared “quantum supremacy.” And in 2021, more than $3 billion was invested into quantum computing, further cementing its importance to the future of technology.</p>
<p>#2: So, what exactly is “quantum supremacy”? For starters, Dr. Palacios-Berraquero prefers the term “quantum advantage.” When Google announced that it had achieved this, what did that really mean? How significant was this?</p>
<p>Well, Google was essentially successful in using quantum computing to solve a problem that would have been infeasible for a classical computer. However, the problem it solved had no application in the real world. While the industry is moving toward solving commercially useful problems, there is still progress to be made before any organization can consider itself to have a true quantum advantage.</p>
<p>#3: There is consensus that the quantum computing threat to traditional public key algorithms will be a reality within the decade. However, taking Google’s 2019 claim of quantum supremacy into consideration, the question arises: Has this timeline been accelerated?</p>
<p>The answer: not necessarily. There are two main factors to consider here. The first is that it is very hard to scale these machines. The second is that there are lots of errors in quantum computers’ processors. Error correction schemes are very complex and take up quite a few logical qubits in quantum computers, leaving fewer qubits to perform logical computations. So, even with the progress made at present, the threat timeline of quantum computers has not accelerated.</p>
<p>#4: Is the news about quantum computing all about its threats and challenges? Echoing what we learned from episode one, absolutely not! There are major benefits that quantum computing can unlock in the future. For starters, quantum computing can crack those intractable problems we can’t currently solve today. This opens entirely new applications, markets, and industries. Some examples include both material and drug design, paving the way for innovations in healthcare and the battle against climate change. In the near term, quantum computing promises benefits like financial portfolio optimization, improvements in machine learning algorithms, and the simulation of quantum and physical systems.</p>
<p>#5: &nbsp;What is a quantum random number generator and how different is it from what we know of entropy in cryptography today? The quantum random number generator is based on the main proposition of quantum theory that the outcome of a measurement is completely unpredictable. It uses this principle to generate entropy/random numbers. Over the past decade, it has been proposed to use these generators as a source for cryptography.</p>
<p>The main difference is that entropy used in cryptography currently is based on classical mechanics, where theoretically everything is predictable. In theory, by knowing the exact functioning of a system and combining it with a lot of computing power, you could predict the outcome of a classical random number generator.</p>
<p>The reality is quite different, though. Current cryptography uses mathematical tools in addition to a random number generator, making it quite impossible to crack. While the industry is debating the use and applications of a quantum random number generator, it’s still a long way from adopting it in cryptography.</p>
<p>#6: Additional benefits in development include quantum computing as a service (QCaas) and quantum internet. These are two very different things. QCaaS is a means by which users can access quantum computers via the cloud. For example, AWS hosts around five quantum computers, and a user can buy time on them through the cloud and run various algorithms. And there’s a long line of users queued up to use these computers. Who are these users? A mix of academics and researchers as well as R&amp;D departments in industry. However, these machines are still in the labs of companies, and it will be a while before they can function independently in a data center.</p>
<p>Now let’s unravel the service known as quantum internet. Picture a computer network that can send quantum information between distant computers, and there you have it in a nutshell.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access IT systems and data is at the core of cybersecurity, especially as most successful cyber-attacks are enabled by the abuse of stolen credentials. Access management, therefore, is an essential part of any cybersecurity strategy, but in the modern business world, where cloud computing, virtual machines, DevOps, automation, AI, and remote working are common, this can be extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity of access management, these business IT technologies and practices increasingly involve the use of service accounts for humans and machines to perform IT tasks. These are commonly known as privileged accounts, which are given to privileged users to enable them to access critical resources and perform admin-level actions.</p>
<p>In the light of continually increasing and evolving cyber threats, management of this high-level access is critical for all modern businesses because the misuse of privileged accounts and credentials is a popular and powerful technique used by cyber attackers.</p>
 PAM necessary for almost everything related to business IT 
<p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are designed to enable organizations to deal with these challenges, and with today’s complex operating environments and interconnected machines, and the proliferation of privileged accounts, almost everything related to business IT has some need for PAM. But this is a dynamic and evolving market space driven by changing threats and business IT environments.</p>
<p>As a result of widespread adoption of cloud services, for example, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) platforms are disrupting the traditional PAM market, demand for dynamic cloud access continues to grow, and Just in Time (JiT) and Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) demands are beginning to impact the market.</p>
 Customer Identity &amp; Access Management highlights in the EIC agenda&nbsp; 
<p>Whether your organization is considering implementing PAM for the first time or looking to replace or augment existing solutions, it is important to understand exactly why PAM is necessary, what are best practices, how this market is evolving, and the business benefits. A good place to start, is the dedicated <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/935">PAM track</a> at this year’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud &nbsp;Conference</a>.</p>
<p>In the modern business world, there is an increasing demand for contact-free onboarding experiences, passwordless authentication, decentralized identity, and policy-based access. Get up to speed with these and other trends in access management and learn how to future-proof existing access management investments in a session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/3">Access Management Trends in a Connect Anywhere World</a>.</p>
<p>Drilling down to the specific topic of Privileged Access Management (PAM), it is important to recognize that all organizations are different and so it is important to choose the PAM solution that best fits your organization’s technical, security, and business requirements. Discover what the PAM market has to offer and how to choose the right solution in this market overview for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5334/1">Privileged Access Management Solutions</a>.</p>
<p>As already discussed, privileged accounts are very powerful and are a top target for cybercriminals, but they are often anonymous and shared. Learn how to take control of privileged access in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/1">Trust No One, Always Verify</a>.</p>
<p>Learn how to make a business case for PAM, conduct a proof of concept, and achieve a return on investment in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/2">Preparations for Smoother PAM Flight</a>, and discover how to handle identities and accounts in the context of a Privileged Access Security Service based on the real world experience of a German bank in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5328/1">Privileged Access Management – Moving from Cost to Service Centre</a>.</p>

 <p></p><p>The United States’ potential ban of TikTok is the latest and loudest warning sign of our increasing need for a decentralized internet. Consumers are quickly wondering where they’ll go for their short form video content if TikTok is taken away. Creators are faced with the reality that their income could immediately dry up if the most viral social media platform to date disappears. Lastly, businesses could potentially watch one of their most powerful distribution channels go up in flames overnight.</p><p>Distribution and content, two of the most valuable assets on TikTok, are currently owned by the platform instead of the users who worked so hard for them. A follower on TikTok can’t be transferred outside of the platform, and a video on the social media giant is currently owned and stored on TikTok’s servers. It’s the very nature of Web2 infrastructure that platforms like TikTok absorb an incredible amount of ownership and responsibility to store, manage, and steward the relationships and data on them, putting end users and businesses at risk.</p><p>So what’s the alternative? How can we build platforms that turn over data ownership to the users of that platform rather than hoard massive amounts of power? The answer is to build Web5 applications that enable users to maintain ownership of their data so platforms can stick to what they do best: curating and serving that data.</p><p>Let’s consider the model a platform like TikTok currently uses. They ask users to upload videos to TikTok servers and then store, sort, organize, and serve that content. In a Web5 world, users could store their own videos on their own decentralized web node(s) and grant access to that content to TikTok. TikTok would adhere to a common schema to access that content - one that any other platform, such as Facebook or Instagram could access as well, and then layer its own metadata such as likes, comments, and analytics on top of that.</p><p>Follower counts wouldn’t need to be limited to a single platform, instead allowing users with a single decentralized identifier to follow users, creators, or businesses across platforms. This would decouple platforms and distribution, meaning that the marketing power of individuals and businesses wouldn’t be wholly subject to the whim of community guidelines or editorial discretion of platform owners. In this model, a TikTok ban would simply mean that TikTok’s metadata - like counts, comments, and other analytics - would be stripped away, but the content and creator-follower relationships would persist. TikTok and platforms like it would still be able to curate their excellent algorithms, monetize on in-feed ads, and more, while holding less power over their users’ content and reducing the overhead of storing incredibly large amounts of video content on behalf of their users.</p><p>If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a> or join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a>.</p>

  New South Wales Senator Andrew Bragg has recently introduced a crypto services regulation bill in the Australian Parliament.  Titled the Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill 2023, the regulation may introduce a crypto licensing regime.  Australia has a considerable crypto market, with more than 25% of the population owning cryptocurrency in the&nbsp;country.  <p>In a noteworthy development for the Australian cryptocurrency landscape, Senator Andrew Bragg, a member of the Australian Liberal Party from New South Wales, has introduced a new bill to the Australian Parliament. This proposed legislation seeks to implement regulations for crypto services in the country, potentially impacting the future of the crypto ecosystem and its&nbsp;users.</p><p>If Senator Bragg’s proposals receive approval, a person or business would be required to hold an ASIC or foreign license to operate a crypto exchange. ASIC stands for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The same would apply to crypto custody service providers and stablecoin issuers in the&nbsp;country.</p> How Popular Cryptocurrencies are Among Australians? <p>The share of people who own cryptocurrency in Australia is more than <a href="https://swyftx.com/au/blog/25-percent-of-australians-now-own-cryptocurrency/">25%</a>, implying that nearly one in four adults in Australia own some cryptocurrency. In line with the nature of the crypto market at large, Bitcoin is the leading currency in the country, and the foremost reason to invest is portfolio diversification.</p><p>Despite the significant presence of cryptocurrencies in Australians’ financial strategies, regulatory frameworks surrounding these assets are still in development. The recent release of the ‘Token Mapping’ consultation paper in February highlights the ongoing efforts to establish fundamental definitions and guidelines for the sector. This paper represents a crucial step toward shaping the future of cryptocurrency regulations in the country as it attempts to set the basic definitions applicable to the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Returning to the bill moved by Senator Bragg, there are more recommendations apart from the licensing regime for service providers.</p> Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill&nbsp;2023 <p>Senator Bragg insists the Digital Assets (Market Regulation) Bill 2023 seeks to ‘protect consumers and promote investors’, especially in the wake of FTX collapse and the apparent inaction of the Australian Government in bringing regulatory clarity to the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>While setting the pretext for why this bill was necessary, Bragg pointed out the Labour government’s failure in not following through on 12 crypto regulation recommendations introduced by the Senate Select Committee on Australia as a technology and financial center in October&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-to-vote-on-mica-in-april">EU to Vote on Mica in&nbsp;April</a></p> How Does the Proposed Bill Impact the Crypto&nbsp;Users? <p>As cryptocurrency users in Australia eagerly anticipate the potential impact of the proposed bill, it’s essential to understand the implications for the community at large. And to better understand the potential impact of any bill, it’s crucial to look at its upsides as well as the downsides, and that’s exactly what we will do&nbsp;here.</p> The Upsides <p>If passed, the bill would create a robust regulatory framework governing crypto exchanges, custody services, and stablecoin issuers. From a user’s perspective, this translates to increased protection and security, as the bill outlines specific obligations and requirements for these entities.</p><p>These requirements, including capital and minimum reserve requirements, customer fund segregation, customer holdings reporting, auditing, assurance, and disclosure arrangements, are designed to foster a trustworthy and transparent crypto environment. Now, let’s look at the negative aspect of the&nbsp;bill.</p> The Downsides <p>The potential consequences of this legislation are manifold, as it could affect users’ experiences, privacy, and the overall market landscape.</p><p>The bill’s provisions concerning capital and minimum reserve requirements may result in increased operating costs for crypto exchanges and stablecoin issuers. As these entities grapple with the financial burden of compliance, they could pass the costs onto users in the form of higher transaction fees, reduced rewards, or limited access to services.</p><p>This would ultimately make cryptocurrency transactions less attractive and accessible for users, potentially deterring newcomers and hindering the market&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Privacy concerns could also arise due to the bill’s customer fund segregation and customer holdings reporting requirements. As crypto service providers are obligated to disclose their clients’ holdings to regulators, users may feel that their financial privacy is jeopardized.</p><p>This might undermine one of the main attractions of cryptocurrencies — the promise of pseudonymous, decentralized transactions — and deter users from engaging with these services.</p><p>The auditing, assurance, and disclosure arrangements mandated by the bill could negatively impact crypto users by prompting more stringent security measures. While these provisions are intended to protect users and maintain transparency, they might inadvertently result in longer transaction processing times, more complex user interfaces, or the implementation of invasive identity verification processes. Such developments could make the user experience cumbersome and discourage usage in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>However, private members’ or private senators’ bills, like the one introduced by Senator Bragg, often take months or even years to pass through the Australian Parliament.</p><p>Relevant Article: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kongs-proposed-asset-regulation-sparks-industry-optimism">Hong Kong’s Proposed Asset Regulation Sparks Industry&nbsp;Optimism</a></p> Final Note <p>The bill could have both negative and positive ramifications for the industry, striking a balance between consumer protection and innovation. As such, lawmakers must carefully consider the potential implications of this legislation on the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector and its users, ensuring that the regulatory framework fosters growth while safeguarding the interests of all stakeholders involved.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/australias-latest-crypto-bill-explained-b10fbc46baf8">Australia’s Latest Crypto Bill Explained</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We sit down with the eIDAS, digital identity, digital signatures and PKI expert to discuss digital wallets, eIDAS 2.0, and why Italy’s Public Digital Identity System (SPID) is such a success. 



 



 One of the chief aims of eIDAS 2.0 is for all EU member states to make a Digital Identity Wallet available to every citizen who wants one. Are there any countries that you would consider further ahead, or behind, in achieving this than others? 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS 2.0</a> is setting a completely new framework for the European digital identities and digital trust services. This is one of the more ambitious projects of the European Union, with different streams going parallel – the legislative process, standardization, EUDI Wallet Reference development, Large-Scale Pilots, Architecture and Reference Framework specifications. Many actors from public and private sectors have the same goal – doing digital identity right and within a very challenging timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is hard to make predictions on which countries will be ahead and which ones behind, and I don’t believe we should look at eIDAS 2.0 as a race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All EU member states will deliver an EUDI Wallet to their citizens, which will happen in due time, as requested by the Regulation. The EUDI Wallet will have applications in the following main use cases: Payments, Driving Licenses, Educational Titles, Travel Credentials, and Organizational Identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are some countries with an electronic identification scheme already in place, and others in the early stages of defining and framing one. And, while some countries have been offering digital services for many years, others are in the middle of their digital transformation. In the end, however, we will all reach the same point.</p>



 What role will standardization and open-source technology play in the future of digital identities? 



<p>Both play a fundamental role in the development and interoperability of digital identities and trust services around the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. There are several initiatives, led by European standardization bodies, that are focused on drafting standards in support of eIDAS 2.0 or updating existing ones where applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EUDI Wallet reference will be developed with an open-source licence. In this way it can be customized by each Member State to meet specific needs. An open-source code is accessible and transparent, enabling greater trust.</p>



 What are some of the major societal, cultural and economic benefits that digital identities can offer? Which industries will benefit most from eIDAS 2.0? 



<p>The most important parts of our social interactions are carried out on digital platforms today. Technology has enabled billions of people to tell their stories to a potentially unlimited audience. At the same time, technology increasingly defines who we are in the digital world, what we can do, and what information we can access, ultimately influencing how we think. As such, digital identities and personal information are defining our digital twin. It is therefore of paramount importance that we make sure we properly define the technology and governance that regulates our digital persona.&nbsp;</p>



<p>eIDAS 2.0 is an integral part of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/europes-digital-decade">Digital Decade</a>, which aims to provide at least 80% of EU citizens with a digital ID by 2030. This will enable holders to prove who they are cross-border, to give explicit consent to share pieces of personal information, to know exactly with whom they’ve shared personal information, and for what purpose. This technology will allow us to control our own data and how data is used. Reaching this point will be a quantum leap for the digital world, and all industries and the public sector will benefit.</p>

 The Italian eID scheme SPID is regarded as one of the world’s eID success stories. To what do you attribute its success? 



<p>SPID is a real success story, embraced by 34 million citizens who made over 1 billion transactions last year. There are several reasons for its success: it is provided and promoted by the private sector with a special attention to user friendliness and mobile capabilities; has been integrated in more than 16,000 public services and integrated for the provisioning of private services. There are many use cases, for example: with SPID you can request a change of residence, book a health service, consult your health records, send your tax applications, and digitally sign documents. Thanks to this widespread diffusion, SPID offers a multitude of services to its citizens and residents at a click of a button.</p>



 We are only scraping the surface of potential for digital identities and digital wallets. How do you foresee the future of eIDs? 



<p>Well, the future holds unlimited possibilities. We do everything online today – booking a flight, signing legal documents, opening bank accounts, asking for loans. All these use cases require different accounts, passwords and applications, and at some point, applicants will need to prove who they are. Identity proofing is the most painful, costly and frustrating experience of modern times. This will come to an end with the EUDI Wallet. In addition to be able to prove who we are, the EUDI Wallet will enable us to know with whom we are sharing our personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, to have eIDAS 2.0 delivering its full potential, it is important to educate the market, to explain the benefits to citizens, where the Wallet can be used, how it will allow them to control their data, and how to give or withdraw consent.</p>

It has also been crossposted on the blog of our project partner, <a href="http://mysociety.org/2023/03/30/neighbourhood-warmth-monthnotes/">mysociety</a>.</p> Month 0: It’s getting hot in&nbsp;here <p>Here’s a question posed by Immy Kaur at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/M18ovxgiIKQ?feature=share&amp;t=12504">Retrofit Reimagined</a> event last&nbsp;year:</p><blockquote>“What if the climate transition and retrofit of our homes and streets were designed, owned and governed by the people who live&nbsp;there?”</blockquote><p>This is one of those simple questions that holds within it the potential for amazing, transformative consequences. And perhaps the first of those consequences? <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> are kicking off a new partnership, with this proposition at its&nbsp;heart.</p><p>For the next few months we’ll be exploring how we might realise the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/new-value-flows-impact-modelling-and-financing-neighbourhood-retrofit-v0-1-8674f795cef8">Transitioning Together hypothesis</a>, developed by Dark Matter Labs. Together, we’ll build on <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/publications/prototyping-home-energy">lessons</a> from testing mySociety’s <a href="https://mysociety.github.io/neighbourhood-warmth">Neighbourhood Warmth prototype</a>, developed during <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/climate/climate-prototyping/">a series of prototyping weeks</a> in 2022 (pictured below). And we’ll co-create solutions with communities, to test our riskiest assumptions about how collective action on home energy could be catalysed through civic technology.</p>mySociety’s first <a href="https://pages.mysociety.org/neighbourhood-warmth/">Neighbourhood Warmth prototype</a> The spark <p>But how did we get&nbsp;here?</p><p>mySociety’s prototyping weeks allowed their <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/climate/">Climate Programme</a> to quickly dip a toe into several potential areas where their skills and experience could have an effect. The purpose was to understand the potential of civic technology to propel local climate action in each field. External participants generously made time to share their experience and wisdom, guiding a path through jungles of challenges and opportunities. mySociety built prototypes and tested these on the final day of each week to gather feedback. These were synthesised into tentative insights, which were woven into&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Home energy felt like a particularly complex domain to navigate, despite benefiting from the hard-earned knowledge of pioneers like <a href="https://www.powertochange.org.uk/news/carbon-coop-people-powered-revolution/">Jonathan Atkinson</a> during <a href="https://research.mysociety.org/publications/prototyping-home-energy">the second prototyping week</a>. This spurred additional <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qtTI3YuT7u6M3VYh-k4Mq5EYoBBtJKj_RS3n7CwaspU/edit?usp=sharing">research and engagement</a>, to deepen mySociety’s analysis and to explore collaboration.</p><p>Eventually, the idea coalesced that collective action on home energy could overcome critical limitations of the default, individualist approach: from the user experience and motivations, learning, risk and its perception, to level of ambition and the economies of scale. This aligns with the first of <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/2021/11/24/three-shifts-well-make-to-repower-democracy/">three shifts</a> in mySociety’s current strategy — to design for the needs of society, not just provide tools for individual citizens.</p><p>mySociety discovered a handful of trailblazing initiatives that gesture towards the power of coordinated efforts: for example, Carbon Co-op’s <a href="https://carbon.coop/portfolio/levenshulme-abs/">Levenshulme Area Based Retrofit Scheme</a> and Connected Places Catapult’s <a href="https://cp.catapult.org.uk/report/integrated-planning-for-net-zero/">Community Retrofit Service</a> prototype — but no sign of a mature digital infrastructure to support a shift away from atomised&nbsp;action.</p><p>As mySociety edged forwards with their route of enquiry, one organisation’s work proved particularly illuminating: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">Dark Matter Labs, who suggest</a> that a “systemic shift can be achieved by testing strategic interventions in the ‘dark matter’ of the retrofit ecosystem: through piloting and proving out new infrastructures, new standards, new legal patterns, or new institutions.”</p><p>Dark Matter Labs’ explorations around the entanglement of home energy with questions of democracy and justice chime with core concerns for mySociety — for a flavour, check out <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/scaling-the-right-to-retrofit-3b74aa6b08ad">‘A Right to Retrofit’</a>.</p><p>Their approach is a perfect fit for mySociety’s experimental spirit, and together we’re excited to be exploring how our work could be greater that the sum of its&nbsp;parts.</p>A vision of street-based retrofit, from Dark Matter Labs’ earlier work in the&nbsp;space Friction leads to&nbsp;fire <p>Right now we’re crafting a plan to build a functioning version of our Neighbourhood Warmth prototype. This is geared to answer the immediate question that we’re trying to address by the end of&nbsp;May:</p><blockquote>“How can we support communities to organise locally around a simple and achievable home energy&nbsp;action?”</blockquote><p>We believe there is a role for a civic digital platform that supports the process of community coalescing and organising, to open doors to the benefits of collective retrofit.</p><p>Once we’ve built something that people can interact with, we’re planning to test it in a few communities — a mix of places to learn how different contexts make for different outcomes.</p><p>In the final phase, we’ll analyse these lessons and start thinking about where this might go next — perhaps we’ll carry on and build some sort of fully-functioning digital service in this&nbsp;domain.</p><p>If we do, questions will inevitably arise about how people might discover it. We’d love to hear thoughts on that and on this work as a whole, <a href="http://info@darkmatterlabs.org">so please get in touch</a> and share this in any relevant communities.</p>

<p>As we approach the second quarter of 2023, AERGO team decided to hold the first Townhall for 2023. It is a moment to evaluate and reflect on our actions, and&nbsp;results.</p> Genesis of&nbsp;AERGO <p>AERGO was conceived in 2014, before the concept of Ethereum or EVM even existed, based on the initial direction of “blockchain for the enterprise.” Regardless of the industry and era, the need to quickly process large amounts of data in real time with SQL/JDBC support has been consistent. AERGO has been targeting the market through a private blockchain that provides an environment where existing enterprise customers can directly integrate their data with the blockchain.</p> Bridging the Two Universes: de-facto Enterprise to&nbsp;Consumer <p>Over the past few years, various projects based on public blockchains, such as DeFi and NFTs, have seemed to monopolize market attention and drive the growth of the blockchain market. However, private blockchains have been expanding their reach&nbsp;quietly.</p><p>The needs of the enterprise blockchain market are evolving in the form of “Layer 1.5,” which encompasses both private and public blockchains that require connectivity with various chains through technologies such as&nbsp;bridges.</p><p>This is why AERGO has been creating side chains that can interconnect and utilize resources in various environments, from enterprise to public blockchains, based on the core features of SQL language, D-DPOS consensus structure, and <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-merkle-bridge-what-else-is-needed-for-nft-c5170502da3a">Merkle bridges</a>. By utilizing the characteristics of Layer 1.5, AERGO is evolving into a de-facto enterprise blockchain that targets a wide range of enterprise customers, rather than a platform limited to the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Together with its core technology partners, Blocko and Blocko XYZ, AERGO is building and operating <a href="https://www.aergo.io/enterprise">blockchain solutions</a> for various corporate customers, including domestic and foreign entertainment and distribution management companies, and plans to secure more than 500,000 active users within the&nbsp;year.</p><p>In addition, in order to preempt the STO/e-securities field, which has recently attracted the attention of the financial sector, we have unveiled ‘Silvermine’, a security token issuance platform. Silvermine provides basic functions that are difficult to provide by existing cryptocurrency issuance platforms, including issuance, burning, increase and decrease, and division. With this, we plan to expand beyond STOs to non-financial assets such as carbon credits and other asset markets where transaction tracking is critical.</p> AERGO’s Expansion Towards the Public Ecosystem (NFT / Web&nbsp;3) <p>AERGO’s focus is not limited to enterprise blockchain. Through Blocko XYZ, we are expanding our platform to include NFTs and even ‘NFT-as-a-Service’, which allows us to provide additional services such as membership and personal information authentication using SBT (Soul-Bound Token).</p><p>Currently, Blocko XYZ has reduced the cumbersome NFT minting process of over 20 steps from membership to sale to 4 steps, minimized minting costs, and is currently managing about 300,000 active wallets (MAU=active users), with over 800,000 NFTs minted, and continues to increase its share of the domestic NFT&nbsp;market.</p><p>AERGO is planning to support ‘Composable Transaction’ to support the increase in transactions that will occur in the NFT and Web 3 fields in the future and activate the AERGO native token, and has started the transition of the exchange&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>In addition, we have established an <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-labs-funding-the-future-4d195c79858c">Ecosystem Fund</a> to expand the AERGO-based ecosystem and have been providing support to various DApp and service developers. Currently, the closest Dapp to launching is <a href="https://www.booost.live/">BOOOST</a>, an AERGO-based Web 3 social&nbsp;app.</p><p>BOOOST is currently undergoing closed beta testing which features walking and driving modes, but will soon expand into socializing. Users will not only be able to visualize the impact of their daily activities, but will also be able to curate a digital version of themselves, everything on a single app, one activity at a&nbsp;time.</p> Q&amp;A <p>Q1. Are AERGO and Blocko considering to offer alternative payment solutions beyond traditional merchant networks like GemPay&nbsp;still?</p><p>It’s a great question. Payments are an essential feature for expanding beyond just paying to buy goods, and into more services and solutions. It is also key to targeting the B2B market as well as the B2C market, which is why AERGO and Blocko are very positive about developing/introducing additional payment features. Due to volatile market conditions and unclear regulatory issues, it is not easy to launch a crypto-native payment system or DeFi system at the moment. However, AERGO and Blocko are preparing to utilize bridge/cross-chain technology to serve as a payment system in the near future. This will be included in the ‘AERGO 2.0 Whitepaper’, which will be released in May, and we will share more details in a future whitepaper.</p><p>Here’s a preview of what we’ve got lined up for the AERGO 2.0 Whitepaper:</p><p>AERGO Opsilo (working title): A lightweight and easy Web3 and app deployment platform where developers can develop and design Dapps and services while ensuring delivery quality, security, cost optimization, cost management, and compliance throughout the application lifecycle.</p><p>AERGO EVM-Compatibility: A fully EVM-compatible engine, enabling smart contracts written in Solidity to be supported on AERGO smart contract code base to support enterprise-grade applications and Web 3 Dapps in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>AERGO AI / ML: AI and Machine Learning will dynamically change how data is processed and audited. By combining AI / ML with the AERGO blockchain, we will continuously explore and seek to expand the possibilities of AERGO platform.</p><p>Q2. What are your thoughts about introducing new crypto primitives to AERGO mainnet? (i.e., DeFi solutions that allow people &amp; businesses to diversify out of USD, KRW into traditionally safe assets like vaulted tokenized gold &amp;&nbsp;silver)</p><p>In the wake of the recent Luna debacle, blockchain-based stable coins or pegged assets have become the number one target of financial regulators worldwide. While this is definitely something that will be needed in the future, the regulatory risk is too high to develop and launch right&nbsp;now.</p><p>However, a similar area that AERGO and Blocko are currently focusing on is tokenized securities(STOs). On February 3, the Financial Services Commission of South Korea announced to overhaul regulatory system on the issuance and circulation of security tokens. “Token securities” refers to securities under the Act on the Capital Market and Financial Investment Business that are digitized based on distributed ledger technology. The Financial Services Commission has announced that it plans to allow the issuance and distribution of token securities by overhauling the system that has been an obstacle to the issuance and distribution of securities utilizing distributed ledgers.</p><p>Q3. How does AERGO plan to address scalability and interoperability challenges in blockchain technology?</p><p>Scalability and interoperability are two areas we’ve been focusing on since the beginning of AERGO’s development. They are essential for the democratization of blockchain technology, and we want to address them in the following ways.</p><p>1. Scalability: AERGO supports vertical and horizontal scaling. From the initial concept, we have been connecting both on-chain and off-chain using side-chain to enable scalability.</p><p>2. Interoperability: As we have mentioned, AERGO is a Layer 1.5 blockchain, which means that it is a fast, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain that can interoperate between side-chain and private chains using Merkle&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>Q4. How does AERGO ensure regular communication and collaboration with its management team and community members to identify and discuss new ideas and opportunities for&nbsp;growth?</p><p>AERGO will have Townhall sessions and video interviews with executives to engage with the community. Furthermore, we plan to create various channels to communicate with more developers as developers’ engagement will be crucial for AERGO’s current focus on STO, NFTs, and other&nbsp;areas.</p><p>Also, AERGO and Blocko will provide a unified set of tools and developer-friendly environments so that developers can easily build, deploy and run AERGO-based Dapps. Development status and results will be translated into everyday language and announced on the AERGO community and&nbsp;Medium.</p><p>Q5. Would it be possible for you to share a projected release date, or at minimum, a sneak peek of the roadmap to help us better understand your future&nbsp;plans?</p><p>AERGO and Blocko are working on more projects than ever with various Dapp studios, including Booost (Web 3) and Blocko XYZ (NFT/SBT). We’re also currently working with several listed exchanges to support the AERGO mainnet. We’ll be keeping you updated on these developments via <a href="https://twitter.com/aergo_io?s=20">AERGO Twitter</a> and Medium. Starting with this Town hall, we’ll be uploading video interviews with key members of the AERGO and Blocko teams, which will provide key insights into the AERGO 2.0 whitepaper, which will be released in&nbsp;May.</p><p>Q6. Will AERGO move from erc-20 to native Aergo tokens in the foreseeable future? How will AERGO expand its ecosystem? Will there be more implementation partners to help utilize Aergo more broadly? What does AERGO see as the niche where they can thrive in a world with many different L1s?</p><p>AERGO is currently in discussions with most exchanges to convert to mainnet tokens. As mentioned earlier, we are expanding our ecosystem into the Web3 and NFT sectors with various Dapp studios and partners including Blocko XYZ and BOOOST. In the STO space, we are discussing partnerships with other blockchain projects as well as Blocko to broaden the market&nbsp;base.</p><p>AERGO is a fast, low-cost Layer 1 blockchain that can interoperate between side-chain and private chains using Merkle Bridge technology. Our experience in building and maintaining real-world projects, especially for enterprise customers, and our diverse product offerings in response to regulations are advantages that other blockchain projects cannot easily access. We plan to take the lead in the STO field based on these experiences.</p><p>In May, we will release the AERGO 2.0 Whitepaper, which will outline our new direction and development roadmap. As we reshape ourselves to meet market changes and customer demands, we will reveal something worth waiting&nbsp;for.</p><p>Q7. How are you bringing value to the Aergo&nbsp;token?</p><p>As AERGO and Blocko move forward with the project, we are aiming to secure healthier on-chain activities and expand the ecosystem, rather than the short-term value of the Aergo token. BOOOST in the Web3 field and Blocko XYZ in the NFT/SBT field are continuing meaningful activities, so please pay attention to them. We will disclose more details about AERGO’s direction and new technology development plans in&nbsp;May.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/introducing-aergos-townhall-q1-2023-f09757591d1a">Introducing AERGO’s Townhall [Q1 2023]</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>We are happy to share our latest partnership just in time to close our 2023 activity report: NDXInvest.</p><p>NDXInvest is a Singapore-based project aiming to connect individuals to organizational enterprises with Web3-based philosophies and technologies for successful Digital Transformation. The core team is formed by experts who previously work in companies like Samsung and&nbsp;Google.</p><blockquote>NDXInvest’s vision is that “within Open Innovation, individuals will develop and prove their abilities by branching out into different characters. Likewise, enterprises and organizations will branch out into various DAOs and collaborate with various individuals within these DAOs to gain new growth engines.”</blockquote><p>With this partnership the two companies seek to develop a new project that promotes a DAO, a DAC and a new DEX. The DEX would first be launched as a MVP (minimum viable product) using the META-Orbit bridge for locking up and DeFi investing features using Metadium’s and NDX’s native tokens as well as BTC, ETH and&nbsp;MATIC.</p><p>The Metadium Team welcomes our new partner to the ecosystem of companies working together to bring blockchain technology closer to people’s&nbsp;life.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>올해 1분기 마지막 파트너십사인 NDXInvest를 소개합니다.</p><p>NDXInvest는 성공적인 디지털 트랜스포메이션을 위한 Web3 기반의 철학과 기술로 개인을 조직, 기업과 연결하는 것을 목표로 하는 싱가포르 기반의 프로젝트입니다. 팀의 핵심 구성원은 삼성과 구글 등에서 근무한 이력이 있는 전문가들로 구성되어&nbsp;있습니다.</p><blockquote>NDXInvest의 비전은 “오픈 이노베이션 내에서 개인은 다양한 캐릭터로 분기하여 자신의 능력을 개발하고 증명할 것이다. 마찬가지로 기업과 조직은 다양한 DAO로 분기하고 이러한 DAO 내의 다양한 개인과 협력하여 새로운 성장 동력을 확보할 것”이라고&nbsp;말합니다.</blockquote><p>이번 파트너십을 통해 양 사는 DAO, DAC 및 새로운 DEX를 촉진하는 신규 프로젝트를 개발할 예정입니다. DEX는 우선 메타디움과 NDX의 고유 토큰뿐만 아니라 BTC, ETH 및 MATIC을 사용하여 잠금 및 DeFi 투자 기능을 위해 META-Orbit 브릿지를 사용하는 MVP(최소 기능 제품)로 출시될&nbsp;예정입니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀은 블록체인 기술을 사람들의 삶에 더 가깝게 만들기 위해 협력하는 생태계에 함께 하게 된 새로운 파트너를 진심으로&nbsp;환영합니다.</p><p>- 메타디움&nbsp;팀</p><p>Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a></p><p>Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a></p><p>Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a></p><p>Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a></p><p>Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-dex-activity-acfe9b4024cb">Metadium’s new DEX activity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The CA/Browser Forum has approved <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/02/ballot-sc61v4-new-crl-entries-must-have-a-revocation-reason-code/">Ballot SC61</a> with directions as to which certificate revocation lists (CRL) revocation reason code should be used for a revocation of a TLS certificates.</p>
<p>What is the problem? <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt">RFC 5280</a> provides a list of revocation reason codes, but it is left to each Certification Authority (CA) to determine which code they will use. The result is inconsistency in the reason codes provided in different CRLs.</p>
<p>So why does inconsistency matter as revocation is revocation, right? If the CAs use consistent revocation reasons, then the browsers may be able to use the revocation reason to provide different output to the browser users. For instance, a certificate which has been revoked due to key compromise may be indicating an attacker is using the private key, so the certificate should not be trusted. On the other hand, if a certificate was revoked because it was renewed would mean the original certificate did not have any trust issues. The result may be that the browsers would support hard revocation for some revocation reasons and not for others.</p>
<p>So what is hard revocation? This would mean the certificate should not be trusted, so the website would not be presented to the browser user.</p>
<p>Here is the list of revocation reasons from RFC 5280 with a description as to when the reason can be used.</p>
 
 unspecified (0) – used when no specific reason is provided, a CA right to issue has expired, or for a reason specified in the CA’s CP or CPS, which is not specified in the <a href="https://cabforum.org/baseline-requirements-documents/">TLS Baseline Requirements</a> (TLS BRs) 
 keyCompromise (1) – the private key corresponding to the certificate has been compromised, the private key is weak and can be easily computed, or the method to generate the private key was flawed 
 cACompromise (2) – this reason is not applicable to TLS certificates; however a CA can use this reason if an associated CA is compromised 
 affiliationChanged (3) – no use designated in the TLS BRs 
 superseded (4) – the validation of the domain name or IP address is not reliable, the key size or public key parameters are not applicable, or the certificate was issued not in compliance with the TLS BRs or the CP/CPS 
 cessationOfOperation (5) – the website associated with the certificate is no longer in operation 
 certificateHold (6) – not allowed to be used by the TLS BRs 
 removeFromCRL (8) – not applicable 
 privilegeWithdrawn (9) – certificate request was not authorized, certificate was misused, subscriber violated the subscriber agreement, wildcard certificate supports a fraudulent domain name, there is a material change in the information in the certificate, or the information in the certificate is inaccurate 
 aACompromise (10) – not applicable 
 
<p>Ballot SC61 is effective 15 July 2023, so the CAs will be updating their policies and procedures before this date.</p>
<p>Since many CAs also issue other certificates such as Code Signing and S/MIME, we can expect similar revocation reason practices to be used for all certificate types.</p>

<p>Social engineering is still one of the most successful forms of attack in the wild, including various phishing attacks. One form of this threat, spear phishing, uses research and user targeting to breach sensitive systems.</p>
 What Is Spear Phishing? 
<p>Spear phishing is a social engineering attack targeting specific individuals or groups with tailored, sophisticated, and fraudulent communications. In a spear phishing attack, the hacker typically gathers information about the target through extensive research, such as their name, job title, or personal interests. The hacker uses that information to create a compelling message that appears to come from a trusted source, such as a colleague or a company they do business with, to get them to part with their credentials.</p>
<p>The goal of a spear phishing attack is usually to trick the target into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data, or to install malware on their computer or mobile device.</p>
 What Are Some Key Aspects of Spear Phishing? 
<p>Spear phishing is different from regular phishing in several key ways:</p>
 
 Targeting: Spear phishing attacks are highly personalized. The attacker behind a spear phishing attack will typically research the target to gather the information that can be used to create a message that appears to be from a trusted source, such as a colleague or a company they do business with. 
 
<p>While regular phishing attacks are typically sent to many people with a generic message, spear phishing attacks include information and messaging that speaks directly to the recipient.</p>
 
 Sophistication: Spear phishing attacks are often more sophisticated and convincing than regular phishing attacks. These attacks are more likely to be professional looking with more obfuscation around spoofing and free of spelling and grammatical errors. 
 Objectives: The objective of a spear phishing attack is often more specific than that of a regular phishing attack. Instead of trying to obtain generic information such as login credentials, attackers may want to trick the recipient into accessing critical systems or information or to initiate financial transactions that only the victim can do. 
 
<p>While spear phishing and regular phishing attacks rely on social engineering tactics to trick targets into divulging sensitive information or installing malware, spear phishing attacks are typically more personalized, sophisticated, and specific in their objectives. As a result, spear phishing attacks can be more challenging to detect and defend against.</p>
 How Can I Protect Against Spear Phishing Attacks? 
<p>Spear Phishing is a significant threat, but it isn’t an insurmountable challenge. There are several short- and long-term practices and processes that your organization can put into place to prevent spear phishing attacks.</p>
<p>Some of these include:</p>
 
 Education: Employees should learn about attackers’ tactics and how to recognize a spear phishing attack. The common conception that it’s easier to fool entry-level employees over executives has been disproven over the years. With the rising skills of attackers, everyone in a company org chart must understand how these threats work. 
 Verify And Source of Communication: Before responding to an email or clicking on a link, verify the sender’s email address and check the domain name. If you need more clarification, reach out to the supposed sender through an alternate means to confirm their identity. 
 Implement Email Security: Email security measures such as DMARC, DKIM, SPF, and other methods to reduce the risk of your domain name being spoofed in spear phishing attacks. For example, these allow you to whitelist email domains, prevent known spamming domains from sending emails to recipients inside the organization, and insert warning HTML signals into emails from outside domains to warn recipients about the potential for phishing. 
 Don’t Trust Links or Attachments: Don’t click on links or download attachments from unknown or untrusted sources. Even if the message appears to be from a known source, be cautious when links are shortened or appear out of context. 
 Use Multi-Factor Authentication: MFA, especially with biometrics, can add an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a secondary authentication method beyond a password. This can prevent everyday credential hacks by making it impossible for hackers to pass MFA login challenges. 
 Sanitize Online Professional Presence: The more information a professional shares on open networks, the more a hacker can use to craft convincing spear phishing attacks. Post only what is necessary and maintain privacy over all other accounts. 
 Use Passwordless Authentication: While passwordless (or even MFA) can’t stop human error, it can simply remove a hacker’s ability to steal credentials from a spear phishing attack. 
 
<p>Following these best practices can help protect yourself and your organization against spear phishing attacks.</p>
 How Is Spear Phishing Different from Other Forms of Phishing? 
<p>Spear phishing is set apart from other attacks due to its targeted nature and how sophisticated their delivery is.</p>
<p>Consider these different types of phishing attacks:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/email-phishing/">Email Phishing</a>: This is the most common type of phishing attack, in which attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to be from legitimate sources to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. 
 Smishing: This is a type of phishing attack that is carried out via SMS or other messaging apps. Attackers trick targets into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. 
 Vishing: Voice phishing is a type of phishing attack that is carried out over the phone or via video conferencing and chat software. The attacker poses as a legitimate individual or organization and fools the target into revealing sensitive information or performing a specific action, such as transferring money. 
 Clone Phishing: In this type of attack, the attacker creates a nearly identical copy of a legitimate email or website, often using the same branding and layout. The attacker then sends the fake email or link to the target, hoping to trick them into revealing sensitive information. 
 
<p>Spear phishing, and the closely-related threat of “<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">whaling</a>” (or spear phishing that targets <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/executive-phishing/">high-level executives</a>) <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">can use different kinds of technical approaches</a> like those listed above, layered with the added research and targeting tactics that make these attack vectors more dangerous.</p>
 
Thwart Spear Phishing Attempts with 1Kosmos Passwordless Authentication 
<p>One of the best ways to shortcut successful phishing attacks is to eliminate the need for passwords. While this isn’t foolproof, cutting out the password part of authentication can make it extremely difficult for attackers to access a system.</p>
<p>That’s where 1Kosmsos BlockID comes in. With 1Kosmos, you get the benefits of strong biometric authentication, compliant identity verification, decentralized identity management, and streamlined user onboarding.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can utilize the following features:</p>

 Individual user segment of DI market will grow fastest&nbsp; 



<p>Grand View Research’s DI report reveals some interesting market&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decentralized-identity-market-worth-102-130000466.html">insights</a>, including that the individual user segment of the DI industry is projected to register the fastest growth rate over the forecast period given the privacy and security benefits it offers individual users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SMEs and banking are forecast as the fastest growing industry users of the new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an example of how enterprises and customers are already embracing DI products and services, Experian reports in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.com/decision-analytics/global-fraud-report">2021 Global Identity and Fraud Report</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.com/decision-analytics/global-fraud-report">60 percent</a>&nbsp;of global consumers now use a mobile wallet – up from 53 per cent pre-pandemic.&nbsp;<br><br>Explore Anonyome Labs’ new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">Sudo Platform decentralized identity wallet SDK</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity wallets like the one we offer through&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;replace passwords with public and private key encryption to give users more secure access, anchored in blockchain technology. Users use the identity wallet to store their verifiable credentials and to present them as proofs when requesting access to products and services. The wallet app also allows for cross-provider end-to-end encrypted messaging. Learn&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">more</a>.</p>



<p>With the continued rise of the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance economy</a>, the world needs solutions that improve&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;for everyday internet users. Decentralized identity is widely recognized as the most important privacy technology innovation for the next decade because it gives users unprecedented control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized identity-based applications rely on&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">blockchain</a>&nbsp;as the anchor of trust and therefore decentralized identity is one of the most important use cases for blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apparently, Linus of Linus Tech Tips, a YouTube channel known for…uh tech tips…didn’t read <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/lapsus-facebook-and-your-corporate-network">,my blog post on session cookie stealing attacks</a>. Or maybe they read it, and I wasn’t clear enough. Whatever.</p>

<p>The point of this post is to explain how even the best can be vulnerable. So, grab some popcorn, and let's dive in and learn life lessons from Linus.</p>
 Act 1: A Cunning Cyber Trap <p>An unsuspecting Linus Tech Tips team member opened an email containing malware craftily disguised as a mouth-watering sponsorship offer. This sneaky little program wasted no time, swiping session tokens from the victim's browsers (Chrome and Edge) which gave attackers some of the keys to Linus’s kingdom. And what did they do with their newfound power? What anyone would do: stream fake Elon Musk crypto scam videos and delete channel content, of course!</p>
 Act 2: Linus vs. The Hackers <p>At 3 AM Linus and his team embarked on a naked race (seriously, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGXaAWbzl5A">,evidence</a>--but only after you finish reading this post) to contain the attack. </p> 
   The team hadn't prepared a disaster response plan. So the team had to make stuff up as they went along. Of course, you’ve got a plan in place, right? If not, subscribe, like, and follow us on LinkedIn and I promise I’ll explain how.. 
   Linus, bless his heart, focused on password security and two-factor authentication. That’s usually the right move, but in this case, the attackers had waltzed in through the session token (or session cookie) their malware stole. 
   Google's tools, ever the trusty sidekicks, glitched and timed out, adding to the team's mounting frustrations. 
   The cold weather in Linus’s room shrink Linus’s patience and, uh, ego. 
 
 Act 3: The Cavalry Arrived <p>When all seemed lost, Google's Partner support swooped in, identifying the compromised account and banned it, restoring order and videos to their Tech Tips realm.</p> The Moral of the Story <p>What wisdom can we extract from this tale?</p> 
   Have a plan: Know your services, who has the keys to them, and how to snatch those keys back when needed. 
   Arm yourself with the right tools: Powerful weapons like <a href="https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM/">,Google Apps Manager (GAM)</a> can help automate Google Workplace processes to speed things up if you’re comfortable with the command-line and maybe some scripts. Not for everyone. Still, they are not enough as they do not cover other services which are vulnerable to this attack, so having a plan for how to kill sessions on all critical services is critical. 
   Keep it simple: If you're looking for a user-friendly ally, consider YeshID, designed to help you manage your security without breaking a sweat. 
   Find out who added the strawberry to the video. 
  A word from our sponsor <p>YeshID is a next-generation identity and access management solution. The tool is dead simple to use and smart enough to help create a disaster plan, identify and control who has access to what, and mitigate threats with one click. It’s designed to be delightful to use, created with CEOs, founders, and others in mind who wake up to a disaster and wonder why they are still the super admin.</p>
 Serious moment: Session Token Theft – Don’t Get Infected <p>Protecting against session token theft is incredibly hard. You can learn more about this attack in my previous post <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/lapsus-facebook-and-your-corporate-network">,here</a>, but let me summarize it for you: a session token cookie is a way to authenticate you without you needing to type in your password (or <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/post/give-passwords-the-finger">,give your finger</a>) on Every. Single. Action. Think of them as temporary passwords your browser enters for you on every action. These cookies live in your browser storage and are carefully protected. Unless they are stolen via malware, as in this case. Stealing a session token allows the bad actor to authenticate as you without any friction (password, finger, face…)</p>

<p>There is currently no perfect solution to detect and prevent this attack because each website does it differently. If you are on Google Workspace to Enterprise edition, I recommend reducing <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9368756">,session duration</a> to something that won’t annoy users too much.</p>
<p>Don’t forget other services (if they support it), e.g., <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/115005223763-Manage-session-duration-">,Manage session duration | Slack</a>. Sorry, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisburger/">,Kris</a>.</p>

<p>You can go further and enable <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/12645308?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=9262521#:~:text=Understand%20use%20case%20examples%20for%20Context%2DAware%20Access">,Context-Aware Access</a>, and configure it only to allow access from specific trusted devices, but it only <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380?hl=en#:~:text=About%20editions-,Apps,-Platform%20requirements">,covers very specific Google apps</a>, and that doesn’t help Linus as it does not cover YouTube, or third-party services. Or, if you bought GitHub Enterprise and did a SAML integration for that extra Enteprirse-level security, you won’t benefit from Context-Aware Access because that’s <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/9275380?hl=en#zippy=%2Capps:~:text=The%20exception%20is%20SAML%20apps%2C%20which%20are%20evaluated%20on%20sign%2Din.">,not covered</a>:</p>
<p>I am optimistic that the future will be better than today. OIDC (OpenID Connect) - the technology most commonly used for SSO these days - has recently approved the specifications for enabling better session management across different websites and apps with <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-session-1_0.html">,Final: OpenID Connect Session Management 1.0</a>, and support for forcing a logout with <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html">,Final: OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout 1.0</a>, but adoption will take some time. Until then: Avoid malware.</p>
 In Conclusion: <p>The Linus Tech Tips hack was a rollercoaster of emotions, but we've emerged from it wiser and more prepared for the twists and turns of the digital security world. So let's raise a toast to learning from other people's misfortunes and staying safe out there, folks!</p>

				  Digital travel credentials create frictionless, accurate data verification while preserving data privacy at every touchpoint across the traveler’s journey  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>The way we travel has changed a lot in recent years. Travelers expect a seamless travel experience from before they get on the airplane to their final destination.</p>
<p>Today, at the Queen Beatrix Airport in Oranjestad, Aruba, the government of Aruba, SITA and Indicio, announced the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/transformative-innovation-arrives-at-arubas-queen-beatrix-international-airport/">successful trial</a>&nbsp; of a new mobile application that enables seamless travel to Aruba.</p>
<p>The app —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/sita-app-travelers-digitally-cross-border-before-arrival">Aruba Happy One Pass</a> (Aruba HOP) — allows an air traveler to&nbsp; to create a digital travel credential (DTC) from their passport. The DTC allows the passenger to pre-populate their Embarkation and Debarkation card (ED card) as required for travel to Aruba. The traveler can use the selective disclosure features of the credential to select the specific information they need to share by law to clear immigration —&nbsp;and, critically,&nbsp; they can do all this before they step foot on the aircraft.</p>
<p>The ability of immigration to verify all this information as authentic and uniquely belonging to the traveler streamlines arrival in Aruba. Pre-filling information directly from a passport ensures greater accuracy and less error, while a simple scan frees travelers from long waiting lines.</p>
<p>Dangui Oduber, Minister of tourism, public health, and sports for Aruba, described the trial as the result of Aruba’s relentless focus on innovation backed by a strategy of seeking collaborative partnerships with a broad range of stakeholders. He said he wants the entire hospitality sector on Aruba to be able to take advantage of the digital technologies behind AHOP to provide visitors to the island with a superlative, “seamless” travel experience.</p>

				<a href="https://indicio.tech/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8H5A8573.jpg" title=""></a>
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>The Aruba HOP trial resulted in a 64% reduction of the manual entry of passport information into the ED card website, and had an overall 100% error-free clearance rate of participating travelers, meaning the information contained in trial participants’s ED card was digitally verified by immigration authorities to be accurate for all participants.</p>
<p>Here are some of the other ways this app adds value to the overall travel experience:</p>
<p>Convenience<br>Travel can be stressful, especially when it comes to managing travel documents and clearing immigration. With a digital travel credential that clears immigration before boarding, travelers can have a stress-free and enjoyable travel experience.</p>
<p>Contactless<br>The COVID-19 pandemic has made contactless interactions a priority in all aspects of life, including travel. This app offers a contactless solution to clear immigration. Travelers can create a digital travel credential using their verifiable credentials, eliminating the need for physical documents exchange.</p>
<p>Security<br>Verifiable credentials are secure and tamper-proof, making them an ideal solution for digital travel credentials. Any attempt to alter the information in the credential breaks the credential.&nbsp; This means border protection can quickly clear pre-approved&nbsp; travelers with the assurance that their documents are authentic.</p>
<p>Compliance<br>Governments worldwide are implementing strict data protection regulations. This app ensures that travelers’ personal information and travel details are secure and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals. This feature provides peace of mind for travelers, knowing that their data is safe and protected.</p>
<p>The next step<br>Aruba HOP represents a leap forward in digital travel, one that starts with the need for data privacy and delivers the seamless verification that will transform our experience of travel.</p>
<p>Built with the highest level of interoperability using open standards and open source technologies from Hyperledger Foundation, the verifiable credential technology powering the&nbsp; DTC can be easily integrated into any existing hardware and technology infrastructure.</p>
<p>As the world continues to adapt to the changes brought by new mobile and biometric technologies, digital solutions such as digital travel credentials and verifiable credentials are the easiest way to ensure verification of quality data, a smooth traveler experience, and a privacy-protected method for managing travel.</p>

 Part 2: Exploring how new digital tools and better shared data can support zero carbon, bio-based and circular construction. MatR: A digital registry for a building’s material, component and performance data<p>This is part of a series of blog posts introducing the work <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> (DML) has been doing over the past two years as part of the <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> funded <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC: EU CINCO project</a>, to support efforts to decarbonise construction through the use of low embodied carbon, bio-based materials and the transition to more circular construction practices.</p><p>This piece explores how innovation in digital tools and standardised shared data could support the transition to a lower embodied carbon and more circular built environment. It introduces MatR — a digital tool for recording material, environmental impact and performance data for buildings — that we’ve been developing and prototyping with our partners, <a href="https://spatialtech.info/">The Center for Spatial Technologies</a> (CST).</p><p>You’ll find links to the rest of the series at the&nbsp;end.</p> Our built environment is costing us the&nbsp;Earth <p>The environmental impact of our built environment is astonishing. Buildings are responsible for<a href="https://architecture2030.org/why-the-building-sector/"> 40% of global carbon emissions</a> or 10 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2e each year — when measuring both <a href="https://www.istructe.org/resources/guidance/carbon-embodied-operational/">embodied and operational carbon</a>. This is larger than our <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-fired-electricity">global emissions from coal-fired power plants</a>. To meet a net zero scenario by 2030, this figure must fall to below 4 Gt annually.</p>Aerial photo of a quarry (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@adamrhodes?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Adam Rhodes</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a>)<p>At the same time, of the <a href="https://circularity-gap.world/2021">100 Gt of materials we extract each year</a> globally, construction is responsible for nearly 40%. Waste arising from the construction and demolition of buildings and infrastructure represents <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/construction-and-demolition-waste_en">more than a third</a> of all waste materials generated in the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>Not only are buildings carbon intensive before they’re even finished, but their performance has a significant impact on our health once we start using them. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00338-0">recent study</a> found indoor air pollution to be responsible for over 3 million deaths in 2020 alone, almost as many as attributed to outdoor air pollution.

The compounding risks of material scarcity — and knock-on <a href="https://www.raconteur.net/construction/material-shortages-construction/">construction product shortages </a>and price volatility — as well as rapidly <a href="https://reductionroadmap.dk/">depleting carbon budget</a>, means we have no choice but to drastically reassess how and where we use materials, whilst making as much use of existing buildings and their components, as possible.</p><p>We must carefully weigh up when it makes sense to retrofit a building — taking into account the embodied carbon and material requirement of doing so, compared to the projected operational carbon reduction over its life cycle as well as potential benefit to occupant health — versus making better use of it as is, or deconstructing for reuse. When new construction is critical, we should design and construct for disassembly and reconfiguration, whilst retaining vital data for future reuse. For existing buildings, we must find efficient methods to locate and tag reusable components, logging their specification and current condition, helping to assess how and where they can be&nbsp;reused.</p><p>But, we have one big problem — we don’t know what most buildings are made of, or how they actually&nbsp;perform.</p> Current data limitations <p>Whilst we’re awash with tools to track our own behaviour; from sleep patterns, to dating habits, and even life expectancy — we currently lack access to shared, robust data on what our built environment is made of, its environmental impact, and how it functions throughout its&nbsp;life.</p><p>So what are the main challenges in this&nbsp;space?</p>  Lack of embodied carbon benchmarks: City officials, planners, architects and developers lack localised and typology-linked benchmarks for setting thresholds for embodied carbon and circularity in both new buildings and refurbishments, through building regulations and procurement — in Europe, only Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France and the Netherlands <a href="https://fs.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/7520151/RMC/Content/EU-ECB-Summary-Report.pdf">were found to have</a> baseline data of sufficient sample size and quality. Whilst generic emissions databases exist (e.g. <a href="https://ecoinvent.org/">Ecoinvent</a>, <a href="https://circularecology.com/embodied-carbon-footprint-database.html">ICE</a>), these vary in life cycle scope and geographic context. From our experience working with partners in Madrid and Milan, currently there are no standardised emissions databases for benchmarking buildings or for local construction products. Our interviews highlighted this as a key factor which made it difficult to establish incentive mechanisms or attract investment because it reduced certainty on what constitutes a low embodied carbon project and how it should be measured and demonstrated, leading to an increased perception of risk or unclear&nbsp;reward.  Lack of component specific embodied carbon data: Whilst Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for construction products are increasing — with over <a href="https://constructionlca.co.uk/2023/03/01/over-130000-construction-product-epd-available-globally/">130,000</a> now available globally — this is still relatively few. It’s therefore difficult for designers, developers and construction professionals to conduct product-specific embodied carbon assessments using standardised data — in terms of format, life cycle scope and geographic context. At the same time, only around half of these EPDs are machine-readable, preventing widespread integration with digital&nbsp;tools.  BIM adoption and whole life implementation: Building Information Modelling (BIM) is still not widely used in many geographical contexts, including Madrid and Milan. <a href="https://www.planradar.com/gb/bim-adoption-in-europe/">Adoption amongst European construction companies</a> ranges from 73% in the UK to 35% in France, and 20% in Austria. There’s also a lack of digitals tools and standards to make it easy for designers and developers to integrate embodied carbon and material circularity related decisions in the design process. At the same time BIM files tend to be discarded or remain static once a building is built, losing valuable information for optimising building use and future deconstruction.  Missing or inconsistent building performance data: Building performance data — for instance indoor air quality, light and noise levels, water use — is generally considered separately from embodied carbon and material circularity metrics, if measured at all. For facility managers and building owners to make more informed decisions to maximise utilisation of existing spaces and minimise environmental impact of renovations and new buildings, understanding the full picture of building performance and embodied impacts is necessary.  Lack of data on reusable products and circularity metrics: A lack of data documenting the condition, specification, location and potential for reuse of building components and materials, makes it difficult for designers and construction contractors to specify reused products. Without recognised certification and standards for reusable products, construction professionals remain hesitant of reuse. At the same time circularity metrics for buildings are yet to be standardised; and whilst a number of recent <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels/lets-meet-levels/how-does-levels-work_en">frameworks</a> and <a href="https://www.circuit-project.eu/post/report-recommendations-on-circularity-indicators-for-a-circularity-dashboard">research projects</a> make proposals, they are yet to become mandatory.  Data aggregation: There’s a need for digital tools to integrate and aggregate material and environmental impact data from individual components, to systems, to buildings, to cities; to identify local material stocks and track their flows, from the scale of a door handle to a city’s material economy. For instance, tools like <a href="https://onderzoek.amsterdam.nl/publicatie/the-circular-economy-monitor-an-outline">Amsterdam’s Monitor</a>, which measures total material flows (including those resulting from the built environment) within the city alongside their associated carbon emissions and other environmental costs, can help cities to monitor their progress towards material circularity.  <p>For a more detailed overview of barriers and opportunities, as well as relevant existing initiatives in relation to innovations in digital tools and data that could support the transition to a lower embodied carbon and more circular built environment, see our <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xm1k389BQjz3N8KZoLC-uqgvJ-BFXi9f/view?usp=sharing">Digital tools and data: Briefing document</a>.</p> What should we do about&nbsp;it? <p>Whilst it’s useful to understand materials, environmental impact and performance at the scale of an individual building, it becomes exponentially more powerful when aggregated at the scale of cities and regions. Developing these tools in close partnership with municipal governments and city stakeholders will be fundamental to their success and therefore their public&nbsp;value.</p><p>Successful solutions in this space should be designed to facilitate mass adoption; by a diverse range of user types; for a spectrum of use cases — from planning teams and developers to deconstruction contractors and reused component certifiers. We feel it will be necessary to identify and develop a standardised approach, aligned to internationally recognised frameworks and regulations — for example <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels_en">Level(s)</a>; the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/energy-climate-change-environment/standards-tools-and-labels/products-labelling-rules-and-requirements/sustainable-products/ecodesign-sustainable-products_en">Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation</a> (ESPR) and related <a href="https://www.corporateleadersgroup.com/files/cisl_digital_products_passport_report_v6.pdf">Digital Product Passports</a> (DPPs); and recently revised <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0068_EN.pdf">Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)</a> — that integrates with existing digital tools used by built environment professionals.</p><p>For these reasons, we believe it’s important to adopt an open-source approach — taking inspiration from tools like <a href="https://speckle.systems/">Speckle</a> and <a href="https://ifcjs.io/">IFC.js</a> — to foster widespread adoption and enable future adaptation to local contexts and use cases; rather than implementing a closed system using proprietary software.</p><p>Through this work, we believe several criteria will be critical:</p>  Make it open-source: Building on existing open source tools and standards to support data exchange from multiple data sources and integration with other architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software tools whilst enabling users to adopt and extend for diverse use&nbsp;cases.  Share data: Data exists on a <a href="https://www.theodi.org/about-the-odi/the-data-spectrum/">spectrum</a>, from closed, shared to open. Data permissions will help to unlock public value through sharing built environment data, whilst ensuring access to sensitive data — for example building occupancy or security — requires authentication. Decentralised publishing of data, using open standards, as seen in the <a href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk/">Open Banking initiative</a>, can help to standardise sharing across a sector and increase collaboration. Data pooling, of aggregate data from multiple sources, can generate a critical mass of data for analysis and benchmarking across a geography or sector. This may require stewardship from a data institution to act as a trusted intermediary.  Build for the web: Developing a tool that can run in a browser will allow the data to be accessed quickly without proprietary software or specialised hardware, enabling different use cases. Whilst designing it to integrate with recognised AEC tools, currently used by built environment professionals, can help users adopt the new tool as part of their existing workflows.  Integrate multiple sources: This will require a tool capable of gathering data from multiple discrete sources — whether via external datasets and an application programming interface (API); or wireless sensors in buildings; or user input data — and linked to a 3D BIM of the building and its components.  Adopt physical asset tags: It will be necessary to develop a method to encode each unique ID from the digital model to a physical object. This could use proven technologies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification">RFID</a> tags or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a>, or adopt novel solutions to <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/12/dna-of-things-storing-data-in-everyday-objects.html">embed data in the objects themselves</a>.  Align to regulation: Designed to align and integrate with <a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/regulation_on_ecodesign_for_sustainable_products.pdf">incoming regulation</a> on sustainable products and aligned to the <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels_en">Level(s) sustainable building reporting framework</a>. The recently passed <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2023-0068_EN.pdf">revision to the EPBD</a> will require embodied carbon to be calculated as part of life-cycle global warming potential (GWP), using a harmonised approach across member states. It also invites the inclusion of embodied carbon data, as part of mandatory national energy performance of buildings databases, using the <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/circular-economy/levels/lets-meet-levels/how-does-levels-work_en">Level(s) indicators</a>. Here, regulation will be critical for driving behaviour change across the industry, and better, open-source data systems can support the implementation of a harmonious approach across&nbsp;Europe.  Apply to new builds and retrofits: Given the criticality of retrofitting existing buildings and continuing requirement for new buildings, developing a tool appropriate for analysing materials, environmental impact and performance in both use cases is vital. Neglecting to account for embodied carbon in retrofit projects risks misrepresenting their intended carbon savings and exacerbating the climate crisis. It’s only fairly recently that the industry has started to recognise this, with <a href="https://www.leti.uk/_files/ugd/252d09_c71428bafc3d42fbac34f9ad0cd6262b.pdf">guidelines</a> and <a href="https://caretool.org/">tools</a> emerging to guide retrofit projects on this&nbsp;topic.  <p>For now, these criteria remain assumptions, based on our research and experience to date. We’ll continue to validate and reassess them as we develop and test our approach alongside a range of stakeholders.</p> A new approach — MatR <p>A digital registry for a building’s material, component and performance data.</p><p>In response to the barriers and design principles, DML together with partners has been working on one possible approach. MatR is an open source, web-based digital tool that aggregates data on what buildings are made of and how well they perform. It creates a secure digital repository for each building with the digital architecture to link multiple data sources — from environmental impact and material circularity data, to component reuse potential and residual&nbsp;value.</p>MatR proof of concept: A digital registry for a building’s material, component and performance data<p>MatR enables a range of users — from architects and developers to city officials or deconstruction contractors (more on this below) — to connect data to a live BIM file of a building. This may be technical specifications from manufacturers; environmental impact data from <a href="https://www.environdec.com/about-us/the-international-epd-system-about-the-system">EPDs</a> or <a href="https://ecoinvent.org/">life cycle inventory datasets</a>; air quality or noise from indoor sensors; a log of component condition and any repairs; or residual value of components.</p><p>This registry of materials and building performance can then be scaled from a building, to a district, to a city or even nation — contributing to a dataset providing the granularity of the constituent materials in a door handle, to the aggregation of material flows across a city. In the future, it could integrate directly with public datasets and dashboards — for instance emerging <a href="https://stadsutveckling.goteborg.se/sa-planeras-staden/digitaltvilling/">digital twins</a> and <a href="https://3d.amsterdam.nl/index.html">3D city models</a>. Data permissions would ensure that any sensitive data — for example detailed BIM files or granular energy use data — is only accessible via authentication, whilst open data standards can enable aggregate data to be pooled at the city level to inform benchmarks and analyse material&nbsp;flows.</p>Data aggregation and sharing — From the door handle to the&nbsp;city<p>During the planning of a new building, city officials could use city level aggregate data to set planning requirements for embodied carbon or material use. This tool could allow developers and investors — whether commercial, public or civic — to be much clearer on the environmental impact of their projects and drive supply side change via market signals whilst avoiding greenwashing. In the design stage, architects can use specific product-level data to inform their designs and meet benchmarks. During construction, the registry can be used to log the actual components used and specify maintenance or deconstruction requirements. In the use phase, building operators can track building performance, log maintenance processes and monitor the condition of components. At end of life, a digitised inventory pre-populated with deconstruction guides can help contractors disassemble the building and provide a verified dataset on component specification and condition, to better facilitate reuse. This could contribute to a city-wide material reuse platform, identifying when materials are available (or soon to be available) for reuse; where they are; their specification; and what condition they’re&nbsp;in.</p><p>At end of life, a digitised inventory pre-populated with deconstruction guides can help contractors disassemble the building and provide a verified dataset on component specification and condition, to better facilitate reuse. This could contribute to a city-wide material reuse platform, identifying when materials are available (or soon to be available) for reuse; where they are; their specification; and what condition they’re&nbsp;in.</p><p>We believe this approach can be considered innovative in several&nbsp;ways:</p>  Open source software and shared data approach: To support wider collaboration within the construction sector and between diverse stakeholders, to drive the transition to a post-carbon and regenerative built environment. Some of the more developed initiatives in this area use proprietary tools and closed datasets.  Web-based interface and BIM integration: MatR is a cloud-based tool, linked directly to a digital BIM file, connecting multiple different users throughout the building life cycle and extending the functionality of BIM from design through to deconstruction. It does not require specialist hardware or proprietary software licences and aligns to open BIM standards. Existing material passport tools tend to export data from a BIM file, detaching the live file from a material&nbsp;dataset.  Integrating building performance data: Understanding the performance of buildings is critical to measuring how efficiently we use materials. We believe tracking building performance alongside environmental impact and circularity of materials is necessary in order to assess the opportunity costs of how we use scarce materials in the built environment.   MatR — Proof of&nbsp;concept <p>As part of the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC EU CINCO project</a>, we’ve been working with <a href="https://spatialtech.info/">The Center for Spatial Technologies</a> to develop a technical proof of concept (PoC) of this tool — MatR. The PoC currently enables the user to access a BIM file through a web browser; view an inventory of all components; view aggregate data on material mass and embodied carbon for the overall building; and view specific data for select components, including their specification, environmental impact and material circularity (sourced from&nbsp;EPDs).</p>MatR — Building and component level&nbsp;metrics<p>The mockup UX for the MatR platform demonstrates how a user could access data for multiple buildings and projects; manage user permissions; set environmental impact targets; and analyse emissions, circularity and performance related data in a single dashboard.</p>MatR — Data platform&nbsp;UX<p>The team is in the process of validating the concept through user testing with built environment professionals, including architects, developers and city planners. Feedback will help to inform the tool’s future development and ensure the team prioritises the development of functionality that is most critical.</p> Why better data&nbsp;matters <p>The possible impact of material registries can be considered across several horizons.</p><p>In the near-term it could&nbsp;enable:</p>  Low carbon material selection and building design: Supporting architects, engineers and developers to design low carbon and circular buildings by selecting low impact and reusable components.  Lower the cost and complexity of compliance: Tools like MatR can reduce the costs and complexity associated with complying to sustainability related building regulations, procurement requirements and certifications.  Generate local benchmarks: Data collected can contribute to local benchmarks for different building typologies, helping city officials to set more accurate targets within regulation or procurement requirements.  <p>In the longer-term:</p>  Performance-based regulation and contracting of space: Better building data could enable more agile regulation of the construction and use of buildings, based on their performance or outcomes they contribute to. In the future, this could enable the taxation of underutilised assets or those that don’t contribute to public&nbsp;value.  Materials accounting: With intensifying material scarcity, price volatility and dwindling carbon budgets making material accounting increasingly important; the availability of robust, shared data on materials and buildings will be vital. Citywide accounting of material flows or component life cycles — for example, ensuring that carbon is sequestered in timber buildings for a sufficient time period and preventing its early release — will help to guide our material use in buildings.  Analysing future liabilities: More accurately modelling the depreciation of built assets to assess their future value (including the associated liabilities) could support a new economy for both durable and regenerative materials, incentivising the reuse of materials at their highest&nbsp;utility.  Carbon accounting: The use of <a href="https://www.government.se/government-policy/swedens-carbon-tax/swedens-carbon-tax/#:~:text=Swedish%20carbon%20tax%20rates&amp;text=The%20carbon%20tax%20was%20introduced,of%20SEK%2010.15%20per%20EUR).">carbon taxes</a> and possible future implementation of national Carbon Treasuries — public institutions responsible for the national allocation and management of carbon emissions and sequestrations — would require robust, shared datasets for each key industrial sector. With the built environment being a significant contributor to carbon emissions, a sector wide national database of emissions attributed to buildings and their constituent materials, would help efforts to introduce more accurate carbon accounting   What’s next <p>As noted in Part 1, systemic shifts require many levers to interact. Data plays a central role in enabling other levers — including regulation, investment, supply chain and construction practices etc. — to shift. MatR shows what one piece of the puzzle could look like. Together with CST, we’re aiming to continue and expand our user testing over the coming months, as we identify a set of requirements for the next iteration of the tool; with the intention to develop and test it alongside a live construction project for the next stage of development.</p><p>Whilst we’ve initially focussed on a new build scenario — where starting from scratch means data can be linked to the BIM file as the design evolves, making the process more straightforward — we consider a renovation or retrofit use case as equally appropriate. We’ll therefore focus future development of the prototype for use in both new build and retrofit scenarios.</p><p>We’ll also be investing more time in developing the open-source approach and underlying business model, whilst looking for partner cities who would be interested in co-developing the&nbsp;concept.</p><p>If you’re interested in hearing more, collaborating or sharing feedback; or you’re from a city interested in partnering, please get in touch&nbsp;at:</p><p><a href="mailto:matr@darkmatterlabs.org">matr@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p> Other posts in this&nbsp;series <p>This is part of a series covering work we’ve been doing to support efforts to decarbonise construction and transition to more circular construction practices.

 Part 1: Exploring innovations to support zero carbon, bio-based and circular construction. La Borda, Barcelona (Alvaro Valdecantos)<p>This is the first in a series of posts introducing the work <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> (DML) has been doing over the past two years as part of the <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> funded <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC: EU CINCO project</a>, to support efforts to decarbonise construction through the use of low embodied carbon, bio-based materials and the transition to more circular construction practices.</p><p>The series gives an overview of the initiative; the challenges and opportunities identified; interventions we’ve developed in collaboration with project partners; and learnings we’ve taken from them. Within each post we’ll provide links to key ‘artefacts’ as examples of these, with an explanation of their current status, potential value to key stakeholders and possible next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>This piece introduces our focus areas, within the context of the wider project; outlines our whole-systems approach; covers the portfolio of activities we undertook and summarises our learnings. Subsequent posts will dig deeper into each activity&nbsp;area.</p> Introduction <p>Since early 2021, Dark Matter Labs has been part of a group of partners supported by the <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/">Laudes Foundation</a> to investigate and test ways to accelerate efforts to minimise <a href="https://www.leti.uk/_files/ugd/252d09_aa3cb94a124e40fba747d6520afc4bce.pdf">embodied carbon</a> in buildings, support material circularity and increase the use of low carbon, bio-based materials. We’ve been working on a number of initiatives with the cities of Madrid and Milan, as part of the <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220718_J1261-CKIC-NetZero-Playbook-3.pdf">HCC: EU CINCO project</a> (Healthy, Clean Cities: EUropean CIties for climate-Neutral COnstruction).</p>Iron ore mine, Erzberg, Austria (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@silverdaddy?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Chris</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/6LNv5BmYuvI?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a>); Forest, Serbia (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@filipz?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Filip Zrnzević</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/wallpapers/nature/forest?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a>); Building demolition (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@jasonmphoto?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Jason Mitrione</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/xjAmhIhdgGk?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a>) Why embodied&nbsp;carbon? <p>Today, buildings are responsible for <a href="https://architecture2030.org/why-the-building-sector/">40% of global carbon emissions</a>, when considering both <a href="https://www.istructe.org/resources/guidance/carbon-embodied-operational/">operational and embodied carbon</a>. Whilst operational carbon — emissions associated with operating a building e.g. from heating and cooling — currently represents a larger proportion of total emissions, as energy efficiency in buildings increases and energy sources become less carbon intensive, tackling embodied carbon — emissions associated with materials and construction processes throughout the whole life cycle of a building — is now critical. We’ll simply fail to achieve our climate goals without making it a priority, something cities and other built environment actors are slowly starting to recognise at scale — with help from initiatives such as <a href="https://carbonneutralcities.org/embodied-carbon-policy-framework/">CNCA</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.c40.org/accelerators/clean-construction/">C40</a>.</p> Why bio-based materials? <p>Using <a href="https://www.rics.org/news-insights/wbef/are-biobased-materials-the-key-to-a-more-sustainable-construction-industry">bio-based</a> materials — organic resources produced by plants and animals, such as timber or sheep’s wool — is considered one of the most effective routes to not only decarbonising the built environment, but shifting to a more regenerative future. Apart from offering low-embodied carbon alternatives to conventional construction materials, bio-based materials are renewable and can be sustainably produced. They provide a number of additional co-benefits including faster, safer and cleaner construction; easier and more sustainable reuse or composting options at end of life; healthier internal environments; and a boost to rural economies — something of particular relevance at a time where we’re seeing a growing urban-rural political divide, especially with regard to the environment.</p> Why material circularity? <p>The built environment is responsible for <a href="https://circularity-gap.world/2021">nearly 40% of global material extraction</a>. Whilst construction and demolition waste (CDW) accounts for a <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/construction-and-demolition-waste_en">third of total waste generated in the EU</a>. This linear material extraction, use and disposal paradigm represents a material economy and a way of interacting with the natural world that is no longer viable at a planetary scale. The need to transition to a more circular model is increasingly urgent.</p><p>As former president of the American Institute of Architects, <a href="https://carlelefante.com/insights/the-greenest-building-is/">Carl Elefante</a>, famously <a href="http://www.sohosandiego.org/images/forum_greenest_bldg.pdf">said</a>, the greenest, most sustainable building is the one that already exists. While the scope of HCC EU CINCO mostly focuses on supporting decarbonisation in new construction, we recognise this needs to happen within a ‘building circularity hierarchy’.</p>Circular economy for the built environment (LETI,&nbsp;2022)<p>This framework prioritises increasing the utilisation and prolonging the life of existing buildings through maintenance; above refurbishing, repurposing, and deconstructing them for reuse; and finally remanufacturing, reprocessing and recycling components. While this blog series will not go into detail on these aspects, we acknowledge their critical importance.</p> Project partners <p>The project has involved a consortium comprising <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a>, <a href="https://www.demsoc.org/">Democratic Society</a>, <a href="https://materialeconomics.com/">Material Economics</a>, <a href="https://www.bwb.earth/">Bankers without Boundaries</a>, and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/About">Dark Matter Labs</a>, working in close collaboration with local partners in the two focus cities. In Madrid, these include <a href="http://itd.upm.es/en/">UPM</a>, <a href="https://www.arup.com">Arup</a>, <a href="https://www.madrid.es/portal/site/munimadrid">Madrid City Council</a> and <a href="https://creamadridnuevonorte.com/">CreaMNN</a>. In Milan, the partnership has involved <a href="https://www.polimi.it/en">POLIMI</a>, <a href="https://www.amat-mi.it/">AMAT</a> and <a href="https://redosgr.it/en/">Redo</a>. Our work related to digital tool development and spatial data prototyping has been supported by our close partners, <a href="https://spatialtech.info/">The Center for Spatial Technologies</a>.</p> Testbed sites Architectural renders of Milan L’Innesto (Left) and Madrid Nuevo Norte&nbsp;(Right)<p>Two sites were selected to test in practice the innovations proposed as part of the project (more on these innovations below). The two testbeds — sites for conducting rigorous, transparent and replicable testing — are two of Europe’s largest urban regeneration projects: <a href="https://creamadridnuevonorte.com/">Madrid Nuevo Norte</a> (MNN) and <a href="https://innestomilano.it/">Milan’s L’Innesto</a>. MNN is a large-scale development with high sustainability aspirations which seeks to integrate Chamartín Rail Station with the rest of the city. Whilst L’Innesto aims to be Italy’s first carbon-neutral social housing development, located at Scalo Greco Breda, a former freight terminal&nbsp;site.</p><p>By working closely with the project teams of these test sites, alongside local partners from academia, municipal government, private sector and civic organisations, the consortium has had access to a wealth of knowledge and perspectives. This has made it possible to ground the project in real world contexts, deeply understand structural and specific challenges and opportunities from the viewpoint of the diverse stakeholders, and work together to overcome barriers collaboratively.</p> Approach <p>As part of our work, we’ve adopted a whole-systems approach to understand the blocks and bottlenecks that limit the uptake of low embodied carbon materials and circular construction practices, as well as to identify opportunities to accelerate their uptake. This means we have tried to look at the whole picture to understand how regulation, procurement and contracting, material and construction data, digital capacities, finance, culture, habits and ways of working all come together to influence the decision-making of stakeholders along the process — from forestry agents, bio-based material manufacturers, designers, construction teams and academic researchers to policy makers, municipal officials, legislators, insurers, developers and building&nbsp;users.</p><p>We’ve worked collaboratively to strengthen our collective understanding of barriers and opportunities while fostering network building, connection and communication across actors. We believe that the <a href="https://cascadeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/What-is-a-global-polycrisis-v2.pdf">entangled</a> complexity, scale and urgency of the challenges we face, necessitates the whole ecosystem working together to drive the transition to a <a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Regenerative_design">regenerative</a>, low carbon and circular built environment.</p><p>Over the past two years we’ve worked closely with local partners using four strategies:</p>  Building contextual and technical knowledge through interviews and secondary research which we then share via reports and/or sensemaking sessions  Fostering connections through participatory processes such as collaborative workshops and communication events  Designing solutions to current key challenges in close collaboration with “problem owners”, those with the means and mandate to tackle the issue and those who most feel its&nbsp;impact  Sharing provocations to invite partners to think beyond what is possible today to what is necessary in the long&nbsp;term   Focus areas <p>These strategies have been implemented through a series of interconnected interventions as part of a portfolio, which was co-defined with partners and spans multiple&nbsp;levers:</p>  Finance;  Policy and regulation;  Contracting and procurement;  Digital tools and&nbsp;data;  Capacity and capability building;  Networks and shared narrative  HCC: EU CINCO focused on six strategic levers (DML focused on the blue&nbsp;layers)<p>Over the course of the first phase of the initiative, Dark Matter Labs has focused on three of these interlinking levers of change — Policy and regulation; Contracting and procurement; and Digital tools and data. We’ve also developed transversal activities focusing on Capacity and capability building and conducted a study analysing the economic and environmental impact of using sustainable timber in the Madrid testbed. Each of these will be covered in more detail in a subsequent post.</p> Overview of activities <p>The project has involved us conducting over 30 interviews with actors along the timber value chain and compiling their diverse perspectives on challenges and opportunities in a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aO55YkNSMN9Fn_BYi16CcvsNB3untKkT/view?usp=share_link">shared document</a>. While it helped uncover indispensable and detailed contextual knowledge, it also fostered a shared understanding to help disparate stakeholders work together and see their interconnections and potential synergies more easily. We also conducted in depth research and compiled briefing documents on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xm1k389BQjz3N8KZoLC-uqgvJ-BFXi9f/view?usp=share_link">Digital tools and data</a>; and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xl-vN0ClJYlBKv20mm2jxlahhQv5jra1/view?usp=share_link">Policy, regulation and contractual innovation</a> in relation to low embodied carbon and circular construction in Madrid and&nbsp;Milan.</p>Project outputs: Timber value chain learnings; Digital tools &amp; data brief; Policy &amp; regulation brief<p>Additionally we hosted collaborative work sessions with select experts — from the fields of energy, architecture, urbanism and ecology — as part of an innovative process for proposing regulatory changes to integrate carbon and climate conscious perspectives in the review of urban planning legislation in Madrid and to suggest a new approach for learning-focused regulatory sandboxes.</p>Project outputs: WLC reporting template; Municipal price list provocation<p>As to concrete solutions to the barriers currently faced by our local partners, it has led us to design <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hKyyw2uIIaK-VA6ApnUfNzEFNhg8OdsU/view?usp=share_link">clauses to require whole life carbon assessment</a> in the tender processes of Madrid Nuevo Norte; to develop easy to use templates to compile embodied carbon data; and to propose new, low carbon and bio-based materials to be included in Madrid’s municipal list of prices (<a href="https://www.madrid.es/portales/munimadrid/es/Inicio/Vivienda-urbanismo-y-obras/Publicaciones/Cuadro-de-Precios-de-los-Proyectos-de-Urbanizacion-y-de-Edificacion/?vgnextfmt=default&amp;vgnextoid=4527b1a987c0b110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=cf6031d3b28fe410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD">Cuadro de Precios</a>) — a public list of prices for materials, products and construction processes for use in preparing a <a href="https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Bill_of_quantities_BOQ">bill of quantities</a> for public construction projects.</p><p>Recognising the need to work at two speeds — tackling current problems and implementing actions that are feasible today, while considering the long term and working to expand the boundaries of our own and our partner’s imaginations as to what is possible — we have also developed a number of “provocations”. These are thought pieces co-exploring what we think may be needed; meant to inspire, invite discussion and foster new courses of action. As part of this line of work, we reimagined <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xwjuJnZBzf1yTCBvPHTNbYy0WHIRxKPq/view?usp=sharing">what a climate conscious 21st century municipal price list could be</a>, and developed a <a href="https://medium.com/hub-engine/datas-role-for-a-post-carbon-built-environment-7a31b4ebc934">proof of concept for a material registry</a> — MatR: An open source, web-based digital tool that aggregates data on what buildings are made of and how well they perform, which could enable more holistic decisions to minimise life cycle environmental impacts and maximise material circularity in the built environment.</p>Project outputs: Economic analysis of increased forestry in Castilla-La Mancha; MatR — A digital registry for a building’s material and performance data.<p>As part of the project, we also conducted a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cl6bJgQg0bzvkWA-cAaL2W9Nf44RKJt4/view?usp=share_link">regional economic and environmental impact analysis</a> to illustrate the potential impact of increased demand for engineered timber products on the local forestry industry and its related activities within the region of Castilla-La Mancha,&nbsp;Spain.</p><p>These will be discussed in more detail in subsequent posts.</p> Strategic learning <p>Through working across multiple levers of change, we identified three necessary shifts to make the transition to low carbon, bio-based, circular construction possible:</p>  Re-defining cost and value: From a short term and narrow conception focused on direct cost and profit; to a long term and broad conception that considers wider economic, environmental and social impacts and how they are inherently linked.  Re-thinking collaboration: From centralised and siloed approaches where design, manufacture, construction and maintenance are considered independently, and there’s limited stakeholder collaboration; to distributed and multi-actor ways of working where shared responsibility frameworks support innovation and institutional infrastructure facilitates learning and cooperation.  Re-scoping focus: From sector specific approaches in which single point interventions can lead to uncoordinated and sometimes conflicting results; to systemic​ approaches in which multiple levers (finance, regulation, etc.), diverse domains (energy, biodiversity, health, etc.), and their interactions are considered together to minimise negative externalities and maximise co-benefits.  A multi-lever approach for a low carbon, circular and just built environment<p>Collectively, the range of experiments we initiated with our partners aim to help make these necessary shifts possible. Alongside these, a number of key lessons have also&nbsp;emerged:</p> 1 — We have found that barriers are often related to capacity, capabilities and political and normative choices, rather than to technological limitations. <p>Barriers often arise from individuals or organisations having limited time or resources to do things differently, lacking the means to innovate or having limited access to knowledge. Often barriers arise in decision making processes where economic, political and climate values are perceived as contradictory or conflicting. Therefore, focusing on strengthening the capacities and capabilities of key stakeholders to enable collaborative learning; embracing agile action; and long term thinking, becomes critical. This led us to directing more efforts than initially planned to support essential capability building amongst key actors, including municipal officials, and relevant construction sector and industry&nbsp;players.</p> 2 — We’ve witnessed the need for new approaches to planning, financing and agile collaboration. <p>Different stakeholders are subject to very different paces and timeframes. Political cycles, fiscal years and university research timelines don’t usually coincide, complicating multi-actor collaboration and project financing.</p><p>At the same time, because of the ongoing interaction between all the different parts of the system and the continuous evolution of internal and external pressures, traditional linear planning is unable to respond with the necessary flexibility and learning focus to complex challenges such as that of decarbonising construction. This has prompted us to search for and test new ways to plan, fund and collaborate.</p> 3 — We’ve experienced how difficult deep collaboration is. Strategic cross collaboration has to be designed explicitly from the&nbsp;start. <p>For many of us, working collaboratively with very different partners isn’t the usual mode of operation. It may require more time to reach mutual understanding and build trust. When faced with tight deadlines and workload pressure, we may be tempted to retreat to working individually and in silos instead of collaborating across domains. However, together we’re able to achieve better quality, more impactful results. To make this possible, we found collaboration had to be established as a shared objective early on. Time for collective sense-making whilst working individually is not enough; working together through shared challenges accelerates mutual understanding and facilitates deeper collaboration. Deadlines, budget and expectations need to be adjusted accordingly. In response to these insights, we are working to integrate this approach more fully in the next stage of our&nbsp;work.</p><p>In order to respond to continuously evolving contexts, it is also critical to continue to build our capability to be agile and recognise when it’s time to shift focus and adapt resource allocation quickly. This also entails building our decision making capacity so that we’re able to commit the time and resources necessary for exploring areas of potential deeply, without being distracted by emerging opportunities with less potential.</p><p>Additionally, local partner collaboration is invaluable. However, navigating complexity and uncertainty in a second language is difficult. Local partners don’t always feel comfortable or are not able to engage deeply in English. Therefore, deep collaboration with local partners requires speaking the local language.</p> 4 —Within the wider context, we recognise how far cities still have to go to engage deeply with this planet-critical challenge. <p>As the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/">latest IPCC report</a> starkly warns, “there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all” and an urgent need for “deep, rapid and sustained mitigation and accelerated implementation of adaptation actions in this decade [to] reduce projected losses and damages for humans and ecosystems.” There remain significant gaps between the projected emissions from implemented policies and those from <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs#NDC-registry--">nationally determined contributions</a> (NDCs) — on our current trajectory, it’s likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C in the 21st century and will be hard to limit below&nbsp;2°C.</p><p>This gives a clear indication of the scale and urgency of transition required across Europe and beyond, to deliver on our collective climate ambitions. Cities must play their part by accelerating the impact of mitigation and adaptation measures, whilst sharing lessons across sectors and borders. In the built environment in particular, there remains a large disconnect between what is needed in response to the climate crisis and what is currently being built or planned in terms of new development. Collaborative city networks, for example <a href="https://www.c40.org/">C40</a> and <a href="https://carbonneutralcities.org/">CNCA</a>, provide the scaffold for mobilising transformative climate action, disseminating best practice and accelerating change in municipal policy and action. Yet, decision making still does not respond to the depth and urgency of required&nbsp;action.</p><p>We also acknowledge this is particularly hard in the built environment and construction sector, where in some contexts a significant portion of GDP is linked to carbon and material intensive practices. As a sector, it’s typically slow to change and comes with significant risks in terms of job losses and industry phase-out. Here, carefully designed policies along with targeted public investment will be necessary to ensure a just and inclusive transition.</p><p>In conclusion, this work has shown us some of the challenges of attempting to work systemically while operating within structures and systems that have been set up with predefined objectives, and sector specific or siloed approaches which are no longer fit for&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>We recognise that, within the project scope, we’re still working out how to overcome these barriers and will continue to test new ways of working collaboratively, through exploration, while navigating an ever evolving context in which new needs and opportunities will continue to emerge. Sharing our learning and reflections thus becomes mission critical. We hope you will join us on this&nbsp;journey.</p> Other posts in this&nbsp;series <p>This is part of a series covering work we’ve been doing to support efforts to decarbonise construction and transition to more circular construction practices.

<p>The European Union (EU) has recently taken a significant step towards combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities involving crypto-assets. MEPs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the Committee on Civil Liberties (LIBE) adopted new legislation as part of the EU’s anti-money laundering package. (source: <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220324IPR26164/crypto-assets-new-rules-to-stop-illicit-flows-in-the-eu">European Parliament</a>)</p>



 New Requirements for Crypto-Asset Transfers: 



<p>The newly approved legislation mandates that all transfers of crypto-assets must include information on the source and beneficiary of the asset. This information must be made available to the competent authorities. The rules will also apply to transactions from unhosted wallets and will require technological solutions to ensure individual traceability of these asset transfers.</p>



 Removing Minimum Thresholds: 



<p>MEPs decided to remove minimum thresholds and exemptions for low-value transfers, recognizing that the speed and virtual nature of crypto-asset transactions easily circumvent existing rules based on transaction thresholds.</p>



 Public Register of High-Risk Entities: 



<p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) has been assigned the responsibility of establishing a public register comprising businesses and services engaged in crypto-assets that may pose a high risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other criminal activities. Before distributing crypto-assets to beneficiaries, providers are required to confirm that the asset’s source is not subject to any restrictive measures and that there are no associated risks of money laundering or terrorism financing.</p>



 Closing the Loophole: 



<p>Ernest Urtasun, co-rapporteur for ECON, emphasizes that the EU’s objective is to close the loophole that enables illicit flows in crypto-assets to circulate undetected across Europe and the world. Assita Kanko, co-rapporteur for LIBE, further explains that the new legislation intends to both protect and normalize the usage of crypto-assets, while fostering trust.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>The text that has been adopted serves as a draft mandate for MEPs to negotiate the legislation’s final form with EU governments. The European Parliament is scheduled to cast their vote during the plenary session in April.</p>



<p>The EU’s new anti-money laundering package represents a significant step in the ongoing battle against criminal activities related to crypto-assets. By enforcing stricter regulations, the EU aims to improve transparency, security, and trust within the cryptocurrency domain.</p>

<p>The European Union (EU) has recently adopted new measures to strengthen its anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, and evasion of sanctions policies. MEPs approved stricter rules to close existing gaps in combating these illicit activities within the EU. Coinfirm, a leading<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>analytics platform, is dedicated to helping businesses navigate these regulatory changes effectively.</p>



 Key EU Measures: 



<p>Establishment of the European Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA): The new AMLA will have supervisory and investigative powers to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) requirements across EU member states.</p>



<p>Enhanced Customer Identity Verification: Banks, asset managers, and other entities will be required to verify their customers’ identity, ownership, and control of companies. This includes conducting due diligence, assessing sector-specific money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and transmitting relevant information to a central register.</p>



<p>Caps on Cash Payments and Crypto-Asset Transfers: The EU has set limits on cash payments (€7,000) and crypto-asset transfers (€1,000) that can be accepted by persons providing goods or services when the customer cannot be identified. These caps aim to restrict transactions in cash and crypto-assets, mitigating the risk of misuse by criminals.</p>



<p>Banning of “Golden Passport” Schemes and Strict Controls on “Golden Visas”: The EU aims to ban citizenship-by-investment schemes (“golden passports”) and impose strong anti-money laundering controls on residence-by-investment schemes (“golden visas”) due to their high risk of misuse.</p>



<p>Creation of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) in Each Member State: Each member state will establish an FIU to prevent, report, and combat money laundering and terrorist financing. FIUs will share information with each other and with competent authorities, as well as cooperate with AMLA,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/europol/"> Europol,</a> Eurojust, and the European Public Prosecutor’s office.</p>



<p>Increased Transparency with Access to Beneficial Ownership Registers: National FIUs and other competent authorities will have access to information on beneficial ownership, bank accounts, land or real estate registers, and high-value goods such as yachts, planes, and cars.</p>

			  Liam Karwan is a Sales Manager at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>I am Liam Karwan. I was born and raised in Brussels, Belgium. I moved quite a lot in my life. I have lived in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Thailand, and Portugal (where I have now settled). I have always enjoyed the thrill of going to a new city, getting to know the local way of life, and meeting new people with different mindsets.&nbsp;</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>My passion for blockchain started in 2017 during the ICO boom. I did not know or understand much about the technology back then. After starting my career in finance and investment banking, I realized that blockchain would actually be the best technology to disrupt the financial industry. I then did some research, and Tokeny seemed like the most advanced solution to be able to accomplish this complex mission.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>The team is amazing, everyone is looking after each other and everyone has a strong sense of responsibility since day one. It is good to know that although we have a remote work policy, everyone is always reachable and ready to help when needed. As a growing startup, it is rewarding to feel that you are part of a team that is working all together towards the same goal.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Regarding my passions, nothing out of the ordinary. I do not collect stamps, or rare coins 😅. I genuinely enjoy being surrounded by close friends and family, going outdoors and seeing what the world has to offer. I am a big football fan too and always enjoy watching my favorite team playing.&nbsp;</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My grandmother told me that her best achievement in life was to be able to look back at her life and be proud and happy about the way she lived it. Reaching the same conclusions would probably be my ultimate dream.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Take ownership of your tasks and be creative. Joining a growing company comes with lots of challenges, but also with its fair amount of opportunities. Also, do not be afraid to reach out to people and ask for guidance, the team is always going to be ready to help you.&nbsp;</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>The financial sector seems to be increasingly willing to adapt to the new technologies and opportunities created by blockchains. The future looks bright for the Tokenization industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of an occasional series examining misconceptions that people have about personal data empowerment and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>In Mydex’s discussions with people about personal data, time and time again we here this basic&nbsp;refrain:</p><blockquote>“People have been talking about this sort of thing for a decade or two now, but it hasn’t happened, has it? So it never will. PDSs may be a nice idea in theory but they will never really change the way things&nbsp;work.“</blockquote><p>This blog addresses this pushback.</p> Mental models <p>Our one, core answer to this objection is simple. People who argue “it hasn’t happened yet so it never will” have got the wrong end of the stick about the nature of the beast. They’ve got the wrong mental model as to how this sort of change happens, expecting a fish to behave like a&nbsp;fowl.</p><p>A PDS is not just another digital app whose success depends on ‘going viral’. It’s not something where some venture capitalists fund an initially high ‘cash burn’ to achieve this viral growth, and then exit at a massive multiple (usually before the app has actually made any&nbsp;money).</p><p>It’s not that model at all. Personal data stores are infrastructure like water and electricity, like roads, railways and aviation: infrastructure that, when it is installed, rewires how the system as a whole works, changing both what people do and how they do&nbsp;it.</p><p>Infrastructure is never built in just a few short years. It takes decades: first to incubate it and second to install it. It takes many years to bring together all the technical, operational, organisational, commercial and perceptual breakthroughs, big and small, that are needed before a fundamental infrastructure development can take off. This includes ensuring safety, reliability, efficiency, ease of use, accessibility, scalability and economic viability, plus public understanding, reassurance and acceptance.</p><p>Then it takes many more years to actually install. An app can be installed (using pre-existing digital infrastructure) by millions of people in seconds. Making water, electricity and roads available to every household and workplace means painstaking installation work: house by house, street by street, town by town. Which takes&nbsp;decades.</p><p>PDSs are personal data infrastructure for a 21st century digital economy. Judging their success or failure as if they were some sort of digital app — by comparing cheese with chalk — is a potentially disastrous error.</p><p>Many other factors combine to compound this challenge.</p> Perceptions <p>Usually, when people say ‘it hasn’t happened yet so it never will’ they have what they think is a good reason why. In this mini-series we’ve addressed some of these misperceptions, for example the argument that <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/do-people-really-want-to-manage-their-data-bac784b98be1">people don’t want to manage their data</a>, or that <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/is-there-any-demand-for-personal-data-stores-80b9e57adb0a">there is no demand for personal data&nbsp;stores</a>.</p><p>It was ever thus. It’s almost inevitable that when something crops up to challenge an established way of doing things, the experts in those established systems — the ones most deeply immersed in making them work — quickly see all the reasons why the new approach ‘will never&nbsp;work’.</p><p>In the past, for example, consensus expert opinion dismissed the following as viable possibilities: gas lighting, powered flight (and subsequently commercial passenger aviation), transatlantic steamships, alternative current distribution of electricity, radio, rocket propulsion, nuclear energy, communication satellites, mass computing.</p><p>Think for a second how difficult it is to do each one of these things and you can see why the experts said what they said. Nevertheless, in each case, the experts ended up being proved wrong — mainly and precisely because they were experts in the old ways of doing&nbsp;things.</p> Vested interests <p>Other more practical reasons slow progress too, vested interests being an obvious case in point. If your power and riches depend on the old way of doing things, the last thing you are going to do is encourage a new way that threatens your power and riches. With personal data, many of the richest and most powerful organisations in the world have an existential fear and dread of individuals really being able to control their own&nbsp;data.</p> Inertia <p>Another banal but extremely powerful barrier is simple corporate inertia. Large organisations in both the public and private sectors have a deep aversion to any risk and to any effort that’s not directly related to their current priorities. Amongst these organisations, innovation is a bit like teenage sex. The less it’s done the more it’s talked about, especially by those who aren’t doing it. They don’t want to lose face amongst their&nbsp;peers.</p><p>An innovation means doing something that hasn’t been done before. For big corporates, that doesn’t spell opportunity; it sets alarm bells going. It means risk —the risk of something that may not work. And risk is the last thing they&nbsp;want.</p><p>Such risk aversion is actually quite reassuring. Large organisations survive as large organisations because they do things they know work. Huge amount of damage can be done by a large organisation doing something that doesn’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>The bad side however, is that when a new way of doing things comes along, the corporate instinct is to wait, and wait, and wait — until it’s been demonstrated completely and utterly without doubt that it works: that it won’t result in a negative Daily Mail headline.</p><p>This, in turn, creates a chicken-and-egg effect: organisations avoid adopting the innovation because they want to avoid the risk; but the ability to prove these risks either don’t exist or can be managed is hampered because few organisations want to touch it. Every one of the innovations in the list above struggled to get off the ground a) because they presented some very real risks and b) because of resistance from incumbents.</p><p>Effort aversion comes with risk aversion. Organisations invest a huge amount of time, money and energy creating systems that they know work. Given that time, money and energy are always limited, they much prefer to invest what they have in making these existing systems work better than explore alternatives.</p><p>Internal social dynamics reinforce this risk aversion. By definition, within a large organisation the person most likely to be most risk averse is the one with most responsibility for success — the boss. It takes courage for a team member to tell the boss they should be doing something different.</p> Conclusion <p>In his magisterial review of The Progress of Invention in the Nineteenth Century, published in 1900, E W Byrn noted that the motor car had been around in various forms for nearly thirty years and despite endless talk about its potential its overall impact on transport had been marginal. “It is not probable that man will ever be able to get along without the horse,” he concluded.</p><p>Economics history is full of people making such statements.</p><p>The common factor uniting those who say ‘it will never happen because it hasn’t happened yet’ is that they haven’t read their history. At Mydex, because we’re at the front line of it all, we are well aware of the difficulties of making a transformational change such as this happen. But we can also see a way through, and we are also aware of the increasingly rapid progress we are&nbsp;making.</p><p>Personal data stores will happen a) because they’re desperately needed and b) they are eminently doable. The rest is detail. Yes, there is an awful lot of detail, and working through this detail takes time. But that has always been true of innovation at the infrastructure level, and it always will&nbsp;be.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/personal-data-stores-havent-happened-yet-so-they-never-will-c383a7b4acfe">“Personal Data Stores haven’t happened yet.

<p>Recent advances in AI have opened up new challenges and opportunities for social media. As content-generation costs drop, algorithms to help people sort through information must evolve rapidly.</p>
<p>At Bluesky, we’re approaching this challenge from a marketplace perspective. Our goal isn't to create every algorithm in-house, but to enable the developer community to bring new algorithms to users swiftly and effortlessly. In this blog post, we’ll provide an overview of our motivation behind creating a system that enables composable, customizable feed generation, and embraces third-party development.</p>
 Owning your attention 
<p>Your attention is an invaluable resource. A social platform's algorithm is responsible for curating the content in your feed. The algorithm, more than the content type or the app's appearance, is the core of social media because it directs how you spend your attention there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s usually very little transparency into how things are selected or why content is being shown to you. While you have the choice to open or close a social app, you often lack control over the content you see while using it. You might have some control over their feed through choosing who to follow or selecting a chronological feed option, but your ability to truly customize your experience is limited.</p>
<p>Due to the backlash against the perceived algorithmic manipulation of people’s timelines, some people say they really just want a chronological feed of who they follow. A feed of content from the people you follow ordered only by time is also an algorithm (albeit a very simple one). This should be an option if you want, but we think there are also many more ways this could work. The problem isn’t “algorithms” — the problem is a lack of transparency and control around how algorithms are used to direct your attention.</p>
 A Marketplace of Algorithms 
<p>We want a future where you control what you see on social media. We aim to replace the conventional "master algorithm," controlled by a single company, with an open and diverse "marketplace of algorithms."</p>
<p>With the AT Protocol v1 launch around the corner, we can confidently share our vision for this marketplace. Algorithms in ATP will act as aggregator services, similar to search engines. Users will be able to find, share, and add algorithms to their clients. Our UX design allows users to swipe between favorite algorithms or view a multi-algorithm feed.</p>
<p>Here’s how we’ve started building towards a world where users have control over what they see:</p>
 
 Developing APIs for feed generation: These APIs will be architecturally separate from the rest of the system, allowing for custom feed and moderation systems to be created as independent services. 
 Designing interfaces for third-party algorithm selection: We’re developing a feed selection system that enables users to explore third-party feeds and access them as effortlessly as their home timeline. 
 
<p>For developers, an open marketplace of algorithms will provide the freedom to experiment with and publish algorithms that anyone can use. Recent advances in machine learning will make it easy and exciting to experiment with new ways of structuring content.</p>
<p>For users, the ability to customize their feed will give them back control of their most valuable resource: their attention. Life is made up of all the little moments you spend your time on. We hope that the future of social apps is a framework that allows you to express your agency over how you spend your time.</p>
<p>While feed algorithms and search are the primary focus here, we’re using a similar approach to address reputation, misinformation labeling, and moderation.</p>
<p>Our goal is to assemble a social media architecture that composes third-party services into a seamless user experience, because an open ecosystem is likely to evolve more quickly than a single approach to curation or moderation developed within one company. By creating the interfaces for innovation in these areas, we hope to provide a dynamic and user-driven social experience.</p>

<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM) is a major cybersecurity component of any company that maintains customer accounts. Online fraud and authentication attack attempts have grown significantly in the past several years, with attackers increasingly turning their attention to customers rather than companies. This can be seen, for example, in the finance industry, where attacks against customers now <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/news/email-security/attackers-target-vulnerable-financial-customers-rather-than-the-institutions-themselves">outnumber those on institutions or their employees by 4:1</a>.</p> 
<p>Protecting the safety of customers and their data is just one of the many reasons firms need to focus on CIAM as a security priority. Other reasons include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Keeping Customer Trust: A customer’s compromised account will damage their opinion of the firm involved, even though they may not be at fault.  
  Reducing Friction and Frustration: <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/367713/consumers-abandon-brands-after-frustration-over-id.html">61% of consumers</a> said forgetting passwords, failed login attempts and frustrating reset experiences cause them to abandon a transaction.  
  Minimizing Payouts: Many retailers refund fraudulent purchases as a matter of courtesy. With the growing number of attacks, this can be a significant expense.  
  Beating the Competition: Businesses often compete on customer service. If the CIAM experience is poor, consumers may try the competition.  
  Regulatory Compliance: With an ever-increasing number of consumers covered by data protection legislation and other regulations, stronger customer authentication methods may be needed to meet obligations.  
  
<p>However, CIAM often has distinct requirements and priorities from authentication used <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/which-form-of-authentication-is-the-strongest">by employees</a>. Different approaches are required for a context where security can be more complex, and customer conversion can be won or lost depending on the customer authentication method used. Below, we’ll look at different types of customer authentication methods and how they rate in terms of security and customer experience.</p> 
 Types of Customer Authentication Methods – Ranked  
 7. Passwords  
<p>A password is a string of secret characters that, in conjunction with a username or email address, is used to verify identity. It is considered a knowledge authentication factor in that the user must know the password in order to gain access.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>Accounts that only have a password for protection are extremely vulnerable to attack. There are numerous methods attackers can use, such as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/brute-force-attacks-what-to-know">brute-forcing</a>, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/dictionary-attack">dictionary attacks</a>, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/phishing">phishing</a> and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle (MitM)</a>, to gain a user’s password. Attempts to improve password security by enforcing lengths or varying character types have also led to users committing severe security sins, such as keeping lists of passwords. Phishing techniques are very advanced and are often automated, which means attackers can steal the passwords of thousands of individuals at once.</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>Passwords have been used in computer authentication for more than 60 years. Though never very secure, passwords were popular as they gave the user control and were relatively easy to use. Now, however, not only have passwords become more complicated to remember but recovering a password is a regular and frustrating experience. This friction on the customer’’s end can cause them to become frustrated and choose another service provider or leave a purchase behind.</p> 
 6. Magic Links  
<p>Magic links allow customers to log into accounts using a one-time use link sent during the authentication process. After entering their username, a URL link is sent either to the customer's email address or their mobile phone via text.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>A magic link confirms a customer is who they say they are by verifying they have access to the email address or phone number linked to the account. Magic links are somewhat more secure than a password as they can’t be guessed or brute forced, but they can be easily intercepted or stolen. If a hacker gains access to a customer’s email account or text messages then they can take over any account verifying by magic links.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>The concept is easy to use in theory as the customer only has to enter their email address or phone number and then click on the link that is sent — no passwords to remember. However, it assumes that the customer has quick and easy access to their email or smartphone, which won’t always be the case. From a conversion standpoint, it’s never a good idea to tell a customer on the verge of conversion that they should take their eyes off your site (and their shopping cart).</p> 
 5. One-time Passwords (OTPs) 2FA  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/2fa-vs-mfa-an-explanation">Two-factor authentication (2FA)</a> requires a password plus another authentication factor, usually a one-time password (OTP). <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTPs are unique passcodes</a> that can only be used for a single login instance. The next time a user wants to access an application or website, they will need a different OTP.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>After a customer enters their login details, the OTP is sent by email or to their phone by SMS. The customer then enters the code to complete the login process. OTPs are more secure than a password only, however, commonly available phishing kits have become adept at extracting these codes from users. In addition, the rise of <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/sim-swapping">SIM-swapping attacks</a>, where attackers transfer a user’s number to a SIM they control, also renders OTPs highly vulnerable.</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>OTPs, especially those sent by SMS, are widely used to confirm a user’s “possession” factor of authentication, i.e., that they are in possession of a linked device (although many regulatory schemes do not allow SMS OTPs as proof of possession). They are fairly straightforward to use, however, they still require an additional action, on top of entering a password. Moreover, if delayed, they can cause frustration, leading users to request the OTP again and enter the wrong one. Essentially the system is asking the user to enter two passwords — one they’ve thought of themselves and one they’ve received — neither of which is a pleasant experience.</p> 
 4. Social Login  
<p>It has recently become widespread for users to access or create accounts with third parties based on their social media or Google account. This system is built on the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html">OAuth protocols</a> for allowing authorization between unrelated services, creating, in effect, a single sign-on (SSO) for mass usage.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>For individual companies, this authentication method can be useful as it theoretically absolves them of any authentication responsibility. However, on a broader scale, it may be less secure for the user as the related account may only require a username and password, which can be easily phished, allowing the attacker to use that account to access many more.</p> 
<p>User Experience: </p> 
<p>So long as you are logged into the social media or Google account, then everything is quite simple. You click which account you want to use at the login stage, and everything transfers through. The user experience problems arise when you’re not logged in, for example, when on a different device. With your account being entirely predicated upon your social media or email account, you don’t have any way to access it without logging into them as well.</p> 
 3. Push Notification MFA  
<p>A CIAM system looking to verify a possession factor may request a user to “push” a notification on an app to verify they’re in control of their device. After a customer enters their password, they receive a notification via smartphone app. The user must approve the push request in order to access their account.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>Though push authentication might seem relatively fool-proof, hackers launch <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a>, whereby they spam the user constantly until they give up and accept the prompt. Also known as MFA prompt bombing, such attacks <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-report">have skyrocketed in the past year</a>, fueled by easily available automated attack tools.</p> 
<p>Customer Experience: </p> 
<p>Push notifications are relatively seamless, depending on how they are deployed. The major user experience issue with them comes from the “push fatigue” mentioned above. Users can get quite irritated with constant rechecks of their credentials and being asked to push to verify.&nbsp;</p> 
 2. Passkeys (Multi-Device)  
<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> are more secure and easier to use than passwords. Passkeys are a standard-based technology that, unlike passwords, are resistant to phishing, strong, and are designed so that there are no shared secrets. Passkeys cannot be written down or typed in which makes it harder for hackers to trick users into providing their authentication credentials.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>General consumer passkeys can be copied to other devices and shared. This makes them extremely easy for end user adoption but can increase the security concerns for IT and Security Team. They also do not satisfy the possession requirement under some regulations and are <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/#faq">not currently recognized as an official form of multi-factor authentication under these regimes</a>. However, signing in with passkeys is still far more secure than the above customer authentication methods.</p> 
<p>User Experience: </p> 
<p>Passkeys replace passwords, removing one of the biggest customer authentication frustrations and the biggest security risks. The user experience is familiar for customers as they sign-in to an app or website using the same biometric or PIN verification that they use to unlock their device. From the IT side of things, it’s a bit more complicated as any organization that wants to support <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passkeys-for-customer-iam-deployments">passkeys needs a FIDO2 server</a>.</p> 
 1. True Passwordless, Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/true-passwordless-mfa">True Passwordless MFA </a>is built on public key cryptography and uses device-native verification technology. Similar to how passkeys work (both are based on FIDO standards), the user’s private key for authentication is not transferred during login but is only used to digitally sign for authentication locally. Unlike passkeys, however, it is device-bound and cannot be passed amongst devices. It is inherently multi-factor as it simultaneously meets both the possession and the inherence (i.e., something you are) factors of authentication.</p> 
<p>Security: </p> 
<p>Fully passwordless <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-fido2-authentication">FIDO-based MFA</a>, is one of the most secure customer authentication methods available. It can be thought of as a virtual hardware security key. It provides strong phishing resistance as there is no password, OTP or push notification for the attacker to hack. It stores the private key in the secure device TPM and does not transmit, share or sync it. Depending on the specific solution, it meets <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/open-banking-psd2-and-achieving-strong-customer-authentication">PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication</a> requirements and other industry regulatory requirements.</p> 
<p>User Experience: </p> 
<p>True Passwordless MFA allows customers to securely sign in with a single authentication gesture. As a user always has their biometric features with them, it removes further friction with navigating to other accounts, carrying security keys or remembering a code. It also supports multiple verification options if the user is unable to, or chooses not to, use biometrics. This makes it the most seamless of the customer authentication methods.</p> 
 HYPR’s True Passwordless MFA  
<p>Your CIAM processes are critical both from a security and customer experience perspective. Insecure or friction-laden customer authentication methods can lead to breaches, customer churn, lost sales, and regulatory fines, among other consequences. HYPR True Passwordless™ MFA reduces your customers’ frustration while improving security.

<p>Interested in entering the lucrative gaming industry? Here’s everything you need to know about online gambling licenses, their relevance and importance, who needs them, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gaming industry is booming and shows no signs of slowing anytime soon. In fact, while numerous sectors, including financial services, are struggling, the global gaming industry is looking for new approaches to meet consumers’ needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gaming market was worth $63.53 billion in 2022 and is projected <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market#:~:text=The%20global%20online%20gambling%20market,11.7%25%20from%202023%20to%202030.">to grow</a> by 11.7% between 2023 and 2030. The most popular gambling markets in Europe, the United Kingdom is the largest online gambling market, with its GGR <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/29048/largest-regulated-online-gambling-markets/#:~:text=As%20data%20from%20H2%20Gambling,United%20States%20(%2411.0%20billion).">worth $12.5 billion</a> in 2021. Others include France with 3.8 billion and Germany with $3.6 billion that same year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, where there are opportunities there are always criminals looking for ways to exploit the system for their own benefit. Players who use underground gambling platforms and rogue casinos, which often do not have the most rigorous of KYC checks, run the risk of having their personal data and funds stolen. Players should avoid these rogue casinos at all costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To offer gambling services legally, every operator must hold a license and comply with specific regulations and standards set by one or more regulatory authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an online gaming business to be licensed means they are committed to a fair gambling policy and care about their reputation, among other factors. Holding an online gambling license is crucial for the operator and the consumer.&nbsp;</p>



 What is an online gaming license?&nbsp; 



<p>An online gaming license is a legal document issued by a regulatory authority that allows gambling operators to run online casinos and sportsbook platforms in certain regions or territories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For an operator to legally provide gambling and betting services, they must hold a license covering the regions in which they want to operate. Obtaining a license typically involves a lengthy process that includes extensive paperwork and various fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Licenses cost money (the costs may act as a significant barrier to access a market) and oblige the operator to adhere to set regulations. The operator also needs a license to open merchant accounts, obtain AML compliance, buy and offer legal gaming software, and work with payment providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The specifics of regulations usually vary from one jurisdiction to another. Some regions have stricter prerequisites regarding online gambling than others. For instance, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> is among the most <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/gaming/1147366/gambling-laws-in-europe#:~:text=the%20relevant%20licenses.-,United%20Kingdom,-United%20Kingdom%20is">stringent</a> regulatory bodies for gambling worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many countries want online gambling to enter the legal mainstream and have started cracking down on illegal gambling businesses. Those caught offering illegal gambling or betting services risk hefty fines and potential jail time. In 2022, there were record financial penalties ($269,532,490) and warnings – and even gambling-license suspension.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In essence, a licensing body’s main roles include (but are not limited to) the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Eliminating crime from gambling.&nbsp;  Guaranteeing that all licensed gambling is fair and transparent.&nbsp;  Safeguarding <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">minors</a> and vulnerable individuals from potential harm and exploitation of gambling.&nbsp;  



 Who needs a gaming license?&nbsp; 



<p>Any business that offers facilities for gambling, betting, or participating in lotteries requires licenses to operate legally. Obtaining an online gambling license should be considered a priority since it is non-negotiable if you want to enter the world of legal gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A license is needed when registering a company, opening merchant accounts, proving credibility, and establishing the reputation of a fair gambling business in the eyes of B2B providers and players. It also allows licensees to operate in regulated markets and protects them from legal problems, fines, and imprisonment. Licensees can also enter new markets and work with renowned software developers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online gaming licenses and remote gambling licenses are sometimes used interchangeably and refer to all gambling activities involving players participating via different forms of remote communication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the different types of online gaming licenses?&nbsp; 



<p>Types of online gambling licenses vary depending on the jurisdiction. Each licensing jurisdiction has its system. It can be uniform, including a single permit, comprising a variety of games. It can also be split across categories, depending on the kind of gambling or betting activity the licensee intends to offer. The cost of obtaining a permit typically comprises a one-time fixed fee, business registration and bank account fees, and regular renewal fees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The type of gambling licenses needed by a business depends on various factors:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Category of gambling and betting, i.e., online slots, poker, sportsbook, etc&nbsp;  



  Jurisdiction of the operator and prospective customers&nbsp;  Operating currencies&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



 How to get an online gaming license.&nbsp; 



<p>As previously stated, regulations vary depending on the jurisdiction. The most common licensing requirements for licensing authorities include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Business registration, including trademarks and design, and having servers within the jurisdiction&nbsp;  



  Readying detailed information about the business’ main employees, origin and proof of funds, and onsite gambling operations&nbsp;&nbsp;  Enforcing AML policies on the online platform, and carrying out independent audits&nbsp;  Providing clear information regarding problem gambling and the prohibition of underage gamblers&nbsp;  Compiling all required documentation&nbsp;  Paying the necessary fees&nbsp;  



<p>Much like the licensing conditions, the required documents for obtaining a license vary from one region to another. The most common requirements include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Provide evidence of no criminal history&nbsp;  Passport copies of the business owners and main employees&nbsp;&nbsp;  Utility bill copies and bank statements&nbsp;  



  Description of the games and software to be offered&nbsp;  Sound business plan&nbsp;  



<p>Before issuing a license, regulatory bodies usually conduct background checks to ensure the operator is transparent and will not affect the reputation of the jurisdiction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The most popular jurisdictions for issuing gaming licenses.&nbsp; 



<p>There are many recognized jurisdictions worldwide. Below are some of the most popular ones chosen by most operators:&nbsp;</p>



 Malta&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">The Malta Gaming Authority</a> provides B2B and B2C licenses, with the latter divided into four types. Each of these licenses enables the licensee to organize different types of gambling and betting businesses. Licenses remain valid for 10 years. Once the Maltese authorities accept an applicant’s licensing application and the required information, a decision is usually made within 12-16 weeks. The minimum total of all fees combined (initial application, licensing, system, and compliant audit fees), is €36,000.&nbsp;</p>



 The United Kingdom&nbsp; 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> accepts licensing applications for both online and land-based casinos. Applying for a British gambling license starts at about £25,000. Those with a cross-license agreement with the British administration can apply for a gaming license in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



 Curacao&nbsp; 



<p>Curacao is well known for its affordable pricing, low tax rates, and moderate requirements for obtaining gaming licenses. The island of Curacao offers two types of gaming licenses: a basic license and a sub-license. The jurisdiction allows licensees to organize various kinds of gambling activities under one license. Applications to the <a href="https://www.gamingcontrolcuracao.org/">Curacao Gambling Control Board</a> take nearly six weeks to review.&nbsp;</p>



 Gibraltar&nbsp; 



<p>A license from Gibraltar remains valid for five years. Being one of the strictest authorities, the licensing department only considers businesses with experience in the industry, particularly ones with other licenses from recognized jurisdictions, fair financial conditions, and a sound business plan. Generally, the prices have a straightforward structure: licensing for B2C operators running online casinos, betting platforms, and websites offering other gambling products cost £100,000. On the other hand, licensing for B2B providers costs £85,000.&nbsp;</p>



 The benefits of having an online gaming license. 



<p>Obtaining an online gambling license – especially from a respected authority and jurisdiction – has numerous benefits:&nbsp;</p>



  Reach global markets: Obtaining a license from a reputable regulator can allow businesses to gain exposure to global markets. For example, a Malta Gaming Authority license can be used internationally and help the licensee target global markets; specifically, those where gambling is legalized and no regulator is governing activity, like in Canada.&nbsp;  



  Legal business in prime jurisdictions: The UK is Europe’s most <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2020/12/European-Online-Gambling-Key-Figures-2020-Edition.pdf">prominent</a> gambling market, accounting for most of the continent’s market revenue. To offer gambling services legally in the UK, an operator must hold a local license from the UK Gambling Commission.&nbsp;  



  Financial benefits: Some licensing jurisdictions impose low to zero tax rates, allowing licensees to take advantage of fiscal benefits. Operators can also open settlement accounts in various jurisdictions.&nbsp;<br>  Partnerships with top software developers: Through proper licensing, operators can partner with award-winning developers in the industry, such as Microgaming, NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, Playtech, IGT, and more. Licensees can also benefit from ad campaigns created by such software providers, which often prove to be an asset for player retention business strategies.&nbsp;  



  Working with trusted financial institutions: Licensees can negotiate terms and establish strong relationships with renowned payment service providers, such as regional and global financial institutions, e.g., Neteller, PayPal, Trustly, Skrill, etc.&nbsp;  



  Credibility and authenticity: Players and businesses are significantly more likely to trust licensed online gambling operations. Licensed operators also enjoy numerous opportunities, as associations with well-known hardware, software, and other providers are easier to achieve.&nbsp;  



 The risks of not having an online gaming license.&nbsp; 



<p>Online gambling regulation ensures authorities and governments receive revenue and can protect operators and players from all types of crime and gambling-related harm, e.g., fraud, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/#:~:text=Money%20laundering%20involves%20disguising%20the,trading%2C%20bribery%2C%20or%20embezzlement.https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/#:~:text=Money%20laundering%20involves%20disguising%20the,trading%2C%20bribery%2C%20or%20embezzlement.">money laundering</a>, problem gambling, and the exposure of underage individuals to gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating without a license can damage the reputation of a company and may even negatively impact the entire industry. Below are the disadvantages associated with not having an online gaming license:&nbsp;</p>



  Player distrust: Players trust licensed companies. This is for many reasons: a license from a respected regulator means the operator follows stringent rules regarding fair gaming, data security, and responsible gambling. Operators cannot guarantee safety and fairness without a proper license.&nbsp;  



  No cooperation from financial institutions: Financial institutions regard licenses as an agreement and pledge that the operator will not engage in criminal activity such as money laundering or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a>. That is because regulatory bodies conduct thorough background checks to ensure the operator has no criminal record.&nbsp;  



  Little to no partnerships from software companies: Respected software developers and game providers avoid offering their services and products to unlicensed gambling providers. They do not want to risk associating their brand with companies that have the potential to engage in unethical practices.&nbsp;  



  Being blocklisted: Unlicensed gaming businesses face the imminent risk of being blocklisted by distinguished review platforms, regulators, and other organizations. A poor reputation may keep the operator from acquiring an online gambling license or having their current one revoked.&nbsp;  



  Risk of penalties and eventual shutdown: Operating in a certain region and not complying with the jurisdiction’s licensing laws can have dire consequences, including being blocklisted, hefty fines, legal problems (potentially leading to imprisonment), and eventual shutdown.&nbsp;  



 A legitimate gaming license is vital in a booming gaming industry.&nbsp; 



<p>With the ever-expanding gaming industry, having a valid gaming license is becoming increasingly important. Not only must businesses comply with their nation’s laws and regulations in order to protect consumers from harm, but they also need to demonstrate their commitment to responsible gaming practices to avoid any potential reputational damage or legal repercussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having a gaming license gives companies legitimacy, as well as acting as a financial buffer for losses incurred through fraudulent activity or cheating. Furthermore, it allows customers to assess a business’ reliability and trustworthiness when taking part in online gambling activities – ticking all of these boxes is essential for creating an attractive platform for gamers.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today we’ll discuss a new perspective on verified digital identities. And for that, we have a special guest who is Adrian Field. He leads OneID’s market development, working with banks, industry groups, governments and regulators to enable the UK market for identity services to grow and succeed. He’s also engaged with OpenID Foundation developing global open standards for identity and global projects to connect identity schemes, cross-border. Hello, Adrian.</p>
<p>Adrian Field: Morning. Hi, thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure having you. Thank you. Let’s talk about digital identity but first, I’d like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, tell us, what was your journey into this world of identity?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah. So, my background is banking and payments originally, so I spent a long time with one of the card schemes, doing all sorts of things, but learned about the concepts of authentication and authorisation through that process. And then spent a few years at one of the UK’s large banks looking at lots of different innovation topics, but digital identity was one of those. And then I used my authentication knowledge to build on that to investigate more and more about, you know, what is identity? How do you prove that it’s the right person, in a journey, at the right time?</p>
<p>Oscar: And to start this conversation with common understanding, for ones who have not heard or is not completely clear. What is the concept of verified digital identity? So, what are we talking about when you use this term and why is it important?</p>
<p>Adrian: I normally explain this by going back to the question of, “what is identity?” without the digital part. And for us at OneID this is your, it’s the legal concept of your personhood. So, you are a person which is either a natural person, which is a human, or a kind of legal person, which is an organisation. And if you’re a person in UK law, that gives you certain rights, so you can own things, I can sign documents, I can own property. I have certain rights that non-persons, i.e., objects and things don’t have those rights. So, you get your legal identity by – as a person you’re entered into a birth register, or if you’re an organisation, you get entered into a company’s register or charities register as a legal organisation. And that’s how you get the identity part. That’s what an identity is.</p>
<p>The digitisation of that is, how do I securely connect that legal entity or the natural person to that legal identity in a digital process. So, I’ve got to have some way of verifying a birth certificate, or a passport, or a document or some other way to connect those two things together. And then I can store some data, which is the digital part. And I can protect that by providing that person with some secure authenticators, so they can reconnect to that digital identity and use it in other contexts. And that’s when it becomes a reusable digital identity and therefore, it’s more useful and also verified.</p>
<p>Oscar: In most of the countries, there are several co-existing identity verification products. There are some based on getting a passport ID cards, for instance, that’s one category. There are some based on mobile subscriptions. And the one I know you and your company, OneID, is focused is the identity verification based on online banking. So, why this category of verified digital identities are needed?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah, so we looked at the UK market, and we looked at a number of different markets that have digital identity schemes and solutions in place. And specifically for the UK, we didn’t feel the government ID was the right way to go. It was quite hard, because politically, people have looked at ID cards from the government in the past, and they didn’t really want those. Whereas in the UK, we’ve got a very strong financial services market. We’ve got open banking infrastructure, which all of the banks have put a lot of investment into. To meet Payment Services Directive 2 requirements, so some EU legislation. And part of that open banking is all around strong customer authentication. So being able to securely identify that you have the right person in place to prevent payments fraud and things like that.</p>
<p>So, we saw that as a very good technical platform on which to build an identity layer, so an identity scheme on top of that. So essentially, it’s a bank ID scheme. So, you leverage the Know Your Customer process that the bank has put you through, so that they know who you are, we can leverage that and make that available in any online customer journey. And it’s a very easy process, because most people in the UK already have the bank app or the credentials that they need to get through our OneID service. And we can enable that for around 40 million UK adults, for instance, already have what they need to use the service. So, it’s a lot less friction for the customers to understand what a digital identity is, all they need to do is click a button and consent to share some data.</p>
<p>And we do – there’s a lot of kind of documents scanning solutions in the market and we recognise, and we look at that as a kind of bridging technology. I’ve got to scan my documents which we kind of see that as a digitised identity rather than a digital identity. Because I’m digitising paper into a digital format, as a follow-on step from that I can choose to store that digital format somewhere with a provider to create a reusable identity, and then protect that in in some way. So, we see that as a long-term process as well.</p>
<p>And in terms of what the telco sector can bring, there’s a lot of kind of useful signals around telcos in terms of SIM swaps, when was the last date that my SIM was swapped, and where is the phone location-based data, and things like that. We definitely see telcos and banks working together and providing complementary features. Although there are some gaps in the telco market in terms of I could have multiple shared handsets on one account. So, it makes it harder for, to know all the IDs on that account, and pay as you go, for instance. If there’s no KYC on getting the device, then that becomes harder to do identities in that manner.</p>
<p>Oscar: Explain us a bit in a, let’s say concrete example. Thinking the user doing some transactions and doing something online in which requires the identity verification, in the case of these online bank base, verify data identities. If you can guide us to a use case to understand how it works.</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah, sure. So, what our corporate customers who we – relying parties, we use that term. They would implement our service as a, we have a software development kit, an SDK. Essentially that they can embed our button within their app or website, so the consumer, as the service that consumers are trying to get to. They would then click that button, and then select the UK bank that they do their banking with. And once they’ve selected the UK bank, we would route them off to either the bank app that’s on their phone, or an online banking login page for their bank. And they login to that and they see what data that the relying party is requesting, they can consent to share that data. And then we hand off that customer back to the original service or relying party that they’re trying to access.</p>
<p>So, it’s a three click simple process, and the customer is completely in control and has good visibility of what data they’re sharing. And then through that process, we kind of avoid the need to educate the customer on, “This is a digital identity. This is what it is. And this is how you use it.” Because all you really see is I’m sharing my name, address, date of birth, with – I’m trying to get some car finance or trying to buy something online. That’s a lot easier for the consumer to understand in that context.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, so far, it’s already serving different types of relying parties, as you said, or, in practice service provider, or at least the other term just to use that. So, there are many, let’s say type of businesses and also, I guess, government that are already using this type of verified identity.</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes, exactly. So, we’re getting some good traction in e-signing, for instance. So currently, when you sign a document, you typically get an email into inbox, you then click the link and sign the document. But if that email goes astray, or if you, as the contracting provider, want to know that it went to the right person, you can insert a digital identity check in that process. So, we’ve built that and partnered with a number of the e-signature market to be able to have an identity and signature flow, which works really well.</p>
<p>Another use case we’re looking at is Disclosure and Barring Service or DBS Checks in the UK for employment. We can now do that in 100% digital process that doesn’t need documents scanning. So, it’s a much easier flow for the customer to get through.</p>
<p>And final use case is financial services where we’re live in the FCA Regulatory Sandbox working with one of our customers in the asset finance space where we can augment and supply some of the KYC data into their customer due diligence process for money laundering checking.</p>
<p>Oscar: And you have mentioned earlier that one of the reasons why this type of verified digital identity made a lot of sense in the UK is because, the UK has open banking among other parts of the system that are already working, working pretty well. So, if you can tell us a bit more about that online banking, how this approach is using or complementing open banking?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes, exactly. So, we’re regulated ourselves by the Financial Conduct Authority as the UK FS regulator. We’re an Account Information Service Provider under PSD2, so we have permission to access all of the banks without permissions or contracts from the banks. But you can only get certain limited data under the PSD2 directive. And it’s, you know, eIDAS is the regulation in Europe that covers identity. PSD2 is just about triggering payments and getting bank transaction data so it’s not about identity. So, we partner with the banks to get that additional information. So, we’re using open banking as technical rails to secure the API connectivity. But we have commercial partnerships with the banks to actually get the identity data.</p>
<p>Oscar: And this approach can be replicated in other countries?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes. So, we’re looking at other countries that have, either open banking, and digital identity frameworks. A lot of countries who will have both of those things and talking to other schemes in terms of how– sharing how people do it elsewhere; what’s worked, what hasn’t worked, and what needs to be put in place, if you haven’t got the relevant frameworks or standards. And how we can connect those things to enable cross-border journeys. So, there’s a lot of activity going on. I think there’s something like 60 countries globally have digital ID systems. They’re not all based on open banking, but open banking, online banking is emerging as a good model on which to base your identity for a number of different reasons.</p>
<p>Oscar: Coming back to the benefits that verified digital identities have, can you tell us what are some of those benefits both for individuals and for businesses?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes. So, I’ll start with businesses. So firstly, it acts as a key capability within digital transformation. So, understanding who your customers are, and enabling them to access your services in a much quicker way, will lead to increased sales. Basically, you’ll be able to onboard more customers more quickly. They’ll typically spend more with your company, because we find convenience always wins. So, the customers will also use the path of least resistance. If I have one service that is hard to get to and I need to go and find my document and do lots of different steps to get onto that service. Versus one that takes three clicks to get through to the same thing, typically, you’ll find your conversion is better with a simpler service.</p>
<p>We also think this will be a cheaper route. So operationally, the cost if you haven’t got – don’t need people checking documents, then it’s a cheaper provision of service. And also, for the business, we think this will lower fraud because we can keep fraudsters out of the loop because they can’t prove that they are who they are. So typically, impersonation fraud, someone’s pretending to be someone they’re not with a different name. If you then ask them to authenticate themselves with their bank account, they won’t have a bank account in that name so they just can’t get through the process. And this will help things like authorised push payment fraud, and other frauds in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And then on the on the individual life. It’s really all about making my life simple. So, make my life easier, and not more complex. If I’m trying to get to a service, when I’m out and about maybe my ID documents at home, I can onboard to service easily just with the phone I have when I’m out. It makes my life really simple. We can actually onboard you to a service provider and also do a login afterwards as well. So, there’s no new passwords to remember. I get to see what data I’m sharing so I can control my data. I consent to share exactly what data has been asked for. I can see what data I’ve shared in the past through another consent service that we offer.</p>
<p>And in our model, the data is protected by my bank. So, someone I already have a relationship with, I trust my bank, I trust him with my money, I trust him with my information. And they can help me when it goes wrong as well. So, if something happens and identity is compromised, I can call my bank and say, “Can you help me out? Let’s figure out what went wrong and fix it.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Do you see there could be some cross-border challenges that come from specific country based digital identities?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yeah. So, a lot of a lot of this comes from, you know, interoperability in the standards space. So, what – how do I actually connect to these services, connecting together to share data from one scheme or solution to another one? What’s the kind of data format, what does the data mean? And then from a governance perspective, what’s the level of assurance that was been through, the checking of that identity before that data was issued? And do I trust that that process was followed properly?</p>
<p>So, in the UK, for instance, we have a certification regime set up where I can actually get an independent auditor to verify that I’m safe and doing these things properly. And therefore, you build in different layers of trust in the data that comes out of that ecosystem. And do you have equivalents of those things across different corridors. But essentially, identity, or legal identity always comes from a national authority, so it always will be nation-based. I got my identity from being on a birth register in a country. And then they issued me with a passport, driving license, et cetera, digital identity can be added on to those things.</p>
<p>So, I do see we will have 200 plus countries issue identity, and in what format they do those things. And that’s where some of the work I’m doing with OpenID Foundation and others is in terms of; how do we come up with better, easier-to-use standards that can enable, all of these things, to talk to each other.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how are this type of approach of online bank based verified identity fits with eIDAS 2.0, if it fits?</p>
<p>Adrian Field: Yes, there’s a lot of interesting activity going on in Europe with eIDAS 2.0 with the whole kind of shift to digital wallets and people having a wallet or a container that they can then put digital identity credentials into. What are the kinds of standards and infrastructure that enables that to happen? And how do we give people more control and visibility about what data they have, enable them to choose to share that data with third parties, and a privacy respecting, data minimisation, all of those good things happen through that. And I think that the kind of eIDAS 2.0 framework started to drill down through the layers to say how these things actually going to be implemented, which is really good.</p>
<p>And we’ve got four or five large scale projects with lots of different parties involved, with lots of good capabilities. So, we’re watching that space quite closely in terms of what’s our equivalent approach in the UK to digital wallets between the government, the banking sector, us as a provider, how those things work and interoperate together. To be able to securely provision those credentials into the right wallet.</p>
<p>And I do think some key challenges are going to be around how do you bind the credential to the wallet? How do you bind the wallet to the device, and the person that owns it, to make sure that the credentials that are being presented actually belong to the person that’s in front of you, or in that digital journey?</p>
<p>Oscar: How, first of all, is the UK Trust Framework is supporting verified digital identities?</p>
<p>Adrian: I think the UK government is doing really well with the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology. There’s a new department, but they’ve now taken over ownership with the trust framework. The Trust Framework is in a beta version, and we have 36 providers in the UK market that have been certified under a number of different roles within that framework.</p>
<p>So, I think the UK government’s work has certainly catalyse the UK identity market and enabled providers, such as ourselves, to be certified for services within that. And also, they have launched – there are three schemes, there’s a right to rent, right to work and Disclosure and Barring Service schemes that have been launched under that. Where if relying parties are looking to buy services from the market, the framework is recommending that they use certified providers because you’ve got that layer of trust that you don’t have with non-certified services.</p>
<p>So, I think it’s been a very good framework that’s evolved and enabling the UK market to progress from where it was before. And also, for – we now have a kind of reference point for; anyone that’s doing anything and identity in the UK and point towards the framework and say, “Well, let’s do it this way. We can have that common language between each other. We all know what the inputs and outputs are in terms of a common approach. So, it has been really good.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, and as you said earlier when I asked you about the, what are the verified data identity? You mentioned very clear there are verified identity for individuals, which mostly what we’re talking in this conversation, but also you mentioned there’s also for the organisations. So, that touches the topic of the Legal Entity Identifiers, LEIs, to go your view how do LEIs are supporting verified digital identities?</p>
<p>Adrian: Yes, I think this is – these are essential and the whole, the work through GLEIF and the whole ecosystem of, how do we give unique identifiers to legal organisations globally? That can then be used to create security around who are the business organisations that I’m dealing with, who owns which assets, etc. Who owns – what’s the kind of parent-child relationship, in particular businesses, as well. Absolutely helps understand that kind of transparency and trust of, I know, organisationally, who I’m dealing with, who I’m contracted with.</p>
<p>And then we can add in the individual identities from things like OneID to say, “I know who the individuals are, and I’ve verified the individuals.” I can then start to connect those two things together. So, I’ve got OneID for an individual, I’ve got an LEI that I know it’s this particular company. And I can then join those two things together to say, this individual is acting as a director of that organisation. Or it’s the Chief Financial Officer, and they have access to the bank account information. And then you can then start to secure those channels to say, “I’ve only got certain notified people should have access to my corporate bank accounts.” It then protects the corporate bank accounts from fraudulent use of internal people, or the wrong internal people accessing those accounts.</p>
<p>And also, when you’re paying other companies, you can then start to verify, “Am I paying the right company? Am I dealing with the right person within that company, in terms of individual identities?” So, it becomes very powerful, the combination of both.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. And I really hope to see this – exactly the use case that you just described I hope to see really in the in the near future. Unless, unless you have already seen them. But yeah…</p>
<p>Adrian: And we’re looking at those kinds of use cases as well to say, you know, how can we actually do better corporate identity, and use the LEIs for all sectors, really. So, LEIs have been born out of the financial sector, through regulation. But we do see business use in all sectors is useful, to be able to enable less fraud within a country, or better and smoother cross-border use cases for companies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, certainly. A final question, Adrian, for all business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Adrian: I would say, come and talk to us, so my email is <a href="mailto:adrian@oneid.uk">adrian@oneid.uk</a>. Come talk to us, come and engage with the services, come and test and learn and try them out. So, we’re live and we have an easy-to-use API that takes a few hours to integrate. We’re also based on open standards, with OpenID Connect. So, it’s very easy to get up and running with a service and start to consume it, to see what kind of data you get from the service, what kind of assurance, and what certification? How does this interoperate in terms of other things in the market? What kind of solutions are you using today? What kind of problems you have, that these solutions can potentially address? But it’s all ready and up and running, so yes, just come talk to us.</p>
<p>Oscar: Again, it was very nice, very interesting discussing with you Adrian and all the best.</p>
<p>Adrian: OK, thanks for having me.</p>

Join security experts from KuppingerCole Analysts and Zero Networks as they discuss network segmentation as a departure point and how microsegmentation is evolving to make it easier to use.</p>
<p>Alexei Balaganski, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts will explain the problems with network security, how microsegmentation addresses those problems, what it is, how it works, and why previously it has not been more widely recognized and adopted as a means of achieving ZTNA.</p>
<p>Nicholas DiCola, VP of Customers at Zero Networks will outline and demonstrate the concept of intelligent microsegmentation. He will explain how this approach makes it easy for organizations to use microsegmentation to achieve least privilege networking automatically and in a scalable way for every user and device without having to deploy agents or configure policies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pioneering-zero-trust-network-access"></a>

<p>Regulators worldwide intensify their scrutiny of the crypto industry, the CFTC files a lawsuit against Binance for evading US regulations, G7 finance leaders prepare to discuss tighter crypto rules following FTX’s collapse and bank failures, and Huobi advisor Justin Sun faces SEC fraud charges, potentially impacting the company’s VASP license application in Hong Kong.</p>



 CFTC Targets Binance for Evading US Regulations 



<p>Lately, US regulators have been targeting more and more crypto market players. Making headlines now is the suit filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) against Binance, as an outcome of an investigation started in 2021, for allowing US citizens to access their platform and transact in BTC, ETH and LTC without registering with the derivatives regulator.</p>



<p>Internal communication from Binance revealed that the entity knowingly and willingly did so by obfuscating the locations of its executive offices, as well as their identities.</p>



<p>The full details of the lawsuit and allegations against Binance can be read <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/60YAbCz/cftc-binance-pdf">here</a>.</p>



 G7 Finance Leaders to Tackle Crypto Regulations in the wake of FTX Collapse and Bank Failures 



<p>The G7 is a group of seven countries with the most advanced economies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States; the EU is an active participant, however, not an enumerated member) and its presidency rotates annually, currently held by Japan.&nbsp; Its aim is to address transnational issues, such as financial stability, international security among others.</p>



<p>Days before the annual Leaders’ Summit is hosted in May, the group will discuss, in a meeting of finance ministers and central banks, the tightening of crypto regulations in order to protect consumers and promote business transparency, as an outcome of FTX’s collapse and the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.</p>



<p>Although it issues policies, the G7 is not a formal entity, thus with no legislative or authoritative power to enforce them.&nbsp;The efforts, statements and reports issued by G7 are valuable for international and national organizations from various fields as resource tools in supporting their work and advance national legislation.</p>



 Huobi Advisor Justin Sun Faces SEC Fraud Charges 



<p>Justin Sun, who serves as an adviser to Huobi Global, has been <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-59">charged</a> with fraud, by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, due to selling two unregistered crypto tokens and manipulating trade&nbsp;in one of his three companies. Huobi moved its headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong and is in the process of obtaining a VASP license from Hong Kong’s Securities Futures Commission (SFC).</p>



<p>The new charges brought against Sun may have negative repercussions for Huobi’s application.</p>



<p>Hong Kong’s new licensing framework goes into effect in June 2023, which will allow retail investors to trade cryptocurrencies. Currently there are only two licensed exchange platforms in this territory and only high net-worth individuals are allowed to trade crypto on one of them.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 20th to March&nbsp;26th <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we look into the upcoming G7 crypto regulatory recommendations, the proposed bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Act, the CFTC Commissioners urging collaboration with the SEC for harmonized crypto regulations, and the EU to vote on MiCA in&nbsp;April.</p><p>We are closely monitoring and analyzing regulatory developments while taking into account the importance of protecting the ecosystem. Let’s dive straight into the recap&nbsp;now.</p> G7 to Unveil Crypto Regulatory Recommendations <p>As the G7 summit approaches in May, the member states are reportedly gearing up to advocate for tighter cryptocurrency regulations worldwide.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Moonchaser2020/status/1640190489797246976?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>This potential regulatory push could have significant ramifications for crypto users and the broader digital asset community, altering the landscape of this rapidly evolving&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Recommendations on regulating, supervising, and overseeing global stablecoins and crypto asset activities are expected by July and September this&nbsp;year.</p><p>While the overall tone of the recommendations remains unknown, the potential for stricter regulations could create both challenges and opportunities for the crypto community.</p><p>On the one hand, tighter regulations may hinder innovation and limit the adoption of cryptocurrencies. On the other, enhanced transparency and consumer protection could foster greater trust and increase mainstream adoption, ultimately strengthening the&nbsp;market.</p> EU Parliament Gears up for Crucial MiCA Vote in&nbsp;April <p>The European Union is on the verge of formalizing the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing a licensing regime for cryptocurrencies across the&nbsp;bloc.</p><p>With a 28–1 vote in favor by the Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee last October, the EU is now all set to debate over MiCA on April 18 and final vote the following day on&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>Additionally, the Transfer of Funds regulation, which aligns with FATF Travel Rule requirements, will be discussed and is expected to be approved shortly after&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>If MiCA and the Transfer of Funds regulation are approved, crypto companies will be required to adhere to governance and consumer-protection norms. They will also have to verify user identities and exchange data with counterparty VASPs during transactions to minimize money laundering and terrorism financing risks.</p><p>Although these regulations aim to ensure consumer protection and market stability, their potential impact on user experience and privacy remains a concern for the crypto community.</p><p>As the EU legislators prepare to decide on MiCA, industry stakeholders have a crucial role to play. They should design processes and safeguards to shield the end users from potential regulatory backlash by prioritizing user experience and&nbsp;privacy.</p> Bipartisan Blockchain Regulatory Act for a Clear US Regulatory Environment Aims to Streamline Crypto Industry Oversight <p>US House of Representatives Majority Whip Tom Emmer has introduced the Blockchain Regulatory Act (BCRA), a bipartisan bill designed to bring regulatory clarity to the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>Co-led by Representative Darren Soto of Florida and backed by members from both political parties, the bill aims to create a more sensible regulatory environment for blockchain developers and service providers not involved in holding or managing consumer&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Emmer insists that by distinguishing these entities from money transmitters subject to stringent regulation, the BCRA could potentially alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens and encourage innovation within the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>If passed by Congress, BCRAthe Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act could significantly benefit the crypto community by increasing investor confidence, reducing regulatory uncertainty, enhancing consumer protection, and promoting adoption.</p><p>However, the bill’s success ultimately depends on securing a majority of votes in Congress. If achieved, this legislation would represent a significant victory for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, paving the way for future growth and innovation.</p> CFTC Commissioners Urge SEC Collaboration for Harmonized Regulations <p>At the DC Blockchain Summit, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioners Summer Mersinger and Kristin Johnson emphasized the need for collaboration between the CFTC and SEC to establish a digital token classification framework.</p><p>They highlighted the importance of precise legal terms in defining market participants’ obligations and responsibilities, as well as the limitations of enforcement authority and regulatory oversight.</p><p>Mersinger and Johnson also stressed the significance of a global regulatory relationship, citing Japan’s pioneering regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies established in&nbsp;2016.</p><p>Commissioner Mersinger advocated for “global harmony,” emphasizing the CFTC’s unique role in aligning its rules with international regulations.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">European Crypto Regulatory Climate and its Impact on Crypto Ecosystem</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/gibraltar-based-xapo-bank-to-enable-usdc-services-amidst-banking-crisis">Gibraltar-Based Xapo Bank to Enable USDC Services Amidst Banking&nbsp;Crisis</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Answered</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 In this vlog, 1Kosmos CSO, Mike Engle, is joined by CodeCluster CEO, Mike Vitez, to discuss how 1Kosmos, Arculus, and CodeCluster partner to reduce fraud. 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>All right, thank you for joining. My name is Mike Engle, head of strategy and co-founder at 1Kosmos. Today I’m joined by Mike Vitez, CEO of CodeCluster. Mike, would you be so kind as to introduce yourself and give people a little bit about your background?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Thank you for this introduction and thank you for the opportunity to participate in this video with you together. I really appreciate this opportunity. So as Mike told me, I’m Mike Vitez, I’m the founder and CEO of CodeCluster, a system integrator company focused on web two and web three technologies. I personally been in for almost a decade in the industry, started as a computer scientist and then starting my own system integrator company, which differentiates us on the market is that we are not a typical development chef. We mostly do products including the architecture and giving out Scrum masters project managers. So let’s say, full product teams including business analysts, et cetera. And on the other side regarding custom development, we are integrating web three modules and web three elements into custom development projects. That’s how we got in touch with you also and how we started working with you as 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>No, that’s great. I guess the term custom development project is a bit broad. Maybe you could give an example of a type of integration that you do and what your role is in a process like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>So this custom development phrase as a project covers in the whole integration process, which starts with a consultation where we understand that what is the need of the business, what we are trying to solve, and then we start integration the whole modules from the separate teams and the separate providers. For example, from our perspective, we don’t want to achieve any solution, like to be easy to understandable, we don’t want to create an e-commerce solution. We want to create a solution that can be a solution for an e-commerce business. So we try to solve a business issue, not a technical issue from our side. And custom development means that if we are working with modules from parties, not just ours, then we are the ones who are putting the parts together and probably we can create our own solutions that needs to be developed for the specific reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>That’s great. No, thanks for explaining that. There’s one particular project which we’re going to dive into here today. It is kind of a three-way partnership between 1Kosmos, CodeCluster and Arculus, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>For those that aren’t aware of Arculus, they are the leading cold storage wallet in the marketplace today. Cold storage wallets are used for, most of the time, storing of things like crypto keys, keeping a private key private, and compared to other form factors in the marketplace. The Arculus card, I have one here but don’t have time to pull it out of my wallet, it’s a basic credit card form factor and the company that’s behind that called CompoSecure, they’re a public company and they make most of the metal credit cards in the world today. This Arculus card has some amazing benefits, superior security, it’s got what they call three-factor authentication. And maybe you could talk a little bit about why Arculus, 1Kosmos and CodeCluster came together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>So our role was to create, at first a frame for this card. Arculus hired us to create a mobile application for their cards and we integrated 1Kosmos solutions into the pipeline, so this is a very good example for this custom development process I mentioned above, because after we have made the whole design process, the whole point of the process, we made the application by ourselves based on the design and the needs, what Arculus brought to us. Then after we were able to integrate 1Kosmos SDK as the KYC provider for this particular case and for the security reasons that needs to be done from 1Kosmos’ side to make Arculus to be able to use this solution on the market. So we were the ones who put these parts together, our role was the system integrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Right. As you described. So the perfect use case for your organization and the type of expertise you bring to the table. There’s a process that was in introduced, and that is proving somebody’s identity and we call that Identity Enrollment, which brings a couple disciplines together. So there’s matching somebody’s face to government credentials, verifying the integrity of the credentials, obviously all the security and decisioning bias has to be addressed with that as well. So at the end of this process though, you’re able to use the Arculus card for some pretty neat capabilities. Could you talk about the capability that is brought to the table, what you can do with this card from a transaction perspective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yes. I’ve got two answers for that. Firstly, I would briefly introduce how this pipeline works, how the workflow goes through the registration. Then I can talk about the benefits of the integration. So during this card registration with 1Kosmos BlockID, the user’s payment card creates new keeper. Through the 1Kosmos BlockID app, the user approves the unique authorization by tapping the secure Arculus payment card to the back of our mobile device. So with that case, we’ve been testing and using these physical devices also by ourselves, it was a very interesting part, I have to say. Every one of my developers was super excited about this part and, “I want the card, I want the card.” Everybody said that. So yeah, this is really a cool use case to use also from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>So what we have seen that the real benefit in this case is the heightened security because this solution that was 1Kosmos made is totally eliminating the use of a password to authenticate users, which means that we are eliminating all the risks to inherit into password, including sharing, loss and theft from cyber attack, like account takeover. User authentication is always a problem because in a lot of cases you forget to remember your password authenticate.</p>
<p>So I think that everybody faced that issue in the past, and in that case, a simple tap from the Arculus card is enough to make the users authenticated. So in that case, we are eliminating these need of passwords and password biggest attacks, which I think is the future because the leak, the biggest security leak is still and the most vulnerability point of every system is still the password. So I think that this kind of authentication can be a good solution to solve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there’s a phrase that’s getting really popular, “Hackers don’t hack in anymore, they just log in.” Because they’ve stolen the username and password, and as we saw just this week, the big announcement about how the LastPass hack happened, they basically put a keystroke logger on the main developer’s home machine and got access to all the keys. Imagine if that last pass developer had to go like this with the Arculus card and tap it to the back of the phone for as you put a card present transaction or an incredibly strong factor. And that’s what you guys have developed and brought to the table with this capability be just this simple act and this amazing form factor, which fits in my wallet, is a real game changer in the industry.</p>
<p>So Mike, it’s been really a pleasure speaking with you and hearing about the process, the success story that’s already to market and is brewing as this really picks up speed and looking forward to working with your team in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, me too. And also I really appreciate being represented here and also it was enjoyable process working with both, 1Kosmos and both, with Arculus together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>All right, let’s keep on keeping on. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Vitez:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Every year, the Ponemon Institute surveys more than 2,500 IT leaders who are immersed in PKI management at an enterprise level. The most recent survey — issued in mid-2022 — identified a pattern seen over previous years. According to authors of the study, PKI continues growing in importance in terms of enterprise security and enablement, yet companies are struggling to achieve “PKI maturity” on a couple of fronts.</p>
<p>Barriers to PKI maturity: Funding and talent</p>
<p>Funding presents one large obstacle for most organizations. Few CFOs or other senior leaders understand what PKI is, making it difficult to build a case for securing budget. A second and more imposing obstacle, according to the survey, is a persistent shortage of skilled IT and IT security practitioners. This is a widespread problem that cuts across all markets, company sizes and regions of the world. There simply are too few workers with strong PKI management skills. That gap is creating serious challenges for CISOs and other IT leaders looking to mitigate the risks of ubiquitous cyberattacks.</p>
<p>So, if PKI talent isn’t readily available on the market, how do you build a team? Which tasks do you keep inside the organization and which ones do you outsource to a trusted partner? Before we dive into those questions, let’s quickly review the key roles requires for effective PKI and certificate management:</p>
 
 Certificate Authority (CA) Administrator: People in this role are responsible for analyzing security data and producing reports regarding the enterprise’s system security status. They conduct system security risk assessments and penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and implement remediation actions. They also establish security best practices and are generally responsible for the overall health of the PKI infrastructure. 
 Auditor: This is the PKI team member responsible for defining which CA events and for reviewing the security log for events related to PKI management and operations. 
 CA Officer: This role is responsible for managing digital certificates and cryptographic keys. This includes the important tasks of certificate issuance, renewal, revocation, issuance and deletion. 
 Backup &amp; Recovery Specialist: People in these roles are accountable for the ongoing backup and recovery of the CA database and configuration settings. 
 
<p>The increasing importance of digital security prompts many organizations to staff these roles internally and keep the tools that allow access to “the crown jewels” inside the organization. For most in-house approaches, companies create small and specially trained teams that manage the entire life cycle of digital certificates and keys. Responsibilities for these small but mighty teams include creating and updating security policies, ensuring the security and integrity of root signing keys, managing user registrations, and staying current on crypto standards and protocols.</p>
<p>Companies increasingly lean on trusted cybsersecurity partners</p>
<p>But because these teams are small, it’s easy for them to become overwhelmed with the time-consuming responsibilities of urgent requests to resolve lost, compromised or expired certificates. In fact, these day-to-day management responsibilities can require so much manpower that many companies end up finding a trusted outside partner to help with those tasks. This is true even when sophisticated tools are deployed for automating certificate and key management.</p>
<p>These PKI management challenges are magnified as organizations grow. If growth is organic — or simply involves the expansion of existing digital ecosystems — the challenge is simply a matter of volume. But in the event of mergers or acquisitions, teams likely have to take on the massive and complex task of integrating disparate architectures and platforms, which are likely using a number of PKI solutions.</p>
<p>This reality — coupled with the challenges of funding headcount and finding qualified candidates — is leading to more widespread use of external managed services for PKI life cycle management. Partnering with an external provider of cloud-hosted PKI infrastructure-as-a-service provides CISOs and other IT leaders with access to personnel, systems and distributed data centers that scale to meet the demands of an enterprise.</p>
<p>Key strategy: Hiring moldable talent</p>
<p>But even if an external managed service is engaged, organizations need skilled people to oversee certificates, keys and other critical elements of a digital ecosystem. Considering that (according to a 2022 ISC2 market study) there is a global cybersecurity workforce gap of 3.4 professionals, how can you even build a small team?</p>
<p>One answer is to shift your focus from hiring fully trained, plug-and-play talent to finding people with the right soft skills who are highly receptive to training. Instead of searching for unicorns who bring every certification and skill set to the job on day one, look for good, smart people who want to learn — and have a professional affinity for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Just as it is with developers and software engineers, the technologies, standards and best practices surrounding cybersecurity are moving so fast that it’s more important to have people who are willing to learn than people who are deeply familiar with cybersecurity particulars of the moment. Given the global shortage of cybersecurity talent, it’s likely a more prudent path to hire enthusiastic and hard-working people to learn the PKI trade. Then, fill in any gaps with external partners you trust — while maintaining control over your certificates and keys.</p>
<p>Tips for building a successful PKI program</p>
<p>In addition to resolving the PKI talent gap, it also helps to build a secure and manageable PKI program. Here are some tips for that:</p>
 
  Maintain good key and certificate hygiene and conduct regular scans: Know where your keys and certificates are located, how they were generated, and when they expire. Build accountability into your processes. Know precisely who has access to keys and certificates and where they are stored. Create a life cycle management process that keeps you in control. 
  Built a collaborative risk management strategy: Digital security is becoming a boardroom topic, so this should be easier than in previous years. Analyze your risk profile across the entire enterprise. Include people from business units, compliance, IT, engineering and other disciplines. Make sure everyone understands the plan and knows why adhering to the processes you establish is necessary. 
  Achieve a balance of strong security and excellent user experience: You could create a bullet-proof cybersecurity strategy if you didn’t have to worry about user experience. But without productive employees, engaged business partners and happy customers, you wouldn’t have anything to protect. Work closely with all user groups to explain the benefits of security and identify the security measures that both protect them and keep them engaged. 
 
<p>Building a strategy that incorporates these principles and focusing your hiring practices on promising talent rather than people with deep and specific knowledge will help you create a successful and sustainable security strategy in a world full of great opportunities and ubiquitous threats.</p>

<p>At the Gartner IAM Summit 2023, Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, presented on the promising future of true B2B IAM. Attendees of the Summit can replay this session via the Gartner app. However, for those who didn’t attend, this overview will cover the key takeaways from the session.</p>
 Current B2B IAM 
<p>To understand why nobody is delivering true <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/b2b-iam/" title="B2B IAM">B2B IAM</a>, we need to look at what is being delivered today. B2B IAM focuses on the external identities – i.e., partners, suppliers, consultants etc.</p>
<p>Delegated administration is a key (and very beneficial) feature of B2B IAM. When using delegated administration in B2B IAM, the entity that knows what the identities should be manages the external identities, so that they can effectively&nbsp;oversee the identity lifecycle management. Whether done through federated authentication or management monitored, the central point retains control over the authentication and authorisation of external identities.</p>
<p>Therefore, B2B IAM systems are still managing the identities&nbsp;of individuals. This leads us to question, how is this different from B2C IAM? Although B2B IAM makes identification and authentication simpler, it still follows the same processes as B2C. In these scenarios, transactions are made with organisations (perhaps shops, restaurants etc.), rather than an individual. Yet this proposes a security challenge.</p>
 The Challenge of Transaction Values 
<p>The security in a transaction comes from being able to identify the parties involved and using that identification to work out the risk involved in the transaction and managing that risk appropriately.</p>
<p> Higher assurance identities provide a lower risk, whilst the risk increases with lower assurance identities. With any given risk, we can choose what kind of transaction value we’re prepared to tolerate within that.</p>
<p>There are, and have been, many ways for individuals to verify they are dealing with verified organisations. However, there is currently no technical identification to verify a legitimate transaction. This is why highly assured organisational identities are needed to identify the endpoint in transactions with organisations.</p>
 Which Organisational Identity to Choose 
<p>There are many organisational identities that exist today. The World Trade Organisation are pushing an initiative for cross-border paperless trade, based on organisation identities. Within their toolkit they list the five preferred subject identifiers that will be used.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Only one of these identifiers represents a highly assured identity that is suitable for use in identifying the endpoint in transactions and reducing the associated risk. The LEI is globally unique, externally validated and has public access, meaning it can be looked up, at no cost, with full visibility for that highly assured organisational identity.</p>
 What is an LEI? 
<p>The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) was created as a result of the 2008 financial crisis. It tells you who is who, and who owns who. Understanding this consolidated ownership is key to stopping the circular investment meltdowns that caused the financial crash. For more about LEIs, see: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/corporate/what-is-legal-entity-identifier/" title="What is a Legal Entity Identifier and what can you do with it?">What is a Legal Entity Identifier and what can you do with it?</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to the LEI’s implementation through an open data framework, and the strict accreditation rules through the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF), the LEI is a highly assured organisation identifier. The G20, with the FSB, have a target to grow the number of LEIs to about 20 million by 2027 (about 10% of organisations globally), at which point we’re beyond that critical mass stages of having that highly assured organisation identifier.</p>
 What can happen if you get Organisational Identity Wrong? 
<p>Having or representing the wrong organisation identity can have serious consequences and significant financial impact. Who remembers the <a href="https://www.keatingchambers.com/case-report/liberty-mercian-ltd-v-cuddy-civil-engineering-ltd/">Cuddy Group vs Liberty Mercian contract case</a>, resulting in a 5 million GBP bill? Or the fake Eli Lilly Twitter account which cost $15 billion on their market cap?</p>
<p></p>
<p>These cases show how it’s critical that not only do you have a highly assured organisation identity, but that you can attribute it to the right person to represent that.</p>
 Why True B2B IAM is the Future of Digital Identity 
<p>The combination of a strongly authenticated individual with a highly assured organisation identity enables you to express who you are, who you represent, and the rights that you have to represent them.</p>
 
 Strongly Authenticated Individual<br>
The rise in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/european-reusable-strong-identity/" title="reusable identity">reusable identity</a> schemes globally means that reusable, strongly authenticated, highly assured identities are becoming easily available and accessible for individuals. 
 High Assured Organisation<br>
The LEI is available globally and is a highly assured organisational identity. 
 Ability to Combine Them<br>
To combine the strongly authenticated individual and the highly assured organisation is a technical operation. 
 
<p>Firstly, a form of assurance is required, a vetting of records – but that assurance is required to get identities. The second factor for combining them is delegation. But not just delegated administration that is seen in current B2B IAM, as discussed earlier, but generic delegation is required. Delegation chains, within operational workflows, are what adds value to the business proposition.</p>
 How Delegation Completes the Picture 
<p>Organisations are big tree structures, from a management and execution point of view, the rights to operate flow through that structure. The governance framework for the organisational flow is embodied within an individual’s contract or job description, but these checks and validations are usually administrative.</p>
<p>What if generic delegation, across all operations within the organisation, was implemented instead of delegated administration alone. Being able to do all business operations through the delegation chain is the true value that delegation brings.</p>
 Example: Payroll Operation Delegation 
<p>Many organisations outsource payroll to third-party organisations. Delegation allows the organisation to delegate its rights and responsibilities for submitting payroll and payroll tax to the external third-party organisation. They will then delegate internally, within the payroll organisation. This operational delegation allows for the whole system to run smoothly, providing the same efficiencies that we see from delegated administration, but on the operational side.</p>
<p>The combination of strongly authenticated individual identity and highly assured organisation identity, with true delegation at all levels, is True B2B IAM from our perspective.</p>
 How does True B2B IAM fit the Current Global Movement? 
<p>Several global schemes and frameworks are recognising the LEI as the highly assured organisation identifier of choice. Both the World Trade Organisation and the ICC are pushing to enable paperless trade leveraging the LEI. The eIDAS 2.0 EU digital wallet scheme will enable citizens to use the LEI to express relationships to organisations. The Globally Assured Identity Network (GAIN) also recognises the LEI as the entity identifier within its framework to allow for a transitive relationship between global networks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The GLEIF has launched the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">verifiable LEI (vLEI)</a> as both a verifiable credential and a governance framework. It has created an ISO standard which defines a jurisdiction-based legal role and enables the verifiable credential mechanism to express a relationship between; a highly assured individual, a highly assured organisation identity and the Official Organisation Role that bridges them together.</p>
 How Ubisecure enables True B2B IAM 
<p>As of March 2023, Ubisecure became the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/ubisecure-200000-organisation-identities/" title="largest issuer of LEIs worldwide">largest issuer of LEIs worldwide</a>, alongside our status as a leading identity and access management provider.</p>
<p>We have delivered True B2B IAM in a solution that supported over 400,000 organisations, and this is just the beginning. Our insights have shown that the combination of highly assured organisation identity and broad delegation can achieve savings of up to 99%. Meaning that transactions previously costing €30, can be reduced to €0.20 by deploying true B2B <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Katso-Case-Study.pdf" title="IAM">IAM</a>.</p>
<p>A broad range of use cases exist for this true B2B IAM. Watch the below video on how to authenticate an employee to a supplier, and then communicate the rights of that employee to represent his company. This simple use case shows how the RapidLEI platform and IAM services can digitise traditional, high cost administration.</p>
 
  
 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<p>We know that organisational identity is fundamental to the delivery of true B2B IAM. If B2C involves identifying the Cs, then B2B must involve identifying the Bs. Over the next few years, we expect to see a push from the legislation and organisations that are working on it. And this must impact what we’re doing as identity professionals, and how we think about B2B IAM.</p>

 The Block Perspective — March&nbsp;2023  European Crypto Regulatory Climate and its Impact on Crypto Ecosystem <p>Welcome to the first edition of The Block Perspective, Shyft’s monthly thematic overview! Here, we will be diving deep into some of the most pressing issues and trends in the industry, offering fresh insights and analysis from our team of experts. From the latest regulatory developments to real-world use cases and market trends, we will give you a comprehensive view of the blockchain landscape and the opportunities it presents.</p><p>Today, we are excited to delve into the European crypto regulatory landscape and explore its current state and future implications for the industry. We will examine the specifics of these regulations, from the EU’s MiCA proposal to 5AMLD, and explore how they shape the broader crypto market. Let’s not wait for any further and dive straight into this complex and ever-changing landscape and gain a better understanding of the future of digital assets in&nbsp;Europe.</p> The Delicate Balance: Europe’s Crypto Conundrum <p>Europe faces a pivotal task in crafting crypto regulations that protect privacy, autonomy, and innovation while preserving user experience. The contentious MiCA proposal presents a significant challenge, sparking debate and potentially jeopardizing blockchain’s foundational principles.</p><p>Achieving the optimal balance is vital to prevent hindering innovation, talent growth, and user privacy. Privacy-enhancing technologies and DeFi platforms offer viable solutions, necessitating strong collaboration between policymakers and industry stakeholders to ensure a seamless user experience.</p><p>Ultimately, Europe must champion cooperation and bolster cutting-edge solutions to effectively navigate this regulatory terrain. By doing so, Europe can unlock the full potential of cryptocurrencies, uphold their distinctive values, and maintain a user-centric approach that respects privacy. This will create a win-win situation for users, regulators, and industry stakeholders, fostering a thriving crypto ecosystem.</p> Dynamics of the World’s Largest Crypto&nbsp;Market <p>A year ago, Europe was proclaimed the world’s <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/europe-is-now-world-s-largest-cryptocurrency-market">largest cryptocurrency market</a>. The Central, Northern, and Western Europe regions, in particular, had become responsible for one-fourth of all global cryptocurrency activity, amounting to more than US$1 trillion in digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Large crypto transactions by institutional investors rose from US$1.4 billion in July 2020 to more than US$46 billion in June 2021. Much of this phenomenal volume stemmed from transactions worth more than US$10&nbsp;million.</p><p>One way to decipher the popularity of digital currencies in European countries is through the percentage of the invested population. For instance, as high as <a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/crypto-popularity-in-europeans-union-nations/">10–20%</a> of the population in several European countries invested in crypto assets, including Slovenia, Croatia, Luxembourg, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Slovakia, Austria, Portugal, Czech Republic, Estonia, Netherlands, Lithuania, and&nbsp;Ireland.</p><p>Realizing the growing market of cryptocurrencies in Europe, a long list of digital asset exchanges is making a b-line to enter the lucrative European market. In fact, according to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/01/11/as-crypto-crashes-coinbase-bets-big-on-europe/">report</a> published in January 2023, Coinbase, one of the most well-known crypto exchanges at a global level, was looking forward to “leveraging its status as the lone public crypto exchange in a do-or-die play to increase market share across&nbsp;Europe.”</p><p>With renowned crypto businesses and investors looking forward to augmenting their positions in major European markets, it is high time we take a closer look at the European crypto regulatory climate.</p><p>Existing regulations and legislations play a key role in shaping an industry ecosystem. And crypto assets are no exception. We will now look at the prevailing crypto regulatory ecosystem in some of the major European economies.</p> Germany <p>Considered one of the world’s most crypto-friendly countries, Germany started treating cryptocurrencies as financial instruments in 2011. And although this isn’t equal to making cryptocurrencies legal tender, Germany did greenlight crypto’s use for payment purposes, even before most of the world started taking digital assets seriously.</p><p>Any German crypto company, whether it wants to offer its services to German residents or not, must obtain a license from <a href="https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/FinTech/Geschaeftsmodelle/DLT_Blockchain_Krypto/DLT_Blockchain_Krypto_node_en.html">BaFin</a> or the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. However, when it comes to companies located outside Germany, they only have to obtain a BaFin license when actively soliciting German residents. And in case German residents register on their platforms voluntarily, they aren’t required to seek a license from&nbsp;BaFin.</p><p>Having implemented 5AMLD in 2020, crypto businesses are also required to enforce strict KYC/AML controls and report all suspicious transactions to BaFin as and when they come across&nbsp;one.</p> France <p>The French crypto <a href="https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/16/textes/l16b0826_texte-adopte-commission#D_Article_5_bis">regulations</a> want companies to register with the Financial Markets Authority to demonstrate their compliance with basic money laundering and governance norms. However, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/13/france-to-tighten-crypto-registration-rules-next-january/">reports</a> published in mid-February 2023 show that no operator has yet received such a license, hinting at procedural burdens associated with the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Despite this, <a href="https://decrypt.co/122455/france-moves-ahead-tighter-crypto-rules-new-entrants">sixty</a> companies have opted for simpler registration under the country’s prevailing two-tier system. Reportedly, these companies will not be affected by the new compliance requirements coming into&nbsp;effect.</p><p>The prevailing two-tier system seeks crypto businesses to apply for a simple registration with local financial regulator L’Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) to operate and could also opt for full licensing with more disclosures. However, it is also a fact that none of the French companies has yet opted for a full licensing process.</p><p>To explain this briefly, the regulation of Digital Asset Service Providers — known as DASPs or PSANs in French — is a two-tiered regime. The first tier seeks mandatory registration of providers of services in crypto custody and crypto-fiat exchanges. The second tier, known as the optional license, is for any digital asset service provider that requests such licenses and meets underlying requirements.</p><p>Essentially, crypto-custodians and crypto-fiat exchanges in France must register with the Authority. However, full licensing isn’t a must, at least for&nbsp;now.</p> Spain <p>The Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing is one of the most crucial <a href="https://www.mariscal-abogados.com/regulation-of-cryptocurrencies-in-spain/#:~:text=Companies%20working%20with%20cryptocurrencies%20in,money%2C%20financial%20instrument%20or%20value.">regulations</a> for crypto start-ups in Spain, which also requires virtual asset service providers to register with the Spanish Central&nbsp;Bank.</p><p>The second pertinent legislation in this matter has to do with the recent circular of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV). The circular — aimed at protecting potential investors — requires companies that advertise crypto as an investment object in Spain to comply with several requirements.</p> Netherlands <p>The Netherlands is a European country, with 12% of its total population invested in crypto. The country’s crypto-fiat exchanges and custodian wallet providers fall under the supervision of De Nederlandsche Bank or the Dutch National Bank. Initial Coin Offerings in the Netherlands come under financial supervision only if they qualify as securities or units in an investment fund.</p><p>The Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (<a href="https://www.mariscal-abogados.com/regulation-of-cryptocurrencies-in-spain/#:~:text=Companies%20working%20with%20cryptocurrencies%20in,money%2C%20financial%20instrument%20or%20value.">WWFT</a>) is the key crypto regulation in the Netherlands, which mandates all crypto-related entities to register with the DNB. In 2020, the WWFT was amended to incorporate rules that stemmed from European law, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5).</p> Slovenia <p>Keeping up with its image of being one of the most crypto-friendly jurisdictions globally, Slovenia has simplified the licensing mechanism for VASPs. Instead of going through a tiresome and intensive licensing process, crypto companies can enter their data into the register created and administered by Slovenia’s National&nbsp;Bank.</p><p>Although, in general, Slovenia accords a six-month deadline for crypto-related businesses to register with Slovenia’s Central Bank, the provided time is comparatively lesser for crypto exchanges and custodian wallet providers, as they have been given only three&nbsp;months.</p><p>The penalizing provisions for non-compliance may lead to fines from 6,000 Euros to 120,000 Euros for both private individuals and companies.</p><p>While, so far, we’ve seen what some of the European nations are doing in the crypto regulatory space, we must remember that the European Union has plans to introduce an EU-wide crypto regulatory mechanism. Expectedly, this regulatory framework, known as MiCA, would take away the regional aberrations and make the crypto ecosystem homogeneous.</p> Adoption of the Draft MiCA Regulation by the European Parliament <p>On Monday, March 14th, the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee <a href="https://www.simmons-simmons.com/en/publications/cl0vtj84109uh0a82m8a1caqe/the-draft-mica-regulation-adopted-by-the-european-parliament">adopted</a> its mandate to negotiate new rules relating to crypto-assets. The key provisions in the draft included the overarching themes of transparency in the ecosystem, communication, authorization, and control of operations.</p><p>To understand the impact that MiCA could bring to the European Crypto Regulatory Climate and the continent’s crypto ecosystem, we must look at the regulation in&nbsp;detail.</p> What Does MiCA Recommend? <p>The European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union agreed on MiCA on June 30th, 2022. MiCA stands for Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which is seen as the first comprehensive regulatory regime made specifically for crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Since the regulation is yet to come into effect, we would concentrate on the <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-7694-2022-INIT/en/pdf">procedural document</a>, which serves as the basis for the three institutions to negotiate among themselves.</p> How MiCA Defines Crypto Assets and What it Means for the Crypto Ecosystem? <p>Crypto assets — according to MiCA — are digital representations of value or rights that could be transferred and stored electronically. The tool to accomplish the transfer and storage is Distributed Ledger Technology.</p><p>This definition covers a lot more ground than what we generally understand from the term crypto assets. It is because the term crypto asset, defined in MiCA, does not refer to cryptography.</p><p>However, this definition was adopted by the Council of the EU without changes. The opinion of the contradicting experts and bodies was that digital asset could be a more appropriate term if the Council went by their definition.</p><p>Many cited the UK Crypto Assets Task Force’s definition of the crypto-asset to be more appropriate — “a cryptographically secured digital representation of value or contractual rights that uses some type of DLT and can be transferred, stored, or traded electronically.”</p> Asset Categories according to&nbsp;MiCA <p>The Markets in Crypto Assets regulation has put crypto-assets into four categories: Asset-Referenced Token, e-Money tokens, Utility Token, and a category for all other crypto-assets that do not fall within the above&nbsp;three.</p>  Asset-Referenced Tokens are essentially stablecoins. However, these tokens could use assets other than fiat currencies for stabilization.  E-Money tokens are stablecoins that use one single fiat currency for value referencing.  A Utility token — as evident from the name — provides access to a good or service that the token issuer has up for&nbsp;offer.  The fourth category of tokens may include all other types of assets that do not fall into the above-mentioned categories. These could be exchange tokens or security tokens, or something else.  <p>The crypto industry players must understand the categories they fall into and how the regulations would work in shaping their categories.</p> What Would MiCA Mean for Asset-Referenced Tokens? <p>The issuer of any asset-referenced token would have to establish themselves in the European Union and obtain mandatory authorization to offer such tokens to the public in the EU or admit them for trading on a crypto-asset exchange.</p><p>One of the benefits of MiCA being a bloc-wide regulation is that authorization — once granted — would stay valid throughout the EU. The prerequisites of authorization for asset-referenced tokens include specified capital requirements: the higher of 350,000 Euros, 2% of the daily average of the reserve over the preceding six months, and a quarter of the fixed overheads of the preceding year.</p> What Would MiCA Mean for E-Money&nbsp;Tokens? <p>MiCA suggests that for any institution to become the issuer of an e-money token, it must have authorization as an electronic money institution or credit institution.</p><p>The European Banking Authority will not be the lead regulator if at least 80% of the token holders and transaction volume are concentrated in the home state. Instead, the home regulator will stay as the supervisory authority.</p> What Would MiCA Mean for Non-Stablecoins? <p>Tokens, not asset-referenced or e-money, are expected to face a relatively lighter regime. However, the issuer of such non-stablecoin crypto assets must obtain relevant regulatory approval of a white paper with specified content and form requirements.</p><p>However, certain non-stablecoin crypto-assets must not obligatorily fulfill white paper requirements. These non-stablecoins include crypto assets offered for free, automatically created as a reward during the validation process, a utility token for goods/services already in existence or operation, can be used for goods and services in a limited network for merchants, etc.</p> 5AML — Fifth Anti-money Laundering Directive <p>The Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, or 5AMLD, has expanded the anti-money laundering obligations beyond what its predecessor (4AMLD)&nbsp;did.</p><p>Before 5AMLD, there was no set of AML and CFT-related requirements for crypto companies operating in the European Union or serving residents of its member states, but that changed with its introduction in 2018. However, the member states were given sufficient time to implement the directive, with January 2020 being the deadline.</p><p>Since then, all crypto businesses within the European Union, including those operating a crypto exchange, custodian e-wallets, or more, must register with the local regulatory authority where they operate or plan to offer their services. They must also monitor and report all suspicious transactions to relevant authorities.</p> Shocking U-Turn: EU Parliament Reintroduces Crypto Payment Restrictions <p>The European Parliament has reached a consensus on the final text of an anti-money laundering bill set for a vote on March 28, which, to much dismay of the broader crypto community, brings back restrictions on crypto payments involving self-hosted wallets.</p><p>The updated bill caps commercial cash transactions at €7,000 and imposes a €1,000 limit for crypto transactions involving self-hosted wallets, with the cap applying only if the customer or beneficial owner cannot be identified.</p><p>MEPs have further tasked the European Commission with evaluating the commercial payment rule in three years to ensure alignment with the European Union’s digital identity framework and the requirements of the newly proposed Anti-Money Laundering Authority.</p> The Overall Ramifications: What it Was &amp; What it Could&nbsp;Become? <p>Before MiCA was conceived, crypto-assets were not imagined as part of monolithic European legislation.</p><p>Establishing a harmonized regulation across the continent would help market players diversify their businesses through definitive crypto asset strategies. It will offer healthy protection mechanisms to non-regulated crypto assets, related service providers, and consumers. However, the web of compliance requisites will become more intricate for the service providers.</p><p>The businesses would have to improve their operational efficiency to keep the public informed about their pricing process and trading volumes in real time and settle all trades within the same day trades have happened. Exchanges would have to keep their funds separate from that of their&nbsp;clients.</p><p>The registration might become yet more complicated if the MiCA authorities ask crypto businesses to get their businesses insured. It could mean enhanced levels of operational hassle and increased involvement of traditional finance organizations like banks and insurance agencies.</p><p>To conclude, any regulatory framework in any industry may end up doing two things. First, it could make the industry more efficient and fair by enabling a variety of participants to expand and diversify in an organized manner.</p><p>On the other hand, it may disrupt the existing equilibrium and pace of growth. It may turn the process unnecessarily complicated and inherently inefficient. However, only time will tell how the European crypto regulations will steer the&nbsp;market.</p> Crypto Mindfulness <p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  It is already known how centralized systems work: the majority must follow the rules and authority of the few in order to benefit from necessary tools, applications, and websites.  

Even more, centralized systems do not offer us the means or opportunity to voice our concerns and needs as members of the system.

DAOs, on the other hand, are shaped by the voices of its active members who work togeth

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are becoming more and more popular due to the many benefits they offer. These include creating a safe environment for individuals to interact with one another. as well as equality and transparency among its members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the potential of DAOs, however, many struggle with a lack of user participation. Without active engagement from its members, decision-making and growth can be delayed, and the DAO's decentralized structure can decline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> is addressing this issue by developing an engagement system that aims to keep its members active and involved. By motivating participants to regularly engage within the DAO, the DAO itself will become more active and successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the SelfKey DAO engagement system, its benefits, and how members can participate in the DAO in order to mint tokens.</p>
 Highlights 
 
 The SelfKey DAO Incentive System 
 How the SelfKey DAO Incentive System Works 
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
 The Benefits and Uses of Work Tokens 
 Conclusions 
 
 The SelfKey DAO Incentive System 
 Introduction 
<p>The SelfKey DAO’s Incentive System is an innovation that offers a wide variety of benefits to its valued members. One of the main advantages of the SelfKey DAO Incentive System is that active members can mint tokens for their contributions and involvement within the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These tokens can be used to access various services within the SelfKey ecosystem, such as buying NFT packs to customize <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211">NFTs</a>, as well as buying SelfKey ENS domains.&nbsp;</p>
 How the SelfKey DAO Incentive System Works 
 A brief definition 
<p>The SelfKey DAO Incentive System is designed to facilitate users to mint work tokens for their active participation and positive behavior in the DAO. Participants who contribute valuable resources, such as time, skills, or suggestions, are recognized accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO offers numerous benefits to its users, including a secure and decentralized platform for managing digital identities. Even more, participants are incentivized to work together towards common goals. This builds a strong sense of community and collaboration within the DAO.</p>
 The SelfKey DAO Incentive System and Individuals 
<p>Tokens minted within the SelfKey DAO Incentive System represent a powerful tool for promoting growth and adoption of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DAO offers active members the possibility to mint tokens and have their contributions recognized. This helps the organization attract and retain high-quality talent and resources. In turn, it can enhance the quality and effectiveness of the services offered by the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the SelfKey DAO Incentive System is a powerful asset for creating a strong, joint community of participants who are committed to the success of the DAO. The long-term goal of the DAO is to be able to build a space for innovation and creativity, while also driving growth and adoption of its services.</p>
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>To fully benefit from the platform's incentive system, users need to participate actively in the DAO's general governance and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are specific tasks which participants of a DAO can do in order to mint work tokens and help maintain the DAO.</p>
 How to keep the SelfKey DAO active and mint work tokens 
<p>Member engagement is a key necessity in order to benefit from an active platform. Aside from contributing to the overall well functioning of the SelfKey DAO, active members have the opportunity to mint work tokens by completing certain tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, there are some essential activities that participants can perform to help SelfKey DAO in achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
 
 Invite Friends. 
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system. 
 Engage with the official Selfkey SM posts. 
 Be active in the official discord channel. 
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system. 
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants. 
 Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions. 
 
 Invite Friends 
<p>Inviting friends to join SelfKey DAO can increase the membership and participation of the platform. This could offer more resources for the system, as friends could potentially bring in new skills and connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If more people join SelfKey DAO, the network security of the SelfKey ecosystem can grow. The benefit of this is that it can potentially result in greater visibility, influence, and impact within the larger community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, a constant flow of new participants to the DAO can be a valuable strategy for expanding and strengthening it. It can increase its resources and capabilities, and build a more powerful sense of community and collaboration among its members.</p>
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system 
<p>It’s highly important for members to actively post SM messages generated by the system in order to boost the visibility of SelfKey DAO and its activities. This way, participants can help expand the SelfKey network by bringing awareness to the platform and its goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using system-generated Social Media messages, SelfKey DAO can make sure that its content is consistent and on-brand. This can help create credibility and build trust among the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another benefit of SM messages generated by the system is that it can be more efficient than manually creating and posting each message. This can save time and resources, allowing members of the DAO to focus on other important activities.</p>
 Engage with official Selfkey SM posts 
<p>Engaging with official SelfKey SM posts could help members stay informed with the latest official news and connect with others participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows members to make informed decisions, increase their visibility, and potentially attract new business opportunities. Participants can also give constructive feedback, which can lead to platform upgrades that could benefit the entire community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, by engaging with official SelfKey SM posts, active members can gain access to exclusive content or benefits that are not available anywhere else.</p>
 Be active in the official Discord channel 
<p>The SelfKey Discord channel is a community hub where users can connect with other members of the SelfKey community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants who stay active in the channel can engage with other individuals, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. Even more, active members can quickly get answers to their questions and find solutions to almost any problems they may encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ft2U7DKg4X">official discord channel</a> is often the place where SelfKey DAO announces and hosts various events and activities. Therefore, keeping up with the channel and actively participating in discussions, members can stay up-to-date with important news and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By showing drive and creativity, active members can help develop new ideas and solutions that will help the DAO grow. This can be anything from suggesting new features for the DAO's platform to proposing fresh methods for community governance.</p>
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system 
<p>By certifying that members have a deep-rooted interest in keeping their own credentials safe, the overall security of the system can be enhanced. This can also minimize the risk of credentials being lost or stolen, as well as help keep participants safe from identity theft or other security breaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another advantage of staking is that it can increase the credibility of the system by motivating participants to make sure that their credentials are valid and up-to-date. This way, errors or mistakes in the data can be prevented, reducing delays or issues when using the platform.</p>
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants 
<p>One of the key benefits of offering a grant within SelfKey DAO is that members can mint tokens for their contributions to building the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helping with developer and designer tickets can improve the overall quality of the platform. By addressing technical issues and making improvements to the design, the platform can become more user-friendly, efficient, and effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can aid in attracting new users and retaining existing ones, as well as drive the growth of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way that members can contribute to the DAO is by delivering on development, design, and QA bounties based on grants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bounties encourage members to tackle specific tasks that have to do with the development, design, and testing of the DAO's software. Participants can work together or individually to deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of the DAO and its community.</p>
 The Benefits and Uses of Work Tokens 
<p>As stated previously, SelfKey DAO facilitates benefits for active members, such as being able to mint tokens. We’ve elaborated on the activities active members can perform. Now, let us focus more thoroughly on how participants can make use of the work tokens they mint.</p>
 Work tokens can be exchanged for NFT packs 
<p>SelfKey’s NFTs are called Normies, and they can be customizable to fit the user’s personal preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some advantages Normies bring to members:</p>
 
 they allow users to express their unique creativity and personality by creating one-of-a-kind digital assets.&nbsp; 
 they can increase the originality of the asset, as it becomes more exclusive and personalized.&nbsp; 
 they enable members to have greater control over their digital assets. 
 they allow members to modify or add additional content to their NFT. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT packs that members can obtain by exchanging work tokens can be used in several ways.</p>
 
 To customize Normies around a specific theme or concept, such as a particular genre or event, such as: fandoms, movies, games, music, etc. 
 To customize Normies by choosing the background, outfits, hair styles, skin color and texture, or additional details. 
 To create different levels of rarity among the NFTs contained within them. For example, a pack could contain one or more ultra-rare, limited-edition wearables. 
 To build a collection of related or complementary NFTs. This can motivate members to collect multiple packs in order to complete the entire set. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, SelfKey’s NFT packs can include unlockable content, such as additional media or exclusive access to events.</p>
 Work tokens can be used to participate in DAO Governance 
<p>DAO governance is ideal for members because:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Decisions are made through a decentralized voting system that takes every participant’s opinion into consideration. 
 It represents a more fair and open method of organization that aims to benefit every active member. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>Centralized systems are based on pyramid structures, where the majority have to follow the rules and authority of the few. Typically, in this kind of structure, individuals have no way of voicing their needs, let alone have them met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs, on the other hand, can be shaped by the participants’ direct involvement. This is why it is important to keep DAOs active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO is working on developing the most efficient incentive system to make sure that active members are constantly involved with the development of the DAO. It’s likely to become the ideal space in which individuals can safely engage and have their needs heard and met.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>We hear it all the time: “Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity”. Unfortunately, this contemptuous characterization of human nature is deeply ingrained in the industry. While human error is still the driving force behind a number of security breaches and incidents, the modern cybersecurity landscape has become too broad and sophisticated to be managed by individuals alone. By modernizing and implementing the right tools, however, we may be able to reduce and improve the impact of the human factor on cybersecurity.</p>
 The Alternative? Passwordless Authentication 
<p>Security could be dramatically enhanced by modernizing authentication systems and introducing new technologies. It is much easier to blame the end user for a security breach than to address the larger and more challenging issue of getting rid of legacy systems. Luckily, the continued momentum of passwordless authentication technologies is one of the key trends in the identity and access management (IAM) space.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, there has been a significant uptake in the adoption of passwordless authentication solutions in both enterprise and consumer use cases. Passwordless is becoming the new normal, and the use of passwords is becoming less and less relevant. For enterprises, this means a new opportunity to build new authentication architectures and leverage the potential of standards such as FIDO.</p>
 FIDO as a driving force 
<p>The non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. As a result, the FIDO Alliance has introduced a set of open, scalable and interoperable specifications to reduce the reliance on passwords.FIDO2 is the latest specification released by the Alliance, offering a more flexible approach that supports a range of authentication factors, including biometrics, security keys and other devices. WebAuthn is a web standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that implements the FIDO2 specifications for web applications.</p>
<p>The role of FIDO2 and WebAuthn in passwordless authentication is to provide a secure, standardized, and user-friendly approach to authentication on the web that eliminates the reliance on passwords and improves user experience at the same time. FIDO2 and WebAuthn use public key cryptography and strong authentication to enable passwordless authentication while reducing the risk of password-related attacks, such as phishing and credential stuffing.</p>
<p>FIDO has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems. More recently, these companies have announced plans to support passkeys on their platforms. For example, Apple's latest update, iOS 16 for iPhones as well as macOS Ventura for Macs, now supports passkeys, while Google introduced support for passkeys in December 2022.</p>
 The adoption of passkeys 
<p>In a nutshell, a passkey is a type of authenticator that works by generating a unique cryptographic key pair. The private key is securely stored on the user's device (such as a USB key or mobile phone), while the public key is shared with the FIDO server. During authentication, the passkey generates a digital signature using the private key and sends it to the server along with the user's credentials. The server then verifies the signature using the public key, and if the signature is valid, the user is granted access.</p>
<p>The use of passkeys by these companies is likely to contribute to the widespread adoption of a passwordless future. As a consequence, the transition to phishing-resistant forms of authentication will continue to gain momentum. Companies need to evaluate the assurance level they seek for their relying applications and, if appropriate, leverage the benefits of passwordless technology. Nevertheless, by eliminating passwords and providing users with a more modern authentication system, organizations can strengthen security and lessen the impact of the human factor.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>The European Union (EU) has consistently demonstrated its innovative approach to technology and data protection through the implementation of groundbreaking laws such as the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679&amp;qid=1679610648554">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0281">Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS) regulation</a>. These legal frameworks have set the bar high for data protection, privacy, and digital identity standards, establishing the EU as a global leader in these domains. As a result, many countries around the world have been inspired to follow suit, adopting similar regulations and best practices that align with the EU’s progressive stance on ensuring security, interoperability, and trust in the digital age.</p>
<p>This conversation with Viky started with a discussion around the history and evolution of eIDAS. One part of eIDAS is related to electronic identification and electronic identity, and the other is related to trust services, which include electronic signatures, timestamps, electronic seals, preservation of electronic signatures over a long period of time, and certificates for website authentication. As part of the legislative process, the European Commission conducted an assessment of the eIDAS regulation after several years of implementation to determine if any changes or adjustments were necessary. This assessment took place from the regulation’s inception in 2014 until 2020. During this period, it was observed that only 14 member states had notified electronic identification schemes in place, which means that only around 59% of citizens had access to an electronic identity mechanism. Out of these 14 electronic identity schemes, only seven were mobile. As a result, it became apparent that the regulation was not meeting the expectations and needs of citizens, who increasingly prefer to use mobile devices for accessing services and information.</p>
<p>We then shifted the conversation to talk about <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">The European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework</a> and how it’s going to be implemented in 4 pilot projects across various use cases. They are composed of representatives from different member states and the private sector. The mix of participants, including both member states and the private sector, was one of the main requirements.</p>
<p>The European Commission launched a call for applications and selected four winning consortia:</p>
 
 The first is the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium (EWC)</a>, which focuses on mobile travel credentials and organizational digital identity. It covers all European Union countries, including Ukraine, and has participants from over 60 countries in both the public and private sectors. 
 Next is the <a href="https://www.nobidconsortium.com/">NOBID Consortium</a>, which is primarily focused on payment issuance and acceptance. 
 The third consortium is <a href="https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/">Potential</a>, with various use cases such as electronic registration, account opening, electronic driving licences, and electronic prescriptions. 
 Lastly, the fourth consortium, <a href="https://dc4eu.eu/">DC4EU</a>, is focused on educational credentials and professional qualifications. 
 
<p>These consortia aim to cover the main use cases that could lead to the widespread adoption of the eID Wallet and the new European electronic identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Viky and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
 
 Understanding eIDAS 2.0: its history, lessons learned and implications. 
 How the current ecosystem of trust providers will change and adapt under new eIDAS 2.0 regulation. 
 The EUDI Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (ARF), and how it aligns with eIDAS. 
 Person Identification Data (PID) Providers, and the differences between Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers and Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Providers. 
 Exploring the 4 Large Scale Pilots, their use cases and their use of PID. 
 Some of the various associations collaborating alongside eIDAS and the large scale pilots (e.g., <a href="https://www.etsi.org/">ETSI</a>, <a href="https://cloudsignatureconsortium.org/">CSC</a>, <a href="https://inatba.org/">INATBA</a>). 
 Trust lists, trusted issuers/verifiers and governance! 
 Current and upcoming challenges and opportunities. 
 
<p>I hope you enjoy the conversation as much as I did. There is tons to learn for anyone interested in how a digital identity program start from a legal framework, and be coordinated across multiple nation states and actors.</p>

<p>One of the most critical aspects of standardizing Sign-In with Ethereum is allowing wallets to interpret messages for better UX and increased safety when users sign into apps and services. </p><p>We're now happy to announce a significant step forward in Sign-In with Ethereum adoption with a direct integration into MetaMask.</p><p>Previously, when users were prompted to sign a SIWE message, they were given a human-readable message to sign, as installed by the app-specific developers. This included things such as:</p>  The intent of the user (wanting to sign in)  Additional statements (such as agreeing to a Terms of Service), and  Other information, such as the domain where the user was and a nonce  <p>However, until SIWE adoption became more prevalent, it was challenging to include additional UI/UX enhancements within the wallet layer to create an even better user interaction for signing in. When wallets expect a standardized message format for signing, they can build much better UX to create “Sign-In” experiences more closely aligned with what we expect in traditional web applications.</p><p>Now, when an app or service follows the<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Sign-In with Ethereum standard</a>, MetaMask can parse that message and give the user a friendlier interface – prompting them to “Sign-In” rather than sign a message:</p><p>The required fields are still prominently displayed for the user, but the intent has now been clarified: this is a "Sign-In request." </p><p>The intention of the message, and the action the user is taking, are made much more evident. This is a leap forward for user safety in Web3, where users could previously be easily confused about whether they were signing into a service versus authorizing a malicious actor to transfer assets out of their account. Now, in Metamask, users can expect to see a “Sign-In” button and a user experience much more similar to what they would expect in a Web2 application. </p><p>Another prominent feature of this integration that improves user safety in Web3 is domain binding. Domain binding is present to make sure users don't become the victim of phishing attacks when sites ask users to sign in, but the message doesn’t match the website they’re actually on. If this happens, the user is prompted with a warning and they must explicitly select to move ahead, accepting the risks of a potential phishing attack. </p><p>These efforts to provide user-friendly security and safety enhancements across Web3 wallet experiences should increase the sense of confidence that users have interacting with dapps.</p><p>We look forward to working with additional wallet providers to continue offering user protections and benefits through Sign-In with Ethereum, and with developers in the space looking to integrate the standard.</p><p>For developers, we recently <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">released SSX</a> as the easiest way to get started with Sign-In with Ethereum and incorporate these newly improved signing-in experiences with MetaMask for end users. At Spruce, we will continue to make Sign-In with Ethereum as easy as possible to integrate and continue extending SIWE capabilities beyond authentication to enable users to control their identity and data across the web.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>Through this collaboration with MetaMask to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, we are happy to address some of the major concerns we repeatedly hear in Web3 - user safety and user experience - and look forward to future enhancements to come.</p>

   After a two year absence of a data privacy law framework for transferring personal data from the EU to the U.S., President Biden signed an Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (the "Order") on October 7, 2022, that will usher in a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the "Framework").

  <p>After a two year absence of a data privacy law framework for transferring personal data from the EU to the U.S., President Biden signed an <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/10/statement-us-secretary-commerce-gina-raimondo-enhancing-safeguards">Executive Order</a> on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (the "Order") on October 7, 2022, that will usher in a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (the "Framework").</p>

<p>The Framework will regulate how US intelligence agencies may collect data from EU citizens and create new mechanisms to address EU citizens' claims that personal information was collected or handled in violation of the Framework.</p>

<p>The Framework, which was first announced as an agreement in principle by Biden and European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen in March 2022, is intended to re-establish the legal regime governing trans-Atlantic data flows, after the previous regime, the Privacy Shield, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") ruling in the Schrems II case.</p>

<p>Although the Executive Order authorises implementation measures for this new Framework under U.S. law, ultimately, the European Commission will now need to issue an adequacy opinion to approve the Framework.</p>

<p>The Framework is anticipated to be formally adopted by the EU in the summer. However, it's likely to be made on the condition that the US Government implements all the new requirements, which may take a while.</p>

<p>Under the first step of that approval process, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has agreed the measures introduced by the Executive Order achieve two things:</p>

  It goes a long way towards addressing the GDPR compliance issues highlighted in the Schrems ruling with respect to the US Government's bulk collection of EU originating personal data. 
	 It forms the bedrock of the new data protection framework that will eventually deem the US an 'adequate' country from an EU data protection law perspective. 
 <p>The EDPB, which brings together the data protection supervisory authorities of all EU member states, flagged specific concerns that will need to be resolved prior to the EU's formal adoption of the Framework including (but not limited to):</p>

  Improving the data protection principles to be observed by US data importers in relation to handling EU originating personal data (currently a copy and paste of the principles of the previously invalidated Privacy Shield framework). 
	 Evaluating the US Government's response to redress requests made by EU citizens, in relation to bulk data collection. 
  Conclusion 

<p>The new Framework will fill a significant gap and promises to provide businesses greater legal certainty in transferring EU personal data to the U.S. — for example, to cloud services providers. Moreover, approval by the European Commission will signal that U.S. privacy law protections are sufficient for transferring personal data to the U.S.</p>

<p>In the meantime ForgeRock will continue to help customers with managing their GDPR compliance obligations by offering EU standard contractual clauses backed up by Transfer Impact Assessments.</p>

<p>Learn how Fission models its work and communication style on the distributed systems we help build and support.</p> The Case for Fewer Meetings <p><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf">A study</a> by the University of California, Irvine and Humboldt University on the cost of interrupted work found that while work was still complete and accurate after the person was interrupted, that person demonstrated increased levels of stress and speed while trying to get their work done.</p><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296322000364?via%3Dihub">in an extended analysis</a> of 10 years of published research on flexible work practices, it was determined that employee productivity increased by over 70% when meetings were reduced by 40%.</p><p>So if stress levels decrease and productivity increases when there are fewer meetings, and it's already a big challenge for a distributed company to find a time when everyone can meet for a weekly all-hands meeting, why not look at a different approach? </p> FissionCast <p>Several months ago we did just that. Our VP of Engineering keeps track of any team news or project updates being shared on Discord and community calls, and at the end of the week he records a podcast. He reports on each working group's progress, which is helpful if you haven't had an opportunity to follow what your co-workers are working on. </p><p>Team members are also encouraged to share their own updates using Loom recordings. Looms allow you to record your screen, so if you wanted to walk team members through a process or demo a project, you can do that while making it more personable and engaging. You can also do a traditional recording and share an update that way. We record our Looms and ping our VP of Engineering in Discord when we're done, and then he compiles them together and peppers them throughout the podcast.</p><p>FissionCasts are shared on Friday afternoons, so folks can watch them on Friday or Monday at their convenience. One of the strengths of FissionCast is not just letting people catch up when it works for them, but also how. Some watch the video at 2x speed, and others will skim the transcription and notes. It keeps us connected without having to block everyone's calendars and coordinate across timezones!</p><p>FissionCasts are also shared in an internal post on our discussion forum, Discourse, which is helpful for adding relevant links and continuing the conversation asynchronously via comments.

				 <p><a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/digital-wallets-are-the-future-of-identification/">Digital wallets are a vital part of the digital technology revolution</a>. To gain clarity in this space, it’s essential to understand the digital wallet industry and ecosystem. In this post, we’ll discuss the definition of digital wallets, how they differ from digital identity wallets, and their relationship with digital technology.</p>
 Digital Technology is Changing the Way We Manage Finances 
<p>Digital wallets (think of an app) have gained widespread popularity recently. However, there has been some confusion about the distinction between digital wallets and digital identity wallets. At their core, both types of wallets utilize digital technology to store and manage information. Digital wallets, as the name suggests, are primarily designed to store and manage payment information such as credit and debit card details.</p>
 Managing Personal Identity Information in the Age of Digital Technology 
<p>On the other hand, digital identity wallets are designed to store and manage personal identity information such as government-issued ID cards, passports, and other forms of identification. However, separating the two types of wallets into distinct categories isn’t necessarily helpful; the two are increasingly becoming intertwined as digital technology evolves.</p>
 The Intersection of Digital Wallets and Digital Identity Wallets 
<p>For instance, many <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/03/09/coming-soon-to-a-digital-wallet-near-you-biometrics/">digital wallets now incorporate identity verification features such as biometric authentication</a> to enhance security and prevent fraud. Conversely, many digital identity wallets combine payment features to enable users to make secure and convenient online purchases.</p>
 The Role of Digital Technology in Integrating Financial and Identity Management 
<p>Digital technology has opened up new possibilities for integrating financial and identity management. For instance, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/digital-id-privacy/">blockchain technology is being explored to create secure and decentralized digital identity systems</a> that could enable more secure and streamlined financial transactions.</p>
 Ensuring Security and Privacy in the Digital Wallet Ecosystem with Digital Technology 
<p>As such, it is more beneficial to view digital wallets as a broad category of tools that users can use to store and manage various information, including financial and personal identity information. The key is to ensure that any digital wallet a user chooses is secure, reliable, and trustworthy. Users should also be aware of the privacy implications of using digital wallets and <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/protect-your-personal-information-and-data">take steps to protect their personal information</a> accordingly.</p>
 The Future of Digital Wallets: Innovations in Digital Technology 
<p>As digital technology progresses, the line between digital wallets and digital identity wallets is becoming increasingly difficult to draw. It’s more helpful to consider them two sides of the same coin; when used in tandem, they can create a secure, seamless customer journey.&nbsp; The advancements in digital technology have made a unique opportunity for financial and identity management to evolve, leading to exciting prospects for the future. We can expect to see more exciting developments.</p>

							<p>One of the biggest news stories in tech in 2023 concerns ID verification. This is a feature that social media giants like Twitter and Meta have rolled out recently, with the hopes of gaining benefits like:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  User verification  <p>&nbsp;</p>  Authenticity within their platform  <p>&nbsp;</p>  New revenue streams (since both online ID verification programs require users to pay a recurring fee)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, these emerging programs aren’t the only way to ensure a more authentic and secure online social media presence. A free online identity verification service like <a href="https://dentity.com/">Dentity</a> provides authentication across multiple online platforms including social media, marketplaces, and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Opting for a more secure online presence is just one reason to explore these ID verification programs. Today we’ll help by comparing the two popular ID verification services – Twitter Blue and Meta Verified – then show you how using Dentity helps you better protect your privacy and provides control of your online identity.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Why are Social Media Platforms Opting for ID Verification?  		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>There are many reasons why social media platforms have started offering more in-depth ID verification for their users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>User Safety</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For years, experts have insisted that ID verification online helps keep social media users safer. Fraud is rampant across social media, with <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/01/social-media-gold-mine-scammers-2021">scams</a> involving user impersonation becoming increasingly popular.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It takes almost no work for a malicious user to impersonate another person (either real or fake). Then, they can use that profile to perpetrate romance scams, cryptocurrency scams, and almost any other illegal or dangerous act imaginable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Platform Authenticity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing user security isn’t the only reason why social media platforms are opting for ID verification. Platform authenticity has become critical since advertiser dollars make up such a large percentage of a social media company’s revenue stream. After Elon Musk’s failed rollout of the initial version of Twitter Blue, advertising spend on the platform <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ad-spending-twitter-falls-by-over-70-dec-data-2023-01-25/">dropped by 71%.</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Revenue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to protecting users and ensuring increased platform authenticity, ID verification has the potential to become a new and lucrative revenue stream for social media companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, in order for Twitter to replace its advertising revenue, it would need more than <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/11/14/twitter-would-need-64-million-subscribers-to-replace-existing-revenue-and-cover-existing-losses/?sh=736e443ba95f">60 million subscribers</a> to its Twitter Blue program, making it difficult to achieve without aggressive marketing. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>Comparing Online ID Verification in 2023</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With more than <a href="https://datareportal.com/social-media-users">137 million people</a> joining social media last year alone, using some form of user verification is essential. However, each social media platform is approaching it in its own way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s how their programs stack up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter Blue</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a rocky launch of <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts">Twitter Blue</a>, platform officials announced that they were restarting the program in December 2022. Advertised as a “premium subscription service”, Twitter Blue offers users a variety of enhanced platform features for an annual fee of $114.99 for iOS users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To use Twitter Blue, users must sign up, pay the fee, then be verified via a confirmed phone number. After that, a blue checkmark is applied to their account as a sign that they have been verified.&nbsp; No government-issued ID is required to get a blue check mark on Twitter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any changes to the user’s name, handle, or profile photo will result in the temporary loss of the blue checkmark until the phone number has been reconfirmed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meta Verified</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/19/meta-is-rolling-out-a-new-paid-verification-subscription-service-for-instagram-and-facebook-users.html">Meta Verified</a> was rolled out as a subscription service starting in February 2023. The service costs $179.99 annually on iOS and offers users the chance to submit a government-issued photo ID to Meta in exchange for a blue verification badge on Facebook and Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While this service does offer the benefit of allowing users to prove that they are who they say they are, its cost is not insignificant. This means that many people will simply choose not to enroll. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/biggest-benefits-risks-in-meta-twitter-verification-subscriptions.html">some cybersecurity experts</a> are worried that cybercriminals will still be able to impersonate users, adding more credibility to these authenticated accounts that may make an unsuspecting victim more likely to trust them and put themselves at risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dentity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, ID verification is now available online in a format that can be used across social media, virtual marketplaces, dating apps, and more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While you will have to pay nearly $295 annually to be verified on both Twitter and Meta, Dentity is an entirely free online identity verification service designed to keep people safe online.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through our secure process, users can easily prove their identity using an ID, then share their unique online ID verification with anyone who requests it. This means that it’s easy to prove that you are who you say you are when you’re meeting someone for a first date, buying something online, or even just getting to know a new friend digitally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once your identity is verified, the information stays in your digital wallet – no more sharing your ID with a company only to find it vulnerable following a hack or data breach.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Why Use Dentity? 		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>So, why use Dentity? Dentity’s easy-to-use and <a href="https://blog.dentity.com/why-peer-to-peer-verified-identity-matters/">secure authentication system</a> is just one reason why so many people are choosing this form of online ID verification.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dentity is also: &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Completely free vs. nearly $300 annually for both Twitter and Meta  Accessible across multiple platforms, including Twitter and Meta  Safe and secure, making your information completely private  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>After you get verified on Dentity, you can access a profile containing your authenticated information. From there, you can send this information to whomever you want and request details from others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Going on a first date? You can send your match your name and phone number, so they know you are who you say you are. Hiring someone off Facebook or Craigslist? Use Dentity to ensure they are a real person.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With Dentity, there’s no need to pay for multiple verification services across different social media platforms. There’s just one secure service that will never lose your data or charge you for the privilege of proving your identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://app.dentity.com/sign-up">Try it for yourself today</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Jason Garneau</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-indicio-networks/">Last month,</a> Lynn Bendixen and James Schulte took a deep dive into Indicio’s three networks (DemoNet, TestNet, and MainNet), discussing how these Hyperledger Indy-based blockchain networks provide support for decentralized identity ecosystems. Each of these networks are composed of nodes, each of which contain a copy of the blockchain ledger that is used to verify decentralized identity credentials. Each network node is created and maintained by an individual or (as is more typical) a company or organization, and until now, spinning up and maintaining a node required them to build a server from scratch and host it on their own hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now have a simpler solution, one that takes the technical challenges out of creating and maintaining a Hyperledger Indy network node—or an entire network of nodes. It’s called Indicio NoDe (Node on Demand), and it’s available through Google Cloud Marketplace.</p>
<p>With Indicio NoDe, anyone can easily participate in a decentralized identity network — or build their own network — using Indicio’s pre-built, turn-key solution and be up and running within minutes. It’s an effortless way to create the infrastructure for digital transformation.</p>
<p>Indicio NoDe eliminates the need to build a network node from scratch, which requires dedicated server hardware and specialized technical knowledge. By acquiring their network node from the Google Cloud Marketplace, companies save significant time and resources compared to building their own solution. They can also bypass the entire product development cycle and focus their time and energy on integrating the solution into their existing systems. Furthermore, companies can pay for NoDe in conjunction with their current Google Cloud services, creating additional cost savings.&nbsp;</p>

  The EU Parliament will cast its final vote on the MiCA legislation on April 19,&nbsp;2023.  If approved, MiCA regulation will establish a licensing regime for crypto across the EU and introduce reserve requirements for stablecoins.  The European Banking Authority (EBA) is hiring crypto-skilled staff to prepare for its duties under&nbsp;MiCA.  <p>The European Union is set to formalize the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) to establish a licensing regime for cryptocurrencies across the bloc. The MiCA debate will take place on April 18 in the European Parliament, with a final vote expected the following day.</p><p>The MiCA legislation has received widespread support, with members of the Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voting 28–1 in favor of the law in October last&nbsp;year.</p> Transfer of Crypto&nbsp;Funds <p>Alongside MiCA, the European Parliament will also discuss the Transfer of Funds regulation, which aligns with <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">FATF Travel Rule requirements</a>. This regulation was provisionally agreed upon in June 2022, and its final approval is expected shortly after&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>If the EU implements the Transfer of Funds regulation, it will require Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to verify their users’ identities and exchange their data with counterparty VASPs during crypto transactions.</p><p>VASPs will have three options to comply with this&nbsp;mandate:</p><p>(i) Obtain and exchange user data manually with their counterparty VASPs.</p><p>(ii) Opt for an automated Travel Rule Solution that stores their user data on third-party or their own&nbsp;servers.</p><p>(iii) Choose an automated Travel Rule Solution that enables VASPs to exchange user data in a Peer-to-Peer exchange&nbsp;mode.</p><p>The first two cases will impact the user experience and privacy, making users leave the platform altogether in search of a VASP that cares about them. So, what should VASPs&nbsp;do?</p><p>Of course, choose a Travel Rule Solution of the third kind, as it can help them comply with FATF requirements while preserving user privacy. We have an ideal solution to suggest — Shyft Veriscope. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-the-critical-infrastructure-underpinning-fatf-travel-rule">Click here</a> to learn about&nbsp;it.</p> What if MiCA is Approved? <p>If approved, crypto companies will have to mandatorily meet governance and consumer-protection norms, as prescribed under MiCA. On a positive note for VASPs, the MiCA legislation is expected to take effect one to three years after its approval, giving them some time to&nbsp;prepare.</p><p>EU legislators believe introducing a cryptocurrency licensing regime is a significant step forward for the EU. It will enable them to regulate the rapidly evolving crypto market while ensuring consumer protection and market stability.</p><p>In this challenging regulatory climate, Shyft Network has made protecting the user experience and privacy its core objective and urges regulators and industry stakeholders to work towards regulations that act in the users’ interest.</p> Working on the Successful Implementation of&nbsp;MiCA <p>The European Banking Authority (EBA) is also ramping up preparations for the forthcoming MiCA regulation by hiring staff with expertise in crypto.

<p>Today in this edition of Unexpected Google admins, I’d like to introduce Tom Daly. He started his career in technology as the AV guy in his high school where his favorite job was setting up overhead projection machines. When he grew up he co-founded and was CTO of <a href="https://account.dyn.com/">Dyn</a>, an internet performance management and web application security company. It was purchased by Oracle in 2016.</p>

<p>I met Tom at Fastly where he had built their network. I soon learned that he is a networking and infrastructure wizard - who has a brain that is equal parts technologist and business savant. He knows better than anyone about how internet plumbing works and what it takes to keep it functioning. </p>

<p>After leaving Fastly, he focused on his angel investments (including <a href="https://www.yeshid.com/">YeshID</a>) and most recently stepped into the CEO role and Google Administrator role at <a href="https://www.bignetwork.com/">Big Network</a>.</p>

<p>What is your role/company?</p>
<p>I'm the CEO of <a href="https://www.bignetwork.com/">,Big Network</a>. Big Network creates private and secure cloud networks that enable businesses to simply connect their public and private clouds to on-premise infrastructure, devices, and people across the globe.</p>

<p>We are 16 people. We are a remote-first employer. We have folks in New Hampshire, New York, France, Slovakia, Ukraine, and the Philippines. </p>

<p>Why/How did you get designated as the Google Administrator? How long did you hold this role?</p>
<p>We are too small to have a dedicated IT person. We are a team of technologists, yet none of us wanted to assume the role of IT. </p>

<p>My slack profile used to say “internet janitor.” If you're the CEO of a startup and nobody else wants to do the job, it’s your job. If the toilets need plunging, then I’m going to plunge the toilets. If I have to offboard some users from Google, I’m going to do it. That’s how it works.</p>

<p>I have delegated more of the operational role of IT to our COO. But in terms of policy design, implementation, and security, I still play a foundational role.</p>

<p>What is the strangest thing you encountered using Google Workspace?</p>
<p>Google is not prescriptive about how to set up a workspace for your business. What you need from Google Workspace looks different depending on your business and stage of growth. The most surprising thing to me is that there isn't a playbook for best practices for each stage of your company for how to set up your security, workplace deployment, etc.</p>

<p>Google assumes everyone is a power user. Google should have a training course before they grant you super admin rights as a founder. Thanks for signing up for Google Workspace - you now have to take 4 hours of webinars on how to not suck at being a Google super admin. Instead, you have lots of dials and nobs and a manual that says “good luck.” </p>

<p>Any funny mishaps you want to share?</p>
<p>No, mostly annoying. </p>
<p>[Editor note: This question will be changed into the future to say “Any annoying mishaps you want to share.]</p>

<p>It’s probably the cynical network engineer coming out in me. Networking used to be the major approach for security for the company and employee base. Which I am a little familiar with. Now it is identity and access management. And it is really important for me to learn this completely new approach, but also I should probably really focus on my other 20 roles at our startup.</p>

<p>For instance, now there are so many things to consider when you're offboarding. Obviously, you don’t want them to have access to any of your systems. But what should you do with email backups? Or drive backups? Who do you delegate the calendar to? If you don't have a playbook established upfront for that, then you actually just end up creating a mess. </p>

<p>So then you find yourself in a scenario of “here’s a half a dozen suspended accounts” because you don’t want to complicate your life with delegation. And yep, I am paying a license fee for them. Suspend is Google’s way of suggesting you punt that decision-making down the road. I know the account is suspended, so I know it's secured. That can just live on as long as you want. And Google's going to keep collecting their <a href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/pricing-updates-and-more-flexible-payment-options-google-workspace">,$21.60 user/month</a> happily. But what business value is actually being derived at this point? It is just a really expensive backup solution.</p>

<p>I'm also surprised at the sheer number of service accounts that I've found inside of our organization. We have workloads running inside GCP that always take service accounts. We have some integrations with third-party apps that form our core IT for the business. And they're requiring service accounts and we just give them one. It is fast and like magic. How thoughtful were we in granting API level permissions to these service-level accounts? Not very.</p>

<p>A lot of this stuff predates me in the business. It is really easy to go through user accounts and know that a person isn’t there. But it is really hard to know if something is an enterprise accounting application and do they depend on this permission flag that might be too permissive for them to be using.</p>

<p>What is one thing you wish you had set up / known earlier in your IT career?</p>
<p>When I was at Fastly, HR knew me as Thomas Daly. And IT knew me as Tom Daly. And the two systems just constantly fought against each other because no one knew which was the source of truth. </p>

<p>So my advice when you start a company: immediately integrate your IT system with your HRIS system. Your life gets better the moment you do. </p>

<p>Which parts of Google Workspace did your org outgrow first?</p>
<p>We are a zoom shop for video conferencing. And slack for chat and chatops standpoint. We just started with them because we were comfortable with them and also because Google Meet and Spaces were just not where they needed to be. </p>

<p>Google Workspace is mainly used for Identity, email, drive, sheets, docs, and slides.</p>

<p>Did you ever find active accounts for users that did not exist or had left the company?</p>
<p>Yep, absolutely. Which relates to the topic of hygiene.</p>

<p>In the early startup days, you pull your friends in to help. There were a couple of folks that we gave a company email to so they could communicate to the world as Big Network. </p>

<p>As we've formalized the business operations, employee agreements, and consultant agreements, we’ve realized that Big Network “friends” either need to have a formalized relationship with us or be booted off our network. We still love them. But when you realize they haven’t looked at their account since 2021, you have an open connection into your business waiting to be exploited.</p>

<p>What is your advice for founders who find themselves with the Google Super Admin title?</p>
<p>I think the big thing that founders need to understand is that Google is very unopinionated in how you should do things.</p>

<p>You have to be super thoughtful upfront about what type of access you are giving applications. All of these SaaS apps you use have a similar goal which is to get on a monthly subscription and to retain that money. So the easier they make it for you to click a button and integrate &amp; authenticate between applications the less likely you will remove their application. So the higher likelihood you will keep paying your bill. </p>

<p>You end up building this IT house of cards. You get business with your business and have more customers and more employees. And surprise, you are human, and you are going to forget that this little building block of an application over there. Why did you give it permission to Google Workspace or another application?</p>

<p>You have to be thoughtful about how you are constructing your business operations IT stack. I mean, I still have Google Admin anxiety about our stack. Like “I’m going to click this button over here…what’s going to go wrong?”</p>

<p>What advice would you give from a security perspective?</p>
<p>First, two-factor authentication for everything. It is non-negotiable. Standardize on an authenticator with your users like Duo, Google Authenticator, Authy. It is also helpful to make sure your OTP can be accessed from multiple devices, so you need a plan for a missing cell phone.</p>

<p>Second, and this is a bit outside Google Workspace, figure out machine secrets management. You have to be thoughtful about how you're going store non-human, machine-readable secrets that your engineers and operations staff will need. That’s a whole different ball of wax, baling wire, and duct tape, and probably a different blog post.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p> A New Pamocracy is Growing Inside Your Organization 
<p>When you were not looking, the number of privileged identities you manage went from thousands to millions </p>
<p>OK everybody is doing it right now, so I asked the analyst’s new best friend, Chat GPT, to define Privileged Access Management. Here is what it said: “Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a critical security discipline that provides a framework to manage and monitor privileged access to sensitive systems and data. PAM solutions aim to prevent unauthorized access, reduce the risk of cyberattacks, and ensure compliance with industry regulations.” Well, you can’t argue with that, I could have written that myself – in fact I’m sure I have!</p>
<p>But as anyone put in charge of managing identity and privileged use activity knows, the picture is a little fuzzier in real life. As my <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuppingercole.com%2Fresearch%2Flc81111%2Fprivileged-access-management&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C26333608ee9043c3f5fc08db2705ced8%7C898d3826262f46f0be34f5de261bc54a%7C1%7C0%7C638146678113418628%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=53wedgl4WxkPXnp9UMZR9cbt01C52FkphJRkuDGVz80%3D&amp;reserved=0">Leadership Compass PAM 2023</a> shows, there is a lot going on in the market which makes choosing and using PAM to achieve anything close to ChatGPT abstraction. The results of Leadership Compass showed that vendors are responding in diverse ways to meet the demands of buyers, who it must be said often express confusion on the best type of product to choose.</p>
 PAM no longer just manages human identities 
<p>Those at the top end of the Leadership scale, including the traditional “big” players, are keeping up with a changing market by adding new capabilities to platforms while also simplifying purchasing, deployment, and daily usage of the software – the bit that developers sometimes forget! Clean dashboards are replacing CLIs and code - automation and wizard tools are on the increase - all good. Smaller players with the advantage of creating lean, clean cloud native software from scratch have been instrumental in driving the bigger players to make many of these usability changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest change is a recognition that PAM is now quite removed from its traditional definition and in this aspect ChatGPT gets it pretty spot on when its says "A framework to manage and monitor privileged access to sensitive systems and data". For a long time, PAM was about managing admins and superusers and controlling access to endpoints or other network devices, usually for maintenance purposes.</p>
<p>The market now knows that PAM is a technology that must manage not just human identities but those associated with machines, workloads and applications. Other areas of enterprise computing such as multi-cloud, microservices, code repositories, software defined networks and more have transformed how we see identity and what identities are allowed to do to get things done.</p>
 The laws of Pamocracy 
<p>In effect this means that millions and millions of identities require agile and fast access to something, somewhere that could be considered privileged. In my <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuppingercole.com%2Fevents%2F2023%2F04%2Fwelcome-to-pamocracy&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C26333608ee9043c3f5fc08db2705ced8%7C898d3826262f46f0be34f5de261bc54a%7C1%7C0%7C638146678113418628%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9G7PrDPe1%2Bdpz142uYEryJc0jPwhN5l44eVeaCan7M8%3D&amp;reserved=0">forthcoming webinar</a> I talk about the new <a href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kuppingercole.com%2Fevents%2F2023%2F04%2Fwelcome-to-pamocracy&amp;data=05%7C01%7C%7C26333608ee9043c3f5fc08db2705ced8%7C898d3826262f46f0be34f5de261bc54a%7C1%7C0%7C638146678113418628%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=9G7PrDPe1%2Bdpz142uYEryJc0jPwhN5l44eVeaCan7M8%3D&amp;reserved=0">Pamocracy</a> which is my term for describing this massive expansion of privileged access in a world where everything is connected to everything else. But like any other kind of power group, it must be controlled by policies, laws and regulations to make it work in the interest of the whole enterprise.</p>
<p>While this has been happening, new players and friends have entered the PAM market. Smaller vendors are realizing that there is money to be made addressing PAM niches – such as DevOps, Cloud and even database access. For them, the trends of decentralized purchasing means that some organizations are witnessing purchase of limited PAM for certain departments, even when a cross enterprise PAM platform is in place. As more PAM vendors move to SaaS, this will be more common. The irony is that managing theses decentralized PAM SaaS or on demand iterations will need controlled access too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And at the outer edges of the market, I am starting to see some aspects of Data Governnace and Privacy emerge into the PAM domain. Vendors in that space are starting to offer PAM-like capabilities. Maybe they don’t call it that – or even realize they are offering it, but it’s happening.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Aidonker Francisco and I am from Ecuador. I joined Ontology in September 2019.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I studied computer engineering and computer science at the Universidad Agraria del Ecuador. My hobbies include listening to music, coding and playing strategic video games. I also have six beautiful cats! I like to talk about everything and form strong relationships with the Ontology community.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am a moderator for the Ontology Spanish Community and I also create Spanish-language content for the Ontology blog! Day to day, I create content and infographics for the blog, translate content, and promote user engagement within the community!</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology’s community is what makes it stand out. Ontology has been in the crypto ecosystem for a long time and has the potential for huge growth in the future. Having survived in the industry for five years, despite many unfavourable industry conditions, Ontology has maintained steady growth and created a strong community, which is something other blockchain projects can learn&nbsp;from.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Educating the community. I use my knowledge of the project to teach others how Ontology can benefit them and the crypto ecosystem as a whole, as well as how identity is essential nowadays. I feel that this is a very important role and I like being able to share my love for the project with other&nbsp;users.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The huge growth and expansion of the Ontology community have been a key moment in my career. I am now part of a brilliant team and have developed a deep knowledge and enthusiasm for the Ontology&nbsp;project.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about the future developments that Ontology will see over the next few years. Ontology is evolving every day. Even after five years of constant development, Ontology is continuing to build new services for users and institutional clients, which is something to be proud&nbsp;of.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>It’s great how Ontology is bringing more important tools into the Web3 space, such as its tools to protect privacy and identity. Web3 as a whole is a space with so much potential for innovation, which can benefit everyone. Ontology’s role here is to make it as accessible as possible to everyone while protecting their privacy and freedom as they explore Web3. Ontology helps to integrate both the Web2 and Web3 worlds and eases the process of onboarding new users to&nbsp;Web3.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-moderator-aidonker-c3bbcf51d53a">Meet the Team: Community Moderator, Aidonker</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> A maturity level matrix for Identity Fabrics 
<p>The term and concept of Identity Fabrics has become popular in recent years. We observe widespread adoption of the concept as the foundation for further evolving IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) infrastructures. To provide a guideline for organizations, KuppingerCole Analysts have developed a maturity model for Identity Fabrics, as we have done for other areas of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an72527/maturity-level-matrix-for-iam">IAM</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an72555/maturity-level-matrix-for-cyber-security">cybersecurity</a>.</p>
 What makes up maturity of an Identity Fabric 
<p>When working on such maturity models, the first question to ask is what makes up maturity in that segment. For Identity Fabrics, there are five main areas:</p>
 
 Supported identities: The scope of an Identity Fabric must extend beyond the workforce. Ideally, it covers all types of identities, human and silicon ones, but at minimum all human identities, including customers and consumers. 
 Convergence: Identity Fabrics are about a holistic perspective across all functional areas for IAM. This does not mean that there should be only one tool used – it can be more, but they need to be integrated. 
 Integration: Integration is required at all levels, from the user interface to a consistent set of APIs, the Identity API layer, and to data. Again, this does not mean “only one database”, but the accessibility of data across all functional areas. 
 Flexibility: Identity Fabrics are flexible by default. This requires modern architectures, based on microservices and – unless delivered as Saas only – flexible deployment models, but again also a comprehensive set of APIs. 
 Supported systems and services: Identity Fabrics must support the hybrid reality of organizations, from modern SaaS to legacy applications. 
 
<p>With Identity Fabrics being defined as a comprehensive, modular, and flexible approach for all IAM, not every IAM infrastructure qualifies as an Identity Fabric.</p>
 A maturity model for Identity Fabrics 
<p>Based on these baseline requirements, even the level 1 (“initial”) raises the bar a bit higher than some might expect. The blueprint must cover all areas of IAM. It requires a unified UX (user experience) at least for the main capabilities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: A CMMI model targeted at Identity Fabrics. There is a minimum level of maturity required to call the IAM infrastructure an Identity Fabric.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the architecture and the interfaces must be “modern” in the sense of having flexibility in deployment and providing a consistent set of APIs, so that the the API layer can then be used by other services such as modern digital services to request and consume identity services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: The KuppingerCole Identity Fabrics model as the foundation for developing organizations’ own Identity Fabrics concepts.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there is no place for existing, traditional IAM solutions. They can form a part of the Identity Fabric and deliver services, until modernization can take place. Moving towards an Identity Fabric is a journey. Traditional IAM solutions can even be utilized for a longer period for providing connectivity to parts of the legacy IAM infrastructure.</p>
 More on this at EIC 2023 
<p>Identity Fabrics are a key topic at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity Conference 2023</a>. My colleagues Christopher Schütze, Dr. Phillip Messerschmidt, and I will run a pre-conference workshop on “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5239">Building the roadmap for your future IAM</a>”, where the concept of Identity Fabrics plays an essential role. In the Identity Fabrics track, I will give a presentation on the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5271/1">Identity Fabrics Maturity Model</a>. I’ll be around for the whole conference (no surprise…), so don’t miss the opportunity to meet &nbsp;me in Berlin.</p>

				  Simplifying the Creation of Trusted Ecosystems 
<p>The Creation of trusted ecosystems can be complex and challenging, especially in education. In our latest webinar, we introduced the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trustcontinuum/">Trust Continuum</a>™ methodology to simplify the creation of trusted ecosystems. Our approach aligns with the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/">Trust Over IP 4-Layer model</a> and has proven successful across multiple industries.</p>
 StudentReader.io’s Decentralized Education Product 
<p>The webinar featured Laura Brugioni, founder of <a href="https://studentreader.io/">StudentReader.io</a>, who discussed their decentralized education product – a course reader for <a href="https://atalaprism.io/">Atala PRISM</a> – the Foundations of Decentralized Identity. The result of the course reader emphasized the need for comprehensive training material on SSI and the endless possibilities for this technology to be used in education and across sectors.</p>
 Creation of the Right Conditions for Trusted Ecosystems to Form and Flourish 
<p>Continuum Loop is working with StudentReader.io to create the right conditions for their trusted ecosystem to form and flourish. Our Trust Continuum™ methodology provides a valuable tool for simplifying the creation of trusted ecosystems. We emphasize collaboration, adaptability, and a commitment to creating sustainable and prosperous ecosystems.</p>
 Governance Frameworks for Trusted Ecosystems 
<p>During the webinar, we highlighted the importance of simple, executable governance frameworks that can be adapted to each ecosystem’s unique needs. Our tools are all Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0), making them available for anyone to adopt and adapt.</p>
 Understanding, Exploring, Designing, Building, and Nurturing Ecosystems 
<p>We also discussed how various ecosystems could be understood, explored, designed, built, and nurtured. By leveraging the Trust Continuum™ methodology, we can create dynamic ecosystems that are flexible and adaptable to changing circumstances.</p>
 Q&amp;A Session 
<p>We were thrilled to receive so many great questions from our attendees. Unfortunately, we couldn’t address them all during the Q&amp;A period, which began at the 45-minute mark. However, we wanted to ensure we answered all questions, so we’ve provided them below.</p>
<p>Where else will you be funding scholarships?&nbsp; What places – what courses? What about other languages?</p>
<p>StudentReader.io is working to create more programs with Atala Prism (languages, etc.) and working to duplicate the pattern with other programs. We want to fund scholarships across various fields.&nbsp; By working closely with educational institutions and subject matter experts, we will identify high-impact courses that hold the potential to create meaningful change in students’ lives. We recognize the importance of linguistic diversity and are committed to expanding our offerings in multiple languages. As we grow, we plan to work with experts in different regions to create and publish course content in various languages, making education accessible to a broader audience. StudentReader.io is continually exploring strategic partnerships, such as the one with Atala Prism, to enhance our platform’s capabilities and reach.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of complicated tech here – wouldn’t it be easier to write a cheque?</p>
<p>We can ensure greater transparency and accountability in scholarship distribution by leveraging blockchain technology, allowing for more efficient funds management and increased trust among all stakeholders.</p>
<p>We appreciate the engagement and enthusiasm of our audience and look forward to future opportunities to connect and share insights on creating trusted ecosystems!</p>
 Creating Trusted Ecosystems Across Multiple Industries 
<p>Thank you to Laura for sharing more about StudentReader.io, and we encourage you to check out <a href="https://book.io/">book.io</a> for minting the NFTs – it’s coming soon! With the right conditions in place, any ecosystem can flourish, and we look forward to continuing our work in creating trusted ecosystems across multiple industries.</p>

<p>Biometrics are well-established as the leading technology for strong authentication. Many serious security systems use biometrics to verify user identity.</p>
 What Is Facial Recognition? 
<p>Facial recognition is a method of verifying a user’s identity using their facial features. It captures a picture of a person’s face, analyzes facial features, and compares them to a database of templates to verify a user’s identity.</p>
<p>Facial recognition is increasingly popular, specifically for multi-factor authentication, due to the proliferation of mobile devices and computers equipped with high-end cameras.</p>
 Is Facial Recognition Secure Compared to Other Biometrics? 
<p>Facial recognition is just one form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-id/">biometric ID</a> that comes with some specific comparisons with other established biometrics. These include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/fingerprint-verification-biometric/">Fingerprint Authenticatio</a>n: Fingerprint matching and biometrics have been around much longer than facial recognition and as such, can be more accurate because it is easier to capture and analyze the unique ridges and patterns on a person’s fingers. However, fingerprints could be more easily spoofed than facial features. 
 Iris Recognition: Iris recognition is another highly accurate form of biometric authentication based on the unique patterns in a person’s iris. Iris patterns are highly unique, potentially more so than fingerprints, and are thus very secure. However, iris recognition requires a high-quality eye image, and facial scanners are more convenient. 
 Voice Recognition: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/voice-authentication/">Voice authentication</a> is a form of biometric authentication that analyzes a person’s voice to verify their identity. Voice testing is much more convenient to implement but is much less secure due to the apparent ease of spoofing voices via modulation. 
 Behavioral Biometrics: Behavioral biometrics is a form of biometric authentication that analyzes a person’s behavior, such as their typing patterns, accent, or mouse movements, to verify their identity. Generally, behaviors are easier to fake if the person is able to understand the behavior and mimic it. 
 
 What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Facial Recognition? 
<p>Facial recognition is a secure and convenient form of authentication that has many potential benefits, regardless of how it compares to other forms of biometric authentication.</p>
<p>The benefits of using facial recognition for authentication include:</p>
 
 Added Security: Facial recognition is secure because it relies on unique physical characteristics that are difficult to spoof. This means it is much harder for an unauthorized person to access a secure area or device, especially when the hacker doesn’t have immediate access to the user’s devices. 
 Convenience: Facial recognition is a convenient form of authentication because most mobile devices, including phones, tablets, and laptops, include quality digital cameras that can capture high-definition images and videos. 
 Contactless: Facial recognition is a contactless form of authentication that works well in situations where fingerprint use isn’t desirable. 
 Scalability: Facial recognition can authenticate large groups of people quickly and efficiently, making it ideal for use in high-traffic areas like airports and stadiums. 
 
<p>Conversely, there are some challenges around facial recognition technology as well:</p>
 
 Privacy Concerns: Facial recognition technology can capture and store images of people’s faces, raising concerns about privacy and data protection. 
 False Readings: Facial recognition technology can be inaccurate, especially when lighting and cameras need to be optimized. This leads to the phenomenon of false negatives (or a complete lack of recognition despite the correct user presenting their face) or false positives (where the wrong face is read as a legitimate user). 
 Security Risks: There are also risks associated with the security of facial recognition systems. There have been some complicated proof-of-concept facial recognition spoofers, and it’s possible that hackers can steal facial information from databases. 
 
 Where Is Facial Recognition Used? 
<p>Because of its usability and security, facial recognition has been deployed in various industries. Here are some examples of how facial recognition is being used in different industries:</p>
 
 Physical Security Applications: In office buildings or data centers, facial recognition technology can be used to verify the identity of individuals through face scanners to maintain a secure perimeter around data-processing devices. 
 Banking and Finance: Face recognition can be used in banking and payment systems to verify the identity of account holders accessing accounts from mobile applications, bypassing the need for passwords. 
 Travel: Facial recognition can be used in travel applications, such as passport control and airport security. For example, some hotels use facial scanning to streamline check-in procedures–a major benefit in a world where contactless interactions are much more common. 
 Entertainment: Facial recognition can be used in entertainment applications, such as ticketing and attendance tracking. Some organizations, such as <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180712005205/en/CLEAR-Partners-Major-League-Baseball-Tickets.com-Introduce">Major League Baseball</a>, are using facial recognition to ID ticket holders at event gates so that attendance can be automated without sacrificing accuracy. 
 
 Implement Facial Recognition with Enterprise Authentication Through 1Kosmos 
<p>Facial biometrics seem like a no-brainer in terms of strong authentication. Everyone can leverage the technology, it’s easy to decentralize, and it’s very secure once everything is said and done.</p>
<p>Having facial recognition implemented without a solid security foundation is like covering mud with ice cream. To get the most out of biometrics like facial recognition, you need robust authentication and identity verification that can support users throughout your enterprise.</p>
<p>This solution is 1Kosmos. With 1Kosmos BlockID, you can leverage the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture, and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.

 Ontology and Ethereum Ecosystem Further Opened&nbsp;Up <p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology </a>is proud to announce <a href="https://goshen.network/">Goshen Network</a>, a distinguished Layer 2 (L2) project incubated by the Ontology Foundation. The collaboration between two parties promotes the interactivity between the Ontology and Ethereum ecosystem and provides a better solution for developers and users in the entire Web3&nbsp;world.</p><p>The future trend of Web3 is to provide fast, efficient, and cost-effective solutions through smooth interaction between multiple public chains. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/mainnet-3rd-anniversary-special-ontologys-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm-debut-f92111436a8e">Ontology EVM</a> has broken down the barrier between Ethereum and the Ontology chain, and Goshen aims to present an improved alternative to the expensive and slow transactions of Ethereum while maintaining high levels of security.</p><p>Goshen’s optimistic rollup has an exquisite design that is simpler and more compatible than other existing L2 projects. The project has modular development components and balances performance and security to deliver a better solution for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Its unique RISC-V fraud-proof system is used to support on-chain computing and collaborative interaction challenges, ensuring the security of both architecture and implementation, and bringing high overall security.</p><p>Goshen’s full compatibility with Ethereum is not the only reason for its convenience in deploying and reusing toolchains within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its partnership with Ontology, which shares the same values on decentralized identity and reputation, also contributes to a smoother user experience. Moreover, Goshen’s smart contracts will be fully open source for developers in April, demonstrating both Goshen and Ontology’s commitment to transparency and collaboration within the developer community. Ontology’s own open-source code also reinforces this partnership and shared&nbsp;vision.</p><p>With five years plus technology precipitation and in-depth research on L2, Ontology recognized Goshen’s L2 framework design and its technical compatibility. At the same time, Ontology’s EVM, along with its full set of <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/building-decentralized-society-own-your-value-c5be7088ac95">OWN infrastructure</a> solutions, <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a> framework, and product suites, which are compatible and interoperable with Ethereum, will bring additional value to Goshen. Additionally, Ontology has a mature global community and users in DeFi, NFT, wallets, and other areas, which helps Goshen to extend its testing to a larger&nbsp;scale.</p><p>In the future, ONT will be introduced into Goshen’s governance, running for a role in the decentralized network and getting a share of the L2 network fees. The collaboration between Ontology and Goshen is expected to offer improved outcomes for users and developers in the Web3 world, creating a better future for blockchain technology.</p><p>To celebrate the collaboration, Ontology is going to launch various campaigns together with Goshen, covering developers, users, and community members with their own special NFT incentives. Detailed rules for these campaigns will be announced soon separately</p><p>The collaboration between Ontology and Goshen is expected to bring great improvements to the Web3 world, providing better solutions for users and developers. Join our community now and let’s scale Ethereum and Ontology together!</p> About Ontology <p><a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a> is a project designed to bring trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions.

 History of Legal Entity Identifiers 
 <p>History of Legal Entity Identifiers Timeline</p> 
<p>The structure of LEI issuers and issuance starts with Local Operating Units (LOUs). LOUs then work in partnership with Registration Agents (RAs), and Validation Agents (VAs) to provide local support and issuance of LEIs.</p>

<p>To find out more about the history of LEIs, take a listen to the Let’s Talk About&nbsp;Digital Identity podcast episode, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/history-of-lei/" title="LEI and the History of Identities for Businesses">LEI and the History of Identities for Businesses</a>. Clare Rowley from the GLEIF joined this special episode to discuss LEIs from conception through to the current ecosystem.</p>
 What is an LEI? 
<p>The LEI is a 20-digit alphanumeric code, which can be broken down into three sections. Example of LEI code and breakdown below:</p>
<p></p>
 Current LEI Ecosystem 
 
 The LEI database captures the structure of an organisation, making it a one-stop-shop to understand who you’re dealing with, who owns the company, the legal entity, and where the entities are registered. 
 The LEI is the only globally standardised entity identifier. 
 There are now 294+ global compliance and regulations requiring use of an LEI, including in Australia, India and Europe. 
 LEI adoption has increased significantly over the past 6-8 months. Largely due to the use of LEIs in AML, KYC, risk management and client onboarding. 
 
 What problems have been realised so far? 
<p>Robust business credentials are a major obstacle, particularly for SMEs in developing economies, the LEI provides organisations of all sizes a way to identify themselves, in a highly assured way.</p>
<p>The use of LEIs provides transparency leading to, financial stability, reporting, easier compliance and regulations, better risk management, less friction, and better decisions.</p>
<p>There are various benefits to banks and organisations, for using LEIs, especially for onboarding and compliance services, for example improved customer experience.</p>
<p>Banks and financial institutions are increasingly getting involved with LEI issuance and management, by becoming Validation Agents.</p>
<p>The LEI has seen increased adoption outside of traditional financial markets, for example, the US Customs and Border Force trialling the LEI as a global identifier for import and export.</p>
<p>There are major cost savings bought by LEI adoption and investment. The McKinsey Company found; the use of LEIs in certain banking environments could annually save the global banking system, 2-4 billion in client onboarding.</p>
 What are we doing to push forward the LEI ecosystem? 
<p>The RapidLEI and Ceviant partnership aims to improve access to trade finance and partnerships, especially for SMEs.</p>
<p>Verifiable LEI (vLEI) is the next step of the ecosystem, creating the ability to validate individuals, organisations, and Official Organisational Roles, confirming they are able to act on behalf of the organisation.</p>
<p>The LEI is not a compliance requirement alone, rather it is a highly assured organisation identity. Providing a way for organisations to identify themselves globally, while also improving robust and streamlined processes for governance, authentication, authorisation, and delegation.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier Webinar Q&amp;A 
<p>The Q&amp;A session at the end of the webinar provided further insight, based on questions of those in attendance.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 What is the process to get an LEI?
 
 What documentation is needed? 
 The LEI application process 
 
 
 How long does LEI issuance take? 
 How do the RapidLEI APIs improve LEI issuance? 
 When an LEI is present in KYC and onboarding, is other documentation required? 
 What are the main value benefits of having an LEI?

<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole will explain why we need to get better at protecting the digital identities of human and non-human actors in an age where the majority of cyber-attacks is identity-based, and why we need AI to be successful.</p>
<p>Andrea Rossi, Senior Identity &amp; Cybersecurity expert at Sharelock will introduce the Sharelock behavioral anomaly detection platform and describe how ITDR platforms can augment IAM controls to identify potential security breaches and take preventive actions. He will also explain how a combination of ITDR and CWP can address run-time DevOps security requirements.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-centric-threats"></a>

<p>Choosing messaging apps over landlines and electric scooters instead of gas-guzzling cars, tech-savvy Gen Zers and Millennials think and experience life very differently to Gen X and Baby Boomers.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Although their priorities on money differ, there’s one common thread that pulls the generations together: each wants to be in a healthy financial position to enjoy the lifestyle they want both now and in the future. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Like generations before them, to reach their goals, digital native Millennials and Gen Zers are fast turning to budgeting apps such as <a href="https://www.quicken.com/">Quicken Inc’s</a> <a href="https://www.quicken.com/simplifi/">Simplifi</a> which helps people stay on top of all their finances in under five minutes a week.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Driven by <a href="https://www.finicity.com/manage/wealth/">consumer-permissioned data</a> from sources including Mastercard’s <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/open-banking-solutions/">open banking platform</a>, <a href="https://www.quicken.com/simplifi/">Simplifi</a> pulls together a wealth of data ranging from checking, savings, stock portfolios and retirement accounts in addition to the other account types that Simplifi integrates into a single, easily customizable dashboard.  &nbsp;</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>“Putting an emphasis on how we categorize data helps to optimize time spent by customers on tracking their finances,” said Kristen Dillard, Quicken’s vice president of product management. “Now users can see their investment balances, account types and holdings in real time, while personalizing the look, feel and function of the app.”  &nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a one-stop shop that gives users a big picture view of their finances and lets them choose how they track their money, set spending plans, pay bills, and channel money into rainy-day funds.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>“People are looking to do the same basic thing across generations. They worry: ‘How do I balance my bills with the fact I need to save for retirement, or how do I make sure I spend my money on things that really matter to me, or how do I make sure that inflation isn’t getting the best of my finances,” says Dillard.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>To tune into its mobile-first Millennial and Gen Z users, Quicken looked to the fitness and gaming industries for inspiration on how to help Simplifi customers personalize their experiences.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Younger users want ease and flexibility when it comes to budgeting. Some might like to track every dollar, similar to tracking every carb and calorie, while others might just want a view of how much cash they can spend on entertainment or travel. Simplifi lets each user decide exactly how they want to slice and dice their spending and savings each month, while push notifications warn if they max out their set budgets.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>For generations who have grown up gaming, receiving rewards for paying bills on time and reaching net worth goals makes the process fun, encouraging them to stick to their financial health plans. </p>







<p>“Everybody’s approach to personal finances is unique. You have to allow customers to see that data and manage that data in a way they want,” says Dillard.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>“Younger generations expect everything to be in an app. They’re mobile first, they expect to do everything on the go, and they expect efficiency and ease.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>With Millennials and Gen Zers less likely to take lifelong jobs with plump pension plans, Simplifi helps prepare for the future by pulling in wealth data that let users easily track multiple retirement accounts.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s definitely a different mindset between younger and older generations. In 30 years, will we see the same trend we’ve seen with older customers where they end up in a better financial place? Adopting the right financial tools can be the first step to achieving those goals. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Every app development ecosystem worth using needs its own do-everything CLI tool with a short, catchy name. Git has <code>git</code>, Node.js has <code>npm</code>, Rust has <code>cargo</code>, Vue has <code>vue</code>... And Holochain has <code>hc</code>. This article introduces you to this tool and the things you can do with it.</p> Not just for scaffolding <p>In the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/scaffolding-my-first-happ-in-10-minutes/">previous article</a> of this series, I introduced you to the <code>hc scaffold</code> command. That was a glimpse of what <code>hc</code> can do, but didn’t really explain what it was or how you might use it after you finished scaffolding.</p><p>It is of course, as you’ve just learned, Holochain’s version of that do-everything CLI tool that I claimed that every good project must have. You can use it to package/bundle, test, and run Holochain applications.</p><p>If you want to know what sorts of things it can do, you can always go <code>hc help</code> from inside the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holonix-the-beginning-of-your-happ-development-journey/">Holonix dev environment</a>. But it wouldn’t make for a very interesting or helpful article if I ended there, so I’m going to dig into all the subcommands with you. (Note: I’m going to skip <code>hc scaffold</code> because I covered that in the previous article.)</p><p>In the scaffolding article we built an entire hApp from scratch. It wasn’t complicated — it only had one DNA, one coordinator zome, and one integrity zome, and a basic web-based client UI. (if I’m already getting confusing, don’t worry; I’ll define those terms below — or you can read the article). Let’s unpack each of those components in turn by exploring the tools you’ll use to work with them.</p><p>Note: In all of these examples I’ll be working on an app called <code>gardenswap</code>. So the first thing I’m going to do is create a project directory with the same name. I’m going to diverge a bit from the usual <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/quick-start/project-structure/?ref=blog.holochain.org">project structure</a> of a scaffolded hApp, because at time of writing <code>hc</code> doesn’t let me create all the files in existing directories.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain]$ mkdir gardenswap
[holonix:~/Holochain]$ cd gardenswap</code>  <code>hc dna</code>: working with DNAs <p>If you’ve read the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Core Concepts</a>, you’ll know that zomes (short for chromosomes) are the code modules that make up a DNA, and come in two flavours: integrity zomes, which define the ‘shape’ of valid data, and coordinator zomes, which contain business logic. Zomes are just WebAssembly files, which means you can theoretically write them in any language that compiles to WebAssembly — but right now we only provide Rust-based SDKs for writing <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi?ref=blog.holochain.org">integrity</a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk?ref=blog.holochain.org">coordinator</a> zomes.</p><p>The contents of the DNA are specified in a DNA manifest file, a simple text file that <code>hc dna</code> will use to bundle everything up into a DNA file, ready to distribute.</p> <code>hc dna init</code>: creating a DNA manifest <p>But I’m getting ahead of myself here. When you’re creating a project from scratch (that is, not using <code>hc scaffold</code>), you’ll want to create an empty project directory and DNA manifest to put your zomes into. <code>hc dna init</code> will do that for you. If I enter the Holonix shell and type this command:</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc dna init dnas/gardenswap/workdir</code> <p>It will ask you for a DNA name (I used <code>gardenswap</code>) and a network seed (I just went with what it suggested), then it will stub out a <code>dna.yaml</code> file for you. Here’s what’s inside that file:</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'
name: gardenswap
integrity:
  network_seed: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  properties: null
  origin_time: 2023-03-10T17:42:14.028653Z
  zomes: []
coordinator:
  zomes: []</code> <p>It’s not a complicated file, but if you’re new to Holochain, it’s probably not obvious what these fields are for. Let’s go into each one.</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'</code> <p>This tells <code>hc dna</code> and the Holochain conductor what manifest format you’re using (currently there’s only version 1).</p> <code>name: gardenswap</code> <p>This line gives your DNA a name, which will appear in application launchers. The name can contain spaces and other characters and should be written to help a curious application participant understand what it’s doing on their machine. Here’s an example from DevHub, our official hApp package manager hApp:</p><p>Next comes the <code>integrity</code> section. Everything in this section affects the DNA hash. Any modifications to this section — either by hand-editing the manifest and rebuilding the DNA, or by specifying new values when you clone a DNA — will cause the DNA hash to change. And when that happens, any cells using that new DNA hash will enjoy their own network, separated from the original.</p> <code>integrity:
  network_seed: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
  properties: null
  origin_time: 2023-03-10T17:42:14.028653Z
  zomes: []</code> <p>The <code>network_seed</code> value is the easiest way to create a clone; it changes the DNA's hash without affecting its behaviour. Everybody who inputs the same network seed will get the same DNA hash, so they can find each other on their new little network. You can think of it as sort of a network-wide password.</p><p>It’d be fiddly for app users to edit this by hand. So you, dear developer, can specify a network seed when your front-end calls the conductor’s <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#variant.CreateCloneCell"><code>CreateCloneCell</code></a> API endpoint. You can take human input, or you can auto-generate it and find some way of sharing it among people who want to join the clone network.</p><p>The <code>properties</code> value is just a spot for you to throw some YAML data into. It’ll get reserialised into MessagePack and then made available to your application code (both zomes via <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/latest/hdi/info/fn.dna_info.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>dna_info</code></a> and clients via <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppResponse.html?ref=blog.holochain.org#variant.AppInfo"><code>AppInfo</code></a>) for deserialisation. You can use this field to store ‘environment variables’ that change a coordinator or integrity zome’s behaviour — examples are an admin’s public key for permission management, a credit limit for a community currency, or default page sizes for indexing.</p><p>The <code>origin_time</code> value is a bit obscure; it defines the ‘birthdate’ of a DNA. This is the earliest allowable timestamp for any <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">actions</a> that people write to their source chains, and it also gets used to make gossip more efficient.</p><p>Lastly, <code>zomes</code> is an array of structures that define your integrity zomes. You can’t see anything in the above stubbed file, so here’s an example from the hApp I scaffolded in the last article:</p> <code>- name: gardenswap_integrity
  hash: ~
  bundled: "../../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/gardenswap_integrity.wasm"</code> <p>The <code>name</code> field gives your integrity zome a friendly name within the manifest, so coordinator zomes can refer to it as a dependency.</p><p>The <code>hash</code> field is optional, and serves as a sanity check to make sure that the zome being referenced is actually what you expect it to be.</p><p>The <code>bundled</code> field looks straightforward — just the path of the compiled WASM file — but it’s just one of three ways of referring to the zome:</p>  <code>bundled: "&lt;path_to_wasm&gt;"</code> will embed the zome’s WASM in the DNA bundle.  <code>path: "&lt;path_to_wasm&gt;"</code> doesn’t embed the WASM, and instead expects it to be available at the specified path when the user installs the DNA.  <code>url: "&lt;url_to_wasm&gt;"</code> doesn’t embed the WASM either, downloading it from the specified URL at install time.  <p>For both <code>bundled</code> and <code>path</code> I’d recommend relative paths to make life easier for both devs and end-users.</p><p>Finally, we find the <code>coordinator</code> section.</p> <code>coordinator:
  zomes: []</code> <p>It only has one value, an array of <code>zomes</code> — just as with integrity zomes, these are structures that define your coordinator zomes. These structures have one extra field: <code>dependencies</code>, an array of integrity zomes (referenced by their <code>name</code> fields) upon which this coordinator zome depends. If the DNA has only one integrity zome, this field can be omitted.</p><p>What does a ‘dependency’ mean in this case? Simply that this coordinator zome writes and reads entries and links whose types are defined in the listed integrity zomes. Note that, internally, these names are mapped to indices, so you’ll want to specify the dependencies in the manifest in the same order they’re imported into your coordinator zome’s code.</p><p>In the manifest file:</p> <code>- name: "gardenswap_coordinator"
  bundled: "../path/to/compiled.wasm"
  dependencies:
    - name: "profiles" # dependency number 0
    - name: "posts_integrity" # dependency number 1</code> <p>In your coordinator zome’s <code>lib.rs</code> file:</p> <code>/ ... other namespaces to be imported ...
use profiles::*; // dependency number 0
use posts_integrity::*; // dependency number 1
// ... rest of file ...</code>  <code>hc dna pack</code> and <code>unpack</code>: bundling and unbundling a DNA file <p>Once you’ve compiled your zomes and written your DNA manifest, it’s time to pack it up for distribution. <code>hc dna pack dna.yaml</code> does that for you, adding the <code>.dna</code> extension the manifest’s <code>name</code> field for the final filename. If you’d rather specify a name of your own, use the <code>-o</code> argument.</p><p>And if you find a DNA that you want to inspect or modify, <code>hc dna unpack &lt;name&gt;.dna</code> will do that for you. Again, you can specify an <code>-o</code> argument; this time it lets you choose a directory to unpack the assets into. If that directory already exists and you don’t care what’s in it, you can use the <code>-f</code> flag to force overwriting.</p><p>hApps are meant to be hackable; that’s why every <code>pack</code> command has a corresponding <code>unpack</code> command. In this way a UI developer or skilled user who doesn’t want to get into Rust can take a look at what other people have built and remix it for their context.</p> <code>hc app</code>: working with hApps <p>One level broader than a DNA is a hApp. It’s just a bundle of DNAs that comprise the full back-end functionality of an application. You can treat DNAs as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices?ref=blog.holochain.org">microservices</a>, tightly-scoped modules that do one thing and do it well.</p> <code>hc app init</code>: creating a hApp manifest <p>The first step, as you may have guessed, is to stub out a hApp manifest file.</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc app init happ-workdir/</code> <p>It asks you for a name and a description, then generates the file for you in <code>happ-workdir/</code>. Let’s take a look inside the <code>happ.yaml</code> file.</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'
name: gardenswap
description: A place for sharing seeds, plants, and extra produce
roles:
- name: sample-role
  provisioning:
    strategy: create
    deferred: false
  dna:
    bundled: ./path/to/my/dnabundle.dna
    modifiers:
      network_seed: null
      properties: null
      origin_time: null
      quantum_time: null
      version: null
      clone_limit: 0</code> <p>In addition to the familiar manifest version number and name fields, there’s a description field; this lets app launchers show something human-friendly to the person installing it.</p><p>After that come the roles of each DNA in the hApp. Each role defines a thing the hApp does, then says “this is the DNA that’s going to fill that role”. You can think of them as similar to <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">interfaces</a> in TypeScript or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/trait.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">traits</a> in Rust, albeit without a formal definition of what functionality they’re expected to provide.</p><p>Each role has a name:</p> <code>roles:
- name: sample-role</code> <p>The conductor will use this field both in display and in generating cell IDs — unique identifiers for each cell, or running DNA instance paired with an agent key. Below you can see an example from a hApp that my colleague Matthias created, <a href="https://wordcondenser.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Word Condenser</a>, which helps people come up with good names for things. The hApp has two roles, <code>lobby</code> (where we come together and find out what things people are trying to name) and <code>craving</code> (where we express a need for a new word). There are three <code>craving</code> cells. Their DNA names, circled in red, are different; but their role name, circled in blue, is identical.</p><p>Next we define how the cell is going to be provisioned when someone installs the hApp.</p> <code>  provisioning:
    strategy: create
    deferred: false</code> <p>Currently the only supported strategy is <code>create</code>, and the <code>deferred</code> field is ignored. But in the future you’ll be able to specify whether the cell should be created immediately or later, cloned on installation, created only when a cell with the same DNA hash doesn’t already exist, or not provisioned at all and simply made ready for cloning.</p><p>After this you specify what DNA is going to fill the role.</p> <code>  dna:
    bundled: ./path/to/my/dnabundle.dna
    modifiers:
      network_seed: null
      properties: null
      origin_time: null
      quantum_time: null
    version: null
    clone_limit: 0</code> <p>In addition to the path to the bundled DNA that you created with <code>hc dna pack</code>, along with an opportunity to override the DNA’s default modifiers (except the list of integrity zomes). This lets you reuse other people’s DNAs in your own hApp, creating a new network space via the network seed or other modifiers.</p><p>Three fields bear further description:</p>  <code>modifiers.quantum_time</code> lets you tune the way gossiping works for historical data; large numbers are better for DHTs that won’t see much activity. It’s safe to leave this as <code>null</code>.  <code>version</code> is an optional sanity check that makes sure the DNA you’re pointing to is what you expect it to be. It can be a single DNA hash or multiple DNA hashes in cases where there are multiple compatible versions of a DNA that could work in that role, e.g. while developing the app and experiencing a lot of DNA hash changes. The DNA hash is calculated before this manifest overrides any of its modifiers.  <code>clone_limit</code> lets you put a cap on how many clones can be created from this DNA in this role. <code>0</code> prevents clones from being created. Make sure your limit is reasonable — large enough to allow real-world use cases but small enough to limit resource consumption. Every cell takes up a bit more storage, memory, network, and CPU cycles.   <code>hc app pack</code> and <code>unpack</code>: bundling and unbundling a hApp file <p>Similar to <code>hc dna</code>, once you’ve created your hApp manifest you can bundle it into a hApp file and decompose a hApp file into its manifest and DNA(s). You can also specify DNA manifest files rather than bundled DNA files and give the <code>--recursive</code> flag, which directs the tool to bundle all missing DNAs from their manifests first, then bundle them all into the hApp file. This works by looking for the referenced bundle first, and if it can’t be found, it’ll look for a <code>dna.yaml</code> manifest in the same directory as the missing bundle and bundle it into a file with the expected name.</p> <code>hc web-app</code>: working with web-based hApps <p>Once you’ve got your hApp all bundled up, you can bundle it with a web-based client for distribution to the Launcher or the future Holo hosting network. By now, I bet you’ll be able to guess what sub-commands it has — <code>init</code>, <code>pack</code>, and <code>unpack</code>. Let’s try the first one.</p> <code>hc web-app init</code>: creating a web hApp manifest <p>Once again, I’m going to put the web hApp manifest file into a work directory. The scaffolding tool puts it into the same <code>workdir/</code> directory, but as the <code>hc</code> tool currently doesn’t let me do that, I’ll give it its own:</p> <code>[holonix:~/Holochain/gardenswap]$ hc web-app init webhapp-workdir</code> <p>Again it asks for a name — and that’s it! Let’s look at the new <code>web-happ.yaml</code> manifest file.</p> <code>manifest_version: '1'
name: gardenswap
ui:
  bundled: ./path/to/my/ui.zip
happ_manifest:
  bundled: ./path/to/my/happ-bundle.happ</code> <p>The bundled UI is just a zipped-up web app with, at the very least, an <code>index.html</code> file. You can use whatever front-end framework you like, or just hack away in vanilla JavaScript. The only requirement is that you precompile everything into something a web browser can use. (We’ll get into how to make your UI talk to the hApp in a future article.)</p> <code>hc web-app pack</code> and <code>unpack</code>: bundling and decomposing a web hApp <p>These two subcommands operate on a web hApp manifest and <code>.webhapp</code> file in the same way that <code>hc app</code> operates on a hApp manifest and <code>.happ</code> file. Again, <code>hc web-app pack --recursive</code> recursively bundles a missing hApp from a manifest (and likewise any missing DNA bundles specified in the hApp manifest).</p> <code>hc launch</code>: trialling your hApp locally <p>When you move from single-instance to distributed computing — whether cloud apps or peer-to-peer apps like Holochain — you gain some things and you lose some things. Scaling problems disappear, but you have to say goodbye to the simplicity of having only one program manipulating only one data store.</p><p>Holochain has a number of tools to help you reason about and test your application. There’s a Node.js-based framework for creating automated, multiplayer scenario tests, called <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tryorama</a>, but that’s outside the scope of this article (I’ll introduce it in a future one).</p><p>For now I’ll introduce a couple subcommands for manually testing your hApps. The simplest one is <code>hc launch</code>, which creates conductor setups for one or more ‘users’ of the hApp and uses a command-line version of the Launcher to show their UIs. The nice thing about this is that you're testing with the same binary as your users will be using. And it live-reloads the UI as you're working on it!</p><p>You can launch a hApp simply by entering <code>hc launch &lt;name&gt;.webhapp</code> on the command line. These arguments give you some more control:</p>  <code>--num-sandboxes &lt;number&gt;</code> spawns multiple agents.  <code>--network-seed &lt;seed&gt;</code> passes a network seed to all cells.  <code>--holochain-path &lt;path&gt;</code> lets you specify an alternative conductor binary on your system, if you’re testing your hApp against different Holochain versions.  <code>--ui-path &lt;path&gt;</code> lets you point to a directory full of web assets if you’re launching a UI-less <code>.happ</code> file with a UI of your own.  <code>network &lt;mode&gt;</code> lets you specify the transport implementation; you can choose from the default <code>quic</code>, <code>mdns</code> for local peer discovery, or <code>mem</code> for single-machine in-memory transport. If you choose <code>quic</code>, you can specify a bootstrap service URL with the <code>-b</code> argument. Note that this is a subcommand, not a standard argument; there’s no preceding <code>--</code> , and it has to come after all arguments, including the name of your <code>.webhapp</code> file.  <p>There are other parameters for more esoteric needs; enter <code>hc launch help</code> to learn more.</p><p><code>hc launch</code> also spawns a useful tool in your browser: the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-playground?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain Playground</a>. This tool, created by Guillem Cordoba, is sort of a hApp inspector; it gives you a view into the DHT of each DNA in the hApp, as well as the source chains of each locally running cell. It’s great for both learning and debugging.</p> <code>hc sandbox</code>: creating and running conductor configurations for testing <p>If you find your needs grow beyond what <code>hc launch</code> can offer, <code>hc sandbox</code> gives you more control over how test instances are created. It generates conductor configurations (sandboxes) that are persisted to disk across test runs, along with the databases that store hApp data. This lets you create test fixtures, although it isn’t recommended to check them into source control because there are some machine-dependent paths and the databases will keep accumulating more data across runs.</p><p>Before we get into all the subcommands, some things are common to a number of them:</p>  The argument <code>--force-admin-ports &lt;port0&gt;[,&lt;port1&gt;...]</code> specifies WebSocket ports for the sandboxes’ admin APIs. If they aren’t specified, the conductors will each autoselect an unused port. (Note: the admin API lets you control the conductor itself, and is typically used only by hApp launchers, not hApp UIs. You can find documentation on all the endpoints in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.adminapi.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client library’s documentation</a> or the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rustdoc</a>).  The argument <code>--holochain-path &lt;path&gt;</code> specifies what conductor binary to use when spawning instances.  By default, sandboxes are created in your system’s temp directory. If you want a consistent place to store them (for example, if you want to check them into source control), the <code>--root &lt;dir&gt;</code> argument will work for both <code>hc sandbox create</code> and <code>hc sandbox generate</code>.  As you create or generate sandboxes, the names of the directories in which they’re stored are random, but the full paths to them are stored in an <code>.hc</code> file in the directory in which you run the commands. <code>hc run</code> will find that file and use those paths. If you’re creating sandboxes to be checked into source control, check the <code>.hc</code> file in as well; otherwise add it to your project’s source control system ignore file.   <code>hc sandbox create</code>: create empty sandboxes for later population <p>This subcommand simply creates conductor configurations without any hApp configuration in them. This can be useful if you’re building and testing something that controls a conductor — for instance, if you’re developing a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher?ref=blog.holochain.org">hApp launcher</a> or a hApp that <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/electron-holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org">embeds both the UI and the conductor in an Electron shell</a>.</p><p>In addition to the <code>--root</code> argument and <code>network</code> subcommand I described, <code>hc sandbox create</code> has a couple other arguments:</p>  <code>--num-sandboxes &lt;number&gt;</code> creates multiple sandboxes.  <code>--directories &lt;directory0&gt;[,&lt;directory1&gt;...]</code> lets you specify named sandbox directory names rather than the default randomly generated ones. Make sure that you give as many directory names as the number of sandboxes, or it’ll generate random names for the remaining ones!   <code>hc sandbox generate</code>: create hApp sandboxes <p>This subcommand goes one step further, letting you put a hApp into your generated sandboxes. It takes the path to your bundled hApp, along with <code>--root</code> and <code>network</code>, and the following arguments:</p>  <code>--app-id &lt;id&gt;</code> is just a string to identify the hApp by.  <code>--num-sandboxes</code> and <code>--directories</code> work like they do for <code>hc sandbox create</code>.  <code>--run [&lt;port0&gt;[,&lt;port1&gt;...]]</code> runs the sandboxes right away, with an optional comma-separated list of app interface ports. Make sure the number of ports matches the number of sandboxes, or the remaining sandboxes won’t be run.   <code>hc sandbox run</code>: run those sandboxes you created <p>Okay, so you’ve generated a bunch of conductor sandboxes, along with hApp, admin API, and network transport configurations, and now you want to run them together and see how they do!</p><p>You’ve got a few choices for specifying which sandboxes to run:</p>  <code>--all</code> runs all the conductor sandboxes it finds in your current directory’s <code>.hc</code> file.  <code>--last</code> runs only the last sandbox listed in <code>.hc</code>.  <code>--existing-paths &lt;path0&gt;[,&lt;path1&gt;...]</code> runs only the sandboxes in the specified paths.  A space-separated list of indices as the last argument looks in your <code>.hc</code> file and runs only the lines specified. These indices are zero-based.  <p>Finally, you can give a list of app API WebSocket ports with the <code>--ports &lt;port0&gt;[,&lt;port1&gt;...]</code> argument; a <code>0</code> for any port will cause the port number to be auto-selected. These port numbers will be saved for the next time you run the sandboxes. See the note above about making sure you specify enough ports for the number of sandboxes you want to run!</p><p>The app API, in contrast to the admin API I mentioned earlier, is how your hApp’s client (such as a UI) accesses the hApp itself. You can find more info in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.appapi.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client lib documentation</a> or the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rustdoc</a>.</p><p>Now your hApp is running a few copies of itself on your machine! The copies are already communicating with each other using the transport protocol you specified when you created the sandbox configs, and they’re listening for clients using the ports you just specified. I’ll explain how to connect your client to those ports and use the app API in a future article on the JavaScript client lib.</p> <code>hc sandbox call</code>: access a running sandbox’s admin API <p>Now that you have a bunch of sandboxed conductors running your hApp, you can also call their admin APIs using a command-line interface. All of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/blob/main/docs/client.adminapi.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">admin API endpoints</a> are there as kebab-cased subcommands, and you get to pass API call payloads as command-line arguments and see responses as JSON rather than awkward MessagePack blobs.</p><p>A description of these endpoints is beyond the scope of this article, but read the afore-linked documentation and make liberal use of <code>hc sandbox call help &lt;api-endpoint&gt;</code> to learn how to use each of them. And stay tuned for that future article on the JavaScript client lib.</p> <code>hc sandbox list</code>: list available sandboxes <p>This one’s a real simple one; it just lists the sandboxes in your current folder’s <code>.hc</code> file alongside their indices for use in <code>hc sandbox run</code>. You can get more info about the sandboxes’ conductor configs with the <code>--verbose</code> argument.</p> <code>hc sandbox clean</code>: remove sandboxes <p>This command is even simpler; it deletes the sandboxes whose paths are listed in your current folder’s <code>.hc</code> file and removes the <code>.hc</code> file.</p> That’s it! <p>These CLI dev tools are often called ‘Swiss army knives’, and this one is bristling with blades and screwdrivers and other things. It may not be clear yet how to use all of them, but I encourage you to bookmark this article — you’ll likely want to refer back to it as you start digging more deeply into hApp development.</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/02/22/the-future-of-financial-services-developing-your-open-banking-strategy/?sh=5924c9177b1b">The Future Of Financial Services: Developing Your Open Banking Strategy</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/alexanderradchenko/">Alexander Radchenko</a>, Chief Executive Officer at <a href="https://www.intellectsoft.net/">Intellectsoft</a>, writes in Forbes on why financial institutions need to pay attention to open banking. How does open banking differ from regular banking? Open banking uses technology, such as APIs, to offer nonfinancial and financial businesses a network of financial products like accounts and transaction methods. This means third-party providers are allowed access to payment products so they can design and build new user experiences. In 2018, the European Union introduced thePayment Services Directive (PSD2), legislation which “required banks to put the power back into the hands of customers by requiring banks to open up access to their data to third parties.” These third parties can provide a range of services, from managing the financial needs of small businesses to helping people budget.</p>
<p>Radchenko notes that open banking’s ability to speed up payments is critical to current businesses. Today’s customer does not have the time or patience for lengthy processes, and points to statistics such as <a href="https://www.forter.com/blog/infographic-customers-wont-tolerate-friction-filled-checkout/">“Half of Americans agree they’re less likely to buy something online if the entire checkout process takes longer than half a minute.”&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The key to open banking is to be able to create and sustain trusted connections between your bank and third parties that need to access your data. But creating these trusted relationships can be more complex than most people think. Having a third-party service directly access financial data through an API raises non-trivial privacy and security issues for consumers. This is why open banking needs verifiable credentials to flourish—as we explain in our recent article about consent-based data sharing with <a href="https://indicio.tech/create-seamless-account-access-and-consent-based-data-sharing-with-indicio-proven-finance/">Indicio Proven Finance.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/23884/driving-financial-inclusion-for-small-businesses-in-jordan-with-open-banking">Driving Financial Inclusion for Small Businesses in Jordan with Open Banking</a></p>
<p>Dylan Thiam, Head of Marketing &amp; Content at TESOBE / Open Bank Project, explains how open banking has exploded in Jordan. At the end of November the Central Bank of Jordan published legislation requiring all banks to “open Account Information and Payment Initiation services to authorized third-party providers by the end of 2023.”</p>
<p>One of open banking’s key value propositions is that it can deliver critical business services to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) which are otherwise unavailable from large banks.</p>
<p>For example, in Jordan, <a href="https://www.giz.de/en/worldwide/112806.html">only 10% of all bank and microfinance institution (MFI) loans go to MSMEs</a> due to either their lack of documentation and credit history or banks being unable&nbsp; to handle smaller loans and financing. Given that SMEs make up <a href="https://www.giz.de/de/downloads/GEMJ_EN.pdf">96% of the corporate economy</a> in Jordan, the impact of these new rules on the economy will likely be significant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-cfpb-open-banking-rule-8915627/">The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Open Banking Rule</a></p>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a US Government agency tasked with making sure consumers are treated fairly by banks, lenders, and other financial institutions. Recently, the CFPB unveiled its Open Banking Rule, which would push the financial services industry toward open banking and require financial institutions to provide six&nbsp; categories of customer information, including customer identity information (address, name, etc) and transaction information to authorized third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motivation behind the ruling is, according to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, to boost market competition in the financial sector by “empowering people to break up with banks that provide bad service.” By enabling the consumer to have control over their data, Chopra says that consumers can more easily take their business anywhere, and to smaller or newer organizations that would have otherwise been unable to compete with larger banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2023/nigeria-greenlights-open-banking-to-deepen-financial-inclusion-boost-innovation/">Nigeria Greenlights Open Banking to Deepen Financial Inclusion, Boost Innovation</a></p>
<p>Nigeria has become the first African country to adopt open banking regulations.&nbsp; While traditional banking usage is low in Nigeria, the use of mobile money — apps that allow you to send money to peers, make purchases, apply for loans and pay bills, all from money stored in a bank-style account linked to their mobile phone. — is very popular.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This raises interesting use cases, as the end users here don’t necessarily care about traditional “banking” at all, but instead seek better integration between mobile money networks and financial institutions. Every integration enables more access for everyone to their financial institutions and apps of choice, enabling more people that previously couldn’t to benefit and be a part of the local economy.</p>

 Staying compliant in an ever-changing industry requires the right partner by your side. 



<p>Compliance in the gaming industry is no easy feat, especially with an increasing and competitive illegal market. It is therefore undoubtedly one of the most crucial aspects driving the industry as a whole. With <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gaming-regulation-in-europe-an-overview/">regulatory changes in many European countries</a> tightening and requiring companies to address this issue, along with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">differing requirements across the EU and UK</a> – finding the right RegTech partner is crucial in overcoming those challenges whilst remaining commercially competitive.</p>



 First off, what is RegTech in gaming? 



<p>Regulatory technology, or RegTech, is a rapidly emerging technology that works to streamline the process of meeting regulatory requirements. Playing a heavy hand in financial services, it has become an important component of the gaming industry.</p>



<p>Here are just some of the many ways in which RegTech assists businesses in gaming:</p>



  Helps operators to automate and monitor compliance with regulatory policies more quickly and effectively than ever before  Makes it possible for operators to easily identify irregularities in licenses, as well as in countries where compliance may be difficult  Provides gambling authorities with clear information regarding auditing activities  Allows operators to keep track of changes in regulations without manual updates, giving them the ability to stay compliant and make sure their games are accessible everywhere  Increases efficiency for gaming companies  Protects gaming customers by improving security and mitigating risks associated with fraudulent activities  



<p>By ensuring that operators are following rules and regulations and customers are gambling legally, RegTech promises a more secure gaming experience for customers worldwide all while providing a pleasing user experience.</p>



 Regulatory needs of gaming companies. 



<p>When it comes to the needs of gaming companies a few priorities top the list and therefore aim to be achieved. Some of these needs are major concerns as well.</p>



 Reducing fraud: 



<p>Fraud tops the list for one of the most important priorities of gaming operators. With the global online gambling industry already <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">valued at US$63.5 billion in 2022, and an expected annual growth rate of 11.7% from 2023 to 2030</a>, it’s safe to say that the popularity of online gambling is very much present. As more players use their mobile phones to play, gambling is here to stay. But with that comes fraudsters waiting to play their hand. Specifically, many operators are facing challenges with regards to bonus fraud and synthetic fraud.</p>



<p>Bonus fraud, also known as bonus abuse, is fraud that involves signing up to a service multiple times with different identities in order to receive the customer bonus or marketing offer that is advertised. This abuse is costing the online gaming industry around <a href="https://www.intergameonline.com/views/a-tale-of-woe-betting-gaming-and-bonus-abuse">15% of its total gross revenue</a>. Along with that comes in synthetic identity fraud with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/08/19/how-businesses-can-fight-the-growing-threat-of-synthetic-identity-fraud/?sh=438a88232887">23% of businesses seeing this type of fraud as the most prevalent fraud scheme in their industry</a>. This is where fraudsters harvest different kinds of information in order to create a brand new fake identity that appears legitimate. As a result, synthetic fraud can therefore be used in combination with bonus fraud.</p>



<p>With such looming threats facing many gambling operators, reducing fraud is one of their top priorities in order to safeguard their company as well as their players.</p>



 Balancing compliance with user experience: 



<p>As gambling companies continue to expand and grow, finding the right balance between staying compliant in a growing and competitive industry and offering a seamless user experience can be challenging. In order to stay compliant with the ever-increasing laws in jurisdictions, companies need to make sure they cover all requirements without sacrificing on customer onboarding.</p>



<p>Therefore, meeting such needs as verifying players’ age and identities efficiently and as frictionless as possible is a must have. Furthermore, as more and more states across the board promote <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gambling</a>, it is imperative that gambling operators implement such measurements in order to create a safer gambling environment for their players. By so doing, gambling companies can rest-assured that black markets will not prevail, but staying compliant will allow them to scale their market without sacrificing overall player experience and commercial profitability.</p>



 Importance of finding the right RegTech partner. 



<p>With the needs of gambling operators clearly defined, it’s important to find a partner who understands those needs and can assist in solving the issues at hand. Therein lies the importance of finding the right partner to help.</p>



<p>Gambling companies need a partner that listens to these needs and offers solutions that work. With many operators trying to cope with the growth and attempt at scaling all while being compliant with regulators’ ever-changing demands and reducing fraud, it is not a one-man show, but can only be accomplished with the help of a RegTech partner.</p>



 



  



 Features of a reliable RegTech partner. 



<p>As Gambling sales managers at IDnow, we work directly with gambling operators. As a result, we have come up with a list of features that current gambling companies are looking for when it comes to finding the right fit for a RegTech partner in the industry:</p>



<p>Accuracy &amp; Reliability: The number one priority for gambling operators is that the solutions RegTech providers are offering do what they are advertised to do. But not only that, it is imperative that the solutions are accurate and reliable by guaranteeing that identity documents will be screened correctly, so fraud will not pass through. Based on our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046033339908001792">LinkedIn poll</a>, 81% saw reliability as the top priority for gambling operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Honesty &amp; Trust: Honesty and trust are essential when dealing with service providers. Companies want a partner who will inform them openly and honestly about the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions presented. A RegTech partner should show how to minimize risks and describe where you can work with them. Not only will you meet the requirements, but you will also raise the bar for your compliance responsibilities with their help.</p>



<p>Expertise: Experience and professionalism is key when it comes to identity verification, at least according to 19% of participants in our recently-conducted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046033339908001792">LinkedIn poll</a>. Operators want to know that who they are working with have the expert knowledge on the many regulatory markets and can provide them with the information they need to stay compliant, while still scaling globally.</p>



<p>Speed: As more and more users partake in online gambling, making sure a solution quickly verifies potential players in a fast manner is truly essential, especially when wanting to increase conversion rates.</p>



<p>Simplicity: Along with speed, simplicity is also high on the wish list of gaming operators. Since all players must go through screening before being allowed to play, a solution that offers a minimal frictionless process towards the player onboarding experience is key.</p>



<p>Support: In the end, what will ultimately lead the RegTech solution to success is the implementation. Operators need to know that the company they partner with will provide support in relation to the product along with the resources, timeline and costs required. Support appears to be a given, as nobody in our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7046033339908001792">LinkedIn poll</a> selected Security as the top priority for gambling operators.</p>



 A perfect partnership, a balance of benefits. 



<p>If taking the above desires into consideration, RegTech providers can listen to their potential partners in order to better understand their needs and provide them with the best possible service. But despite the list of features they hope to see in their provider, there are also concerns that come with it. Such concerns include product unreliability, blockage of vast amounts of internal resources, aftersales care and support not met, and the cost of implementation from price, time and resources too high.</p>



<p>Thus, RegTech providers need to provide businesses with what they need in order to alleviate those fears. It’s always a balancing act when it comes to partnerships, and solution providers need to listen and assess the situation in order to showcase the benefits that the operators will receive by partnering with them.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on the problem it’s better to look at the solution. When operators link up with a RegTech provider the benefits far outweigh the concerns. Such benefits businesses can expect include the scalability they desire paired with high conversion rates, excellent document coverage, faster verification, fraud detection and the support and care they hope for.</p>



 IDnow and our solutions. 



<p>IDnow is passionate about the gaming industry, our products and our customers. We listen to and consult operators about solutions, considering their situation in order to find something that works for them.</p>

<p>After the FATF Plenary in February 2023 two new guidances were issued by the authority:</p>



  <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/countering-ransomware-financing.html">Countering</a><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/countering-ransomware-financing.html"> </a><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Methodsandtrends/countering-ransomware-financing.html">Ransomware Financing</a> 



 <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Guidance-Beneficial-Ownership-Legal-Persons.html">BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF LEGAL PERSONS</a> 
  Countering Ransomware Financing 



<p>The report on ransomware highlights an increase in these attacks between 2020 and 2021 compared to data from 2019. However, despite this increase, ransomware attacks seem to have one of the lowest reporting rates out of all financial crimes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To assist authorities throughout jurisdictions, the report:</p>



  disseminates methods used by criminals to carry out the attacks and money laundering schemes – for example,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/raas/"> ransomware as a service (RaaS) </a>and attacks on high-value entities seemed to have had the highest success rate; 



 provides a list of red flags which indicate ML where the predicate crime is ransomware. The flags are categorized as follows:
  Banks/Other financial and payment institutions identifying ransomware victim payment; 



 VASPs identifying ransomware victim payment; 



 VASPs identifying ransomware payment receipt/ransomware criminal account; 



 Jurisdictions with higher money laundering risks; 
  



 suggests jurisdictions to increase international communication, acquire skills and develop or make use of tools that allow them to collect relevant information to trace transactions and recover crypto assets; 



 requests a call for action on VASPs’ side to increase the reporting of these attacks; 



 urges jurisdictions which have not yet implemented FATF’s Recommendation 15 into national law to do so urgently. 
 <p>It is noted that payments are almost exclusively requested in virtual assets due to the instantaneous cross-border nature of transactions, VASPs with lax or non-existent AML processes and procedures and the availability of privacy coins and mixers which help in the laundering process of the proceeds.&nbsp;</p>



 Beneficial Ownership Of Legal Persons 



<p>FATF’s Recommendation 24 requires „countries to ensure that competent authorities have access to adequate, accurate and up-to-date information on the true owners of companies”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Standard was subject to revisions aiming at:</p>



  identifying and preventing criminals and sanction evaders from using businesses such as shell companies to hide their illicit activities and illegal proceeds.&nbsp; 



 help jurisdiction assess and mitigate risks related to ML and TF stemming from foreign companies to which they are exposed.&nbsp; 



 helping jurisdictions „identify, design and implement appropriate measures in line with the revised Recommendation 24 to ensure that beneficial ownership information is held by a public authority or body functioning as a beneficial ownership registry, or an alternative mechanism that enables efficient access to the information.” 



 providing guidance on types and sources of relevant information, and mechanism and sources to obtain such information.

				<p>The canvas is a tool to map out a use case for an IDtech product. It’s a visual guide to help align internal and external stakeholders who will be interacting with the product.&nbsp;This post will include some examples of a “filled out” canvas to stoke the imagination and help make these concepts more concrete. We will follow three examples throughout the rest of the post to illustrate how they map onto the questions outlined in the IDtech product canvas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>					 
						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is the IDtech Product Canvas NOT for? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While the first version of this tool was called the “Trust Ecosystem Canvas,” after a round of feedback we’ve made some adjustments to the name of the tool to clarify that it should not be used to map out an entire trust ecosystem.&nbsp;This tool doesn’t show everything needed to illustrate a regulated, multi-stakeholder, trust ecosystem that encapsulates many use cases.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The canvas is also not meant to show&nbsp;how all of this works in practice and how to operationalize these concepts. We decided this is beyond the scope of this tool, though we’re actively working on other tools to help builders turn the IDtech Product Canvas into a more actionable product plan. For now,&nbsp;the technical details around credential formats, blockchains, trust registries, API calls, etc. are out of scope.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>What is the problem that you’re solving?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Said another way, what is the use case you’d like to map out on the canvas?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the purpose of this blog post, we’ll be exploring three use cases. For the featured use case, we’ll answer all questions on the canvas to clearly illustrate how to fill out the entirety of the tool. For the secondary examples, we’ll just provide final outputs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Featured use case:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  A local government is looking to increase tourism by issuing a tourist pass  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondary use cases:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Increasing security and convenience by issuing digital banking credentials  Streamlining license and credential management for travel nurses

				<p>We think it makes sense to start with the issuer box, then move to the holder, verifier, and provider. The issuer, holder, and verifier are common roles within the traditional “trust triangle” of SSI. While they’re all illustrated as separate stakeholders, it’s possible for an issuer to be the holder, if they’re self-attesting to a credential like a favorite color or t-shirt size. It’s also possible for the issuer and verifier to be the same party, if they’re both issuing and verifying membership to a company rewards program.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s follow a specific example through the canvas, answering the associated questions.</p>

				<p>If you answer the questions from the canvas individually, you’ll get an output like:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				 
 	 Who is issuing credentials?

 New Feature: Enable CEX Trading for Tokenized Securities 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>As a tokenization platform using mainly public blockchain networks, enabling more liquidity features is one of our priorities. Today, we’re proud to introduce&nbsp;the Centralized Exchange (CEX) feature&nbsp;to our&nbsp;<a href="https://csqny04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/WZ+113/csQNy04/VW4pyT3zNtYvN68yK3dP9r9TW48Yhp74YcDjjN26s6053q8_QV1-WJV7CgRrdN4nvB8n1Y638W4mNwdT6f1Qp6VzQxZ46ZLDqkW1SYNzb38d95rW5Bt--R2YQLX7W81_fZm3_vVcXW1ZRRkh5VL_cgW4GMZPB7W8mfJW8qjGfv8DxQFQW1lZbDm57G8BLW74c1dx378NCcW8dfkg77CkvBtW7qq46t8xQS9SW3Rc_BY2VCdgdW5DW97k1rHthvW3M9P-s81w0rsW13C6Lb4GJqjYW6znj3Q4sd_bGW7c_jpq5H7hXzN5ZZqjWPKZWsVKj_d35PNRD3W5P5csj6m0JT136NK1">T-REX platform</a>&nbsp;to facilitate liquidity. This&nbsp;makes your ERC3643 tokenized securities technically compatible with any centralized exchange&nbsp;using the same blockchain network as your tokenized securities.</p>
<p>The CEX feature complements our innovative bulletin board solution&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/">Billboard</a>&nbsp;to provide additional liquidity solutions to issuers. Once activated, investors can&nbsp;trade their digital securities on centralized trading platforms such as exchanges, ATS, or MTF.</p>
<p>(Note: The trading platforms listed in the screenshot below are examples)</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<p>1. Sign a commercial agreement: As an issuer, you have the responsibility to ensure that the trading venues are in compliance with your securities. You and the trading venues must sign a commercial agreement enabling the listing of your tokenized securities in their exchange or network.</p>
<p>2. Allow trading venues: Simply enable the ‘Is Allowed’ button for exchanges you have an agreement with.</p>
<p>3. Add deposit wallets: Each of your investors can view enabled exchanges on their Investor Portal dashboard under the ‘Buy/Sell’ module and add their deposit wallets provided by the respective trading venues.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>4. Approve deposit wallets:&nbsp;You’ll receive a new request to approve the deposit wallet via your ‘Deposit wallets” module.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>5. Transfer tokenized securities:&nbsp;Once the deposit wallet address is approved, investors can transfer their tokenized securities to the deposit wallet.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>6. Trade on CEX(s): Transfers take only a few seconds, depending on the network. Once completed, tokenized securities will be managed by the exchange and available for trading on their platforms.</p>
<p>The rollout of the CEX feature marks a momentous milestone for us, and we couldn’t have achieved it without the dedication and tireless efforts of our developers. We are committed to continuously expanding our features to support more secondary market solutions, such as decentralized exchanges and collateralization DeFi protocols,&nbsp;bridging tokenized real-world assets (RAW) to DeFi&nbsp;to unlock the full potential of tokenized securities.</p>

Since its initial publication in 2019, KERI has become a promising alternative to a distributed consensus ledger (i.e. a blockchain) for self-sovereign identities (SSI). The KERI community has also been growing rapidly in the past few years, spawning a number of open-source projects, such as <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust">WebOfTrust</a>, as well as getting a major adoption by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) in the form of <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">verifiable LEI&nbsp;(vLEI)</a>.</p><p>I was first introduced to KERI by Sam Smith, i.e. the author himself, in one of the Internet Identity Workshops in 2020, and my first impression of KERI&nbsp;was:</p><blockquote>Holy cow, that’s a lot of&nbsp;jargon.</blockquote><p>As someone without a background in cybersecurity, KERI was definitely not an easy concept to grasp. It also contains a huge collection of newly defined terms, making a steep learning curve for all but a few cybersecurity professionals and computer scientists. However, as I went down the KERI rabbit hole, I slowly became convinced that KERI is one of the most elegant, if not the most elegant, implementations for identity systems to&nbsp;date.</p><p>Hence, I would like to write an introduction to important jargon for understanding KERI. This introduction is divided into two&nbsp;parts.</p>  Part 1 deals with the term related to Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs) as well as operations and data structures defined in KERI. It also, in a way, provides a summary of the KERI whitepaper.  Part 2 dives into other peripheral topics in the KERI ecosystem such as Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC), Out-of-Band Introduction (OOBI), and Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR).  <p>Note that this blog does not aim to be comprehensive and only introduces each term at its surface level. For more comprehensive materials, I recommend the following:</p>  KERI Whitepaper (<a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf</a>)  KERI Presentation by Sam Smith at SSI Meetup, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/key-event-receipt-infrastructure-keri-secure-identifier-overlay-internet-sam-smith-webinar-58/">https://ssimeetup.org/key-event-receipt-infrastructure-keri-secure-identifier-overlay-internet-sam-smith-webinar-58/</a>  KERI Community main repository, <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri</a>  Trust Over IP ACDC wiki, <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/">https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/</a>   Table of&nbsp;Contents <p>· <a>Root of Trust</a><br>· <a>Identity Architecture</a><br>· <a>SCID (Self-Certifying Identifier)</a><br>· <a>AID (Autonomic Identifier)</a><br> ∘ <a>AN (Autonomic Namespace)</a><br> ∘ <a>Basic Prefix</a><br> ∘ <a>Self-Addressing Prefix</a><br> ∘ <a>KERI DID Method</a><br>· <a>Pre-Rotation</a><br> ∘ <a>Partial Pre-Rotation</a><br>· <a>KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure)</a><br> ∘ <a>Establishment Event</a><br> ∘ <a>Non-Establishment Event</a><br> ∘ <a>Key Event Ilk</a><br> ∘ <a>Interaction Event</a><br> ∘ <a>Extended Rotation Event</a><br> ∘ <a>Key Event Sequence</a><br> ∘ <a>KEL (Key Event Log)</a><br> ∘ <a>Key Event Receipt</a><br> ∘ <a>KERL (Key Event Receipt Log)</a><br> ∘ <a>Duplicity</a><br> ∘ <a>DEL (Duplicitous Event Log)</a><br>· <a>Protocol Operational Modes</a><br> ∘ <a>Direct Replay Mode</a><br> ∘ <a>Indirect Replay Mode</a><br>· <a>Related Entities</a><br> ∘ <a>Controller</a><br> ∘ <a>Verifier</a><br> ∘ <a>Validator</a><br> ∘ <a>Witness</a><br> ∘ <a>Watcher</a><br> ∘ <a>Juror</a><br> ∘ <a>Judge</a><br> ∘ <a>Resolver</a><br>· <a>KA2CE (KERI’S Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment)</a><br>· <a>Cooperative Delegation</a></p> Root of&nbsp;Trust <p>A Root of Trust is defined as a component or process of the system upon which other components rely on. In an identity system, it is something on which the security of the system is dependent, and great care must be taken to design and implement a root of trust. There are two main types of roots of trust, namely primary and secondary roots of&nbsp;trust:</p>  A primary root of trust is irreplaceable and provides trust that is uniquely necessary to the system. Any compromise on the primary root of trust also compromises the trustworthiness of the entire identity system. In a blockchain-based identity system, the primary root of trust is the blockchain. In KERI, on the other hand, the primary root of trust is in a self-certifying identifier — called an autonomic identifier (AID) — that is purely cryptographic and is under the control of an end&nbsp;user.  A secondary root of trust is replaceable and provides trust that may be also provided redundantly by another component. In a KERI-based identity system, a Key Event Log (KEL) is considered a secondary root of&nbsp;trust.  <blockquote>Note 1: A blockchain may be used with KERI and an autonomic identifier (AID). In this case, the blockchain serves as a secondary root of trust for the&nbsp;AID.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: KERI also has additional supporting mechanisms that serve as secondary roots of trust, including a Key Event Receipt Log (KERL), witnesses, watchers, etc.</blockquote> Identity Architecture <p>An identity system requires a mechanism to uniquely identify each entity that participates in all transactions.​ To achieve this requirement, the architecture of identity systems has three common components: (1) a controller (i.e., an end-user), (2) a public-private key pair, and (3) an identifier that uniquely identifies the controller. A key pair allows a controller to create a digital signature that cryptographically proves the authenticity of a transaction. An identity system binds the three components, and any weak link in such a system presents a vulnerability to cyberattacks.</p>Binding of a controller, authentication factors, and identifiers in identity&nbsp;systems.<p>The binding between a controller and a key pair can be easily made strong by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator">cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG)</a>, which collects sufficient entropy to generate a key pair. As long as the controller has the ability to keep the private key secure, such binding is considered strong. However, how the controller and the key pair are bound to an identifier depends on the types of identity architectures. In <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a> by Phil Windley, three types of identity architectures are defined: namely Administrative, Algorithmic, and Autonomic architectures.</p>  An Administrative Architecture relies on an administrator—which is a person or an organization—to be the primary root of trust. The administrator binds an identifier to a key pair of the controller. Such bindings are considered weak as it is inherently vulnerable to faulty operational administration. A classic example of this architecture is the Domain Name System (DNS) with Certificate Authorities (CAs), which suffers from security exploits such as DNS hijacking and requires additional infrastructure to mitigate the&nbsp;risk.  An Algorithmic Architecture relies on a blockchain to be the primary root of trust that registers and strongly binds a public key to an identifier. In a system where the identifier is cryptographically derived from the public key, all three bindings are considered strong. Here, the controller of the key pair can assert control over the identifier, and anyone with access to the ledger can algorithmically verify the controller-identifier binding. Most SSI implementations that are built on blockchains fall into this category.  An Autonomic Architecture is similar to an algorithmic architecture where a controller generates a key pair and derives an identifier, providing strong bindings to all components. The difference is that, in an autonomic architecture, the controller is the primary root of trust. The controller records the binding between the key pair and the identifier in a local Key Event Log (KEL), instead of recording such binding in a globally shared ledger. KERI is an autonomic identity architecture.  <p>In summary, the main difference between KERI and blockchain is that blockchain relies on a network of validators while KERI requires only local operation by a controller.</p><blockquote>Here, we specifically refer to the term “blockchain” as a “distributed consensus ledger” with a global ordering of&nbsp;records.</blockquote> SCID (Self-Certifying Identifier) <p>A SCID (Self-Certifying Identifier) is an identifier that is uniquely and cryptographically derived (e.g. by using a hash function) from a public key of a key pair. It is self-certifying (or more precisely self-authenticating) because it does not rely on any trusted third party. The controller of the SCID can cryptographically prove their control by using the private key of the same key pair to generate a digital signature on a message, and the verifier may extract the public key from the SCID itself to verify the signature.</p><p>In a basic SCID, the mapping between an identifier and its controlling public key is self-contained in the identifier itself. A basic SCID is ephemeral/non-transferable, i.e., it does not support the rotation of its key pair and therefore must be abandoned once the controlling private key becomes weakened or compromised from exposure.</p>Cryptographic binding between a public key and a self-certifying identifier (SCID). AID (Autonomic Identifier) <p>Formally, an AID (Autonomic Identifier) is a self-certifying identifier that is the primary root of trust in KERI. An AID can be considered a variant of a decentralized identifier that does not rely on a blockchain. An essential property of an AID is that it may persist despite the evolution of its key state. In other words, the controller of an AID is capable of rotating their key pair while retaining the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>A key state of an AID refers to the set of currently authoritative and pre-rotated key&nbsp;pairs.</blockquote><p>There are two types of AIDs, namely transferable and non-transferable AIDs.</p>  A Non-transferable AID—which is also known as an ephemeral AID—is cryptographically bound to a single key pair that is not rotatable. This type of AID is not meant for long-term persistent use and should be abandoned/replaced after its private key becomes compromised. Within KERI, the primary use for non-transferable AIDs is for AIDs of witnesses and other supporting roles.  A Transferable AID is cryptographically bound to two sets of key pairs where one is called the current key pair and the other is called the next key pair. The controller can rotate the key pairs while retaining control over the AID. This process is called pre-rotation and is discussed in more detail&nbsp;later.  Simple examples of non-transferable and transferable AIDs (using a single-signature scheme). AN (Autonomic Namespace) <p>In an identity system, a namespace is defined as a grouping of identifiers for a set of related resources and their attributes. In other words, a namespace provides a systematic way of organizing identifiers by employing some scheme for assigning identifiers to the elements of the namespace.</p><p>A name-spacing scheme uses a prefix or prefixes in a hierarchical fashion to compose identifiers. The following is an example of a namespace scheme for addresses within the USA that uses a hierarchy of prefixes:</p> state.county.city.zip.street.number <p>An AN (Autonomic Namespace) is a namespace that has a self-certifying prefix that can be cryptographically verified as a root control authority over its namespace. Each identifier (i.e., an AID) from an autonomic namespace includes a prefix that is either the public key or is uniquely derived from the public key(s) of the incepting key pair(s). The associated private key may then be used by the controller to authoritatively sign statements that authenticate itself and authorize the use of the&nbsp;AID.</p><p>The following is the Autonomic Namespace Syntax and an example from the KERI whitepaper:</p> aid:prefix[:options][/path][?query][#fragment]<br><br>aid:BXq5YqaL6L48pf0fu7IUhL0JRaU2_RxFP0AL43wYn148/path/to/<br>resource?name=secure#really <p>Here, “BXq5YqaL6L48pf0fu7IUhL0JRaU2_RxFP0AL43wYn148” is the AID&nbsp;prefix.</p> Basic Prefix <p>A basic AID includes a prefix that is composed of a Base-64 (URL safe) derivation code prepended to Base-64 encoding of a public digital signing key. The derivation code is a special character that encodes the derivation process. Abstractly the prefix may be represented as&nbsp;follows:</p>Basic Prefix. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.) Self-Addressing Prefix <p>A basic prefix is bound to a single key pair, which makes the AID non-transferable. For transferable AIDs, it is more useful to bind the identifier to the content digest (i.e. a cryptographic hash) of the inception statement. The inception statement includes the derivation code, the public key, the configuration, and the signature as shown&nbsp;below.</p>An inception statement for an inception event. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.)<p>Abstractly the prefix for an AID may be represented as&nbsp;follows:</p>Self-Addressing Prefix. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.)<p>There are also variants of self-addressing prefixes including:</p>  Multi-Sig Self-Addressing Prefix where the inception statement contains multiple sets of public keys (and the digests of multiple pre-committed keys) for a multi-signature scheme.  Delegated Self-Addressing Prefix, which involves two AIDs—namely a delegating AID and a delegated AID. A delegated AID prefix may be created by including the delegating prefix in the delegated prefix inception configuration data.   KERI DID&nbsp;Method <p>An AID may be represented as a decentralized identifier according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a>, using a <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/did-keri/">KERI DID method</a>. A KERI DID is represented simply as a “did:keri:” followed by the AID&nbsp;prefix:</p> did:keri:prefix  Pre-Rotation <p>A transferable AID is cryptographically bound to two sets of key pairs, each of which plays a role that together establishes complete control authority over the AID. In this case, the control authority over the AID is split between the two sets, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The Current Key Pair(s) holds the signing authority.  The Next Key Pair(s) holds the rotation authority.  <blockquote>Here, the “s” refers to the case where a multi-signature scheme is employed, where multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities.</blockquote><p>For simplicity, let’s assume that single key pairs (i.e. using a single-signature scheme) are used for the current and next key&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>The current key pair may be used for the day-to-day operation of the AID, such as digitally signing documents and authenticating the AID’s controller via challenge-response protocols. The public key of the current key pair is revealed to external parties so that they can be used to verify signatures.</p><p>On the other hand, the public key of the next key pair is only pre-committed and hidden by a cryptographic digest (hash). The next key pair — both private and public keys— must be kept secure until a key rotation is required. The rotation event revokes the current key pairs that hold signing authority as well as replacing the next key pairs that hold rotation authority. This process is called pre-rotation since the next key pair is simply committed for rotation while the actual rotation event may occur at a later&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Formally, pre-rotation is a cryptographic pre-commitment of an AID to the next key pair(s) for key rotation.</blockquote><p>In the example below, an AID is derived from the 1st key event that includes the 1st pubic key (current key) and the digest of the 2nd key (pre-committed next key). Once the 1st key pair is rotated, the 2nd public key is exposed and becomes the new current key. Here, the 3rd key pair is also generated, and the digest of the 3rd public key is included in the 2nd key event as the new next&nbsp;key.</p>A simple example of pre-rotation for a transferable AID (using a single-signature scheme).<p>Pre-rotation gives the controller of an AID the ability to recover their authority over the AID even if the current private key becomes compromised or&nbsp;lost.</p><blockquote>Note 1: The `new` current key in an establishment event may not necessarily be the same key as the next key from the `previous` establishment event. In other words, during rotation, the controller may assign a new key pair to be the current key instead of using the previously pre-committed key&nbsp;pair.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: A controller may choose not to replace the next key pair during rotation. In this case, the AID becomes non-transferable.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 3: Pre-rotation makes KERI post-quantum secure. Although Shor’s algorithm can break public key cryptography in poly-logarithmic time, cryptographic hashes are considered quantum-safe. Even if someone may break the current key pair of an AID, the controller of the AID can still recover the control authority by using the next key pair that is hidden by a cryptographic hash.</blockquote> Partial Pre-Rotation <p>When a multi-signature scheme is used to manage an AID, pre-rotation becomes slightly more complicated as multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities. A rotation event on a set of pre-rotated keys may keep some keys in reserve (i.e unexposed) while exposing others as needed. This is known as partial pre-rotation.</p><p>For example, the inception of an AID has three current key pairs called [A0, A2, A3] and three next key pairs called [A3, A4, A5], which are pre-rotated by hashes [H(A3), H(A4), H(A5)]. Here, Ai represents a public key and [H(Ai)] represents a hash of a public key Ai. The key state at the inception of the AID can be shown as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The current keys: A0, A1,&nbsp;A2  Hashes of the next keys: H(A3), H(A4),&nbsp;H(A5)  <p>A rotation event may expose [A3, A4] while reserving [A5] as well as generating [A6] to be a new signing key and [A7, A8, A9] to be new pre-rotated keys. The key state of the AID after the rotation can be shown as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The current keys: A3,&nbsp;A6  Hashes of the next keys: H(A5), H(A7), H(A8),&nbsp;H(A9)  A simple example of reserved (partial) rotation.<p>This example is also known as reserve rotation. There are two main types of partial rotations, namely reserve and custodial rotation.</p>  Reserve Rotation enables pre-rotated key pairs designated in one establishment event to be held in reserve and not exposed at the next (immediately subsequent) establishment event.  Custodial Rotation involves another entity, called a custodial agent, whose role is to hold signing authority (current keys) while the original controller can hold exclusive rotation authority (next keys). The holder of the rotation authority can then at any time without the cooperation of the custodial agent if need be revoke the agent’s signing authority and assign it to some other agent or return that authority to&nbsp;itself.   KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) <p>The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) is a decentralized public key infrastructure for secure self-certifying identifiers (i.e., AIDs) that aims at minimum sufficiency and maximum security.</p><p>KERI uses a hash-chain data structure for managing public keys and AIDs, so it may be considered a type of “blockchain”. However, unlike traditional blockchains, KERI is not globally ordered and does not have a distributed consensus mechanism. As a result, KERI is not double-spending-proof and cannot be directly used as an infrastructure for crypto-currency or other crypto-assets. On the other hand, KERI is specifically made to be an infrastructure for identity systems and is often considered more scalable, more performant, and more decentralized—compared to blockchains.</p><blockquote>A traditional blockchain with a distributed consensus mechanism is globally ordered in the sense that all participating nodes (validators or miners) share an identical ledger, which is an ordered list of transactions.</blockquote><p>Each word in KERI has the following meaning:</p>  Key — asymmetric key cryptography.  Event—a series of key events that are related to the management of public keys and identifiers, including key rotations.  Receipt—signed receipts from witnesses of key events that provide an additional threshold structure  Infrastructure—an open-source framework for building decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.  <p>As its name suggests, KERI is all about key events, which are related to the management of persistent self-certifying identifiers (i.e., AIDs). A data structure that represents a key event—including signatures on its body—is called a Key Event Message. There are two types of key events in KERI, namely Establishment and Non-Establishment events.</p> Establishment Event <p>An Establishment Event is a key event that `establishes` changes in the key state of an AID, which includes the current set of authoritative and pre-committed key pairs for an AID. There are two sub-types of establishment events, namely inception and rotation&nbsp;events.</p>  An Inception Event is an establishment event that provides the incepting information needed to derive an AID and establish its initial key&nbsp;state.  A Rotation Event is an establishment event that provides the information needed to change the key state which includes a change to the set of authoritative key pairs for an&nbsp;AID.  <p>An establishment event message may contain the current key(s) and the digest of the next key(s), signature(s), and other metadata.</p>Establishment Event Message. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.) Non-Establishment Event <p>A Non-Establishment Event is a key event that does not change the current key state for an AID. Typically the purpose of a non-establishment event is to anchor external data to the current key state of the AID, as established by the most recent prior establishment event.</p><p>A non-establishment event message contains the seals of the anchored external data and signatures, which are signed by the current&nbsp;key(s).</p>Basic Non-Establishment Event Message. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.)<p>In KERI, there are four types of&nbsp;seals:</p>  A Digest Seal is a simple digest (cryptographic hash) of external&nbsp;data.  A Root Seal is a hash tree root (the Merkle tree) of external&nbsp;data.  An Event Seal includes the AID prefix, sequence number, and digest of a key event in a Key Event Log (KEL). An event seal anchors one key event to another key event, which may or may not be from the same key event sequence.  A Location Seal includes the AID prefix, sequence number, “ilk” and prior digest from a key event. A location seal is used when two seals in two different events are cross-anchoring each other. This provides a cross reference of one event to another where the other event’s digest must include the seal in the event contents so it cannot contain the first event’s digest but the digest of the preceding event.   Key Event&nbsp;Ilk <p>Note that the key event ilk—or simply ilk—indicates the type of the key event. There are 7 types of ilks defined in the KERI whitepaper:</p>  “icp” for an inception event  “rot” for a rotation&nbsp;event.  “ixn” for interaction event  “dip” for delegated inception event  “drt” for delegated rotation&nbsp;event  “rct” for event receipt&nbsp;message  “vrc” for validator event receipt&nbsp;message  <p>Specific applications may use other event ilk values. The definitions and discussions of receipt and validator will be given later&nbsp;below.</p> Interaction Event <p>An Interaction Event is a type of non-establishment event that is interleaved into the key event history along with establishment events. An interaction event includes an event-specific interaction data payload in the form of an array of one or more&nbsp;seals.</p><p>The purpose of an interaction event is to enable interactions between a controller and validator that are not expressly establishment. Interaction events are signed with the current signing&nbsp;key.</p><p>A Delegating Interaction Event is an example of an interaction event where an AID delegates an establishment event (called a Delegated Establishment Event) of another AID, either inception or rotation.</p> Extended Rotation&nbsp;Event <p>An Extended Rotation Event is a special type of a rotation event that contains interaction event data. Hence, it anchors external data to the AID while also rotating its key state. In other words, it is a key event that combines a rotation event and interaction event in the same key event&nbsp;message.</p><blockquote>An extended rotation event provides enhanced security to normal (non-establishment) interaction events since the signing key is rotated immediately after it is used to sign the key event&nbsp;message.</blockquote> Key Event&nbsp;Sequence <p>A Key Event Sequence is a uniquely ordered sequence of key event messages that are chained together via the digest of the immediately preceding key event message. A key event sequence consists of two key event subsequences, namely an establishment subsequence and an non-establishment subsequence.</p>Key Event Sequence. Sequence composed of interleaved establishment (inception, rotation) and non-establishment (interaction) events. (Reference: <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a>.) KEL (Key Event&nbsp;Log) <p>Formally, a Key Event Log (KEL) is an append-only verifiable data structure that represents a full key event sequence for an AID. It is an ordered chained record of the key event messages created by the controller of an AID. The key events are chained in such a way that each event message (besides the inception event) includes a cryptographic digest (hash)of the preceding event message. A KEL includes both establishment and non-establishment events, which are interleaved in the key event sequence.</p><p>A verifier may verify the authority of a controller over an AID or the authenticity of signed data by replaying the subsequence of establishment events in a valid&nbsp;KEL.</p><blockquote>Note 1: A KEL is technically a type of “blockchain” in the traditional sense of an ordered list of records that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: A KEL is considered a secondary root of trust in KERI. The primary root of trust is its AID and the entropy from which the AID is&nbsp;derived.</blockquote> Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>A Key Event Receipt is a message whose body references a key event of an AID and includes one or more signatures on that key&nbsp;event.</p><p>For example, a key event receipt may be signed by witnesses to provide fault tolerance, security, and availability of key events. (More detail about the witnesses is given&nbsp;later.)</p> KERL (Key Event Receipt&nbsp;Log) <p>A Key Event Receipt Log (KERL) is a KEL that also includes all the consistent key event receipt messages created by witnesses. Each witness’ KERL for an AID is an append-only event log of first-seen verified consistent events. A witness only keeps consistent events and receipts of those consistent events.</p><p>A verifier may verify the authority of a controller over an AID by replaying the subsequence of establishment events in a valid&nbsp;KERL.</p><blockquote>A KERL is also considered a secondary root of trust in&nbsp;KERI.</blockquote> Duplicity <p>For a given AID, Duplicity refers to the existence of two or more versions of inconsistent instances of a KEL. Since every event in a KEL must be signed with non-repudiable signatures, any inconsistency between any two instances of the KEL is provable evidence of duplicity on the part of the signer(s), i.e. the controller of the&nbsp;AID.</p><p>Duplicity could be caused by a misbehaving/malicious controller or by an attacker that gains an access to the controller’s private key(s). In the latter case, if only the current (signing) key(s) are compromised, the controller may recover their authority by rotating the compromised key(s).</p><blockquote>Note 1: A shorter KEL—which does not differ in any of its events with respect to another but longer KEL—is not duplicitous but merely incomplete.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: A controller (or a validator) of an AID may set a threshold number at which&nbsp;, called Threshold of Acceptable Duplicity (TOAD).</blockquote> DEL (Duplicitous Event&nbsp;Log) <p>A Duplicitous Event Log (DEL) is a record of duplicitous events with respect to a given KERL. The duplicitous events are indexed to the corresponding event in a&nbsp;KERL.</p> Protocol Operational Modes <p>In the KERI protocol, there are two operational modes that define how key events can be conveyed between the controller of an AID and its validator. These modes are direct and indirect replay&nbsp;modes.</p><blockquote>Here, we may make a reasonable assumption that the controller of an AID is honest as it is usually in the best interests of the controller to act in a trustworthy manner. This is because each key event must be non-repudiably signed by the controller, and any inconsistent alternate version of a key event may be eventually detectable by any validator once given access to both versions. Such “duplicity” may destroy the trustworthiness of the controller and their&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Direct Replay&nbsp;Mode <p>In the Direct Replay Mode, the controller and the validator exchange the KEL of the AID directly.</p><p>First, the validator must validate that the AID is really under the control of the controller. Since the AID is bound to one or more key pairs, the controller may establish control by sending the inception event message of the AID signed with the corresponding private keys. This inception event establishes the controller’s initial authority over the AID at issuance. This control authority can be subsequently maintained via successive rotation events. As long as the validator maintains a copy of the original event sequence—i.e., the key event log (KEL)—as first received, the validator will be able to detect any later exploit that attempts to change any of the events in that sequence, i.e., duplicity detection.</p><p>Upon reception of a key event, the validator sends a key event receipt message, which includes the validator’s signature, as an acknowledgment. The controller now has a signed receipt that attests that the validator received and verified the key event message. Hence, the validator also acts as a witness to this key event. The controller can keep the receipt in a key event receipt log (KERL). This provides a trust basis for transactions between the controller and the validator. The validator may not later repudiate its signed receipts nor refer to a different key event history in interactions with the controller without detection by the controller.</p><p>Each party could establish its own AID for use with the other in this pair-wise interaction. Each party would thereby in turn be the controller for its own AID and the validator and witness for the other’s AID. Each could maintain a KEL for the other’s AID and KERL from the other for its own AID. This allows each party to be invulnerable to subsequent exploitation with respect to this pairwise interaction.</p>A direct replay mode between Entity A and Entity B in a pairwise interaction. Indirect Replay&nbsp;Mode <p>In the Indirect Replay Mode, the promulgation of key events to a validator may happen even when the controller of an AID is not online and therefore not able to communicate directly with the validator. The purpose of the indirect mode is to provide a highly available trustworthy service for an AID that thereby ensures that any validator may have access to a copy of the original version of the key event&nbsp;history.</p><p>The controller may designate a set of witnesses, called a witness pool, that essentially stores and forward key events to any requestor. This function of the witnesses is called a key event promulgation service. The witnesses also sign the key events to create receipts and keep them in their&nbsp;KERLs.</p><blockquote>Note 1: A witness may also send its receipt to other witnesses. This might be with a broadcast or gossip protocol or not at&nbsp;all.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: It is possible that witnesses may receive inconsistent key events. In general, the witnessing policy of the witnesses is that the first seen version of an event always wins, that is, the first verified version is witnessed (signed, stored, acknowledged, and maybe disseminated) and all other versions are discarded. The exception to this general rule is that an establishment event may recover following a set of exploited non-establishment events. The recovery process may fork off a branch from the recovered trunk.</blockquote><p>An example of the indirect replay mode with a set of witnesses that are designated by the controller is shown&nbsp;below.</p>An indirect replay mode via witnesses.<p>Since the witnesses are designated by the controller, they may not be trusted by a validator. Hence, the validator may designate its own set of Watchers that may provide high availability and security from the validator’s perspective. This watcher service may be called a Key Event Confirmation Service. A simple example where both services are used is shown&nbsp;below:</p>An indirect replay mode via witnesses and watchers.<p>The validator’s confirmation service may be further enhanced to provide duplicity detection and other protections as needed. Additional roles for the key event confirmation service include a Judge and Juror(s).</p>  the Juror(s) performs duplicity detection on key events and key event receipts as well as keeps a duplicitous event log (DEL) for the&nbsp;AID.  the Judge examines KERLs and DELs from witnesses, watchers, and jurors to determine if the controller is trustworthy.  An indirect replay mode via witnesses, watchers, jurors and&nbsp;judge. Related Entities <p>The KERI protocol defines a number of entities that are involved in the management and usage of an AID, some of which have already been mentioned briefly.</p><blockquote>Here, an “Entity” could be a person, organization, autonomous software, or thing, such as an IoT&nbsp;device.</blockquote> Controller <p>A Controller of an AID is a controlling entity that can cryptographically prove the control authority (signing and rotation) over the AID, as well as make changes on the associated KEL. In the case where a multi-signature scheme is used, the controller consists of multiple controlling entities.</p><p>Normally, the controller holds both signing and rotation authorities over the AID. However, the controller may grant its authority to third parties. An example is custodial rotation where the controller grants its signing authority to a custodial agent.</p> Verifier <p>A Verifier of an AID is an entity that cryptographically verifies the signature(s) on an event message related to the&nbsp;AID.</p> Validator <p>A Validator of an AID is an entity that determines that a given signed statement associated with the AID was valid at the time of its issuance.</p><p>Note that a validator must first act as a verifier in order to determine the authoritative key set for verifying/validating the signed statement from the KEL of the&nbsp;AID.</p> Witness <p>A Witness of an AID is an entity that is designated (trusted) by the controller of the AID. The primary role of a witness is to verify, sign, and keep the key events associated with the AID. Designation of witnesses is included in key establishment events. As a result, the role of a witness may be verified using the KEL and KERL of the AID. When designated, a Witness becomes part of the supporting infrastructure for maintaining and verifying the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note 1: As a special case, the controller may serve as its own&nbsp;witness.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 2: Witnesses are used in a group, called a witness pool. The pool forms a threshold structure that provides protection from the exploitation of a minority of the key- pairs of the ephemeral Witness AIDs in the&nbsp;pool.</blockquote><blockquote>Note 3: the initial set of designated witnesses is specified in the inception event and then may be changed by a rotation&nbsp;event.</blockquote> Watcher <p>The Watcher of an AID is an entity that keeps a copy of a KERL. A set of watchers may be used as a supporting infrastructure for a validator. Unlike witnesses, watchers are not designated by the controller.</p> Juror <p>The Juror of an AID is an entity that performs duplicity detection on key events and key event receipts. Once duplicity is detected, the Juror creates a digital signature on the duplicitous key&nbsp;events.</p><p>Each juror keeps a duplicitous event log (DEL) for each controller and all designated witnesses with respect to a KERL. Any validator may confirm duplicity by examining a&nbsp;DEL.</p> Judge <p>The Judge of an AID is an entity that examines the entries of one or more KERLs and DELs to validate that the event history of the AID is from a non-duplicitous controller and has been witnessed by a sufficient number of non-duplicitous witnesses such that it may be trusted or conversely not-trusted by a validator.</p> Resolver <p>The Resolver of an AID is an entity that provides discovery for the&nbsp;AID.</p> KA2CE (KERI’S Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment) <p>The key event promulgation service for an AID is provided by a set of witnesses (witness pool) that employs a type of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm, called KERI’s Agreement Algorithm for Control Establishment (KA2CE). KA2CE provides a service for the key event history of the AID via a KERL (Key Event Receipt Log). The controller must designate a threshold number where a subset of witnesses may at any time be faulty. The objective of the service is to provide a verifiable KERL to any validator on&nbsp;demand.</p><p>In this algorithm, an agreement consists of a specific version of a key event with verifiable receipts (signatures) from the controller and the designated witnesses. An agreement means that each witness in that set has witnessed the same version of that event and each witness’ receipt in that set has been promulgated to every other witness in that&nbsp;set.</p><blockquote>The purpose of using multiple designated witnesses in KERI is to ensure both the availability and the security of the service in the event of faulty witnesses. In addition to faults such as unresponsiveness and network interruptions, allowed faults include what are commonly known as Byzantine faults such as dishonest/malicious witnesses.</blockquote> Cooperative Delegation <p>A controller of an AID may authorize some degree of control authority to another AID. This process is known as delegation.</p><p>A delegation operation involves a pair of events by the delegating and delegated AIDs. Such operation is cooperative in KERI as it requires a cryptographic commitment from both the delegator and the delegate, as&nbsp;follows.</p>  The delegating event contains an “event seal” that includes a digest of the delegated event  The delegated event contains a “location seal” that includes the unique location of the delegating event.  <p>The pair of seals cross-reference the two events participating in the cooperative delegation operation. The delegating AID performs an establishment operation (inception or rotation) on a delegated identifier, as illustrated below.</p>Cooperative delegation.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 13th to March&nbsp;19th <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we look at Illinois’ proposed crypto bill, a Federal Judge taking on the SEC over current regulatory uncertainty, the EU’s bill to regulate smart contracts, and Russia’s first CBDC regulation draft.</p><p>But no matter what regulatory measures authorities take to reign in the broader crypto market, they need to keep the end-users in mind. The industry stakeholders, too, have a role to play here, as they are expected to ensure minimal impact on user experience and privacy while complying with relevant crypto regulations.</p><p>Now, let’s dive straight into the&nbsp;recap.</p> Illinois Proposes a Bill to Regulate&nbsp;Crypto <p>Illinois’ proposed crypto bill (House Bill 3479), also called the Digital Assets Regulation Act (DARA), seeks to regulate crypto business activity in Illinois.</p><p>The bill, which has received mostly negative reactions from the crypto industry, grants the state more power to investigate unapproved digital asset transactions and arrest those against the guidelines.</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/lund_dane/status/1635010445672349696?s=20">Image Source</a>)</p><p>In the process of providing regulatory clarity to the fast-evolving cryptocurrency space, the bill is also “making it very difficult for companies to comply” by creating a very tight window for submitting an application and gaining approval.</p> Federal Judge Blames the SEC for “Highly Uncertain” Regulatory Environment <p>Presiding over the SEC vs. Binance US case over Voyager’s acquisition, the bankruptcy Judge Michael E. Wiles laid into SEC for relying on “hyperbole or on ‘straw man’ arguments.”</p><p>Speaking of the regulatory nature of crypto trading platforms and the security nature of crypto, the judge noted, “the Commission itself has not taken any position” on such subjects.</p><blockquote>Judge Wiles also said that although the crypto exchanges have been operating in the space for years, they were left “without being subject to clear and well-defined regulatory requirements.”</blockquote><p>Not to mention, “regulators themselves cannot seem to agree” as to whether cryptocurrencies are commodities and subject to CFTC regulation or securities and subject to securities laws, “or neither, or even on what criteria should be applied in making the decision.”</p><blockquote>“I do not know how any party could possibly be expected to address the SEC’s comments with the limited guidance that the SEC has provided,” leaving everyone to only “guess as to what the arguments might have been,” said the&nbsp;judge.</blockquote> EU Passes Bill to Regulate Smart Contracts <p>The European Parliament passed the 2022 Data Act on March 14 with 500 votes in favor and 23 against it, which includes provisions on smart contracts. It mandates that smart contracts must have access controls, protect trade secrets, and have functions to terminate or&nbsp;reset.</p><p>The new rules will come into force in 2024, and companies will have to adhere to them to serve EU-based consumers.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1636012086697377794?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The essential requirements regarding smart contracts for data sharing are covered under Article 30 of the Data Act. And while the provisions primarily target the Internet of Things (IoT), they could also affect DeFi and crypto if their reach and scope remain&nbsp;unclear.</p> Russia Approves First Draft for CBDC Regulation <p>The Russian Parliament has approved draft laws establishing a system to issue and regulate CBDC in a first reading on March 16. The Russian State Duma also approved the first reading of a bill that makes changes to the Russian Civil Code and defines the digital ruble as “non-cash money.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1637150062466703361?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The two bills, which will go through a review process before being finalized in the second reading that’ll take place in the coming months, mainly cover gaps in regulation stemming from the digitalization of a currency.</p><p>The bill’s current version proposes authorizing the Russian central bank to process users’ personal data without consent. As such, the Parliament has instructed the financial markets committee to ensure that personal data will be protected appropriately in the new digital ruble system for the second&nbsp;reading.</p><p>The legislation establishes a foundational framework for the digital ruble, including setting up a platform to issue the CBDC, developing wallets for storing it, and defining procedures to access the platform and participant rules.</p> Interesting Reads&nbsp;📰 <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/gibraltar-based-xapo-bank-to-enable-usdc-services-amidst-banking-crisis">Gibraltar-Based Xapo Bank to Enable USDC Services Amidst Banking&nbsp;Crisis</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/most-googled-questions-on-fatf-travel-rule-answered">The Most Googled Questions on FATF Travel Rule&nbsp;Answered</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>On Friday, March 3, 2023, Dock’s mainnet was upgraded in order to launch an Ethereum bridge later this year, enhance security, and improve performance. </p><p>The Dock-Ethereum bridge will enable users to:</p>  Efficiently transfer Ether on Dock’s highly scalable blockchain or move native Dock tokens to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be swapped for other Ethereum-based assets  Dock tokens can be bought on Ethereum and transferred to the Dock blockchain   What Is a Blockchain Bridge and Why Are Blockchain Bridges Important? <p>A blockchain bridge is like a digital connection that allows different blockchain networks to communicate with each other. Each blockchain network has its own unique set of rules and processes for recording transactions, and they often can't talk to each other directly. Blockchain bridges make it easier for people to use different blockchain networks, exchange assets, share information, and access new opportunities.</p><p>Think of it like a bridge between two islands. Without a bridge, people and goods would have to travel by boat or airplane, which can be slow and inefficient. But with a bridge, people and goods can travel quickly and easily between the two islands.</p><p>Similarly, blockchain bridges make it easier and faster to transfer assets and information between different blockchain networks, which helps to increase the efficiency and interoperability of the entire blockchain ecosystem. </p><p>Stay tuned for more updates on the development of our tech!</p> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently and securely.

   ForgeRock Announces Major Expansion of Passwordless Capabilities with the Introduction of Enterprise Connect Passwordless 

<p>Ten years ago, the launch of the FIDO Alliance spurred industry-wide interest in passwordless authentication. In the years since, we've seen a lot of progress on the path toward passwordless including ForgeRock being the first major IAM platform to offer support for FIDO2 Web Authentication (WebAuthn). Now the world's largest device, browser, and operating system manufacturers <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/apple-google-and-microsoft-commit-to-expanded-support-for-fido-standard-to-accelerate-availability-of-passwordless-sign-ins/">have jumped on board</a> with support of passkeys. The good news is that more and more consumer websites are introducing support for passkeys. Even better news: it all is becoming simpler and more convenient for the user, and security is vastly improved at the same time — a huge win-win and growing optimism that passwords can be eliminated once and for all.</p>

<p>However, progress in fully eliminating passwords has hit stumbling blocks. Common challenges across enterprises involve integrating legacy applications that will always require a password, migrating user bases gradually at their pace of readiness rather than a big bang approach, and account recovery processes when a device is lost or stolen. Solving these challenges requires more than just having authentication that supports passwordless, but also requires an IAM platform that offers real-time user access orchestration and integration into everything from legacy to modern applications.</p>

<p>Today, I'm thrilled to announce a major step forward on the path toward a completely passwordless world and the realization of ForgeRock's vision of a world where you never login again. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">ForgeRock Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> expands on our leading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">passwordless solution</a> and provides simple integrations to solve enterprises' most complex, often legacy-based, use cases.</p>

	<blockquote><p>According to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4007059">Gartner</a>, by 2025 more than 50% of the workforce and more than 20% of customer authentication transactions will be passwordless, up from less than 10% today.</p><p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/4007059">Gartner</a>, "Take 3 Steps Toward Passwordless Authentication"Refreshed 22 February 2023, Ant Allan, Published 19 October 2021. GARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally and is used herein with permission.

<p>Enterprise Connect Passwordless is integrated into our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> and protects the most commonly used and vulnerable enterprise resources, such as servers, workstations, remote desktops, and VPNs. It helps proactively defend against cyber-attacks and unauthorized access by providing a more secure passwordless login experience.</p>

 Eliminating Passwords in Stages 

<p>With ForgeRock, you can move to passwordless at your own pace without facing an all-or-nothing proposition. There are multiple possible stages, each providing a better user experience and simultaneously improving security.</p>

<p></p>
	
<p>Passwordless Factor</p>
<p>For purists out there, you would say this is not passwordless — and I can understand this point of view. However, providing support for biometrics, such as Face ID or Touch ID, as a second factor in MFA is considerably better than the alternatives, such as one-time passcodes transmitted over SMS text messages, <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/questionsand-buzz-surrounding-draft-nist-special-publication-800-63-3">which NIST deprecated in 2017</a>. We recommend customers take this step no matter where they are on the passwordless journey.</p>

<p>Passwordless Experience</p>
<p>One of the biggest threats involving passwords comes from users knowing their passwords, which can then be compromised. The idea behind a passwordless experience is removing user knowledge and interaction with passwords, while there still may be passwords involved somewhere in the equation, particularly in legacy applications. The reality is that this stage of passwordless is likely where enterprises will be for some time while there are so many applications that simply are not ready for passwordless. But that's ok — if there is nothing to phish or brute force, then that is significant progress. Our new Enterprise Connect Passwordless offering delivers exactly on this promise.</p>

<p>Complete Passwordless</p>
<p>The holy grail, the point where there are no passwords anywhere in the enterprise. We expect this to occur much faster in the world of consumer identity (CIAM) because typically there are far fewer applications involved and we expect them to support passwordless sooner. ForgeRock is ready to support this now with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">leading passwordless solutions</a>.</p>

 A Complete Platform Approach to Achieving Passwordless 
<p>No matter the approach planned, having a complete IAM platform that provides flexibility to support your passwordless journey is critical. In addition to supporting a variety of authentication methods, the platform must be capable of orchestration to gradually move users to better and more secure experiences, and also integrate into all types of enterprise resources.</p>
	
<p></p>
	
<p>Authentication Methods</p>
<p>The ForgeRock platform supports an expansive set of authentication methods, such as FIDO2 WebAuthn, passkeys, Oath, push, one-time passcodes (OTPs), biometrics, and others, to enable passwordless using mobile authenticators, smart cards, biometric devices, digital certificates, platforms (Apple ID and Microsoft Hello), browsers, and applications.</p>

<p>Access Orchestration</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">ForgeRock's identity orchestration capabilities</a>, you can tailor drag-and-drop passwordless authentication journeys to provide both strong security and a better user experience. For example, the authentication process can include analyzing risk signals, such as device ID and IP address, as part of the passwordless login process. Organizations can create these journeys with little or no code using pre-built nodes, and reuse these nodes to provide passwordless authentication.</p>

<p>Application Integrations</p>
<p>Building on top of ForgeRock's already rich integration technologies — including broad identity standards support, software development kits, web and Java agents, and Identity Gateway — ForgeRock Enterprise Connect Passwordless integrates with an extensive list of components in the enterprise infrastructure, including Windows, Mac and Unix workstations and servers, RADIUS-based authentication, Remote Desktop (virtual and Windows), VPNs, databases, mainframes, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs, and many more.</p>

 Realize the Benefits of Passwordless With ForgeRock 

<p>The goal of our passwordless strategy is to enable you to mitigate one of the biggest security risks your organization faces — passwords — while delivering great user experiences. We think we've done that with Enterprise Connect Passwordless for our workforce customers and, with our support for WebAuthn and passkeys, for our CIAM customers. Now, customers can realize the benefits of better protection against breaches and drastically reduced costs as a result of far fewer help desk tickets and a reduction in lost productivity.</p>

   ForgeRock CTO Eve Maler answers seven critical questions 

<p>ForgeRock's purpose is to help people simply and safely access the connected world. Passwordless capabilities are helping us do that in exciting new ways, solving problems for consumers as well as enterprise workforces. But passwordless is often misunderstood and over-hyped. I recently spoke with Eve Maler about her perspective on passwordless and the questions she most frequently addresses. Here are seven of them.</p>
	
  What does passwordless authentication really mean? 
 <p>EM: Let's start from the beginning: authentication is defined in terms of factors, and if you mix factors, your authentication gets stronger. So, one factor may be something you know, like a password; another is something you have, like a device that's been associated with you; finally, a factor may be something you are, such as a fingerprint or another biometric that is unique to you.</p>

<p>If you mix any two of those, you get two-factor authentication, or 2FA. If you mix multiple factors, you get multi-factor authentication, or MFA. Passwordless, at its simplest, means the absence of a password for authentication. But I want to get a little more specific.</p>

<p>A password is what is known as a static shared secret, which means that it's a secret that both sides know and that persists over time, perhaps 90 days per enterprise policy, or even possibly many years. Some representation of this password, secured and scrambled, has to be stored on a server, so that when you type it in somewhere it gets checked.</p>

<p>So passwordless relies on something you have or something you are — and no longer something you know. Push authentication is a good example. QR codes and magic links are others. Often, people talk about "passwordless" – even when referring to it as an additional factor on top of passwords to add up to 2FA or MFA. We call this approach a passwordless factor. Unfortunately, as soon as you do that, you have all the frailties of involving a static shared secret. The total experience is not passwordless. Essentially, you can interpret a passwordless factor plus a password as plain old MFA.</p>

  So, how can we do better than passwordless as an authentication factor? 
 <p>EM: If passwordless is done right, it gets you a long way down the path to increasing security –&nbsp;and certainly improving the experience.</p>

<p>We call this complete passwordless, where the user doesn't have the experience of interacting with a static shared secret at all because there isn't one. And it is possible, for example, with a magic link and other methods, to eliminate that static shared secret. Since the user's not interacting with the password, you get rid of all the security risks and usability issues of static shared secrets.</p>

<p>Enabling consumers to encounter complete passwordless is a little bit easier than it is for employees. There's a whole stack of technology that employees interact with — it's not always going to be a web app or a mobile app or some SaaS service. It'll be things like Oracle databases or logging into a VPN, and it's hard to make databases and VPNs stop expecting passwords.</p>

  Passwordless can mitigate certain threats, like man-in-the-middle attacks where a password is grabbed in transit, but is it enough to only eliminate password-based attacks? 
 <p>EM: When it comes to passwords, some prevention is definitely better than none. Our most recent Consumer Identity Breach Report revealed that threats using compromised credentials, particularly unauthorized access, accounted for fully half of all data breaches in 2021. It showed the danger of breaches that release credentials into the wild again and again.</p>

<p>It's been a one-two punch. You know, credentials just have to be stolen once, and from there, they can often be used to perpetrate many more data-rich breaches. And there are many risks, such as medical identity theft, insurance, fraud — massive numbers of account takeovers and lateral movement across all kinds of different environments within an enterprise.</p>

<p>Where complete passwordless isn't possible due to the complexity of IT systems, it's possible to enable what we call a passwordless experience. In these cases, there may be a password behind the scenes but it can remain untouched by human hands, so to speak. Workforce users can avoid actually having to see or experience the password. And that in itself is a big mitigation against some other threats when a password still exists and still works.</p>

  Speaking of workforce, what are key differences in a passwordless journey for a consumer deployment vs. workforce? 
 <p>EM: The widely available consumer devices are much more in play, because, hey, you're not the boss of them, so they get to choose. For example, you can't make your consumers stop using that old Android device that everyone knows is terrible for security.</p>

<p>So, you have to roll with the devices they choose. Luckily, these days the FIDO standards tend to be pre-integrated or pre-enabled in modern laptops, smartphones, and tablets. And there are even a few circumstances where consumers are incentivized to use a security key – a hard authenticator or hard token. It might be a FIDO-enabled YubiKey.</p>

<p>In the enterprise, it's easier to provide interface shims around the workforce users to provide that passwordless experience, letting them avoid interactions with passwords. This makes it safer and it can also result in a great experience if it's designed well. That's exactly what we do with our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/enterprise-connect-passwordless">Enterprise Connect Passwordless</a> offering. It enables passwordless experiences for a lot of use cases in the employee's environment.</p>

  I heard you say that we may not always be able to achieve complete passwordless in the enterprise, but can we get far enough to see a more secure environment? 
 <p>EM: Yes. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It's possible to be better — and in different, clever ways for different users and for different kinds of services and applications. And that's what I think of as the subtle art of orchestrating the journey, so that you make sure to improve the experience and reduce the friction, along with increasing the security. It's crucial, because everybody's felt the pain of plain old MFA, right? I mean, nobody likes it, even though they're being forced to do it more often.</p>

  You mentioned FIDO. Is FIDO implementation required for passwordless? 
 <p>EM: FIDO is the Fast IDentity Online Alliance. ForgeRock is a sponsor member of FIDO. The FIDO2 WebAuthn standards are the latest in a series of standards that have been created to enable interoperability and security around the use of different authentication methods.</p>

<p>FIDO2 WebAuthn has become very popular, partly because of the adoption by Apple, Google, and Microsoft — the makers of so many popular devices, browsers, and operating systems in the world. It's a big deal because they've decided that FIDO2 WebAuthn is something worth baking into their products and, in some cases, laptops and other hardware enable FIDO-based fingerprint unlock.</p>

<p>Passkeys, otherwise known as multi-device credentials, are the very latest thing from FIDO. For multi-device credentials, you register one device — here I am waving around my iPhone! — and, because I've got my identity connected throughout the Apple ecosystem, I have my iPad and the laptop that I'm speaking to you on — all those things know the same "me." I wouldn't have to pre-register any of these other devices to save me in case I lost my phone.</p>

<p>While passkeys are becoming popular primarily for consumer-facing use cases, like web and mobile apps, enterprise employees are people too. They're often in a bring-your-own-device situation and FIDO helps strong auth and complete passwordless to be more readily applied to these kinds of user-centric environments. FIDO is not strictly required for passwordless. As I already mentioned, there are ways you can integrate to those IT systems that are trickier and maybe older and less configurable and less customizable, so as to remove passwords from the employee's experience.</p>

  How would you advise organizations that want to get started with passwordless? 
 <p>EM: First, I advise them to stick to standards. SAML and OAuth and OpenID Connect — leveraging those standards for secure single sign-on pairs really well with a properly designed passwordless environment.</p>

<p>Of course, single sign-on helps reduce the number of apps that need to be enabled. So that's something to consider. And then picking the population, the risk level, the particular apps that you want to focus on first — go in phases, parcel that out.</p>

<p>While you're doing any kind of rollout, it's really important not to disable existing methods until you've collected enough telemetry to identify emerging issues.</p>

<p>Other things to do: design authentication journeys to be adaptive and responsive. One size really can't fit all. Different organizations have different backends, they have different needs, different risk appetites, different fraud levels. And so, it's important to design the journeys that make sense for your business. And that's where <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a>, commonly known as "Trees," really shines.</p>

<p>And then the last advice I have is to fold fraud management into the authentication experience. A.I. is a companion to orchestration as it does some of that heuristic checking of the environment to make sure it smells right. You can do those checks silently. And if you decide you don't want to be silent and you want to actually approach your user and ask them to prove themselves more thoroughly with transactional authorization, then you can do that.</p>
	
<p>For CISOs and CIOs — for anyone in the enterprise who is looking at the user experience end of it and feeling the pain of fraud — the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">actuality of eliminating passwords</a> is really attractive.</p>

<p>This is one of an occasional series examining misconceptions that people have about personal data empowerment and personal data&nbsp;stores.</p><p>Sometimes in debates about personal data people at opposite ends of the spectrum seem to end up agreeing. Privacy is a case in point. “Privacy is dead!” declare some campaigners. “That’s a terrible thing! Something should be done about&nbsp;it!”</p><p>“Privacy is dead,” agree some Big Tech apologists. “It’s just an inevitable by-product of the way technology is evolving. Get used to it!”. The two sides might disagree about whether privacy being dead is good or bad. But they agree on the underlying point nevertheless.</p><p>This isn’t helpful, and this blog explains&nbsp;why.</p> ‘Resistance is&nbsp;futile’ <p>First, we need to be wary of the ways in which some people use claims about ‘facts’ as stalking horses for the hidden agendas. The claim that ‘privacy as dead’ is a case in&nbsp;point.</p><p>The underlying message of the ‘Privacy is dead, get used to it’ brigade, for example, is that “resistance is futile”. This is the central message of all tyrannies, because tyranny only succeeds when people accept that resistance is futile. The other side of the coin is that tyrannies always fail once people adopt the stance ‘we will resist, no matter&nbsp;what’.</p><p>Either way, this isn’t actually a debate about the facts (in this case the supposedly unstoppable impacts of new digital technologies). It’s about whether we accept, or refuse to accept, something that is toxic and&nbsp;unfair.</p> So what are the&nbsp;facts? <p>Leaving the rhetoric of hidden agendas aside, what are the facts about privacy? In simple terms, it’s true that in order to operate, many digital services have to do things that are potentially invasive of privacy. To provide a location-based service for example, you have to know where the person is located. The question then arises, what does the organisation collecting this data do with&nbsp;it?</p><p>It’s also true that new digital technologies and services are generating data about things that were once intensely private — such as search generating real time data about our personal interests and intentions. Which again, raises profound questions about how such information is used, by&nbsp;who.</p><p>However, it’s also true that even though platforms like Google (Alphabet), Facebook (Meta) and Apple have accumulated eye-watering amounts of data about people, they still actually know surprisingly little about us. That’s because equally eye-watering amounts of data are held by other bodies that these platforms have no access to — bodies like banks, health services, tax authorities and other public services.</p><p>The way our data system is structured means that individuals’ data is dispersed across hundreds of different organisations. Try as hard as they might, via various schemes and initiatives, the digital platforms’ most determined efforts to move into these spaces (via health and financial apps and services for example) have resulted in only minor&nbsp;inroads.</p><p>So, No. The dispersed nature of today’s data ecosystem means that no matter how some people might wish otherwise, privacy is not dead, because no single organisation has access to all the data they need to kill&nbsp;it.</p> What do we mean by ‘privacy’? <p>There are, however, some important subtleties in this debate. It doesn’t help, for example, that ‘privacy’ has become a bit of an Alice in Wonderland word, where people use to mean what they want it to&nbsp;mean.</p><p>For some people, privacy is mainly about civil liberties and the dangers of an all-too-powerful ‘database state’. For others, it’s about ‘surveillance capitalism’ and the activities of big commercial platforms like Facebook and Google. For others, it’s a simple sense that we don’t like people snooping into our&nbsp;affairs.</p><p>These are all real issues, but they are not necessarily the same issues requiring the same solutions. When a word is used to mean whatever a person wants it to mean, debates can quickly get lost in crossed purposes without finding a way&nbsp;forward.</p><p>That’s why we at Mydex stay clear of the word ‘privacy’ if we can. Instead, we focus on the human needs and emotions that debates about privacy relate to, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Safety: not being put at risk of harm or&nbsp;abuse  Agency / control: being able to act effectively in the world as opposed to feeling powerless and&nbsp;helpless  Fairness: not being taken advantage of; not having to submit to another party’s excess&nbsp;power  <p>Also, while privacy and data protection lie at the heart of everything we at Mydex do, we are not pursuing the goals of ‘privacy’ or ‘control’ as ends in themselves. We are just as much pursuing them as means to another end: of enabling individuals to access and use their data to manage and improve their own lives. ‘Privacy’ is not just about abstract principles. It’s about the practicalities of getting stuff done in our lives. It’s about utility: the practical benefits of utility and its emotional benefits, arising from a sense of safety, agency and fairness.</p><p>When you see privacy in these practical human terms, the answer to the question becomes instantly clear. ‘Privacy’ will never die because human beings’ quest for utility, safety, agency and fairness will never&nbsp;die.</p> The Privacy&nbsp;Paradox <p>Another subtlety in this debate lies with the privacy paradox. In survey after survey people say they are extremely concerned about privacy issues, but their day-to-day actions seem to belie this concern. Just look at the way people fail to assert their rights to stop cookies being placed on their computer, or tick boxes giving unnecessary consent to organisations accessing their&nbsp;data.</p><p>For some, this is evidence that people don’t really care about privacy at all: “People say they care because they know they should. But they are dissembling. We don’t need to take what they say at face&nbsp;value”.</p><p>There is, however, another much better explanation of this phenomenon. It boils down to ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness">learned helplessness</a>’. If people begin to believe that no matter how hard they try, they still won’t be able to affect the outcome, then they stop even bothering to&nbsp;try.</p><p>Learned helplessness is compounded by other human factors like salience and so-called ‘hyperbolic discounting’. Some things — like chocolate — offer immediate tangible benefits. With other things however, like saving for a pension, the costs are immediate and tangible but the benefits are diffuse and distant. The more diffuse and distant something becomes, the harder it is for us flawed humans to act on it as we&nbsp;should.</p><p>Protecting our privacy can often seem very diffuse and distant, especially when we are busy trying to access a service to get something done. Knowing this full well, many organisations have developed the art of confusing, bamboozling, overwhelming and obfuscating to such a high degree — with hundred-page gobbledygook small print infested privacy policies and T&amp;Cs, for example — that for many people learned helplessness is now their default mode of behaviour.</p><p>Which takes us back to the ‘resistance is futile’ argument, except this time the statement ‘privacy is dead’ reveals itself not as a statement of fact but as a statement of intent: that they intend to make resistance futile, if at all possible. They want to make people feel as helpless as possible.</p> Conclusion <p>For us at Mydex, personal data empowerment is about a lot more than ‘privacy’. It’s about the human needs and emotions of safety, agency and fairness that underlie it. And it’s about being able to express these needs and emotions practically: being able to collect and use our own data to improve our own&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Given this, there is one aspect about the privacy debate that we don’t like. By focusing only on what organisations do with the data they collect, debates about privacy tends to generate a negative framing: a focus on how to stop organisations doing bad things — which ignores the other, more important side of the coin of how to empower citizens to do positive&nbsp;things.</p><p>In the context of empowering people to use their own data to improve their own lives, ‘privacy’ is a simple, basic sine qua non; a foundation for everything else that follows. Once people are provided with the tools that make it simple and easy to collect and use their own data for their own purposes, ‘privacy’ becomes a no-brainer.</p><p>Far from being dead, it’s only just waking&nbsp;up.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/is-privacy-dead-ef236d38867d">Is Privacy Dead?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Learn more about the latest scam to hit the crypto industry, how it works, how to spot it, and which KYC measures can help prevent it. 



 



<p>Despite the nightmare-inducing name, a “pig butchering scam” (or “pork butcher scam”) is a type of fraud that tends to take place over a long period of time, and combines elements from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a>, crypto fraud, and investment schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The name derives from the Chinese expression “Sha Zhu Pan,” which translates as “butchering a pig.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The analogy refers to the process of gaining the victim’s trust or “fattening up” a pig before stealing crypto or funds, i.e., the butchering. The scam often involves a ring of scammers scouring social media and dating platforms for potential victims.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The large-scale and long-game scamming technique became widely reported in 2019, and initially targeted men in China. However, scammers quickly broadened their horizons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While there is no specific data on pig butchering scams in the UK, crypto fraud is becoming more common. According to ActionFraud, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/29/everything-is-fake-how-global-gangs-are-using-uk-shell-companies-in-multi-million-pound-crypto-scams">reported losses</a> in all cryptocurrency frauds surged 72% to above £329 million in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These scams are carried out on a large scale, on an industrial scale — like they’re doing fraud in a factory,” said Jan Santiago, the deputy director of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2022/09/09/pig-butchering-crypto-super-scam/?sh=2c610cf1ec8e">Global Anti-Scam Organization</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pig butchering scams have been identified around the world, from the US to Germany. An investigation led by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism discovered that organized crime syndicates use the UK as a virtual ground for their activities, capitalizing on the lax Companies House registration system to execute fraud on a commercial scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately 168 UK-based corporations have been arraigned for operating crypto or Forex trading scams, with half of the scams likely associated with pig butchering fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 How do pig butchering scams in crypto work?&nbsp; 



<p>Pig butchering scams involve scammers contacting prospective victims and gaining their trust by befriending or flirting with them. Earning the victim’s trust can often take several months, depending on the commitment of the criminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pig butchering scammer usually creates a fake social media account on platforms to reach out to prospective victims. Their goal is to find a victim and become their “friend” or “lover” via cordial discussions or through the act of “love-bombing.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such a scam may begin with something as simple as a text from an unknown number or a DM on a social media platform or dating site. Scammers also often pose as long-lost contacts to the victim they target. Typically, the scammer (or scammers) poses as an attractive, wealthy, and young individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After exchanging various messages, voice notes, and selfies, among other things, the topic of finance will be brought up. If often appears as natural as having a conversation with friends about current affairs. The scammer may also talk about friends she knows who have earned significantly via crypto or currency trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the victim is coerced into converting their funds into crypto, transferring them to a digital wallet or trading platform under the scammer’s control. The scammer may give the victim the impression that they are earning money or even allow them to withdraw some of their initial “profits” to earn their trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later, when the victim tries to withdraw funds, the account imposes fees or taxes on them. Once the victim realizes the platform is not legitimate, their transactions have already disappeared on the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



 How to spot a pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>All pig butchering scammers run on a similar pattern. Similar to other scams, it helps to avoid transactions requesting upfront payment in crypto. Avoid taking financial advice from someone you have never met.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To avoid being a victim of such a crime, take note of these points:&nbsp;</p>



  Scammers usually contact victims via social media or dating apps. They also send text messages “accidentally” to start conversations with victims. Avoid responding to unsolicited texts and block or report the person sending them.&nbsp;<br>  Fraudsters gradually instill trust in their victims before bringing up the topic of investment. Be wary of any investment advice promising significant profits. Avoid sharing personal and financial information with an online contact.&nbsp;  



  Since scammers want their victims to trust them, some promise extravagant gifts and exorbitant trips abroad. If the so-called scammer’s promises seem unrealistic, it is best to block them.&nbsp;<br>  The scammer will convince the victim to download an investment app and trade with them to demonstrate how it works. The platform will first allow small withdrawals. Later, upon more significant cash withdrawal requests, the platform may impose taxes or fees and inform the victim that their account has been frozen and that paying the fees is the only solution.<br>  The scammer’s recommended site may have a misspelled URL. Always make 100% sure you are using a legitimate website.&nbsp;<br>  As more people become aware of scams, they become less successful. Therefore, the nature of scamming is constantly evolving. Keeping up to date on the latest scam trends will help keep you up to date.

 Tightening security measures against pig butchering scams and fraud in crypto.&nbsp; 



<p>The FBI and Interpol have issued warnings, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003">PSAs</a>, and guidelines on how to avoid pig butchering scams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In September 2020, the European Union agreed to create a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulatory framework to reduce the imminent risks for consumers investing in cryptocurrencies. The established <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">rules</a> mean crypto providers would be liable for investors’ cryptocurrency asset losses. The regulation is expected to enter into force in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On 10 January 2020, the FCA <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/cryptoassets">implemented</a> new crypto-focused regulations to oversee companies operating in the sector and to ensure they follow the same AML and CFT regulations as the ones in conventional financial markets. Presently, all cryptocurrency firms based in the UK must adhere to money laundering regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2023, the UK’s National Crime Agency announced plans for a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/crypto-crime-crackdown/">new division</a> to tackle crypto crime called “Crypto Cell.” Just a month later, UK’s HM Treasury also recently proposed a crypto-regulatory <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">regime</a> in its consultation paper.&nbsp;</p>



 How KYC can fight crypto fraud and pig butchering scams.&nbsp; 



<p>Through rigorous KYC measures, such as document validation and biometric authentication, crypto platforms can verify the identity of genuine users to prevent pig butchering scams. Crypto platforms can also integrate systems that are able to conduct detailed pool monitoring of activity associated with each user transaction and set up alerts for suspicious activities to strengthen their fraud prevention techniques overall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A robust KYC process can help crypto platforms determine the possible risk linked to a customer, strengthening user trust, reputation, and customer satisfaction. By verifying users’ identities, exchanges can prevent criminal activity like money laundering and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/terrorist-financing/">terrorist financing</a>, and other fraudulent operations like pig butchering scams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Crypto transactions generally cannot be reversed, making them rather appealing to bad actors in their fraudulent pursuits. Pig butchering&nbsp;scams can also be difficult to track and prosecute, as the scammers often operate anonymously and from offshore locations,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>When operating online, individuals should be vigilant and avoid sending crypto&nbsp;to anyone&nbsp;not met in person, no matter how convincing their story. When it comes to crypto, it is always better to be safe than sorry.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow</blockquote>



 Better KYC processes to the rescue.&nbsp; 



<p>Scammers involved in pig butchering scams exploit dating, social media platforms, and messaging applications to draw victims into scams and steal their assets. This has led to warnings from authorities in the US, UK, and other affected countries and regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crypto exchange platforms must use the KYC process to confirm their customers’ personal data and better understand their activities, verifying their identity, and thus mitigating crypto scams like pig butchering schemes.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a>&nbsp;are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, even amid an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">evolving crypto regulatory landscape</a>. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s terminally-online age, fraud is a growing and ever-present concern for businesses.</p>
<p>Why is fraud detection important? Because successful fraud attempts can cost businesses significantly in time, money, and reputation.</p>
 What Is Fraud Detection? 
<p>Fraud detection identifies and prevents fraud before malicious parties execute illegal or damaging actions. Fraud detection systems use various techniques, including data analytics, machine learning, and behavioral analysis, to identify patterns of suspicious behavior to flag potential fraud.</p>
<p>Fraud is a constant and ongoing problem for many businesses, as it can cause significant financial losses and damage to reputation. By using fraud detection measures, companies can proactively monitor their systems and take steps to prevent fraud before it occurs.</p>
 What Are the Components of Fraud Detection? 
<p>Fraud detection systems use various techniques to identify patterns of suspicious behavior and potentially flag fraud. As fraud threats become more and more sophisticated, the processes used to prevent those threats must match them equally.</p>
<p>Some common components of fraud detection systems include:</p>
 
 Data Analysis: Fraud detection systems rely on big data to identify behavior patterns (like those from account access or shopping) to determine potentially fraudulent activity. 
 Machine Learning: Fraud detection systems use machine learning to analyze the data and identify behavior patterns in ways humans cannot. Furthermore, these algorithms can make real-time decisions to mitigate fraudulent activity before it becomes a problem. 
 Real-Time Alerts: Fraud detection systems are designed to provide real-time alerts when potential fraud is detected. This allows businesses to take immediate action to prevent fraud and limit the damage caused by fraudulent activities. 
 Biometrics: Biometric authentication can go a long way in preventing fraud by requiring that an authorized user is present to OK any particular activity. This limits the ability of hackers, especially those distributed worldwide, from breaking into accounts to commit fraud. 
 Zero-Trust identification: Zero-trust principles state that no user or identity should be implicitly trusted at any point of authentication or authorization. Using zero-trust identity management, you can place many more roadblocks in front of fraudsters that rely on lenient privilege systems. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Implementing Fraud Detection? 
<p>There are several benefits of using fraud detection systems for businesses. Here are some of the key benefits:</p>
 
 Early Mitigation: Fraud detection systems can identify bad behavior early, meaning mitigation and remediation (if necessary) can happen much sooner–minimizing the impact of fraud if not outright eliminating it. 
 Reduced Costs: In terms of costs, those associated with actual fraud are often much more significant versus those associated implementing fraud detection. This means that it’s a huge revenue loss to cut corners and not deal with fraud at all. 
 Stakeholder Trust: Customers, banks, credit providers, and financial investors trust organizations more when they take fraud seriously. On top of being irresponsible, the refusal to implement fraud detection signals that a company doesn’t value money or personal information. 
 Compliance: Some industries, such as finance and healthcare, have specific regulatory requirements for fraud detection. In these cases, it’s not just a benefit but a requirement. 
 
<p>By implementing advanced technologies and best practices for fraud detection, businesses can reduce their exposure to fraud, increase efficiency, and enhance their competitive market position.</p>
 What Are Some of the Challenges of Implementing Fraud Detection Measures? 
<p>While fraud detection systems are effective at identifying and preventing many types of fraud, businesses also face several challenges when implementing and using these systems. Here are some of the key difficulties against fraud detection:</p>
 
 Sophisticated Fraud: Hackers and fraudsters are constantly adapting tactics to stay ahead of fraud detection systems. The ever-growing online banking and shopping market doesn’t make dealing with these threats any easier, either. Organizations must remain vigilant. 
 Big Data Processing: Fraud detection systems rely on large volumes of data to identify patterns of suspicious behavior, and without proper data collection tools, many detection measures will not be accurate. 
 False Positives: Fraud detection systems can sometimes generate false positives, flagging legitimate transactions as suspicious and causing unnecessary customer delays or inconvenience. This can harm customer experience and potentially lead to a bad reputation. 
 Cost: Implementing and maintaining fraud detection systems can be costly, which makes these systems out of the reach of small- or mid-sized businesses. While the costs of fraud may be higher, that doesn’t much matter if the company cannot afford advanced fraud detection. 
 
<p>While fraud detection systems are essential for preventing fraud, they require ongoing attention and maintenance to remain effective.</p>
 What Are Common Types of Fraud? 
<p>Fraud is a wide-ranging problem, made more so due to the fact that digital spaces and eCommerce sites are particularly ripe for exploitation.</p>
<p>Types of cyber fraud can include:</p>
 
 Identity Theft: This occurs when a fraudster steals personal information, such as their name, date of birth, Social Security number, or credit card details, and uses it to pretend to be that person. This then allows them to make purchases, sign up for credit cards, or access bank accounts as that individual. 
 Phishing Scams: One of the more common forms of cyber attacks, phishing involves sending fraudulent emails, texts, or messages via teleconferencing software that appear to be from a trusted source to trick people into providing their personal information. This information can be used to access unauthorized accounts or commit various forms of identity theft. 
 
<p>These scams are especially problematic in contexts like spear phishing and whaling, which can lead to massive <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/ceo-fraud/">CEO fraud</a>.</p>
 
 Chargeback Fraud: This fraud involves a cardholder challenging a legitimate credit card charge with their bank. Because banks often side with customers, this means that merchants can lose out on revenue, and the individual still keeps their items. On top of that, the merchant and the banks will have to pay significant fees to credit card networks upon successful chargeback, costing them tens of thousands of dollars. 
 Credit Card Fraud: This kind of fraud occurs when a fraudster uses another person’s credit card to make unauthorized purchases. Credit card fraud is often part of larger fraud schemes, like identity theft. 
 Money Laundering: Modern money laundering is heavily influenced by digital banking and commerce, making it that much harder for financial institutions to catch fraudsters. This is why <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws provide several layers of guidance on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/secure-authentication/">secure authentication</a> and identity verification, especially for large-scale banking and investing.

<p>By Dr Paul Ashley,&nbsp;co-CEO and CTO, Anonyome Labs</p>



<p>This article was originally published in Michael Bazzell’s Unredacted magazine, January 2023. To learn more, view the&nbsp;<a href="https://inteltechniques.com/magazine.html">latest issue</a>.</p>



<p>I’ve been exploring decentralized identity in&nbsp;<a href="https://inteltechniques.com/magazine.html">Unredacted</a>&nbsp;(Issue 2 and Issue 4) so we can better understand this new technology that’s giving users greater control over their personal data and identity. This time, I go straight to decentralized identity’s killer feature: verifiable credentials (VCs). What makes VCs the standout? Simple: VCs are what will make decentralized identity ubiquitous on the internet in the next decade.</p>



 What are VCs?&nbsp; 



<p>VCs are cryptographically protected and privacy-respecting digital documents that convey information about a user. [1] Trusted identity providers (called issuers) create these digital documents. Any physical car or document that a person can carry (e.g. in a wallet) could be replaced with a digital VC—think: digital driver license, digital passport, digital health card, digital travel visa, or even something as mundane as a digital gym membership card or a digital library card.</p>



VC structure



<p>Every credential has an identifier and some metadata but, most importantly, it also has the claims or attributes the issuer is asserting about the holder (user). The issuer digitally signs the credential so verifiers receiving proofs based on the credential can confirm any credential information that is asserted plus the credential’s authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized identity-based VCs are designed to be privacy preserving. The holder (user) maintains absolute control over which elements of their personal information (contained within the credential) they choose to provide. This is very different from physical credentials (e.g. a driver license), where the verifier can always see everything contained within the credential the user presents. Another key benefit of VCs is that the verifier can independently verify them without any communication with the credential’s issuer, which ensures issuers cannot track when the holder uses their credentials.</p>



 How do VCs work?&nbsp; 



<p>You’ll see here the parties involved in VCs, plus the data flow between those parties:</p>







<p>The VC process starts on the left with the issuer. An issuer is an entity (e.g. government or business) that wants to issue VCs. To do that, the issuer must first register some specification information on the blockchain (termed the verifiable data registry). Using the Hyperledger Indy network as an example, the issuer writes their decentralized identifier (DID), the credential schema [2] (which defines the elements of the VC), and the credential definition (linking the issuer DID and credential schema) to the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the issuer has registered information on the blockchain, they can create and issue VCs. It begins with the holder (a user) and issuer forming a DIDComm connection (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md">Aries RFC 0160: Connection Protocol</a>). Over that connection the issuer sends the VC (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md">Aries RFC 0036: Issue Credential Protocol 1.0</a>), which will be stored in the holder’s wallet (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0050-wallets/README.md">Aries RFC 0050: Wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this point, the holder can present their information from the VC to service providers who require it. To do this, the holder establishes a DIDComm connection to the verifier and transfers the VC proof presentation (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0037-present-proof/README.md">Aries RFC 0037: Present Proof Protocol 1.0</a>). The verifier must connect to the blockchain to read the issuer DID (which includes their public key), credential definition, and credential schema, so they can verify the presentation proof.</p>



<p>The key privacy-preserving capabilities of this process include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 The verifier can determine that the credential has not been altered and is authentic.&nbsp; 



 Verification happens without the verifier communicating with the issuer.&nbsp; 



 The holder (user) can select which information from a credential they present to the verifier.&nbsp; 
 



 What are AnonCreds? 



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">AnonCreds</a>&nbsp;or anonymous credentials specification is based on the open source verifiable credential implementation stemming from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>&nbsp;project. Extensive use of AnonCreds worldwide has made it a de facto standard for VCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some important concepts around AnonCreds make it a very attractive solution for VCs, such as:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Anonymity—Using unrevealed identifiers for holder-to-VC binding prevents correlation based on those identifiers. [3] This prevents colluding organizations from correlating user-specific identity information.&nbsp; 



 Revocation—AnonCreds provides a revocation scheme that proves a presentation is based on credentials that the issuer has not revoked.&nbsp; 



 Reduced PII exposure—An implementation of zero knowledge proofs (predicate proofs) helps eliminate the need to share specific PII (e.g. holders can prove they are over age 21 without disclosing their specific birth date).&nbsp; 
 



<p>The current AnonCreds specification matches the existing&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/main/libindy/src/api/anoncreds.rs">Hyperledger Indy SDK (“libindy”)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-shared-rs/tree/main/indy-credx">Indy Credential Exchange</a>&nbsp;(“credx”) implementations, [4] but recently there was a proposal to make AnonCreds a standalone Hyperledger project, which will help it to grow with future enhanced capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One key factor to note is the use of the term proof presentation. This term describes the holder presenting one of three items to the verifier:&nbsp;</p>



 
 all of the data in the credential&nbsp; 



 part of the data in the credential (a partial disclosure)&nbsp; 



 a zero knowledge proof for some data in their credential. 
 



<p>Using ZKPs is a critical aspect of AnonCreds—that is, it is not the actual VC that is presented to the verifier, but rather a cryptographically derived proof that allows the data in the credential to be presented securely. As such, the user can keep more of their PII private while still answering questions such as, “Are you over 21?”, “Do you live in this country?”, or “Do you have a college degree?”</p>



 What are W3C VCs? 



<p>In addition to AnonCreds, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has created the Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1. [5] This W3C recommendation is published and being used in government and commercial applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>W3C VCs are also open source and provide the same basic functionality as AnonCreds—that is, this standard provides holder, issuer, subject, verifier, and verifiable data registry roles and supporting functionality. Some of the main target use cases [6] are:&nbsp;</p>



 
 education—transcripts, test taking, transferring schools, online classes&nbsp; 



 retail—address verification, adult beverages, fraud detection&nbsp; 



 finance—Know Your Customer, money transfer, closing an account, trying a new service, create a bank account from home&nbsp; 



 healthcare—prescriptions, pharmacy, insurance, traveling illnesses, proving legal disability status&nbsp; 



 professional credentials—find a doctor, quality training, job applications&nbsp; 



 legal identity—driver license, immigration, air travel, refugee status&nbsp; 



 intelligent devices—manufacturing, delivery, autonomous.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The W3C VCs standard also supports ZKPs, [7] but not all W3C VCs support being asserted as ZKP responses. The choice of whether to enable this capability is left up to the credential issuer. In order for a holder to assert a ZKP response, they must use a credential that has been created to allow for this purpose. Using W3C VCs for ZKPs requires the issuer to do two things:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Add a proof property to the VC.&nbsp; 



 Where they use a credential definition, also define it in the credential schema property.&nbsp; 
 



<p>So long as those two requirements are met, W3C VCs can be asserted in a zero knowledge fashion, as we covered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AnonCreds and W3C VCs have a lot of similarities and some key distinctions, but that’s a topic for another time. The main point is that both standards describe great implementations of VCs and mainstream platforms will be using both for the foreseeable future.</p>



 



<p>[1] This is the most common case. It is also possible for other scenarios such as the user issuing a credential related to an organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[2] In the future it may be uncommon for issuers to write their own schemas. Instead a standards body could write the schemas and issuers would only write credential definitions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[3] This&nbsp;<a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/">paper</a>&nbsp;by Kaliya Young challenges the notion of “link secrets” as a viable alternative to including the credential subject information. This opinion is in turn refuted by this&nbsp;<a href="https://daniel-hardman.medium.com/response-to-kaliyas-being-real-post-13fddb9410f0">paper</a>&nbsp;by Daniel Hardman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[4] It is also argued in the&nbsp;<a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/">paper</a>&nbsp;by Kaliya Young that not having a mature specification is a weakness not allowing sufficient analysis by the industry and it also lacks a standard for interoperability testing.&nbsp;</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Andrej. I’m originally from Latvia, however, I now live in&nbsp;Germany.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I work in the IT field and my hobby is creating websites. Outside of the tech world, my interests include nature. I love studying and learning about hummingbirds, they’re a unique bird with super strength. I find them very interesting.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I am an ambassador for the Ontology blockchain. I joined the project at its very inception, having invested my savings back in 2017, and in 2021, I became an Ontology harbinger. I also work in a computer company as a technician.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>I would say that the highlight of Ontology’s offering is its Decentralized Identity (DID) products.</p><p>When this technology starts to take root in the real world, it will have an incredible impact. There are so many use cases in our everyday lives for this technology, as well as applications that could potentially change the world. DIDs can completely redefine areas like cybersecurity and the Internet of Things, supply chains, and civic participation, but they’ll also play a huge role in addressing human rights issues and furthering innovation.</p><p>I try to draw the attention of other people to this project as much as possible! I engage in discussions about what blockchain is, how important DIDs are, and how they can be used in hospitals, cars, or government agencies, among other industry uses. There are so many things that can be improved by the introduction of a trusted, verifiable identity. DIDs improve our interactions with both technology and the world around&nbsp;us.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I hope that I can achieve even more great success in my future with Ontology.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I really hope that, by promoting DIDs, this project will help to firmly integrate Web3 with the real world, even amidst the current ‘field conditions’. Everything is based on money now, so when using Web3 services, it will be important that Ontology maintains its strong reputation for security and transparency! The latest events involving the FTX exchange have shown this to be particularly evident.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-andrej-3de846c6ccd8">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Andrej</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
