  <p>Programming Bitcoin is fun, particularly on Urbit, but the devil is in the details. Tim (~timluc-miptev) will impart the implicit knowledge he gained working with Bitcoin in the course of his projects, and give an open workshop on what you need to know, either to satisfy your curiosity or to jump in and help. Tim will give a structured presentation on low-level Bitcoin fundamentals, intended to make it easy to use Bitcoin resources for further study.</p>
<p>Tim is the technical director at the Urbit Foundation, and wrote the backend for the Urbit Bitcoin wallet. He is currently managing <code>volt</code>, a project to integrate a Lightning client into Urbit.  This workshop will be interactive — Tim will take questions throughout, and will conduct another session later if material remains.</p>
<p>As always, there will be an informal call afterwards to hang out. We will also open a Bitcoin development channel on Urbit specifically to handle follow-ups from this and for those who can't make it live.</p>

					  Nicht verpassen: Morgen dreht sich alles um digitale Identitäten und den Einsatz von Vertrauensdiensten in der Praxis auf dem „eIDAS Summit“ des bitkom. Auf der virtuellen Hauptbühne spricht Dominik Deimel, Gründer von comuny, über “Föderierte Identitäten und Datensouveränität – ein Modell nicht nur für den Gesundheitsmarkt” (Bühne Vertrauensdienste in der Praxis, 11:50-12:10 Uhr, 15.06.2021). <p>Benutzername plus</p><p>Föderiertes Identitätsmanagement ist heute ein etablierter Standard, der es dem Nutzer erlaubt, mit seiner Identität verschiedenste Dienste im Sinne eines Single-Sign-On zu nutzen. Dieser Ansatz bedingt, dass ein Identitätsprovider (IDP) viele Informationen des Nutzers verarbeiten kann (Stichwort “Profilbildung”) gleichzeitig aber – in regulierten Märkten – einen hohen Aufwand für den Schutz persönlicher Daten betreiben muss. Dies gilt zum Beispiel für Krankenversicherer, die den Zugang zu Diensten der Telematikinfrastruktur wie ePA oder eRezept organisieren. Hier brauchen die Teilnehmer eines föderierten Netzwerks im Gesundheitsmarkt gegenseitige Kontrolle und Akzeptanz. Die Herausforderung in Zukunft: Der souveräne Umgang des Nutzers mit seinen Identitätsdaten in der eID Wallet auf dem Mobilgerät.</p><p>Im Vortrag wird die Architektur eines IDP vorgestellt, der Vorteile und Vorgaben von OIDC und eIDAS als etablierte Standards sowie die Prinzipien von Self Sovereign Identities zusammenbringt. Damit lässt sich sofort und ohne Blockchain Technologie das Mobilgerät als komfortabler Authenticator mit einer mobilen eID Wallet nutzen. Beide Seiten profitieren: Nutzer behalten die Hoheit über ihre sensiblen Daten, und Unternehmen erfüllen die hohen Auflagen von Datenschutz und eIDAS. Dieser Ansatz bietet ein Geschäftsmodell, welches sich sehr gut auf andere Märkte übertragen lässt und offen ist für Business mit weiteren technischen Lösungspartnern und Integratoren.</p><p>#bitkom #eIDAS21 #comuny #Vertrauensdienste #DigitalIdentity #MyDataOperator #verifizierung #authentifizierung #operator #trinity</p><p>Virtuelle Konferenz des Digitalverbands Deutschlands mit branchenübergreifendem Austausch, über 1.000 Expertinnen und Experten, #Tech-Trends, <a title="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=insights&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=insights&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160">#Insights</a> &amp; <a title="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=bestpractices&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=bestpractices&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6808060057956188160">#BestPractices</a> zur sicheren Digitalisierung von Prozessen.</p><p>Anmeldung und kostenfreie Tickets unter <a href="https://www.eidas-summit.de/de">https://www.eidas-summit.de/de</a> und mehr über den Ansatz von comuny <a href="https://www.comuny.de/produkt/">mehr über den Ansatz von comuny</a>&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The growing degree of digitization and the ever-increasing online transactions has necessitated a strong and secure way to identify and authenticate digital entities. This has led to the emergence of Digital Identity Management, where digital documents that prove the identity of an entity are stored and shared digitally.</p><p>While there are many components in digital identity management, in this article, we will talk about a central component called identity&nbsp;wallets.</p> What’s an Identity&nbsp;Wallet? <p>An identity wallet is a digital wallet/storage where you can safely store your digitized documents and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>, and share them easily with others when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>You own this wallet and its contents, so you have the power to decide how and with whom you want to share your credentials. This concept of always being in charge of your identity is called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Self Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and it is one of the pillars of web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>So, how can this identity wallet be beneficial for you and why should you embrace&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here are five reasons why we think identity wallets are the&nbsp;future.</p> Reason #1: Keeps your Data&nbsp;Safe <p>One of the biggest issues facing the digital age is cyberattacks and the resultant <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-id-theft-what-happens-when-your-identity-stolen.html">identity&nbsp;theft</a>.</p><p>If you analyze identity thefts and their patterns, you’ll notice that hackers steal millions of identities from a single storage/database, and often, the owner of the identity would know of the theft only much later, and sometimes, may not know it at&nbsp;all!</p><p>But what happens when you do away with a central repository where all the data is stored and replace it with a decentralized form of storage where each entity stores its data separately?</p><p>It becomes that much harder for someone to steal data because it requires considerable effort to steal just one record, which is not tenable in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>To top it all, the owner is in complete control of the data at all times, so identity theft may not even be possible in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>In all, your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">data is&nbsp;safe</a>.</p> Reason #2: Know Where Your Data is&nbsp;Used <p>Surveys and opinion polls overwhelmingly show that users are concerned about their privacy and want to know how and where their data is stored and&nbsp;used.</p><p>For example, a <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/2020/consumer-data-report-kpmg.pdf">survey by KPMG</a> shows that data privacy is a concern for 97% of U.S consumers and almost 54% worry about what companies do with their data. Likewise, the Eurobarometer survey states that 72% of users want to know how their data is processed.</p><p>These numbers clearly show that users will feel more comfortable when they know where their data is stored and how it is&nbsp;used.</p><p>The good news with identity wallets is that you control the entire data sharing process, so there’s no concern about how someone else can use your&nbsp;data.</p><p>You can choose to send <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">only the relevant data</a> to entities for processing. For example, if you have to prove your age, just send your date of birth credential without including other details such as your address or government ID. That’s how granular you can get with data sharing and its&nbsp;usage.</p> Reason #3: Meets Mandatory Compliance Requirements <p>The European Parliament and Council implemented the eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication, and trust Services) regulation in 2014 and paved the way for greater digital security. The more recent <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">European Digital Identity</a> further empowers users to store their identities in a digital wallet and use it seamlessly where needed, even across boundaries.</p><p>Such forward-looking regulations are likely to be adopted by other countries as well, so before long, having an identity wallet can become a way of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Why not jump on the bandwagon early and proactively meet the required <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">compliance</a> requirements?</p><p>This way, you can enjoy its benefits early&nbsp;on.</p> Reason #4: Facilitates Quick and Easy Authentication <p>Besides keeping your credentials safe, an identity wallet can facilitate quick, easy, and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">hassle-free authentication</a>.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/opening-a-bank-account-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-53ea478b5414">opening a bank account </a>in a different country doesn’t have to entail the collection and submission of a ton of documents that could take weeks to process. With digital credentials stored in an identity wallet, the entire process can be completed in a few minutes because all that you have to do is share it electronically.</p><p>The concerned bank authorities can verify the data and open an account for you. That’s how easy it can&nbsp;be!</p> Reason #5: Perform a Wide Range of Tasks Electronically <p>As more businesses accept identity wallets, it won’t be long before you can share the pertinent information in your identity wallets with a wide range of online services.</p><p>Some possible tasks you can do with an identity wallet&nbsp;are:</p>  Prove that you’re 18+ years of age to buy alcohol or enter a&nbsp;bar  Share your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/on-demand-employment-endorsements-a-use-case-for-verifiable-credentials-d19d263a0fbb">past employment</a> and educational qualifications with prospective employers  Use it as a <a href="https://www.safetravel.affinidi.com/">health passport</a> for travel or to buy the prescribed medicines in any part of the&nbsp;world.  <p>Here are some more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world ideas</a> where an identity wallet can come in&nbsp;handy.</p><p>Undoubtedly, identity wallets are an integral part of the future as it comes with a ton of benefits geared for the next-gen online security.</p><p>So, are you ready to use an identity wallet and leverage the many benefits that come with&nbsp;it?</p><p>To learn more about self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials, check out some related <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">FAQs</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>The Good Health Pass Interoperability Blueprint was released mid-June to help shape the development of a cohesive but decentralized method of issuing, holding, and verifying the results of a COVID status test. The Good Health Pass Collaborative (GHPC) is an open and publicly funded collaborative; it was founded by <a href="https://id2020.org/" title="ID2020">ID2020</a> and the working group is managed by the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/" title="Trust over IP Foundation">Trust over IP Foundation</a>. The <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/" title="blueprint">blueprint</a>, which is now available for public comment, lays out the most important and intentional design choices as well as recommendations to implement an interoperable and inclusive system.</p>
 Intentional design choices 
<p>The Good Health Pass outlines their recommended architecture aspects:</p>
 
 Individuals should be in control of their data: This goes on to describe the relationship between the issuer of a credential (a test center) and the holder of a credential (the individual being tested), as well as the relationship between the holder and a verifier (entity that checks the credential before granting access to a service, such as airport staff, border control, etc.). It is explicitly stated that there is no room for a third party in these interactions – the holder should interact directly with anyone needing to issue or verify their credential. It recommends being restrictive by design with privacy by default. To enable this, the blueprint chooses to use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/" title="W3C Verifiable Credentials">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> as a standard for interoperability, which also allows for selective disclosure of credentials. 
 Equity and Inclusion: There are concerns around tracking the health status of individuals and using it as a gatekeeper to accessing private and public services, and rightly so. When equal access to basic rights are sidelined in favor of promoting mobility, there are risks that some groups will be marginalized. It must be remembered that vaccines are not universally available. Therefore, a negative test must also suffice to allow equal access to services. Thus the name of a credentialing service is important. It should not be called a vaccine passport because it is misleading and would clearly create a barrier to services for large populations who do not have access or choose not to receive a vaccine. It is recommended to be called a “digital health pass”. Access also includes device and offline access. Although a smartphone is the preferred channel for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials, there must be an offline version for those who do not have a smartphone. QR codes on a hard copy credential can fulfill this, with multiple QR codes for different selective disclosure scenarios. 
 Decentralized for security and scalability: This blueprint argues that a decentralized approach boost security of holding and exchanging PII. This argument is made in more detail in <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/an80301/demystifying-the-blockchain-what-makes-a-blockchain-useful-to-a-firm/" title="other resources">other resources</a>. In terms of scalability, the GHPC explains that a decentralized digital health pass could reduce stress and traffic between healthcare information systems by shifting the work of issuing and verifying credentials to other parties, but the scalability of the decentralized ecosystems is not addressed. The scalability of decentralized ecosystems is still a relatively open question, with widely varying results based on the particular public/private/consortium blockchain arrangement used. 
 Open Standards for interoperability and participation: without a doubt, open standards must be followed so that a credential issued at one test center can be accepted at any verifier. The GHPC insists on a pragmatic and phased approach to designing and implementing. While that has led to a well-thought-out blueprint, it is already late to meeting real-world needs. In many countries, the initial rollback of lockdown measures has already occurred, and the reopening of economies means that systems to prove a negative COVID status have already been implemented in a disjointed way. The solutions that are out there many times provide a verifiable certificate, but can be missing other elements such as decentralization, the ability to certify a self-test without a smartphone, or the ability to just use one app for different testing stations. Decentralized systems also face a challenge of unified communication – already a trend in regional vs. federal measures where individuals may find it difficult to find reliable information that does not conflict with other sources. However, the systems in place are less than perfect but they do function to a limited degree and may disincentivize local governments from redesigning their initiatives based on the GHPC’s recommendations. 
 
<p></p>
 Identity Verification as a Foundation 
<p>Among the recommendations offered by the GHPC, binding the holder's identity with their credential is important to ensure that the credential does indeed belong to the holder. This lines up with the rising use of identity verification to accompany onboarding and authentication for higher security. Offline testing and credential issuance may rely on a manual check of a photo ID, but this does not last beyond the time of verification. Binding an identity to a Verifiable Credential remains valid beyond the point of verification by being able to match a real-time biometric data point with one which was logged at the point of verification – checking that a fingerprint matches the one which was logged when the credential was issued, for example. When using decentralized architectures, identity verification can still provide high and/or selective privacy for the holder while assuring the issuer or verifier that the credential can be trusted.</p>
<p>While the GHCP’s blueprint is well designed and offers concrete recommendations for a functional yet privacy-centric solution with implementation recommendations for 30, 90, and 180 day intervals, it comes late in the game and may face reluctance from public players. GHCP may also have limited the potential for its own adoption by relying on a decentralized architecture only, instead of building interoperability for health passes already in circulation. However, this may be the chance that decentralized identity has needed to demonstrate its efficacy on a global level. KuppingerCole will continue researching this market segment, as it has high potential to positively disrupt digital identity management for the individual as well as for the enterprise.</p>

<p>Companies today manage and maintain master data from business partners in multiple instances in various in-house IT systems — and do the same with their own master data in thirdparty systems. Each company has to invest a great deal of time and money in ensuring this data is of good quality. This is due to the high number of data sets created in the process — which amount to several million in the case of major corporations. In addition to this, suppliers have to submit hundreds of certificates year after year to customers such as car manufacturers. Sustainability certificates have recently become increasingly important, too. In practice, this usually results in a considerable amount of manual work on both sides that is very time consuming and prone to errors. The team responsible for the strategic advance engineering project “Economy of Things” (EoT) at Bosch Research is working with partners on an innovative concept that aims to tackle these very issues.</p>

             June 2021   
	 
		 
			 Are Banks Missing Out on the Digital Money Revolution?<br>
 
<p>Digitalization continues to accelerate our everyday life, affecting people, businesses, governments and financial institutions. The Covid-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst that revolutionized the way people work, purchase, and invest. The hype around non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) is evidence of the growing interest in investment opportunities brought by blockchain technology.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/security-tokens-growth-europe-cryptocurrencies?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bytj_o0CGsKv2t4Rzt2IJOjWe7Nzu2IM84T_XwAmnsDzl310A0Cwk9sAwuwGXzrPx9urm">According to a recent report</a>,&nbsp;security tokens are seen as the next blockchain wave&nbsp;and are predicted to reach a market of €918 billion by 2026.</p>
<p>Naturally, the demand for these new means of investment has pushed digital money into the spotlight. Why? Because&nbsp;the cash leg must be on the same infrastructure as the securities&nbsp;in order to allow a real transition to a decentralized network. While most banks are still waiting for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to show the way, stablecoins issued by crypto players have reached a record-high trading volume at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8bytj_o0CGsKv2t4Rzt2IJOjWe7Nzu2IM84T_XwAmnsDzl310A0Cwk9sAwuwGXzrPx9urm">$766.02 billion in May</a>, up 51.9% from the previous month, and nearly 15x greater than one year ago.</p>
<p>CBDC&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Commercial bank digital money&nbsp;vs&nbsp;Stablecoins:</p>
<p>First, let’s take a deeper look at the two forms of money in the current banking system: central bank money and commercial bank money. Central bank money is made available to the public in the form of cash and to commercial banks in the form of central bank reserves. Private money is deposited into commercial banks, and banks are required to hold a certain percentage of these deposits at the central bank as a cushion. The rest of the deposits are used to grant loans to individuals and companies, where commercial bank money is created at this point. Therefore,&nbsp;in traditional finance, commercial banks act like trusted entities&nbsp;to not only provide essential services to customers, but also help create capital and liquidity in the market.</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Similarly, stablecoins require promise and credibility, and they must be interchangeable with existing forms of money, in other words, they have to be anchored. This means stablecoins require users to have the same level of confidence as commercial bank money. Therefore,&nbsp;in onchain finance, commercial banks must take this role of trusted issuer of tokenized cash&nbsp;as they are the most suitable entities to issue stablecoins anchored by fiat money. They have already missed the ecommerce revolution to payment giants such as Stripe, Adyen, and Alipay, and have lost significant retail market share to neobanks. Will this happen again in the digital currency revolution?</p>
<p>Banks are at a critical juncture for catching up with this new wave. If they don’t act quickly, they will be seriously disrupted. With the emergence of crypto players such as Circle (which just reraised $440M), Paxos (which is now a bank), and our partner Monerium (a fiat-eMoney payment gateway for security token investors),&nbsp;the race is already on to become the tokenized money provider for digital assets.&nbsp;</p>

I’m fortunate enough to be at a company that champions identity by delivering identity solutions like MFA, access management and data governance that empower companies, governments and organizations to secure their employees, customers and citizens.

<p>-- The Garden of Forking Paths, Jorge Luis Borges</p>
<p>The pre-technological world was already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net">networked</a>. No material object and no idea has ever stood alone—"no man is an island". Language itself is a network of associations shared between a group of people. The question of technology is: how do we bring our web of associations into the realm of computers? The legacy internet has focused on social networks almost exclusively—our mammalian brains readily took to this, we all love to <a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/robin-hanson/">signal</a>. But before “social media” there was something called hypertext: a seemingly modest way to connect documents shared between computers.</p>
<p>A footnote in a book used to require a library, locating the referenced book, and finding the cited page (which might have footnotes itself)! Hypertext allows one to traverse a network quickly and easily with just mouse clicks, making information accessible to those without the time and resources to hunt down physical artifacts. Urbit’s “%graph-store” is not the same as hypertext but it does bear some familial resemblances. Fundamentally, %graph-store is a data structure that can accommodate disparate data types within a single edifice. It is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph databases</a> and recent implementations such as <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>. To understand this data structure it is worth diving into the origins of hypertext—the original linked network.</p>
<p>The story of hypertext begins at the end of WWII with an article in The Atlantic that proposed to extend the human mind via machine. Vannevar Bush had seen first-hand the explosion of electronics manufacturing and scientific knowledge, recognizing the great peril and opportunity of such a revolution. His <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">description</a> of the Memex presaged the technological world of today, envisioning a personal device that would allow the user to draw upon a vast library of information, and link documents together arbitrarily—what he called "associative indexing"—a deliberate recreation of how the mind connects thoughts.</p>
<p>The 1960s saw the first implementations of these ideas. Ted Nelson's <a href="https://archive.org/details/SelectedPapers1977/page/n15/mode/2up">writing</a> around Project Xanadu elaborated this linking between documents into what Nelson called hypertext. Nelson imagined "a text arranged in a graph structure", centered around a corpus arranged in nonlinear sequence, manipulable by author or audience. The concept was first demonstrated in 1968, at Douglas Engelbart's 'Mother of all Demos', where a vision of computers as a collaborative social environment was revealed to the world. "<a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/137/#7">The Journal</a>", presented alongside other revolutionary demos, exhibited collaboratively edited documents with hyperlinked connections. Any time-travellers in the audience would have immediately recognized the first webpage. From here, the idea of a linked network of documents would be developed through successive phases of computing, from the mainframe to the PC.</p>
<p>Experimentation with these ideas continued through the 1970s and 80s. A team directed by Andy Lippman at MIT extended the concept to threaded visual hypermedia with the Aspen Movie Map, a user-directed virtual tour of Aspen, Colorado. Hypertext and hypermedia gained a mass audience for the first time with HyperCard, a program that shipped with Mac computers. Users were able to collect or create '<a href="https://archive.org/details/hypercardstacks">stacks</a>' of interlinked cards; a personal body of text, art, and knowledge could be accrued and modified, or shared with others—though not yet with native networking capabilities. </p>
<p>With the World Wide Web, hypertext achieved escape velocity. Initially a one-man <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">project</a>, the world wide web was similar to Bush’s vision of the Memex—a way to share, index, and connect information between individuals and groups. The web succeeded by utilizing the physical infrastructure already available: PCs with graphical interfaces, DNS, and the internet. Critically, its method of transmitting and traversing texts was a standardized protocol, allowing a free body of information to assemble atop the new infrastructure by anyone willing to learn the tools. A new frontier was cleared and cultivated with open standards, but it would gradually face enclosure.</p>
<p>In the following decade, after the first wave of social networking sites had crested but before phones became the primary web clients, Twitter was launched. Originally an awkward bridge between SMS and the web, its design eventually coalesced around static identity, posts with chronological sorting, and interlinked post threads. These simple primitives spawned a vast corpus of information, a graph-of-graphs intertwined and overlapped, mapping an entire platonic world. Twitter is fundamentally constrained by its very nature: it is the walled garden of an advertising company. The financial incentives of the server operators demanded seizure of the commons and the replacement of standardized protocols with proprietary databases.</p>
<p>As the first networked services withered, a new critique was implicitly articulated in the construction of a <a href="https://moronlab.blogspot.com/2010/01/urbit-functional-programming-from.html">new kind of abstract machine</a>. Urbit learned from the past: tightly defined protocols, baked-in cryptography, and decentralization were key. If power over the network was determined by those who ran the servers, then we would run the servers ourselves. </p>
<p>Urbit is not fundamentally a hypertext system; it is a new kind of computer, designed to participate in a peer-to-peer network that rejects the client-server model. All Urbit software takes its networking model for granted, it is not an ad-hoc layering of mismatched abstractions. Fundamental design decisions determine the trajectory of the future.</p>
<p>Early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j">implementations</a> of graph databases and projects like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a> hit on the same core idea: linked data needs its own data structure. In 2020 Urbit OS adopted an application called %graph-store that made use of a new, native <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Gwfg442kV3cdfG7NnWPEf2TMa3uLUTAKkZD70ALZkE/edit">data structure</a> which would act as a database service for social applications. Chats, long-form text, and other types of data produced in the course of social computing now share the same tent, a single structure extensible to new types of content. Each item added to it is a node in a personal graph—a tree that grows branches as your computer communicates. These nodes can be linked arbitrarily to other graphs—Urbit's global immutable namespace grants both permanence and ownership and allows the graph’s branches to intertwine with others. Graphs can accommodate a variety of content, from simple text, to code and media yet to be conceived. You own your graph, and it is a record of your digital journey with others.</p>
<p>Personal hypertext graphs are leaving behind proprietary platforms and gaining independence. Graphs until now have been used as tools of surveillance and marketing, but they are being reclaimed and sewn back into the network, each bound to the cryptographic identity of an individual, permanent computer. Where the map of your life was once splintered across a thousand systems and held in the custody of strangers, it is now possessed only by you and shared only as you see fit. On Urbit, an infinite forest of digital lives can take root, nesting their boughs and stalks.</p>

<p>Identity is everything. It permeates everything we do, every activity (both on and offline), and has a huge bearing on our relationships. We go through life sharing parts of our identity, with people, institutions, service providers, even with our pets. Whatever animal we choose to love knows us for who we are, and how we treat them.

<p>The team at Dock has taken another step towards providing secure, decentralized credential solutions by transitioning our testnet to a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) algorithm. We have kicked off this testing phase by successfully onboarding a number of candidate validators to the network, and will transition our current PoA mainnet to PoS as well once the security audit and testing activities are successfully completed, which is expected to happen by the end of June 2021.</p><p>What is Proof of Stake?</p><p>Proof of Stake (PoS) refers to an algorithm in which the validators are selected on a blockchain based on the amount of tokens they have staked. Validators are entities who are charged with the important tasks of producing blocks (hence processing blockchain transactions) and validating the blocks that are produced by other validators. </p><p>In PoS, validators are selected based on how many Dock tokens have been staked (locked up) in support of each candidate. Before validators are selected, candidate validators can stake their own tokens, and/or be backed by other token holders (“nominators”) who stake their tokens on the candidates’ behalf, and receive rewards if the candidates get selected and start producing blocks. Once the nomination period is over, the algorithm automatically selects the candidates with the largest stakes to become validators. The validators are incentivized to perform their duties properly, as the staked tokens can be slashed (taken away) in case of validator misbehavior.</p><p>This is distinct from the approach taken in Proof of Authority (PoA) - the algorithm currently used on the Dock mainnet. In PoA, validators are trustworthy entities selected by the Dock Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to overseeing the Dock network.</p><p>The transition to PoS takes the validator selection decisions away from a single entity (Dock Association) and distributes it across a network of nominators and validators, hence creating more decentralized power and greater security in the network.</p><p>An Open Network for Everyone</p><p>The transition to PoS also comes with further democratization of the network governance structure. Some of the governance for our current PoA mainnet is centralized to the Governing Council, as the Council members are the only ones who can vote on any changes to the network proposed by the Council or token holders. Once the mainnet transitions to PoS, however, Dock token holders will be able to vote on proposed changes to the network (including election of Council members) by locking up their tokens. This change, along with the ability for token holders to earn passive income by staking on behalf of successful validators, enhances the utility of the Dock tokens.</p><p>Participation by token holders as validators, nominators, and voters is made possible by the fact that the Dock network is a permissionless blockchain. This is unlike many of our competitors who leverage permissioned blockchains, and hence limit the access to their blockchain governance to the select few. It is part of Dock’s vision to build a network that has maximum participation and widespread adoption, and we believe that this can only be achieved through decentralization, democracy, and transparency offered by a public blockchain that is open for all token holders, and free from the control of a single entity.</p><p>What’s Next?</p><p>We will be running the PoS testnet for the next few weeks to ensure that all network features work correctly. During this time we will also work with <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a>, a team of security experts currently performing an audit on the PoS network, to ensure that the network is safe and secure. Once these steps are completed we will transition our mainnet to PoS as well. More posts will follow to keep the community posted on our progress and further explain the changes introduced in PoS.</p>

<p>In its latest Digital Signature report, Gartner identified InfoCert as a “Full-service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform”, ranking it among the leaders of the Digital Signature industry.</p>



<p>The consulting firm has served as an authoritative IT advisor for over 40 years. Recently, it released its eSignature market guide, “Market Guide for Electronic Signature”, a true reference for IT and technology solutions professionals and companies. Gartner’s report put InfoCert among the top providers of Digital Signature solutions.</p>



<blockquote><p><a href="https://infocert.digital/analyst-reports/the-gartners-market-guide-for-electronic-signature/">Download the report published by Gartner, free of charge, to see how the digital signature market has evolved and the main global players like InfoCert have performed</a></p></blockquote>



<p>Gartner’s analysis is intended to guide professionals and businesses in assessing the solutions available on the market offered by providers in the field of Digital Signature and Trust Services. Gartner’s report divides Digital Signature and Trust Service providers into three categories. It assigned InfoCert to the “Full Service, enterprise electronic and Digital signature platform” category, which includes firms able to provide highly flexible technological and process services that offer all the technological characteristics required to meet the needs of large, medium and small companies, and even individual citizens.</p>



<p>The report is very useful because it classifies providers according to their specific capabilities and the levels of service they offer. It is an excellent source from which to analyse the latest B2B, B2C and B2E Use Cases. The report also provides a detailed view of the latest “Assurance” requirements (i.e., compliance with the standards established by European reference regulations) and technology requirements – aspects to which companies should pay special attention if they intend to embark on a path of Digital Transformation.</p>



<p>The “Full-service, enterprise electronic and Digital signature platform” segment, in which InfoCert has been recognised as a sector leader, includes Providers that adapt best to their clients’ every need. In fact, according to Gartner, these providers are able to support simple, advanced and qualified electronic signatures, they can include industry-specific processes in their Enterprise solutions, and they are able to offer “out-of-the-box” solutions that can be integrated with third-party platforms and software such as document, HCMs, CRMs and CLMs. They also support API integration, identity verification and knowledge-base verification tools.</p>



<p>The report also analyses the other two supplier categories: “Stand-alone, workflow-focused, click-to-sign electronic signature platform” and “Enterprise digital signature providers”.</p>



<p>The Gartner team of analysts that prepared the report highlights that clients must have access to services that match their needs, their geographical areas (often characterised by different regulatory requirements) and the use case they take as reference. This is why it is essential that clients be able to choose the vendor that best meets their functionality and compliance criteria at every stage of the process.</p>

<p>Building a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private&nbsp;yards</p> Summary Rémi Müller — Unsplash<p>Lawns are a desert in biodiversity, yet they are still the default landscaping approach across Canada. In the region of Montreal alone, lawns cover a surface 317 times the Mount-Royal Park. In the United States, it is the largest irrigated crop. Transforming the culture of perfectly manicured lawns therefore represents an enormous opportunity for collective climate&nbsp;action.</p><p>One of the most devastating causes and impacts of climate change is the global decline in biodiversity. Beyond the development of public policies, legislative strategies and financial incentives, it is essential to increase the capacity for on-the-ground action among individuals and communities through the development of ecological gardening on residential yards. This strategy aims to create spaces that can enrich and support biodiversity and, by doing so, transform our relationship with Nature right at home. This effort involves helping people see that the land they own is part of a larger ecosystem that requires nourishment and care; the land they own is a common responsibility.</p><p>To achieve this ambitious goal, there is a critical need to develop tools that bring together all the available knowledge about ecological gardening in order to inspire and help residents take action; to legitimize the adoption of this new residential landscape aesthetics of biodiversity by creating a community of interest and practice; and to document and measure the socio-environmental benefits of these local actions at different scales in order to sustain the movement and provide municipal authorities with necessary tools and information to incorporate biodiversity and climate mitigation into landscape planning decisions.</p>Pilot project, summer 2020 — Vivant &amp; Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins<p><a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins / New Neighbors</a> aims precisely at developing a platform bringing together different functions (pedagogical, actionable, evaluational, financial, regulatory, etc.) to support and accelerate this socio-ecological transition through the aggregation of residential and commercial yards. It is about establishing the foundations of a movement that proposes a new form of cohabitation between Nature and us, one yard at a time, across urban, suburban and rural divides. <a href="http://www.nouveauxvoisins.org">www.nouveauxvoisins.org</a> is meant to be a platform for informing communities, transforming grass into habitats rich in biodiversity, and mapping and measuring the impacts of a movement already gaining momentum.</p><p>This blog summarizes the case studies and the paper prototype of a platform developed thanks to the generous contribution of <a href="https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/">The McConnell Foundation</a> as part of the Transition Catalyst Fund, and was done in collaboration with Nouveaux voisins, Dark Matter Labs and S. Karthik Mukkavilli.</p> Context <p>While the impacts of climate change are increasingly disrupting our lives, the potential climate strategies that individuals and communities can deploy often remain abstract.</p><p>Beyond the actions themselves, the impacts of these practices on climate change at the local and global scales has also been&nbsp;unclear.</p><p>In this context, it is essential to support, document and measure the contribution of citizen actions in order to make them visible and encourage public authorities to support those initiatives.</p> How could a platform be designed to coordinate citizen engagement and scientific knowledge in order to inspire collective action?  What are the necessary functions and structures of a platform that coordinates citizen engagement and scientific knowledge in order to inspire collective action?  Case studies <p>The first step in this research was to identify certain rewilding initiatives that could inspire the development of the Nouveaux Voisins platform — and inform the relationship between citizen science and remote sensing&nbsp;tools.</p><p>These case studies were selected to represent different dimensions of the Nouveaux Voisins project (e.g., type of ecological actions, citizen involvement, use of technological tools,&nbsp;etc.).</p><p>Following an initial search for international initiatives, 8 initiatives were selected. Following an initial analysis, these initiatives were classified into 4 main categories.</p><p>These case studies have highlighted certain key&nbsp;lessons:</p> Opportunities <p>Economies of care: While access to native plants and ecological gardening services has been identified as a barrier, encouraging a demand for rewilding resources can stimulate a respective shift in supply. This coordinated move towards a local market for native plants and ecological landscaping services can be the beginning of an economy of care and conservation.</p><p>Facilitating civic contracts between citizens, non-humans, and governments: Assembling small-scale citizen observations of local habitat at the landscape level can help gauge the impact of biodiversity on ecological services and public health. This insight can drive government and community programs that circle back to the needs of non-human beings (prioritizing habitat corridors) and citizens (funding for gardening projects, equal access to&nbsp;nature).</p><p>Fostering agency: Clarifying the links between small-scale practices and larger scale impacts can help reframe individual action as collective effort.</p> Challenges <p>Integrating equity and access: Ensuring environmental surveying is accessible to various publics and providing multiple channels for citizens to voice their experiences to their governments and communities. This challenge may call for citizen science toolkits, direct communication pathways between citizens and municipalities, community-building channels, and public events that value the stewardship of citizens unable to take part in gardening at&nbsp;home.</p><p>Respecting local specificity while pursuing common goals: Building in flexible strategies that respond to various ecological regions, community contexts, and individual constraints while navigating commitments and lessons at larger&nbsp;scales.</p><p>Deployment at scale: Assembling collective habitat from small-scale transformations and decentralized citizen observations depends on the engagement of many. Nevertheless, these case studies have highlighted the possibility for surprising collaborations to pursue overlapping goals such as public health and education.</p> Based on these lessons, how can we build a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private yards&nbsp;? <p>From what we learned from the case studies and the Service Blueprint, we decided to organize the platform design around five categories of&nbsp;actions:</p><blockquote>Informing<br>Transforming<br>Mapping &amp; Measuring<br>Modeling &amp; Visualizing<br>Coordinating and Influencing</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins</a> is intended to be a platform that consolidates various features; it provides information, assists in the concrete transformation of grassed areas, maps and measures the impacts of collective actions, and helps visualize possible&nbsp;futures.</p><p>Moreover, all the data collected will help mobilize communities wishing to promote biodiversity by helping them coordinate and influence different actors in their environment.</p><p>See below some early sketches of what it could look&nbsp;like:</p> Next steps <p>Currently, Nouveaux voisins is continuing its on the ground pilot projects with Vivant, while <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> continues to develop a full suite of deep code innovations in support of nature based solutions with <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">Trees as Infrastructure</a> and other initiatives.</p><p>For this specific platform project, we are currently defining the minimum viable prototype and are looking for collaborators and investors around the world to build a first version of the platform.</p><p>If you have any interest or recommendation, please reach&nbsp;out!</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>Emile Forest <br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>emile@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>Jonathan Lapalme <br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</p> Credits <p>Jonathan Lapalme — Co-Project Manager and strategist<br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>jonathan@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>Emile Forest — Co-Project Manager and researcher<br>Dark Matter Labs + Nouveaux voisins<br>emile@darkmatterlabs.org</p><p>S.

<p><a href="https://cccv.to/">CCCV,</a> product of Blocko XYZ, is an incubated project by the AERGO foundation, that anchors member data on the AERGO public&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Blocko XYZ has announced that from June 11th, anyone who has their <a href="https://cccv.to/cccv.info">COVID-19 vaccination status</a> verified through the social DID service CCCV, will be able to receive a real badge and sticker that displays their status to&nbsp;others.</p><p>Starting July, the Korean government is waiving the outdoor mask mandate for those who are vaccinated. Once this policy is implemented, it will be difficult to discern who has been truly vaccinated. As the government has only issued confirmation stickers for people who have been vaccinated above the age of 65, there needs to be a method of distinguishing vaccinated people in younger age&nbsp;groups.</p><p>Although apps for digital vaccination verification have been developed and other similar services are being announced, there is continuing controversy over the issues of security and standardization, and all responsibility is being placed on the individual. Self-employed business owners who manage small scale businesses, such as health and fitness managers, pilates teachers and golf coaches, are particularly in urgent need of a way to distinguish unvaccinated clients who falsely claim to be vaccinated for the sake of remaining unmasked.</p><p>In an effort to solve this problem, Blocko XYZ has announced that it will award free stickers and badges to people who verify their vaccination status by signing up to social verification service&nbsp;CCCV.</p><p>Users can request a badge by clicking on the digital vaccination badge under the CCCV verification tab and uploading evidence of their vaccination status. The requested badge will be granted within 24 hours after the authenticity of the uploaded document has been confirmed by an administrator. After this badge has been granted, users will be able to request concrete vaccination confirmation stickers and badges by simply filling out the required information.</p><p>The digital verification badge can be selected as a top badge and shared with others in the form of a link. Users will be able to easily announce their vaccination status to their family, acquaintances and clients, and influencers may in this way encourage many others to also get vaccinated.</p><p>Kim Kyung-hoon, CEO of Blocko XYZ, announced, “We would like to actively offer our support in finding a solution to the various social problems that may arise following the loosening of the mask policy in July. As a social content business card service, CCCV is used by many self-employed people, from models and coaches to freelancers in various fields, for the sake of verifying their qualifications. We hurried to create the vaccination badge in response to the demand of users like this who required vaccination confirmation due to the frequent interaction with clients. However, consumers have complained that online proof is simply not convenient to apply to offline businesses. Since the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccination APIs are not open, services are only being provided manually. So, we decided to produce a real badge that could be used offline.”</p><p>Blocko XYZ’s CCCV, which has introduced the vaccination confirmation badge, was launched in November 2020. It is a new online content business card service that combines a badge system for expressing one’s academic background, assets and various abilities, with a link sharing service. Since its launch, within just 6 months, CCCV has gained over 2 million subscribers and offers a variety of blockchain-based services including DID and&nbsp;NFT.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-incubated-project-cccv-creates-member-vaccine-verification-f7acc1893feb">AERGO incubated project CCCV creates member vaccine verification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://youtu.be/0Gc33A7F2XE">watch this tutorial as a screencast</a>.</p>

 

 

 Konnect and Okta Integration Topology 

<p>In this example, I’m using the Konnect control plane to create new APIs and policies and publish them to my data plane running as a Docker container in an AWS EC2 instance.</p>

<p></p>

 Introspection Flow 

<p>The introspection flow is part of the token validation process. <a href="https://konghq.com/kong/">Kong Gateway</a> evaluates the injected token at the request processing time to see if it’s still valid to the upstream services. The evaluation hits a specific Okta endpoint, passing the received token. Based on the response provided by Okta, Kong Gateway accepts or rejects the request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For production environments, the OIDC plugin provides caching capabilities for the Okta responses. However, for this tutorial, I’m going to disable caching to better view the flow.</p>

 Set Up the Okta Application 

<p>Regarding Okta’s settings, I’m going to use the same client credentials application I created before. With the client ID and client secret. However, my OIDC plugin has to be set with specific parameters to implement introspection.</p>

<p></p>

 Apply the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>In the Konnect ServiceHub, I have an IntrospectionRoute OIDC plugin enabled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The settings should be:</p>

 
   
    <p>Config.Auth Methods</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Issuer</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Introspect Jwt Tokens</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Config.Introspection Endpoint with a specific endpoint provided by Okta to implement introspection</p>

    <p></p>
   
 

 Test the Introspection Flow With Insomnia 

<p>To better view the flow, I will use <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a>, Kong’s API spec editor, to send requests to both Okta and Konnect. Below are my two requests.</p>

<p>The first one I’m sending to Okta, passing the expected parameters to get it authenticated and receive a token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the second one to consume the route, I’m using a specific Insomnia capability called Request Chaining. With this, I’ll be able to extract values from the response of a given request to build new ones. In my case, I’m pulling the access token from Okta’s response to make the other request and then send it to Konnect.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>Next, let’s send a request to Okta to get our token. There it is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This time, we can see that Kong’s request is ready to be sent since we got Okta’s token injected inside of it.</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>And here’s the Konnect response:</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s important to note that Konnect is validating the token behind the scenes. Here’s one EC2 terminal where my data plane is running. Since I disabled introspection caching for the OIDC plugin, Konnect hits Okta for each request to validate the token.</p>

<p></p>

 Deactivate the Okta Application 

<p>Another way to see introspection is by deactivating the Okta application. All tokens related to it will be considered invalid and, as a consequence, will not be accepted by Kong again.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to Okta’s application and deactivate it. We should get a 401 error code from Kong.</p>

<p></p>

 1.Introduction <p>CRISPY the&nbsp;world!!</p><p>Here is CRISPY WHALES selected as the second company for the AERGO incubation fund program. We are making the online platform, Banana Clips. Thanks to AERGO’s&nbsp;support.</p><p>Banana Clips is a platform that provides users to buy and sell short clips. It allows users to convert trendy video clips into NFT, and protects their copyrights of video clips through the service with patent technologies. Users on Banana Clips can easily purchase a variety of short clips without any concern about copyrights, and can trade their video clips and NTF assets. Please look forward to Banana Clips, the new paradigm of the short clip platform.</p> 2.On going Banana&nbsp;Clips <p>CRISPY WHALES is accelerating its development with the support of AERGO to open the Banana Clips service in&nbsp;July.</p><p>Not long before this report was written, new members with more than 10 years of experience joined us one after another to build and share the future of Banana&nbsp;Clips.</p><p>Among them, designer Jiwon Huh, who is leading the brand and UI/UX of our service, is with over 10 years of experience in various companies as Chief Design Officer (CDO) and has tremendous potential.</p>Jiwon Huh<p>Jiwon Huh</p>  ex CDO of&nbsp;3billion  ex CDO of Casual&nbsp;Steps  ex Design Director of&nbsp;Klleon   2–1. Creative <p>CRISP WHALES is currently working hard to develop Banana Clips. In addition to the technical part, we are putting a lot of effort into developing designs that users can directly&nbsp;feel.</p><p>PANTONE LLC, a global company that leads colour trends in various industries, selected Ultimate Gray and Illuminating, a yellow scale, as its 2021 colours, which contain warm and positive messages for tired humanity suffering from COVID-19.</p><p>This is Banana Clips’s primary colour, which naturally has melted the 2021 trend into our service. However, unlike other companies that use a yellow colour, we applied Baby Green, which reminds us of unripe bananas, to further clarify Banana Clips’ identity, to express the process of short clips becoming a well-cooked banana.</p><p>Banana Yellow</p><p>This colour means pure and warm affection, sincere participation and&nbsp;‘ego’.</p><p>We chose Persona, who shares fun and funny things with friends and blends from morning to night and blends in&nbsp;harmony.</p><p>Baby Green</p><p>This colour represents young and cute likning the unique to fresh-looking baby&nbsp;bananas.</p><p>It contains the future of short clips that can be anything with colours that contains infinite possibilities.</p><p>Banana Clips’ colors according to basic behaviors</p> 2–2.Growth <p>CRISPY WHALES is making great efforts externally as well for Banana Clips will blow a new wave in the contents business.</p><p>We have signed an MOU for a cooperative relationship between Videocon (videocon.co.kr), which is a video contest platform provided by Slate Media, and Banana Clips. Starting with this, we are preparing cooperations with various content productions and distribution channels like MOU. In addition, we completed a survey of popular works in major NFT markets and short clips’ markets and found out what they want through the main target community of video producers and editors. Based on these data, we will fill the service with various trending videos until the&nbsp;launch.</p> 2–3. Tech <p>CRISPY WHALES is a technical partner of AERGO and is in the process of maintenance on some of the AERGO modules. There are many aspects that have not been reflected in the AERGO source repositories because technical reviews are still in progress, but new features that suit the trend will be provided one after another&nbsp;soon.</p><p>In addition, the technical reviews for the recently announced ARC2 has been completed, and actual use is planned for the service currently under development. This smart contract will be mainly used for video transactions through our service, but we are not forgetting to carry out various usability experiments, so we look forward to introducing other use cases&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Finally, all videos uploaded to our service will be uploaded to the AERGO network after various information is extracted by our internal system. Currently, we are developing a video extraction system and search platform, but a new smart contract for this will be announced and distributed in time for the service opening in&nbsp;July.</p> TODO <p>CRISPY WHALES is planning several marketing plans to acquire early users and various contents according to the Banana Clips launch plan to be introduced in July. In addition, we plan to take steps to launch a global service and a mobile app in business. With Banana Clips, you will always have access to videos featuring local cultures from around the world. In addition, we will actively utilize SNS channels mainly used by each generation to share information about video creating and editing and NFT, so that community participants can use the service naturally at the same time as Banana Clips is launched.</p><p>The development team of CRISPY WHALES is putting development plans for another smart contracts and layer 2 on the roadmap in addition to ARC2 to safely store NFT, trading information and copyrights data on the AERGO blockchain network. We hope to share with our community extremely thrilling news&nbsp;, such as a new business model to increase the use of AERGO tokens in trading, but we ask for your understanding that we are still cautious about revealing many&nbsp;things.</p><p>CRISPY WHALES is doing its best to meet the AERGO community as soon as possible. In the next month or so, Banana Clips will be coming to you. Thanks to everyone who waited, and we hope that you will continue to keep in watching with a little more interest.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/crispy-the-world-9c6cb4fde3e5">CRISPY the world!!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

But what happens when that collaboration moves from a gallery or theatre on to the blockchain?</p><p>The answer is, well, just about anything.</p><p><a href="https://async.art/">Async Art</a> is pioneering a new kind of digital art crafted as a collection of live, editable “Layers”. Artists can maintain control of those Layers, sell ownership of individual Layers to collectors, or program the Layers to adapt programmatically based on anything from time of day to fluctuating stock market prices. What results is a fascinating realm of art that morphs and evolves, reacting to its community and the world at&nbsp;large.</p><p>I sat down with <a href="https://twitter.com/breadbreaker22">Lisa Liang</a>, Co-founder of Async Art, to learn more about how <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> helps make it all possible.</p><a href="https://async.art/art/master/0xb6dae651468e9593e4581705a09c10a76ac1e0c8-1494">Desert Clockwork</a>, Cyrus James Khan, 4-state autonomous NFT,&nbsp;2021 Appealing to a wider&nbsp;audience <p>When Async launched, new users were required to log in using a crypto wallet. This seemed reasonable for a platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, but user onboarding quickly became a bottleneck for the company’s growth. As Async began branching out beyond the crypto art community, it was clear that using crypto wallets like MetaMask was a serious challenge for many&nbsp;artists.</p><blockquote>“Before Magic, only a very small percentage of new artists actually ended up minting a&nbsp;piece.”</blockquote><p>According to Lisa, “A lot of traditional artists aren’t even on Twitter. The concept of using MetaMask or buying ETH — these are huge user onboarding hurdles. Magic makes it a lot&nbsp;easier.”</p><p>Like any NFT platform that relies on wallets, the Async team regularly spent hours walking new artists and potential buyers through the wallet setup process. This meant that the startup production team had less time to spend on developing important new features, and only a certain percentage of artists ultimately minted and listed artwork. Something had to&nbsp;change.</p> Onboarding built for&nbsp;everyone <p>To appeal to a wider audience, the Async team knew they needed an onboarding flow that didn’t rely solely on a wallet integration. On the flip side, they had an existing user base of NFT collectors who were passionate about crypto and decentralization. Magic provided Async with the intuitive user experience they needed while maintaining the security and integrity that are table stakes for a Web3 application.</p><blockquote>“Having Magic there eliminates 4 or 5 steps from our onboarding funnel.”</blockquote><p>Async’s top priority is enabling groundbreaking new forms of art, not necessarily exposing users to the tech stack that makes it possible. Lisa said it best: “Our vision for Async Art is to make this accessible for everyone. This is not just about NFTs, this is about utilizing digital technology to create artwork that could never have existed&nbsp;before.”</p><p>With Magic, new users simply enter their email address, click a magic link, and then dive right into the bold new world of programmable art. This streamlined onboarding flow translated to a smoother, faster creation process for artists. After implementing Magic links along with other additional features, Async more than doubled the amount of artworks created on their platform.</p> Focusing on fundamentals <p>Considering Async has invented an entirely new medium of art, newcomers already have quite a bit to wrap their heads around. Magic authentication means login is one less thing for new users to worry&nbsp;about.</p>Almost 40% of Async’s new users are now onboarded with&nbsp;Magic<p>The Async team has seen a growing number of new users opt for passwordless login since implementing Magic just a few months ago. As of May 2021, about 39% of all new users opt for magic link login instead of using a wallet. For Lisa and the rest of the team, this has been immediate validation that choosing Magic has had a positive impact on Async’s&nbsp;growth.</p><blockquote>“Magic makes everyone’s lives&nbsp;easier.”</blockquote><p>In addition to providing a smoother, more accessible onboarding experience for users, Magic has helped the Async team get back valuable time. Lisa told me login-related support requests are now practically nonexistent. That means the Async team can stop worrying about wallet creation and instead focus on trailblazing the future of digital art with new offerings like <a href="https://async.art/music">Async&nbsp;Music</a>.</p><p>Whatever comes next, I can honestly say I’m thrilled to see where the journey takes&nbsp;them.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/async-art-is-bringing-nfts-to-life-with-a-little-help-from-magic-ef558e7c1184">Async Art is bringing NFTs to life with a little help from Magic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Writing about legal topics is always a challenge. I am not a lawyer, but as an analyst and advisor, however, I almost inevitably encounter the implications of laws and current case law. Thus, this text describes only a personal assessment and is not intended to be, and should not be used as, legal advice (and in any case KuppingerCole Analysts do not provide legal advice). At the end of the day, any action should be clarified with colleagues properly qualified to do so, including the legal team.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve5_2020_07_16_small" title="ruling of the European Court of Justice">ruling of the European Court of Justice</a> (ECJ), which has gained some notoriety under the name "Schrems II", has caused great uncertainty among many organizations. The fact that the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/ccpa-gdpr-as-a-catalyst-for-improving-data-protection-outside-the-eu" title="data protection standard, as currently practiced in the United States of America">data protection standard, as currently practiced in the United States of America</a>, is to be considered non-compliant with the requirements of the European Union and the General Data Protection Regulation has had a direct significant impact on an assessment of the processing of personal data abroad, especially of course in the USA. The mechanism previously known as "Privacy Shield" was rendered void overnight. This, of course, particularly impacts the use of cloud services, which had grown significantly over the past year and a half, not least due to the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/reinwarth/pepp-pt-bridging-the-gap-between-covid-19-pandemic-control-and-privacy-by-design" title="pandemic-induced migration to digital services">pandemic-induced migration to digital services</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/custech2020_2020_10_21_kerl_kinast" title="state of limbo">state of limbo</a> and lack of legal certainty required a comprehensive solution. This is now available in the form of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/1_en_act_part1_v5.pdf" title="final version">final version</a> of the "standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries" (published on June 4, 2021). This document, which was published by the European Commission, and the measures it describes are intended to make it possible to continue transferring personal data to countries outside of the EU and to process it there.</p>
 More than just paper – tangible supplementary measures are needed. 
<p>However, merely amending the contractual basis is not enough: tangible technical and organizational measures that ensure the minimization, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization#New_Definition_for_Pseudonymization_Under_GDPR" title="pseudonymization">pseudonymization</a> (as defined by the GDPR) and encryption of transferred data must be developed, and implemented precisely as described. This not only puts the onus on the providers of such Internet services (and their supply chain, end-to-end) to support these measures, but also forces the users of cloud services, for example, to practice data hygiene and reduce the volume of data, which can only be beneficial in terms of improved data protection. The SCCs (Standard contractual clauses) will only be considered effective providing these measures are in place.</p>
<p></p>
 Call for action 
<p>Considering this development as a layman in legal matters this document and the updated SCCs represent an important first step in my opinion. Even if the actual problem (the root cause) namely the possibility of American authorities viewing personal data on the systems of American providers, is not solved. Consideration must now be given to each individual case where personal data is transferred outside of the EU to select and fully implement the correct tools for encryption, pseudonymization and minimization of data at rest, in transit and during processing. While this will involve considerable effort, it is certainly more favorable when compared to the previous legal uncertainty.</p>
<p>This is where we as analysts and advisors come into play. Concepts, technologies, and products that can help implement appropriate technical and organizational measures are evolving quickly. Information Protection and Secure Information Sharing will become increasingly important. These include, for example, Azure Information Protection or advanced tools that enable the transparent encryption and use of critical information, including personal data. Sensitive data discovery, data cataloging and encryption concepts will play a significant role in light of this development. This holds true for structured data and unstructured data alike. Data governance will become a key area to exercise appropriate control over data of varying sensitivity. Data catalogs and data management will facilitate transparency regarding the nature, location and flow of data.</p>
<p>Finally, the requirement for organizational and technical measures to protect transferred data will also have a significant impact on the spread and use of more sophisticated, emerging technologies for encrypting data during use. For example, providers of technologies for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/homomorphic_encryption" title="homomorphic encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> can make a substantial contribution to the definition and implementation of appropriate measures.</p>
<p>KuppingerCole Analysts research – including our <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/?p_order_by=date_publish&amp;p_keyword=&amp;p_topic%5B%5D=&amp;p_type%5B%5D=8&amp;p_author%5B%5D=" title="market compasses">market compasses</a> and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/?p_order_by=date_publish&amp;p_keyword=&amp;p_topic%5B%5D=&amp;p_type%5B%5D=8&amp;p_author%5B%5D=" title="leadership compasses">leadership compasses</a> – builds the foundation for an in-depth view of those markets and technologies.

<p>Pikkle is the first blockchain-based voting and global viewer participation service application built on the AERGO platform. Without understanding blockchain technology, users can access voting as well as attendance results in real-time. Pikkle will be used by the <a href="http://www.kba.or.kr/">Korean Broadcasters Association </a>and developed by <a href="https://www.blocko.io/">Blocko</a>, AERGO’s technology partner.</p><p>What problems is Pikkle trying to resolve with the traditional voting&nbsp;system?</p><p>1. Cost inefficiency</p>  In general, the voting process is complicated and incurs substantial cost in voter targeting, identity verification, ballot count, opening process tables as well as checklists  <p>2. Trust in voting&nbsp;result</p>  There has been trust issues with the electoral system for a long time. Many people do not trust the result of votes — such as resident votes, broadcast program votes and legislative elections  There is a prevailing believe that views and poll results collected via social network services can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platform provider’s own&nbsp;interest  <p>Main Features:</p><p>Voting:</p><p>With the Korean Broadcasters Associations, Pikkle aims to provide a reliable voting service for all users. Pikkle collects users’ views and help their decision-making process through an app service rather than the traditional text voting or spam-type cold calls. ‘Pikkle’ will solve the existing voting problems by storing key data of the voting process (identification of voters, validation of voting, voting results etc.) using blockchain technology.</p><p>Many polls and surveys are still conducted by classic methods such as texting or phone calls despite the current rate of mobile phone penetration. Pikkle encourages users to simply scan a QR code to participate in festivals and voting actions. In this manner, we believe it can be a more convenient and fun&nbsp;service.</p><p>This method has been attempted by many big tech platforms. However, due to public interest and platform dependency issues, it was previously difficult to be socially accepted. Using blockchain technology, Pikkle aims to prevent platforms or stakeholders from interfering in decision-making processes and to promote two way communication by introducing a fair voting system in many content based industries.</p><p>Event Participation:</p><p>In addition to participating in various cultural and artistic events, festivals and broadcasting programs, you can use Pikkle in ‘Metaverse’ events. Pikkle diversifies the participation experience by issuing NFT digital tickets built on the blockchain.</p><p>Mobile tickets with blockchain NFTs (Non-Fungible Token) applied can be used to prove the ownership in the offline world. It even provides features such as joining a queue and tickets for concerts in the virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pikkle’s vision and&nbsp;roadmap:</p><p>2021</p>  Q2: Develop Pikkle Service ver&nbsp;1.0  Q3: Release Pikkle Service ver 1.0 and integrate the system with broadcasting companies and festivals  Q4: Develop Pikkle Service ver 2.0 — Payment&nbsp;system  <p>2022</p>  Q1: Develop Pikkle Service ver2.0 — issuing tickets on<a href="https://github.com/aergoio/ARC2NFT"> ARC2 NFT </a>(AERGO Non Fungible Token Contract)  Q2: Develop and release Pikkle service ver 2.0 — Integrate the system with Metaverse  <p>Origins of&nbsp;Pikkle</p><p>Pikkle originates from the words ‘Pick’ and ‘People’.</p><p>Pikkle’s logo was designed using a round shape feature to emphasize friendliness for every user. Purple is the primary color of Pikkle as the color reflects credibility and creativity.</p><p>Pikkle’s symbol was inspired by ‘P’ from the word ‘Pikkle’ and the shape of a cell phone camera lens that is used to scan QR&nbsp;codes.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/pikkle-x-aergo-7d1b3421e1ff">Pikkle x AERGO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p> Viele Unternehmen nutzen heute mehrere Cloud-Dienste, wobei ihre Enduser regelmäßig Dutzende oder sogar Hunderte verschiedener SaaS-Anwendungen verwenden. Diese große Cloud-Migration hat erfolgreich eine Ausweitung des mobilen Arbeitens ermöglicht und beschleunigt Initiativen zur digitalen Transformation. Eine steigende Anzahl an Cloud-Diensten bedeutet allerdings ebenso einen Anstieg an IT-Sicherheitsherausforderungen. Neben den grundlegenden Cloud-Sicherheitsaspekten entsteht eine zusätzliche Komplexität sowie Interoperabilitätsprobleme, die sich aus siloartigen Identity Stores, nativen Toolsets und einem Konflikt aufgrund der geteilten Verantwortlichkeiten der Cloud-Anbieter ergeben. All das schafft eine erweiterte Angriffsfläche und muss von Unternehmen adressiert werden.</p>
<p>Die Identity Challenge ist die wichtigste Sicherheitsherausforderung die es für Unternehmen zu lösen gilt und wird primär durch die Standardisierung des Managements und der Sicherheitskontrollen im gesamten IT-Ökosystem bewältigt. Nehmen Sie an dieser Sitzung teil und erfahren Sie mehr über:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Die wichtigsten Cloud-Sicherheitsrisiken&nbsp; 
 Wo native Toolsets Lücken in der Sicherheit hinterlassen, die Sie adressieren müssen&nbsp; 
 Wie Sie mit Privileged Access Management (PAM) Best Practices für Cloud-Sicherheit implementieren, um die Wahrscheinlichkeit und das Ausmaß von Sicherheitsverletzungen in der Cloud deutlich zu verringern

   Zusammenarbeit und neue Arbeitsformen ermöglichen, IT-Modernisierung unterstützen 
<p>IAM (Identity und Access Management) ist ein Kernelement jeder Strategie im Bereich der Cybersicherheit. Kontext- und risikobasierte Zugriffssteuerung und adaptive Authentifizierung sind Kernelemente jeder funktionierenden Sicherheitsstrategie. Gerade für Zero Trust mit seinem Grundsatz „Nicht vertrauen – überprüfen!“ ist ein gutes, modernes IAM essentiell, um eben diese Überprüfung durchführen und Zugriffe in Abhängigkeit vom Risiko steuern zu können.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger wird in seinem Vortrag auf die Bedeutung von Zero Trust-Strategien ebenso wie für SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) eingehen, aber auch für die Möglichkeiten, IT insgesamt zu modernisieren. Dabei wird er aufzeigen, wie ein modernes IAM die heutigen Anforderungen unterstützen kann und dabei hilft, eine IT zu schaffen, in der Zusammenarbeitsmodelle mit Partnern und Kunden ebenso wie neue Arbeitsformen für Mitarbeiter flexibel und sicher unterstützt werden und die bereit für alle Varianten von Deployment-Modellen ist.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kuppinger-zero-trust-sase-iam"></a>

 The Day the Veriscope Secretariat Responded to the Financial Action Task Force&nbsp;(FATF) <p>Veriscope and Shyft Network’s response to FATF Draft Guidance on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers</p><p>Last March, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued a<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/public-consultation-guidance-vasp.html#:~:text=asset%20service%20providers-,Public%20consultation%20on%20FATF%20draft%20guidance%20on%20a%20risk%2Dbased,and%20virtual%20asset%20service%20providers&amp;text=In%20July%202020%2C%20the%20FATF,G20%20on%20so%2Dcalled%20stablecoins."> Public consultation</a> on FATF draft guidance on a risk-based approach to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers. Their high-level objective is simple: to update its<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/RBA-VA-VASPs.pdf"> Guidance on the risk-based approach to virtual assets (VAs) and virtual asset service providers (VASPs)</a>.</p><p>As long-time players in the crypto industry, the decision to participate in the consultation was an easy one. The Guidance is an extremely important piece of international policy for our industry; it sets the pace for all member states of FATF on how to treat and deal with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing issues when it comes to cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;VASPs.</p><blockquote>… we support the FATF’s overarching objectives of updating its pre-existing Guidance in a manner that maintains a level playing field for VASPs, minimizes opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, and preserves the intended technological neutrality of the FATF Standards. However, in our view, further revisions are required to ensure that the updated guidance achieves these objectives without going beyond the requirements of the FATF Standards or introducing elements that will have undesirable or intended consequences.</blockquote> Intro <p>The consultation presents five different areas of focus for participants to comment. For the purposes of keeping this post simple, we will only summarize the responses.</p><p>In general terms, the Veriscope Secretariat sees several omissions or shortcomings in the proposed guidance. Should these remain in the updated guidance and become policy, the development, adoption and improvement of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies as a nascent industry will be at&nbsp;risk.</p><p>If you want to read the complete document, please click on the following link:<a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/public-consultation#public-consultation-on-fatf-draft-guidance--a-risk-based-approach-to-virtual-assets-and-virtual-asset-service-providers"> Response by the VERISCOPE Secretariat &amp; Shyft&nbsp;Network</a>.</p> The Response  I. Definition of VASP and VASP activities subject to the FATF Standards <p>The revised Guidance expansive approach to the definition of VASP appears to be inconsistent and its scope could potentially lead regulators to consider, for example, key signers for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s), as VASPs, regardless of their ability, or lack thereof, to participate in the decision making process and custodial obligations.</p><blockquote>We see unintended consequences from this that could move to eliminate key signers from these processes which can further lead to security vulnerabilities at the smart contract level (putting innocent users of these systems at risk), and could introduce innovative obfuscation techniques that further eliminate governance methods that play important roles in transparency and functionality.</blockquote><p>Here’s an example of how this approach can create unnecessary complexity or, worse, roadblocks in the development of solutions for better financial inclusion: Key signing entities in community-run asset pools in DeFi protocols do not have the ability to verify the destination of fund transmissions, and, at times, these signing parties are involved in the blind transmission of assets through autonomous routes. We proposed a review of the definition of control and the role of key signers entirely in the process of transmission.</p><p>In addition, the expanded guidance touches on the role of developers, and the distinction between development companies in contrast to open source software developers (a very common occurrence in our space), is unclear to the point of being&nbsp;blurred.</p><blockquote>It should be noted that in the event this was to be true, even public protocols that are being designed today to solve FATF guidance and travel rule requirements would therefore be VASPs. This would lead to a massive slow down in current timelines and the ability for the industry to utilize smart contract native systems in enabling effective methods of risk mitigation for regulatory purposes.</blockquote><p>Our recommendation to the FATF is to redraft the areas that describe “developers” making a clear distinction between development companies and individuals paid on a fee basis. The blockchain space has grown, in many ways, thanks to open-source software and independent contractors; it’s imperative that we defend and promote this practice.</p> II. Mitigation of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks relating to peer-to-peer transactions <p>We think that the measures and controls in the draft guidance will not mitigate the ML/TF risks that might emerge when P2P transactions gain widespread acceptance. Most of the proposed measures will place additional obligations on VASPs and other obligated entities, resulting in minimal impact of mitigating the ML/TF risks of P2P transactions of unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>We support the recommendation that countries would consider ways of mitigating ML/TF P2P transaction risks through blockchain analytics. We encourage the FATF to further explore how blockchain analytics and other innovative technological solutions can provide greater visibility over P2P transactions between unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> III. Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>We believe that further clarity is needed around the FATF’s expectations of VASPs when transacting with unhosted wallets since the recent drafting suggests that the transactions should be treated as higher risk without providing a supporting rationale.</p><p>Based on our reliance on VASPs and their role as the verifying entities of the largest amount of KYC’s users in the space, we proposed that the FATF allow time for travel rule solutions to work directly on unhosted wallet discovery as well as VASP discovery before determining risk profiles and mitigation methods that may inaccurately assume the risk and hinder&nbsp;growth.</p> IV. FATF and Stablecoins <p>The revised FATF Guidance is generally helpful in confirming the applicability of VASP regulations to stablecoin issuers. However, when it comes to the specific details of comparing stablecoin issuers to other VASPs, particularly for the purpose of conducting an AML/CFT risk assessment, there are several aspects of the Guidance that appear to reflect a misunderstanding of how centrally administered stablecoins function. We believe that conducting an accurate risk assessment of stablecoins is contingent upon having a thorough understanding of how these products currently function, in practice.</p><p>Stablecoins have become an essential element in the crypto industry, with <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/90439/on-chain-stablecoin-volume-december">billions of $USD in volume being transacted through them</a>. The FATF’s understanding of the key features of stablecoins is somewhat limited to them being a volatility avoidance instrument. We expanded on this definition and discussed that their true nature is speed, reliability and low cost for cross-border transactions. Their usability is not limited to issues related to virtual assets, rather, to limitations of cross-border banking.</p><p>Our position, in general terms, is that the risks of stablecoins and their issuers are analogous to the risks of VAs and other VASPs and that prior guidance was already sufficient to mitigate these potential risks. New recommendations by the FATF necessitate an updated risk assessment of this&nbsp;sector.</p> V. Effective implementation of FATF Standards <p>One important element that we identified and discussed was the licensing or registration of VASPs in the applicable jurisdiction. We view this, and the suggestion that local authorities impose conditions on VASPs seeking a license to be able to be supervised as an unfair adaptation of prudential and market conduct requirements for traditional financial institutions unfit for purpose in an AML/CFT context for the VASP&nbsp;sector.</p><p>We believe that the only way to effectively enable compliance in this new realm is to allow for data-collecting centralized intermediaries, to be able to represent users and act as data custodians of that data, while allowing users to passport across decentralized applications.</p><p>Rather than imposing requirements, we recommended that the FATF follows a similar path as it did with money or value transfer services (MVTS), which, like VASPs, may have no physical presence in the country where a transaction is sent or received. In its risk-based approach guidance for MVTS, the FATF encourages competent authorities in the host and home jurisdictions to liaise as appropriate to ensure any ML/TF concerns are adequately addressed. We believe that this would be a more appropriate approach in the VASP context that would ensure a more level playing field among AML/CFT-obliged entities and would reinforce the FATF’s principles of information-sharing and cooperation amongst VASP supervisors.</p><p>We also commented on the risk assessment requirement the FATF seeks to implement. To this point, we asserted that the currently available framework is insufficient in helping the industry identify, assess and understand their ML/TF risks. The crypto industry is rapidly evolving and, unlike the traditional financial sector, hasn’t developed effective controls over decades of experience and operations. That said, industry stakeholders are already initiating a risk assessment exercise and welcome the FATF to an open dialogue.</p> Wrapping up <p>As it pertains to the approach to effective regulation, we believe that the FATF will likely need a fundamentally different approach to regulation.</p><p>When it comes to decentralized systems and smart contracts that do not, and cannot, centralize the data collection and compliance processes that traditional intermediaries hold, we need to look at new approaches to compliance and KYC verification. This is especially true for Decentralized Finance&nbsp;(DeFi).</p><p>Systems are being built today that allow us to decentralize or passport the identities and KYC data sets of users across smart contracts and noncustodial wallets. We believe that the only way to effectively enable compliance in this new realm is to allow for data-collecting centralized intermediaries, to be able to represent users and act as data custodians of that data, while allowing users to passport across decentralized applications. These systems can allow us to have source nexus points for user validation and onboarding, but still allow those users (represented by the public addresses they use today to move assets) to utilize smart contract applications while leveraging reliance on the source data stores and validating onboarding entities. This will be the future of how compliant opt-in systems work across this ecosystem and can solve many of the largest risks and threats that are inherent from an AML/CFT perspective.</p><blockquote>While this infrastructure is currently being developed in systems like Shyft Network among others, we believe that users should not be required to take on compliance or sanctions obligations directly. These systems, when they are solely in the non-custodial realm, are extensions of bearer instruments like cash, and effective regulation needs to focus its efforts on the on-ramps and off-ramps (like that of the traditional financial system) without requiring innocent civilians to take on compliance obligations and the responsibility of sanctions requirements.</blockquote><p>Decentralized systems should be looked at largely as public utilities and enhancements to the utilization of digital bearer instruments that are designed to invoke user freedom and the betterment of individual choice, while still ensuring law enforcement has the ability to effectively address illicit activity. Our ability to ensure these networks do not unintentionally transition to deeper levels of obfuscation is critical in this current time to ensure we can maintain visibility and transparency into how these networks publicly function. Regulations can help maintain this visibility in collaboration with this technology, or hinder it if we do not act collaboratively and cautiously to nurture its benefits.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

<p>The global digital&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;spend&nbsp;is&nbsp;set to hit nearly&nbsp;<a href="https://au.oberlo.com/blog/digital-marketing-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20digital%20ad%20spend,on%20by%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.">USD&nbsp;390&nbsp;billion&nbsp;in 2021</a>. But in&nbsp;yet&nbsp;another&nbsp;blow&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;big tech&nbsp;companies reaping the rewards,&nbsp;a bipartisan group of&nbsp;US senators has raised&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/senators-raise-security-concerns-over-selling-personal-data-a-16351">national security concerns&nbsp;</a>over&nbsp;the&nbsp;automated process that makes personalized&nbsp;ads possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Specifically, their concerns relate to what’s known as&nbsp;“real time bidding”, the split-second automated&nbsp;auction&nbsp;process used to&nbsp;rapidly place&nbsp;personalized ads&nbsp;on&nbsp;web&nbsp;pages, and&nbsp;the “bid stream data”, comprising a users’ personal data, that&nbsp;is&nbsp;used in the bidding process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;three&nbsp;important&nbsp;things to understand here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  What the senators want to know&nbsp;and why&nbsp;  



  How real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp;  



  The privacy issues that potentially risk the safety of US citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p></p>



 What the senators want to know&nbsp;and why&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>On April 1, 2021,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-bipartisan-senators-question-online-ad-exchanges-on-sharing-of-americans-data-with-foreign-companies">six&nbsp;US&nbsp;senators</a>&nbsp;sent a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/040121%20Wyden%20led%20Bidstream%20Letter%20to%20ATT.pdf">letter&nbsp;</a>to AT&amp;T, Index Exchange, Google, Magnite, OpenX, PubMatic, Twitter and Verizon&nbsp;demanding&nbsp;to&nbsp;know,&nbsp;by May 4, 2021,&nbsp;every “foreign-headquartered or foreign-majority owned company” to whom&nbsp;the&nbsp;companies&nbsp;had given&nbsp;the&nbsp;personal&nbsp;data&nbsp;of&nbsp;US users&nbsp;over the pastthree&nbsp;years. In addition, they want to know:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  The specific data about users, their devices and the websites and apps they’re using that&nbsp;these companies are sharing&nbsp;with&nbsp;ad&nbsp;auction&nbsp;participants&nbsp;  Every&nbsp;foreign and domestic company that has received bid stream data in the past three years&nbsp;thatisn’t&nbsp;contractually&nbsp;prohibited&nbsp;from using&nbsp;that&nbsp;data&nbsp;in&nbsp;any&nbsp;way&nbsp;unrelated&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bid&nbsp;process&nbsp;  Any contractual restrictions in place prohibiting the sharing, sale, or secondary use of bid stream&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data and&nbsp;all&nbsp;compliance&nbsp;audit efforts&nbsp;and results.&nbsp;  



<p>The&nbsp;senators&nbsp;fear&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;easy access to&nbsp;bid stream data during&nbsp;the&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;process allows&nbsp;foreign governments to&nbsp;profile&nbsp;US citizens.&nbsp;To wrap your head around that risk, it’s important to understand&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;and the significant&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy issues&nbsp;that result.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 How&nbsp;real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/real-time-bidding/">Real time bidding</a>&nbsp;is an exchange&nbsp;that happens in the&nbsp;milliseconds&nbsp;before a web page loads.&nbsp;It&nbsp;automates&nbsp;the process of buying and selling ad space online&nbsp;and makes personalized ads possible.&nbsp;It’s often&nbsp;difficult for non-tech people to believe this&nbsp;data exchange and ad placement&nbsp;can&nbsp;happen in&nbsp;milliseconds of real time,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it does.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Real time bidding&nbsp;works&nbsp;like an auction in that advertisers bid on&nbsp;available space on web pages and&nbsp;the space typically goes to&nbsp;the&nbsp;highest bidder.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/marketing/real-time-bidding/">four-part process</a>:&nbsp;</p>



  Once a user clicks on a link to open a web site, the site’s publisher sends the dimensions of its available ad space to what’s known as a supply side platform (SSP), a technology platform (like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/">WebFX</a>) that automates the process of web&nbsp;publishers&nbsp;selling their ad space to advertisers.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  The SSP then analyzes the user’s cookies to gather as much data as possible about the user. This is known as bid stream data&nbsp;and&nbsp;typically&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adpushup.com/blog/what-is-bidstream-%20data/#:~:text=All%20the%20data%20passed%20with,Information)%20is%20exc%20hanged%20using%20bidstream">includes</a>&nbsp;URL, device type, model, screen size, CPU,&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;and connection, web browsing activity and interests, IP address and ZIP code location, as well as age and gender.&nbsp;This data determines the most relevant ad for the user.&nbsp;  



  Next, a demand side platform (e.g. Google Ad Manager) uses the bid stream data&nbsp;from the SSP&nbsp;to assign a dollar value to the user’s impression (display of the ad on the user’s screen)&nbsp;and place&nbsp;bids from&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;on the ad space.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Finally, the SSP receives the bids and awards the ad space to the highest&nbsp;bidder.&nbsp;The web page then loads with the ad&nbsp;in the contested slot.&nbsp;The publisher has sold their ad&nbsp;for profit, the advertiser has&nbsp;got its&nbsp;product in front of its highly targeted audience,&nbsp;and the user is none the wiser&nbsp;that&nbsp;their&nbsp;profiledata was&nbsp;up for grabs&nbsp;only moments before.&nbsp;  



<p></p>



 5&nbsp;significant privacy issues&nbsp;of&nbsp;the process &nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>You guessed it: the process is fraught with significant&nbsp;data&nbsp;privacy issues:&nbsp;</p>



  Hundreds of companies can participate in the real time bidding process. Every auction participant gets access to the bid stream data and they don’t even have to bid.&nbsp;  



  Most anyone can participate in the auction: barriers to entry are low.&nbsp;And while there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bidstream/">penalties</a>&nbsp;for misusing bid stream data, parsing the data is still&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-bidstream/">highly valuable</a>&nbsp;to participants.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Bid stream data&nbsp;can be harvested&nbsp;even&nbsp;without third party cookies&nbsp;so recent efforts by&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">Google</a>&nbsp;to ban third party cookies do nothing to&nbsp;mitigate the privacy risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  The bid stream data is usually&nbsp;anonymized&nbsp;but, as we’ve&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/re-identification-of-anonymous-data-is-scarily-simple/">recently&nbsp;covered</a>,&nbsp;it’s relatively easy to match a user to their information.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Data brokers readily package the bid stream data&nbsp;(particularly valuable location data)&nbsp;and&nbsp;sell it&nbsp;to other companies&nbsp;and&nbsp;even&nbsp;governments&nbsp;with little oversight — the key point of&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators’ concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Sen. Ron&nbsp;Wyden,&nbsp;D-Ore.,&nbsp;who&nbsp;led&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators&nbsp;in&nbsp;writing to the eight ad exchange firms,&nbsp;says: “Few Americans realize that some auction participants are siphoning off and&nbsp;storing&nbsp;‘bid stream data’&nbsp;to compile exhaustive dossiers about them. In turn,&nbsp;these dossiers are being openly sold to anyone with a credit card, including&nbsp;to hedge&nbsp;funds, political campaigns and even to governments.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The concern of course is that the information ends up with foreign governments who could create digital profiles of US citizens.&nbsp;“This information would be a goldmine for foreign intelligence services&nbsp;that could&nbsp;exploit it to inform and supercharge hacking, blackmail and&nbsp;influence&nbsp;campaigns,”&nbsp;the&nbsp;senators say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see which companies reply, what they say, and what happens next.

			 The growing interest in security tokens 
<p>Capital markets are advancing into a digital-first world and financial institutions have never been so enthusiastic about investing in digital assets. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/security-tokens-growth-europe-cryptocurrencies?">According to a study</a> conducted by the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, Plutoneo, and Tangany, the European security token market is expected to grow approximately 81% annually over the next five years, and is projected to reach €918 billion by 2026. Its market volume could surpass the cryptocurrency industry in the next five years.</p>
 Identifying wallet owners is a regulatory obligation 
<p>Security tokens are becoming popular and are likely to become a major investment option in the future as the interest keeps growing. However, the change in market infrastructure does not change the fact that securities need to comply with financial regulations. In the tokenization world, investors hold their assets in blockchain wallet(s). Therefore, it is critical for issuers to be able to identify who the wallet owner is and whether this owner is eligible to own the security. Blockchain identities solve this legal problem for issuers. Digital identities not only allow issuers to address compliance issues, but also enable protection for investors through recovery processes.</p>
 Digital identities enable the recovery of security tokens 
<p>If a cryptocurrency holder loses their private key or wallet access credentials for their self-custody wallet, the assets (Bitcoin etc.) are lost and cannot be recovered as most cryptocurrencies are decentralized and controlled by algorithms. Unlike cryptocurrencies, security tokens are controlled by issuers who are liable to their investors by law. As each investor is identified on the blockchain by his/her self-sovereign digital identity instead of the wallet, issuers can recover security tokens to the investor’s new wallet after confirming his/her identity. The traceability of ownership is recorded on the blockchain.</p>
<p>For example, issuers of tokenized securities using the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX open source protocol</a> are able to trigger a recovery function present by default in the suite of smart contracts. In practice, the security tokens can be recovered in just a few steps:</p>
 
 Declare the loss of the wallet: The investor creates a request to recover their tokens to the issuer (or its agent). 
 Verify the digital identity – ONCHAINID: The issuer (or its agent) verifies the token holder’s identity with a standardized KYC process to validate the provenance of the request. 
 Recover the same tokens in the new wallet: If the verification is positive, the issuer triggers the recovery function and the lost tokens are transferred to the new investor wallet. This new wallet will also be added to the ONCHAINID of the investor. 
 
<p>Therefore, issuers and securities custodians can fulfil their securities restitution obligations, whilst investors can participate in tokenized investment opportunities with greater confidence.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 Custodial wallets vs self-custody wallets 
<p>As security tokens are recoverable, investors can choose to use custodial wallets or self-custody ones to store their security tokens with low risk. A self-custody wallet, such as Metamask, allows investors to self-custody their assets by managing the private keys themselves. However, in the case of private key loss, the issuer may charge a recovery operation fee.</p>
<p>While self-custody may seem like a good option, it can be difficult for the layperson due to the technical knowledge required.&nbsp; Some investors may want another regulated party to hold the asset custody accountable, such as institutions. A custodial wallet is a more suitable option for them because regulated entities like banks, issuers or marketplace operators will then keep their private keys. The cost of a custodial wallet will obviously be more expensive, and is sometimes based on assets under management (AuM).</p>

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Regardless of the type of wallet, digital identities lie at the heart of security tokens custody for investors, and secure the assets against loss and theft. As such, wallets are less important to tokenized securities holders than to cryptocurrency holders. With security tokens, the digital identities of investors double up as their blockchain account, with one or several wallets, where assets are controlled and managed, while their wallets are more like blockchain browsers where assets are viewed and where they confirm actions. Digital identity paves the way for the new era of asset custody.</p>

Launched by Indicio.Tech, Cardea provides an easily verifiable, trustworthy, unalterable proof of health tests or vaccination that can be shared in a privacy-preserving way. Cardea easily integrates with existing health systems to ensure trusted data sources for credentials and uses decentralized identity technology to enable better control of data for individuals. Cardea <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/privacy-first-covid-verification-technology-takes-a-giant-step-forward-with-cardea-301286983.html">recently announced its first reference implementation in partnership with SITA for the island of&nbsp;Aruba</a>.</blockquote><p>As part of this ongoing initiative, the Linux Foundation today <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">announced the launch of the Global COVID Certificate Network</a> (GCCN) with Indicio as an initial supporter, among&nbsp;others.</p><p>The goal of the GCCN is to “to facilitate the safe and free movement of individuals globally during the COVID pandemic.

It follows and operationalizes the Interoperability Blueprint (the “Blueprint”) of the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a> (GHPC), an industry coalition that has defined principles and standards for COVID certificates. LFPH has co-led the process drafting the Blueprint, which was released on Monday for a period of public&nbsp;review.</blockquote><p>So what does this all&nbsp;mean?</p><p>Between Cardea’s verifiable credentials platform and the GCCN registry to promote standardization and interoperability, we’re that much closer to having a portable identity that works (and facilitates travel) across borders — all while giving users ownership and control over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p> Learn more:   <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-connects-to-the-indicio-network-2ad5688d72fd">GlobaliD connects to the Indicio&nbsp;Network</a>  <a href="https://www.lfph.io/2021/06/08/gccn/">Introducing the Global COVID Certificate Network</a>&nbsp;(GCCN)  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/privacy-first-covid-verification-technology-takes-a-giant-step-forward-with-cardea-301286983.html">Indicio Announcement of the Cardea Project contribution to Linux Foundation Public&nbsp;Health</a>  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-welcomes-new-projects-and-members-to-advance-public-health-safely-reopen-amid-covid-19-301298729.html">Linux Foundation Public Health announcement of the Cardea&nbsp;project</a>  <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea App webpage</a> with community meeting information (as well as links to meeting archives in Github, Slack,&nbsp;Twitter)  <a href="https://ledgerinsights.com/good-health-pass-publishes-blueprint-for-health-credential-interoperability/">Ledger Insights pre-announcement coverage of&nbsp;GCCN</a>  <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass</a> (and Blueprint)   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea Project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

					 Implementing the Good Health Pass’s recommendations with Cardea 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Cardea is a fully open-source and field-tested verifiable digital credential that meets the major requirements of the Good Health Pass.   
			   
				
				
				 <p>With the rollout of the EU Digital COVID Certificate (previously called the Digital Green<br>Certificate), digital health credentials for managing COVID-19 are now a reality. Political urgency has, unsurprisingly, driven the certificate’s development. A borderless political bloc needs a safe way to ensure travel within its member states. The question is how to make these certificates work—and evolve—in a way that maximizes privacy and security, while interoperating with other credential systems outside the EU.</p>
<p>Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) is leading two collaborative projects that aim to do this. The Global COVID Certificate Network, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/linux-foundation-public-health-creates-the-global-covid-certificate-network-gccn-301307874.html">announced today</a>, is a way for COVID-19 test certificates issued in one country to be recognized as authoritative in another. The second is the <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>, an industry coalition that has defined principles and standards for COVID-19 certificates themselves so that they are privacy-preserving, secure, and interoperable. The Good Health Pass “blueprint” is currently in public draft review.</p>
<p>Cardea, a full, open-source ecosystem for verifiable health credentials developed by Indicio and now a community-led project at LFPH, meets the major recommendations of the Good Health Pass and facilitates the goals of the Global COVID Certificate Network.</p>
<p>The chart below shows the alignment between Cardea and the Good Health Pass recommendations—and where development efforts will be focused to enable full compliance.</p>

				 <p>Cardea has been <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">successfully trialed</a> on the island of Aruba by SITA, the leading global provider of technology to the air transport industry. The pilot project enabled travelers to prove their Covid-test status to restaurants and hospitality locations around the island without having to share any personal information. Dangui Oduber, Aruba’s minister of tourism, public health and sport, <a href="https://www.phocuswire.com/aruba-tests-blockchain-enabled-covid-credential-app">described</a> the ability to trust important health information while preserving visitors’ privacy as “a revolutionary step forward.”</p>
<p>Cardea’s strength as a functioning, deployable ecosystem is that it is built using open source software and doesn’t require any proprietary technology for implementation. It is based on the Hyperledger Indy platform, and uses Hyperledger Aries agents and Hyperledger Ursa cryptography—each backed by dynamic developer communities.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cardea.app/">Cardea Community Group</a>, which meets weekly, is led by co-chairs, Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio, and Keela Shatzkin of Shatzkin Systems. The Cardea Steering Committee, which will guide Cardea’s development&nbsp; is currently composed of Trevor Butterworth, Indicio; Kristy Gale, Honor DRM; John Kindervag, ON2IT; RJ Reiser, Liquid Avatar;&nbsp; Adrien Sanglier, SITA; Mitja Simcic, GlobaliD, and Mike Vesey, IdRamp. The Cardea Steering Committee is committed to inclusion in developing this project and will actively engage in recruiting a diversity of voices to join the committee.</p>

<p>Il prossimo 10 di giugno, avrà luogo un nuovo evento virtuale sul tema “Identità Digitale, opportunità per le imprese, collocazione europea, casi d’uso, rischi operativi ed evoluzioni”, organizzato da ClubTI Milano e ClubTI Triveneto, che a partire dalle 17:30, vedrà susseguirsi gli interventi di alcuni importanti relatori fra cui Marta Gaia Castellan, Business Compliance Senior Consultant e Luca Boldrin, Product Evolution Senior Consultant di InfoCert.</p>



 “Identità Digitale, opportunità per le imprese, collocazione europea, casi d’uso, rischi operativi ed evoluzioni” 



<p>Le Identità Digitali stanno creando un paradigma in cui servizi online e transazioni elettroniche possono sfruttare nuove forme di identificazione digitale per gestire in modo più rapido, efficace e remotizzato quei processi in cui il riconoscimento è obbligatorio. In questo evento cercheremo di dare una panoramica il più possibile completa su: opportunità per le imprese, collocazione europea, casi d’uso, rischi operativi ed evoluzioni in fase di studio.</p>



<p>Marta Gaia Castellan farà un intervento che avrà come focus “Il rischio del furto di identità digitale e le attività antifrode degli Identity Provider SPID”.&nbsp;Luca Boldrin invece, affronterà il tema “Self Sovereign Identity: un nuovo modello di identità decentralizzata”.</p>



<p>Chairwoman dell’evento sarà Claudia Sandei, dottore di ricerca, avvocato e professore associato di Diritto Industriale e delle Nuove Tecnologie dell’Università di Padova, Fondatrice di Itll.it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Le conoscenze e le competenze di RAO (Registration Authority Office), Incaricati al Riconoscimento e di tutti i soggetti coinvolti nell’attività di Identity Provider SPID sono varie e complesse: diplomatica del documento di identità (tecniche di stampa, microscritte, rilievi tattili, timbri), controlli antifrode, utilizzo incrociato di banche dati ministeriali, elementi di social engineering. L’obiettivo fondamentale è proteggersi dal rischio di furto di identità durante la fase di rilascio, e in particolar modo dall’utilizzo di documenti di identità falsi, rubati, contraffatti, attraverso precisi processi di identity proofing e di vetting.</p>Marta Gaia Castellan – Business Compliance, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCert</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>In parallelo all’evoluzione del quadro normativo per un’identità digitale europea, negli ultimi anni sta acquisendo importanza un nuovo modello per la gestione dell’identità digitale, noto come Self Sovereign Identity” (SSI). La principale differenza rispetto ai più diffusi modelli di identificazione e autenticazione sta nel fatto che non richiede la presenza di trusted parties per l’autenticazione: in questo senso si usa spesso lo slogan “you are your own identity provider”. Anche se spesso viene associato a distributed ledger e a nuovi standard (formati, protocolli), SSI è in realtà un paradigma che può essere implementato su diverse tecnologie e in diversi flavour. Questa presentazione fornirà una panoramica del mondo SSI e di alcune importanti iniziative a livello globale ed europeo.</p>Luca Boldrin – Innovation Portfolio, Innovation &amp; Strategy InfoCer</blockquote>

A step towards portable identity for the&nbsp;EU EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, Photo: Radikale&nbsp;Venstre<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">FT</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The EU is set to unveil detailed plans for a bloc-wide digital wallet on Wednesday following requests from member states to find a safe way for citizens to access public and private services&nbsp;online.</blockquote><blockquote>The digital wallet would securely store payment details and passwords and allow citizens from all 27 countries to log into local government websites or pay utility bills using a single recognised identity, said people with direct knowledge of the&nbsp;plans.</blockquote><blockquote>The EU-wide app, which can be accessed via fingerprint or retina scanning among other methods, will also serve as a vault where users can store official documents such as a driver’s licence. Using the wallet was not compulsory, those involved said, but citizens who chose to sign up would benefit from an extra-secure digital ecosystem and greater flexibility ideal for post-pandemic life.</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1399839260971356165">here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>A step in the right direction towards a more portable form of identity — well, at least for Europeans.</blockquote><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-travel-73f90d18909c595da463994e16e17348">The AP on the portable&nbsp;aspects</a>:</p><blockquote>All EU residents would be entitled to an e-wallet, but they won’t be mandatory, according to the EU Commission.</blockquote><blockquote>But dominant online platforms would be required to accept the wallet, a provision that aligns with the commission’s goal of reining in big tech companies and their control of personal&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>Vestager said people would be able to use their EU digital wallets to access Google or Facebook instead of their “platform-specific” accounts.</blockquote><blockquote>“Because of that, you can decide how much data you want to share — only enough to identify yourself,” the commissioner said from Brussels during a virtual media briefing.</blockquote><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0080a5ed-4717-4ba3-9415-111b6fc82dcf">EU set to unveil digital wallet fit for post-Covid life</a>  <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-travel-73f90d18909c595da463994e16e17348">EU plans digital ID wallet for bloc’s post-pandemic life</a>  <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en?mc_cid=7b73084a87&amp;mc_eid=cd5d02dae9">EU Digital COVID Certificate</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/anej">/anej </a>— <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/01/apple-pay-competitors-could-include-a-european-union-digital-wallet/">Apple Pay competitors could include an EU digital wallet — 9to5Mac</a>   2. Meanwhile in Big Tech land, your data still isn’t your&nbsp;data <p>Here’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">TechCrunch</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — who noted: “This is going in the wrong direction.”):</p><blockquote>A change to TikTok’s U.S. privacy policy on Wednesday introduced a new section that says the social video app “may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from its users’ content. This includes things like “faceprints and voiceprints,” the policy explained. Reached for comment, TikTok could not confirm what product developments necessitated the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about the information it automatically collects from users, but said it would ask for consent in the case such data collection practices began.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a> — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">TikTok just gave itself permission to collect biometric data on US users, including ‘faceprints and voiceprints’ — TechCrunch</a>   3. Tweet of the&nbsp;week <p>New York governor <a href="https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1399863589045952518">Andrew&nbsp;Cuomo</a>:</p> 4. A landmark Supreme Court decision over data&nbsp;access <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security">the EFF</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>The Supreme Court rightly overturned the Eleventh Circuit, and held that exceeding authorized access under the CFAA does not encompass “violations of circumstance-based access restrictions on employers’ computers.” Rather, the statute’s prohibition is limited to someone who “accesses a computer with authorization but then obtains information located in particular areas of the computer — such as files, folders, or databases — that are off limits to him.” The Court adopted a “gates-up-or-down” approach: either you are entitled to access the information or you are not. If you need to break through a digital gate to get in, entry is a crime, but if you are allowed through an open gateway, it’s not a crime to be&nbsp;inside.</blockquote><blockquote>This means that private parties’ terms of service limitations on how you can use information, or for what purposes you can access it, are not criminally enforced by the CFAA. For example, if you can look at housing ads as a user, it is not a hacking crime to pull them for your bias-in-housing research project, even if the TOS forbids it. Van Buren is really good news for port scanning, for example: so long as the computer is open to the public, you don’t have to worry about the conditions for use to scan the&nbsp;port.</blockquote><p>And here’s Greg&nbsp;Kidd:</p><blockquote>If one accesses a public website or a private website with user permission, it should NEVER be a felony crime to do so. While it is certainly possible to have penalties that publish misuse of public or private information, it is crazy to have a reading of a statute that can be used to penalize mere access to public data or a user’s delegated access to their own&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>Public access to public data is a public good. And private access to one’s own data is a right not a privilege. Neither Linkedin/Microsoft nor Microsoft should be able to intimidate startup developers for innovating around these principles on behalf of users. We look forward to building on our past victories in this realm with additional ammo from the Supreme Court that included support from elements in both the liberal and conservative branches.</blockquote><p>You can <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/19-783_k53l.pdf">check out the Supreme Court decision here</a>&nbsp;(pdf).</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/van-buren-victory-against-overbroad-interpretations-cfaa-protects-security">Van Buren is a Victory Against Overbroad Interpretations of the CFAA, and Protects Security Researchers</a>   5. On the topic of data rights and Big Tech bullying — New York to “revolutionize” antitrust <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/03/business/dealbook/amc-meme-stocks.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>The act’s passage would put New York at the “vanguard” of a national movement, 15 state and national labor and policy groups wrote in a letter to legislators that DealBook is first to report. The organizations argue that the law would “rein in many abusive tactics corporations use against other firms and workers that are difficult to challenge under current antitrust law and precedent.”</blockquote><blockquote>Market dominance would be presumed with 40 percent market share. Currently, companies qualify as dominant if they have 70 to 90 percent of a market. “It’s not illegal to be dominant,” said Pat Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project, one of the groups that signed the letter. “It’s just illegal to block others from the market unfairly.” In the act, an “abuse of dominance” standard would replace the current “consumer welfare” standard.</blockquote><blockquote>“Where New York goes, often the rest of the country follows,” Garofalo said, and lawmakers at the federal level could be motivated “if they see the ship is leaving&nbsp;port.”</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/new-york-state-to-revolutionize-antitrust">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>What would this bill do? It would change standards for how a firm is considered to be too powerful. While changing standards seems technical and wonky, such a change would in fact be a revolutionary act to break the power that dominant firms have over our economy. (I testified on behalf of the bill last year, and my organization has written an explainer of the legislation.)</blockquote><blockquote>Right now, to be considered subject to monopolization law, a firm has to have 70–90% of a market, plus it has to engage in egregious behavior that economists measure as inefficient. This bill would blow up that entire framework. First, a firm would only have to have 40% of a market to be considered dominant. Plus, firms that are powerful enough to set wages across an industry, ahem Amazon, would also be considered dominant. It wouldn’t be illegal to be dominant, but under this legislative framework, dominant firms would no longer be allowed to engage in predatory conduct or block competitors from the&nbsp;market.</blockquote><blockquote>The legislation would also expand what would be considered anti-competitive behavior. A bunch of stuff that is now dead-letter law, like predatory pricing or selling below cost to capture market share, could come back. The bill would also let private actors sue under these new standards, so it would allow newspapers, grocery stores, pharmacists, manufacturer and employees to sue if they are being abused by a powerful buyer, seller, and/or distributor.</blockquote><p>Meanwhile, on the Federal side of things.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-f64b55d3-ae02-40c9-ad4c-07352527058d.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Divisions within party caucuses, particularly Republicans, are emerging as a new threat to Congressional action against alleged monopolistic behavior by tech giants, Axios’ Ashley Gold and Margaret Harding McGill&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s a blow to the longstanding theory that a bitterly divided Congress could still agree to tighten the antitrust screws on Big Tech, since both sides have beefs with the industry.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/d71eae">Briefing: Facebook Will Face UK and European Antitrust Probes Into Data&nbsp;Use</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/eu-uk-antitrust-investigations-facebook-classified-5ab1e7e6-b18f-4f3b-b6ca-e737ec828af6.html">EU, U.K. launch antitrust investigations into&nbsp;Facebook</a>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/new-york-state-to-revolutionize-antitrust">New York State to Revolutionize Antitrust</a>   6. At Bitcoin Miami 2021 — it was all about community <p>GlobaliD senior product manager <a href="https://twitter.com/pstav90/status/1401789767063269376">Paul Stavropoulos</a>:</p><blockquote>My biggest takeaway from Bitcoin2021 in Miami — we’re just scratching the surface on how tokens + NFTs will be used together to facilitate community.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mariashen/status/1401505500567638020?s=21">Maria Shen</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/markonovak">/markonovak</a>):</p><blockquote>I saw crypto being used in the coolest ways in Miami this week &amp; none of them had to do with payments.</blockquote><blockquote>All of them had to do with building strong communities.</blockquote><p>Maria should check out GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups!</p><p>And here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-community-bitcoin-miami">Michael Casey</a> on “money=community”:</p><blockquote>Our $DESK experience was a reminder that money has always been about community. There’s a feedback loop between people’s desire to own and use a currency and the way in which it intermediates human interaction. Regardless of how functionally advanced your currency is as a technology, this community function is a major determinant of its&nbsp;value.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Let’s face it, technologically, the dollar is outdated. The inefficient U.S. banking and payments system still uses paper checks, for crying out loud. It integrates none of the cutting-edge monetary policy and governance features that comes with cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance. Yet, it rules the world thanks largely to the self-reinforcing power of a “dollar community.”</blockquote><blockquote>Now, for the first time, that community is looking a little less united. As concerns rise about the political and economic sustainability of a dollar-centric global financial system, and as technologies spanning crypto, data services, trading and social media foster new approaches to payments and other financial services, people are exploring alternatives. It’s why everything around money suddenly seems unmoored, as a baffling array of new finance acronyms and memes leaves many in the mainstream confused: NFTs, SPACs, stonks,&nbsp;DeFi.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-community-bitcoin-miami">Michael Casey: Miami, Piranhas and the Power of Community — CoinDesk</a>   7.

 African Cities — Disrupting the Urban&nbsp;Future Harare, Zimbabwe<p>The future of humanity is urban. Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent in the world with an expected 1.2 billion urban residents by 2050.<a href="https://issafrica.s3.amazonaws.com/site/uploads/af2"> The continent’s urbanisation comes with extraordinary transformative potential, but the structural hurdles are equally huge.</a> Historically, there is<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/magazine/19Urban_West-t.html"> compelling evidence</a> to suggest that urbanisation and economic growth are mutually reinforcing. Yet in Africa, urbanisation is happening in a context of slow structural transformation, pervasive urban poverty and inequalities that compromise a hopeful urban&nbsp;future.</p><p>Building on last year’s Istanbul Innovation Days, the 2019 Harare Innovation Days on #NextGenCities will focus on the strategic risks and opportunities inherent in Africa’s rapid urbanisation. It will invite senior civil servants responsible for cities and bring them together with cutting-edge practitioners working on urban solutions from digitally-enabled distributed infrastructure provision to nature-based solutions, and from participatory city-making to sustainable food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Harare Innovation Days is twinned with an Asia-Pacific focussed Innovation Days in March 2020 event on #NextGenGov. Following both events we aim to open up new pathways for targeted support for collaborative experimentation and learning trajectories within governments starting in the Asia-Pacific, Africa and Arab States&nbsp;region.</p> #AfricaIsNow <p>The numbers may be familiar but are staggering nonetheless. According to the World Bank, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2016/01/21/urban-resilience-challenges-and-opportunities-for-african-cities">the continent’s urban population is projected to reach 1.2 billion by 2050. </a>Currently, the continent has three megacities: Cairo (10 million), Kinshasa (12 million) and Lagos (21 million). But this is just the start: if Nigeria’s population continues to grow and people move to cities at the current rate, Lagos could become the world’s largest metropolis, home to up to 85 or even <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247816663557">100 million</a> people by 2100 — more people than California or Britain today. And Lagos is not alone — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/19/urban-explosion-kinshasa-el-alto-growth-mexico-city-bangalore-lagos">according to some scenarios</a>, Kinshasa may have 83.5 million inhabitants at that point; Niamey, currently home to fewer than a million people, may have 46 million; and Kigali could grow from 1 to 5 million residents already by 2050. And it’s not just over the next 30 years, with all of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/10/africa-cities-organisational-structure-cairo-institutions">world’s 10 fastest growing cities are going to be in Africa over the next 16 years.</a> In this context, it’s crucial to remember that over 60% of the land projected to become urban by 2030 is <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/sites/default/files/Brochure%20for%20Urban%20Resilience%20flagship%20report.pdf">yet to be developed</a>.</p><p>The accelerated growth, not just of Africa’s megacities but also its medium sized growth hubs and even <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2019/04/how-bidibidi-uganda-refugee-camp-became-city/">previously rural areas</a>, poses extraordinary challenges for national governments and municipalities. But behind the evident everyday challenges of Africa’s rapid urbanisation — <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/knowledge/publications/african-economic-outlook">unemployment</a> and informality; the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/africa-regional-studies/publication/african-cities-opening-doors-to-the-world">infrastructure gap</a>; structurally underfunded municipalities; huge <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1229079/ghana-the-worlds-fastest-growing-economy-has-a-trash-problem/">waste problems</a>; widespread issues with <a href="https://landportal.org/book/dataset/afrb-surv">land</a> registry and corruption — we see a range of more long-term, interdependent strategic risks: whether <a href="https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/maplecroft-in-the-media/fast-growing-african-cities-at-extreme-risk-from-climate-change-analysts/">climate change</a> and the impact of <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/air-pollution-africas-invisible-silent-killer-1">air pollution</a> on the health of urban dwellers; <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/economic-growth-sub-saharan-africa-challenges-risks/">uncertain economic development</a> and rising inequality; the lack of l<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04685-1">ocally rooted evidence</a> and its impact on planning and governance; the unintended consequences of disruptive technology; food insecurity and the risks of <a href="https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511?platform=hootsuite">nutrient decline</a>; or the impact of rapid development on the natural ecosystems cities rely on. They all call into question the current pathways to greater prosperity and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>On the other hand, it also provides a massive opportunity. Frequently celebrated under the banner #AfricaIsNow, we are seeing incredible dynamism, creativity and innovation across the continent, spearheaded by industry, forward-looking governments and creative, tech-savvy entrepreneurs and enabled by new technologies and new platforms enabling cross-sectoral collaborations.</p> NextGenUNDP <p>By building on such disruptive and pioneering ways of working from across the continent, the Innovation Days seeks to unlock an urban future that addresses the current challenges and strategic risks of our time — a future that is uniquely African, rooted in the diverse identities of Africa’s peoples and places, and the continent’s ability to combine global innovations with local solutions. Through the Harare Innovation Days and ongoing support, UNDP aims to accelerate this African future by supporting next generation strategic experimentation.</p><p>The 2018 <a href="https://apolitical.co/solution_article/how-to-make-governance-fit-for-the-future-7-lessons-from-innovators/">Istanbul Innovation Days</a> on <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-d5dc78e53b1c">NextGenGov</a> already showed how disruptive technologies are shifting the ability of cities to serve their populations, from the blockchain-enabled real-time pollution monitoring system pioneered by<a href="https://www.commonsimpact.org/"> Commons Impact</a>, to<a href="http://metasub.org/"> MetaSUB’s</a> use of advanced microbiome data to enable predictive approaches like early warnings on looming epidemics or emerging signs of microbial antibiotic resistance. Equally, it recognised that new spaces are needed for citizens and communities to access and make sense of such digital opportunities — showcasing institutions like<a href="https://www.medialab-prado.es/"> Madrid’s Medialab Prado</a> that enable such engagement and which develop participative tools like <a href="https://consulproject.org/en/">Consul</a>, a software now being adapted and adopted across the world including in the rebuilding of Mogadishu.</p><p>Recognising African cities are a key entry point to address the interconnected issues of uncertain economic growth, climate breakdown, social disruption and governance shortfalls; in Harare, we will explore how a series of cutting edge innovations already being pioneered in Africa could further develop cities’ capacity for sustainable and resilient growth. In an uncertain urban future it is essential we co-build the institutional capacity to explore and lead towards opportunities that are genuinely relevant to Africa without trying to replicate western models and mistakes. To do this, UNDP is reaching out to senior level civil servants across some of Africa’s fast-changing cities — the key risk holders in the decades ahead. The aim of the Harare Innovation Days is to be a springboard to supporting them with hands on policy experiments in urban governance, development and infrastructure provision, with UNDP providing the required infrastructure to help these key decision-makers develop experiments that will help address their strategic risks. By convening them alongside some of Africa’s leading innovators and disruptors in the technology, urban planning and policy space, we aim to build a platform and peer to peer network for accelerated learning and implementation capacity for urban innovation.</p> Zones of Experiment <p>We propose four initial focal themes below. Of course they are not all-encompassing, but they are indicative of the complexities and possibilities of urban change in Africa. They go across a series of cross cutting themes — new pathways to creating <a href="https://www.ilo.org/africa/media-centre/pr/WCMS_444474/lang--en/index.htm">secure livelihoods</a> and meaningful jobs in an often informal and <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/africa-future-of-work">changing economic context</a>; accelerating the shift to environmental sustainability and ecological regeneration; using the best of cutting edge technologies (AI, IoT and real-time satellite data) to provide us with <a href="https://www.geospatialworld.net/blogs/digital-earth-africa-satellite-dat/">new governance capabilities</a>; and securing pathways to inclusion across highly diverse populations. These are indispensable elements for the achievement of the&nbsp;SDGs.</p> Participatory city-making <p>The future of urban development in Africa cannot solely rely on state actors or large-scale corporate investment; to be resilient and legitimate, it needs to tap into the creativity, passion and drive of local communities and embedded entrepreneurs to co-create urban spaces and re-imagine how they are used. This is crucial in order to build on the unique identity of cities and the creativity of young people as a source of strength and dynamism — to engender new cultures of participation that cut across ‘online’ and ‘offline’, and in turn to enhance sense of belonging (especially in a case of unprecedented migration from rural areas). For example: the <a href="https://www.blockbyblock.org/">Block by Block</a> project uses Minecraft (a game) to give citizens an opportunity to design and re-create local public spaces; <a href="https://www.sei.org/projects-and-tools/projects/i-cmiist/">i-CMiiST</a> in Nairobi and Kampala are using creative methods to explore more sustainable mobility and RanLab’s <a href="https://www.ranlab.org/deliberative-polling-in-uganda-on-resilience-issues-in-the-mt-elgon-region">deliberative polling experiments</a> across Africa show that offline settings for participation can enable better implementation of difficult policy decisions like the relocation of communities due to flooding.</p><p>This is being supported by a range of diagnostic tools, from Arup’s City Resilience Framework to <a href="http://capacitybuildingunhabitat.org/wp-content/uploads/workshops/2017-foundational-training-course-climate-compatible-sustainable-and-resilient-cities/Day%203_%20Urban%20Resilience/Module%204%20-%20Urban%20Resilience/Engagement%20Steps%20.pdf">UN-Habitat’s City City Resilience Profiling Programme (CRPP)</a>, and newfound collaborative energy. The latter converges around innovation hubs which put African talents and innovation at the forefront of a movement that will shape their urban future. These hubs from — <a href="https://ihub.co.ke/">iHub</a> in Nairobi to the<a href="https://cchubnigeria.com/"> Co-creation Hub</a> in Lusaka — serve as data-driven catalysts and tech incubators for young creative talents to experiment with unlikely ideas that address gaps in service delivery in their local communities and beyond. Equally, networks of young civic innovators like <a href="https://i4policy.org/">i4policy</a> foster a collaborative dialogue amongst policy makers, technologists and local communities, in order to create policy frameworks conducive to bottom-up innovation. Such networked movements show how people are already finding ways for their voices to be heard, shaping fertile ground for creative problem solving as well as the leapfrog innovation the continent needs.</p><p>How can we build on such dynamics to re-invent urban governance fit for the 21st century, rather than merely tweaking the structures we&nbsp;have?</p><p>Distributed, hybrid infrastructure (and service) delivery:</p><p>While many African cities struggle after decades of underinvestment, they also have the opportunity to learn from the past mistakes in creating centralised large scale public works. Huge increases in the demand for electricity mean there are now more than 100 million urban Africans<a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/living-under-the-grid-110-million-of-africas-unconnected-customers-represen#gs.l4g9ee"> who live right under a grid, but lack an electricity connection</a>, with massive impacts on productivity — but various alternatives are being tested to make systems more affordable, faster to deploy and less fragile both physically and organisationally.</p><p>In response to this, we are seeing a growing series of infrastructure experiments that utilize decentralized approaches, leading to more resilient urban infrastructures that help to stimulate local economic development. These dynamics can be found across mobility infrastructure — with <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2016/10/mobilized-construction-pilots-new-way-of-fixing-africas-roads/">Mobilized Construction</a> piloting a digitally enabled approach to sensing needs for road repair and creating micro-contracts that can be procured locally, often at a fraction of the cost — and housing — with <a href="https://www.ibuild.global/">ibuild</a> creating a digital ecosystem that provides the transparency and accountability for both governments to procure locally and people to incrementally build shelters/housing based on their socio-economic state — as well as sanitation and waste management with start-ups such as <a href="http://wecyclers.com/">Wecyclers</a> which work with low-income households using an incentive-based model to tackle Lagos’ widespread waste problems. This also provides much-needed opportunities for the <a href="https://www.energy-generation.org/about-us">creation of innovative enterprises</a>, e.g. in renewables, that strengthen local economies by generating income. Enabling many of these is the rise of technological innovations, from smart-contracts to digital cash — ranging from the well known large-scale success stories such as Ecocash to local initiatives such as<a href="https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/about"> Grassroots economics</a>, which issue digital complementary currencies to foster local&nbsp;growth.</p><p>How can cities embrace such distributed approaches in their policies and strategies to build the infrastructures for the 21st Century at the scale, speed and inclusion necessary?</p><p>Food as a lense for circular economies</p><p>Cities have a unique opportunity — and need — to spark a transformation towards a circular economy for food, <a href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/publications/cities-and-circular-economy-for-food">given that 80% of all food will be consumed in cities by 2050</a>. In many African cities, urban agriculture already plays an important role in poverty reduction, food security, flood protection and (as biogas) energy generation. However a combination of population growth, development pressures and cultural change is threatening this provision model. On top of production, the arrival of industrial food processing and distribution (such as supermarkets) has in many cases gone hand in hand with a rise in low-nutrient food types, replacing traditional foods with nutritionally inferior food; extractive economic models and the rise of open food systems that create externalities — leading to reductions in economic, social and environmental sustainability.</p><p>In response, several entrepreneurial experiments are combining new technologies with traditional products to recover wealth from waste products — such as<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-45978942"> </a><a href="https://singularityusouthafricasummit.org/2019-summit-speaker/murendeni-mafumo/">Kusini Wate</a>r which uses Macadamia nut shells in mobile solar powered water treatment — as well as using the mobile revolution to develop more transparent, equitable value chains such as<a href="https://twiga.ke/"> Twiga foods</a> in Nigeria and <a href="https://freshinabox.co.zw/#/">Fresh in a box</a> in Zimbabwe. Taking this to city-wide systems change scale, Lusaka’s<a href="https://foodchangelab.org/food-change-labs-in-lusaka-province-zambia/"> Food Change Lab</a> is starting to work with local stakeholders to create a new urban policy approach to the food system and Antananarivo have set up a <a href="https://www.ruaf.org/antananarivo-food-policy-council-policy-practice">Food Policy&nbsp;Council</a>.</p><p>How can new technological capabilities harness the potential inherent in such locally-rooted pathways to better food, jobs, and&nbsp;health?</p><p>Nature-based solutions</p><p>Urban growth is damaging vital ecosystems globally, with land use change a key issue alongside pollution, waste and carbon emissions. African cities are starting to recognise the importance of integrating climate change information into long term planning and design for critical (and green) water related infrastructure which also drive economic development and inclusion. As our built world is made up of complicated, open-loop systems that subsume and deplete the substrate of our complex environment — it is imperative that we create city systems that don’t depend on depletion and accumulation dynamics.</p><p>City-wide innovations focused on strategic infrastructure include multiple examples of innovative financing such as the<a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/africa/stories-in-africa/nairobi-water-fund/"> Upper Tana River Water Fund</a>, which uses payments from downstream water users to provide education and support for over 20,000 farmers in methods that increase yields while reducing the maintenance costs for Nairobi’s water infrastructure. Other innovations include disruptive technologies, such as the use of real-time sensors to create<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/kala_fleming_easing_water_scarcity_by_understanding_when_and_where_it_flows"> Digital Aquifers</a> in Kenya; community based solutions such as <a href="http://ecolooafrica.com">EcoLoos</a> which provide a sustainable waterless sanitation solution while creating fertilisers, and <a href="https://massdesigngroup.org/">Mass Design</a> which uses exclusively local, responsibly sourced materials, with community members trained and employed throughout the construction process.</p><p>Given cities’ vulnerability to the effects of climate change, how can we build the strategies, regulations and investment pathways to ensure that nature-based solutions become the norm instead of the exception?</p> NextGen UNDP: An antifragile organization <p>These innovations hint at alternative futures, ones where innovation has been nurtured in our policy-making and regulatory capacities and our agile, multi-level governance models are more fit for purpose. In this context of high complexity and accelerated change, our ambition as UNDP is to transform into an antifragile organization, borrowing from Nassim Taleb, that adapts to change and converts strategic risk into strategic opportunity. We understand that the key to antifragility is the ability to fail in small doses and to use external stressors, like the significant strategic risks that cities face, to ‘gain from disorder’ over time and arrive at better outcomes. Our collective ability to deal with such risks and shocks, and to rapidly learn and re-configure our strategies, technology, people and interventions, (in short: our transformational capability) will enable our partner governments and their partners to show how #AfricaIsNow isn’t just true for the continent’s booming creative industries but also its unique urban&nbsp;future.</p>

 Blockchain Layer Enhancement 
<p>We have fully tested the integration with all of our solutions on Polygon, and our customers can now choose to deploy their security tokens on Polygon or Ethereum.</p>

		 
	 
                               <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in June 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>This month we’ll take a look at our recent integration with&nbsp;<a href="https://polygon.technology/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GeROieC2104YV1g-15YG54LvxpTPUngYOeS9eIiuZaINXDRGm-SLLuYKrcN2JMUcEKn8p">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>Polygon (previously known as “Matic Network”) is growing rapidly, and has recently overtaken the likes of Stellar, Binance Smart Chain, Solana and Tezos in terms of its market capitalization. In the last months Polygon made some serious strides with some blue chip DeFi protocols migrating, including Aave, Curve finance, and 0x.</p>
<p>But what does our integration with Polygon mean for our security token customers?</p>
<p>Over the last 6 months, we have seen gas fees skyrocketing as a result of network congestion and ETH price increase with an all-time-high reached last month. Transaction processing times have also been varying a lot depending on the network load. The congestion and issues related to fees should get resolved through the gradual implementations of various deliveries of Ethereum 2.0 in the course of this year and next. However, for our customers and for ourselves having live activity on the network, these congestion issues have become a handicap over the last few months.</p>
<p>Foreseeing that this will continue to be a problem for our customers, we benchmarked several so-called Layer 2 solutions and sidechains as well as some separate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based blockchains and we selected Polygon as the best alternative solution for deploying our products (ONCHAINIDs, the T-REX protocol and the T-REX platform) on Ethereum Public for the time being.</p>
<p>We have fully tested the integration with all of our solutions on Polygon to make sure that the deployment of new security tokens or the migration of existing ones will be as seamless as possible for our customers and their investors. The first T-REX security token has already been deployed successfully on Polygon in May on behalf of one of our customers.</p>
<p>Our customers will benefit from Polygon being:</p>
<p>Secure&nbsp;– the network is secured by a proof of stake consensus and by the Ethereum network;</p>
<p>Performant&nbsp;– transactions are executed in seconds for fees that are usually under 1 cent, making transaction fees virtually irrelevant (we have seen a fees reduction by a factor of 1/10000 compared to what they have been over the last few months on Ethereum Public);</p>
<p>Easy to use&nbsp;– users can still use their Ethereum-based wallets, such as a Metamask or custodial wallets like the ones connected to ONCHAINID;</p>
<p>Additionally, the consensus mechanisms used on Polygon are far-less energy-consuming and as a result more environment-friendly. The Polygon team has an aggressive roadmap to implement interconnection with other blockchains and support interoperability. It has also proved over the last months that it is delivering the products planned as per its roadmap with the introduction of full stack scaling last week (26/05/2021).</p>
<p>Obviously, we remain fully compatible and supportive of the Ethereum Public network, and our customers will be offered the choice between deploying their security tokens on one or the other network. Existing customers will also be offered the possibility to migrate existing tokens from one to the other. Finally, this integration makes us confident that our products and services could be adapted to other EVM-compatible Layer 2 solutions, sidechains and blockchains going forward according to our customers needs.</p>

 Armin Bauer, Co-Founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow 
 
 
<p>Last week, the EU Commission published a draft for the so-called digital identity wallet “EUid”. According to it, within 12 months of the law coming into force, every EU state must provide its citizens with a digital wallet.</p>
<p>The draft for the “Digital Identity Wallet” states the following: Every citizen will be given access to a so-called digital wallet. They have to identify themselves once and the data will be stored for further use.</p>
<p>In addition to electronic signatures, documents such as birth and marriage certificates or driving licences are to be stored in the digital wallet in future. This goes hand in hand with numerous use cases – from digital administrative procedures such as address changes or tax returns to the use of health services. A possibility that would revolutionise our daily lives.</p>
<p>According to the draft, each country has three options for implementation: either it launches a solution for its citizens and businesses itself. Or it commissions a private company to develop the wallet and make it publicly available. The third option is a government-approved certification programme that allows private companies to certify applications for identification. The exact technical standards are currently still being discussed at EU level. Only after publication of these standards, the member states will be able to start implementing the respective solution. In doing so, they will have to pay attention to two aspects in particular: high security standards as well as a user experience that is as pleasant as possible. This is the only way to ensure that the solution is accepted by as many citizens as possible.</p>
<p>From our point of view, the introduction of the digital wallet is a necessary and right step to simplify the everyday life of citizens and to overcome digital identification borders within the EU. With the new regulation, it is possible to create an overarching infrastructure.</p>
<p>As one of the European market leaders in the field of digital identification, IDnow itself is working on its own technology for digital wallets. With the “IDnow Wallet”, users’ data is stored securely on the user’s smartphone in compliance with data protection laws. Fingerprint or facial recognition (Touch or Face ID) is used to release the data for identification. The user retains control over his or her own data at all times. Due to the zero-knowledge principle, it is not possible for IDnow as a provider to gain access to the user’s data. As a certified identification service by the Registration Authority according to §24 1 d) eIDAS and as one of the largest providers of eIDs, the online ID function, IDnow is ideally positioned to provide all citizens and companies with an identity within the framework of a digital identity wallet in the future.</p>

<p>The second edition of Tools for Thought Interchange took place on June 3rd – or June 4th if you were joining us from the other side of the international date line! And in fact, Iian Neill did just that from Australia, plus Frode Hegland calling from the other side of midnight in the UK, rounded out by Brian Rubinton in North America.</p> Fission: IPFS as global data commons <p>Boris kicked things off with why we at Fission care about the category of tools for thought, and offering the IPFS protocol as part of the answer to interchange: a global data commons. </p><a href="https://presentations.fission.app/toolsforthought/2021-06-03%20Tools%20for%20Thought%20Part%202.pdf">Slide deck PDF »</a><p>For those that aren't familiar with it, <a href="https://docs.ipld.io/">InterPlanetary Linked Data (IPLD)</a> is also worth digging into.</p><p>JeffG from Fission also briefly talked about an idea we're exploring: an open source browser extension to be used as a shared web clipper by any tool for thought, with content clipped and shared to IPFS for maximum re-use. If you're interested in #ProjectPachyderm, get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/midijeffg">JeffG @midijeffg</a>.</p><p>As always, <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by the Fission Discord chat to find out more »</a></p> Part 2 Presentations <p>Here are the presentations, notes, and video from Part 2. <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/tools-for-thought-interchange-part-1/">Part 1 is also available on the blog here.</a></p> Iian Neil, Codex Editor &amp; Standoff Editing <p><a href="https://twitter.com/codexeditor">Iian Neill</a> talked about Codex Editor and the concepts around it:</p><blockquote><p>"We need a file system for thought" <a href="https://twitter.com/codexeditor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@codexeditor</a> <br><br>Multiple apps, semantic artifacts that can be shared across each other. Something "like" an operating OS, or at least the desktop OS metaphor for knowledge workers.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToolsForThought?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ToolsForThought</a> <a href="https://t.co/h3Q3hRUdmm">pic.twitter.com/h3Q3hRUdmm</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400628265975386112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>The follow up here with Iian and what he has built with Codex was meant as a compliment to Blaine's talk on atJSON: the concept of Standoff Editing, where annotations don't just exist as inline markup, but in fact are meant to be multi player – including with past / future versions of yourself.</p><p>"Liberate the user from the tyranny of embedded markup" was a particularly strong phrase!</p>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sHt8j3UwYqNOnRCBFLqZjNBxwkdAlmyKisrjKXjWRxI/edit?usp=sharing">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://github.com/argimenes/standoff-properties-editor">Standoff Properties Editor on Github</a>  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/codexeditor">Main page for Codex Editor on Patreon</a>  <p>As well as his on camera presentation, Iian also prepared an extended demo to YouTube:</p> Frode Hegland, Visual Meta <p><a href="https://twitter.com/liquidizer">Frode Hegland</a> took us all the way back to the <a href="https://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/">original Tools for Thought: Howard Rheingold's book by that name</a>.</p><p><a href="http://visual-meta.info/">Visual Meta</a> is what Frode demo'd for us, "BibTeX and a little JSON": a way to put metadata directly into documents, that is both human readable and machine readable.</p><p>Frode made an amazing case for PDF as the 1000 year format:</p><blockquote><p>"I expect PDF to be around in 1000 years"<br><br>"I don't want my son to grow up with PDFs that are basically JPEGs"<br><br>Visual Meta is meant to add more info to PDFs. <a href="https://t.co/JO2DGEf5kl">pic.twitter.com/JO2DGEf5kl</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400640639390208017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>His sentiment about building for his son called back to our presentation with <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/overview-of-logseq-by-tienson-qin/">Tienson, creator of Logseq, who also mentioned building for his daughter</a>. </p><p>Frode invites everyone to join the Future of Text community, as well as to submit work for inclusion in the forthcoming second volume.</p>  <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeialfrkxg5ip7npzp6xyzqzif3zka64zk62ovtrj5w6eulhikmak6u/Hegland%20VM%20Presentation%20T4T.pdf">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://www.augmentedtext.info/">Augmented Text Company</a>, supporting Visual Meta in Author &amp; Reader, both apps available for macOS  <a href="https://future-of-text.circle.so/c/welcome">Future of Text Community on Circle »</a>  <a href="https://futuretextpublishing.com/future-of-text-2020-download/">Future of Text Volume I</a>   Brian Rubinton, Kanopi &amp; RDF for interchange <p>Brian Rubinton joined us to talk about and demo <a href="https://kanopi.io/">Kanopi</a>, his fully RDF-based note taking tool.</p><blockquote><p>Crowded market, BUT "Almost everyone is still using digital paper. There is still a very long way to go"<a href="https://twitter.com/brianru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brianru</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ToolsForThoughts?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ToolsForThoughts</a> <a href="https://t.co/wStIFLQXWf">pic.twitter.com/wStIFLQXWf</a></p>— FISSION (@FISSIONcodes) <a href="https://twitter.com/FISSIONcodes/status/1400643189308989445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>This point about "digital paper" in the crowded market of note taking was in reference to limited "meaning" embedded in those notes (same as Frode's PDFs-as-JPEGs comment). Which perhaps was the theme that ended up emerging from all three presentations: more meaning.</p>  <a href="https://app.pitch.com/app/public/presentation/345a5721-0401-4c79-8009-f7a5fe2e07c8">Slides »</a>  <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUF4aFGjwN2GnO2bkf3cUdTQIRgSCwAkU">Demo playlist on Youtube</a>   Video <p>Even though we had one less presentation, we still ended up going for almost 2 hours.</p><p>We had many wonderful attendees keeping the chat active, including a number of European night owls. The chat log is once again checked into the <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/blob/main/2021-06-03-chat.txt">TFTInterchange repo</a>.</p> TFTInterchange Community <p>This two part series was organized by Boris and the Fission team. Tools for Thought are a recurring theme in our <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/tag/presentation/">presentations</a>, and we'd love to keep supporting Interchange with our Zoom webinar account and our time at the very least!</p><p>We'd like to get a more diverse group of people involved, and make this more of a community project, that bridges community discussion, open source code, and interoperable formats.</p><p>There seemed to be general interest in at least a monthly community event, so perhaps along with timezone differences, we'll see if we can stagger them and so still have a presentation every 2 weeks or so.</p><p>Next steps:</p>  Please share your thoughts and notes from Part 1 and Part2: #ToolsForThought on Twitter, add a link in the comments on this post  Who wants to help organize ongoing talks? <a href="https://twitter.com/shuyunzhang99">@shuyunzhang99</a> has already <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/4">volunteered in this thread on Github</a>. She's in Australia, which naturally may give us an organizing lead for that time zone.  What open source code and interchange can we work on together? Boris has proposed <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/3">ePub to atJSON</a> in the Github repo as a project, please add your own ideas.   <p>Fission invites presenters most Thursdays on a broad set of tech topics. <a href="https://lu.ma/fission">Sign up to get notified of future events »</a></p>

<p>This is the second of two blogs on our new White Paper: <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/AchievingTransformationatScaleMydexCIC-2021-04-14.pdf">Achieving Transform At Scale</a>. The <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/our-new-white-paper-achieving-transformation-at-scale-f97320f8447e">first blog</a> focused on the infrastructure challenge. This blog focuses on the parallel need for institutional innovation.</p><p>Sometimes, when a society confronts a new challenge, the institutions it previously relied on to provide solutions cannot cope. New, different institutions are needed. We think this is the case with personal data. Traditionally, our society has looked to two main types of institution to unleash social and economic opportunities: private sector firms focused on maximising their profits and state-owned enterprises. But as this blog explains, these types of institution cannot rise to the particular challenges posed by personal data. A different type of institution is needed, and thankfully we have one to hand: the Community Interest Company&nbsp;(CIC).</p><p>Many people are still not familiar with CICs, which often come across as a rather strange hybrid beast. CICs&nbsp;are:</p>  asset locked. This means any assets a CIC develops cannot be sold to another entity that is not also asset locked and equally committed to pursuing its community purpose. Mydex is not seeking a trade sale or ‘exit’: it is committed to continuing the operation and extension of its platform as permanent infrastructure to benefit its community (citizens).  dividend capped. Only 35% of distributable profits can be returned to shareholders. The remaining 65% must be reinvested in furthering the community benefits for which the CIC was established.  <p>Why has Mydex chosen this unfamiliar CIC&nbsp;status?</p> Mission logic <p>One simple explanation is that when Mydex was established back in 2007, its founders didn’t just want to sell a product in order to make money. They wanted to produce a service that brings benefits to people and communities and recognised they needed to make money in order to fund this service provision. Making money isn’t the purpose of the business. Benefiting the community by achieving its mission is the purpose, and making money is a means to achieving that&nbsp;goal.</p><p>A second reason is that we recognised that personal data throws up huge issues and challenges relating to trust. We reasoned as follows: If there is a lack of trust surrounding the collection and use of personal data, its full personal, social and economic potential will be hampered by mutual suspicion, power struggles and conflict and therefore never realised. A new type of institution that builds trustworthiness into what it does, and how, is needed for this challenge.</p><p>How CIC status helps us rise to this challenge is not immediately obvious but the logic is powerful. It’s worth exploring.</p> Economic logic <p>The unique and particular challenges (and opportunities) of personal data lie in the fact that unlike physical products and most services, data is a resource that can be used by many different people and organisations for many different purposes without ever getting ‘used up’. Because of this, it breaks the boundaries imposed by current notions of ‘private property’. Institutions organised around the notion of ownership of private property and profit maximisation are struggling to come to terms with a new world where value is created by data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>This takes us to the first unique challenge for Mydex: the question “What makes an enterprise economically viable and successful?”</p><p>It’s commonly assumed that the acid test of an enterprise’s economic success is how much money it makes. But that relates to its financial success, not its economic&nbsp;success.</p><p>If you stop to think about it, organisations’ economic results always lie outside their traditional legal and accounting boundaries — in the value their products or services generate in being used by other parties (while how much money they make is an internal measure). So, for example, the economic (and social) value of electricity isn’t measured by the money electricity suppliers happen to make. It lies in all the many uses our society uses electricity for.</p><p>This is true of all enterprises. The job of a car or phone maker is to provide people with cars or phones — that provide them with mobility and help them communicate: things they want to do in their lives. The job of a hospital is to treat the sick; the job of an orchestra to delight audiences with its music; the job of a local shop to make accessing the necessaries of life&nbsp;easy.</p><p>For most enterprises, this external economic impact is implicit. It’s not something they worry about too much, because they are focused on the internal measures that matter to them. But in the case of Mydex it needs to be made explicit, because the whole purpose of the organisation is the external value it helps to create: making data available to people (especially citizens) outside its traditional organisational boundaries, so that they can use this data for their own purposes. Adopting CIC status makes this external purpose explicit and focuses attention (of people both inside and outside the organisation) on this external&nbsp;purpose.</p> Financial logic <p>If it’s true that financial success is not the same as economic success, then how much money an organisation happens to make has got nothing to do with its external economic impact. If it’s a charity or public service, it could deliver huge economic benefits but not ‘make’ any money at all. If it’s a mafia syndicate, it could make huge amounts of money while its external economic impacts are 100% negative.</p><p>But to survive, an organisation needs to cover its costs, and how it does so&nbsp;matters.</p><p>If it’s a charity, it needs income from donations. If it’s a public service, it needs to be paid for by taxes. If it sells products or services, it needs customers willing to pay for them. If it needs external investment, it needs investors willing to&nbsp;invest.</p><p>Each of these approaches to funding has its advantages and disadvantages. At Mydex, we chose not to be a charity for two reasons. First, because with a focus like ours on personal data we feared that we would end up spending so much time and effort seeking benefactors and donations that this quest could end up diverting our attention away from actually delivering our mission. Second, this constant need to attract benefactors might place us under pressure to bend our mission to these benefactors’ whims.</p><p>Likewise, we don’t think an organisation with a mission like ours, relating to personal data, should rely directly on taxpayer funding for two reasons. First, there are immense risk and trust issues involved in the state having comprehensive citizen databases under its control. Second, taxpayer funded services often find themselves at the mercy of shifting political winds. That is why we chose to be a company that can cover its costs from what it sells: so that it isn’t dependent on external funders and remains free to make its own decisions. For us, this strategic independence is extremely important.</p><p>But does this mean we simply have to bend to the will of a different set of external parties, namely customers (e.g. the organisations who pay Mydex fees to connect to its platform) and investors?</p><p>It could, in theory. But we have designed our business model carefully to avoid this risk. We have designed our revenue streams so that we are financially incentivised to be a neutral enabler, not a ‘data monetiser’: we only sell connections to our platform to enable safe, easy, low cost data sharing; we don’t sell or rent any data itself. And the dividend cap for shareholders means the community always benefits from the lions’ share of any profits we happen to&nbsp;make.</p><p>Getting this balance right is crucial because of the extraordinary potential of the Mydex business model: the more it grows the more profitable it gets. Exponentially. As a platform business, Mydex’s core operating costs do not rise rapidly with volume use. But the more organisations that connect to this platform, the more revenues the platform generates. In other words, as Mydex grows its revenue streams grow much faster than its costs — which means that Mydex has the potential to become extremely profitable. By creating a legally-enforceable dividend cap that requires it to reinvest two thirds of any profits it makes in its community mission, CIC status ensures that Mydex’s external, economically beneficial community purpose always remains paramount.</p><p>(This has an important knock-on internal cultural impact. It means that in everything we do and how we do, we focus all our efforts on doing those things that will continually improve the external value we generate — our community contribution — on ‘making’ rather than ‘taking’. It creates a discipline and a yardstick for decision-making.)</p> Strategic logic <p>But this external value focus creates a potential problem. Why should investors bother investing in a company that only returns a third of the profits it makes to them when they could in theory get all the&nbsp;profits?</p><p>The simple answer to this question is that a third of a very large sum is much bigger than all of a tiny&nbsp;sum.</p><p>There is a paradox to this answer which goes to the heart of Mydex’s CIC status. It relates to the two separate elements: the ‘very large sum’ and the ‘tiny&nbsp;sum’.</p><p>Let’s start with the very large sum. With its data sharing infrastructure Mydex is creating the equivalent of a mass production assembly line for the entire data economy. Henry Ford’s assembly lines reduced the costs of making motor cars by over 90%. They made a transformational product affordable to ordinary people, unleashed a tidal wave of product innovation and transformed the way societies and economies worked. Mydex is doing the same with personal data: slashing the costs of accessing and using it, making its benefits available to ordinary people, unleashing innovation and transforming the way our society and economy uses our data in the process. The potential scale of this business is enormous and global. It could generate very large sums of&nbsp;money.</p><p>What about the tiny sum? A year or two ago, the UK Treasury published a paper on the Economic Value of Data. It contained a crucial insight. It noted that “innovative uses of data can generate powerful positive externalities (i.e. benefits) that may not always accrue to the data creator or controller. This can result in data being under-exploited or under-shared.”</p><p>In other words, the Treasury was accepting that private companies focused only on profit maximisation have no reason to pursue the transformational external economic benefits we have been talking about: they have no reason to build the data sharing infrastructure that Mydex is building.</p><p>This means that without a new type of institution that prioritises the external benefits identified by Treasury they won’t ever happen. If we stick with existing institutions with their existing priorities, the very large sum becomes a tiny sum. Forever. Investors who insist on having access to all the profits will get close to none instead. The opportunity will be stillborn.</p><p>This goes deep into Mydex’s role. The UK Treasury was highlighting a strategic collective action problem. It would greatly benefit all parties if investment was made into the infrastructure that makes the safe, efficient, privacy protecting sharing of personal data possible, so that all its uses and potential can be realised. But it’s not in the immediate interests (or role) of any current data controllers (e.g. organisations collecting and using personal data) to take on the cost, risk or responsibility of making this investment.</p><p>Somebody else needs to take on this role. But this somebody has to be different. They cannot be focused on grabbing all the benefits for themselves. They have to be focused on creating external community value. And these priorities need to be baked into how they work. That’s what CIC status does: bake these purposes into the organisation’s legal structure. As a CIC Mydex is legally required to share financial rewards equitably. And, as a CIC, we are legally required to keep to the above promises in perpetuity (unlike venture capitalist funded outfits that are incentivised to make all the promises in the world and to break these promises once they have achieved a profitable ‘exit’).</p><p>To put it simply, to break the Treasury’s collective action problem and to fully unleash personal data’s ‘positive powerful externalities’ we need a new type of institution that every stakeholder can trust. Only a new, neutral, independent, non-threatening, non-competing, trustworthy body can break the collective action logjam and Mydex’s CIC status formally confirms and signals to everyone concerned that this is its positive, permanent, enabling&nbsp;role.</p> The final piece of&nbsp;jigsaw <p>There is one more piece of this jigsaw that finally locks all the others into place. There are two main types of Community Interest Company: companies limited by guarantee and companies limited by&nbsp;shares.</p><p>Companies limited by guarantee are not-for-profit enterprises, while companies limited by shares can make a profit and distribute (some) dividends to shareholders. Mydex has chosen to be a company limited by shares.&nbsp;Why?</p><p>To some purists, CICs limited by shares are not ‘real’ community interest companies. The purists’ assumption is that if any shareholder stands to make any money out of investing in the company, then by definition they are extracting value from it and therefore exploiting the community that the company is supposed to be&nbsp;serving.</p><p>We don’t see it that way. Mydex is building nationwide infrastructure that will last for decades and building such infrastructure takes time (decades) and money. Which means it needs investment.</p><p>Most financial investors today adopt the role of cherry pickers. They search around for ripe fruit ready for the picking and invest in the cherry picking operation: big, quick, low-risk returns. Mydex is doing the opposite. We are planting and tending a cherry orchard from seedling to maturity — without which there will be no cherries to pick (the ‘positive externalities’ the Treasury was talking about). But this requires a different type of investor: one who ‘gets’ the mission and is prepared to be patient (because reaching the point where those increasing returns kick in will take many&nbsp;years).</p><p>Paying dividends (limited to one third of any profits made) to such investors is not exploitation of the community. It is paying for a service that makes a community benefit possible, just as paying staff to develop the software is not staff exploiting the community but making the community benefit possible. Once again, CIC status helps us to turn potential conflict into alignment to achieve a positive way&nbsp;forward.</p> Locust or&nbsp;bee? <p>Mydex’s mission — to empower every individual with their own data — is potentially global, long term and paradigm-changing: if successful it would put the modern data economy on a new and different footing.</p><p>In nature, we find many strategies for survival. There are predators and prey, parasites and hosts, foragers, scavengers, hunters. Locusts flourish by devouring the value other organisms have produced. Bees flourish by helping plants flourish — to flower and&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>Today’s personal data economy is dominated by locusts, intent on extracting as much profit as they can from individuals’ data. In choosing to be a Community Interest Company, Mydex brings together economic, financial and strategic logic to make it possible for the company to flourish as a bee, and therefore for the orchards to flourish and fruit too. We flourish by helping others to flourish. That, we believe, is why in the long term we will be successful. And that is why we are a Community Interest&nbsp;Company.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/can-i-trust-you-6771a6ca0e35">Can I trust you?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Session Management is a pretty scary term for a lot of developers.  Most of the mechanics of session management are abstracted away from developers, to the point where they don’t properly learn about it until it’s necessary.  Usually, this means a late night trying to figure out a vulnerability, a bug, or how to work with a new session management library.  Hopefully, I can remove some of the magic behind session management in NodeJs and give you a good fundamental place to start.  In this article, you will learn what sessions are, how to manage them in Node.js, and some details that should help you minimize bugs and vulnerabilities.</p>

 Overview of Sessions 

<p>I will start at the beginning.  When a user uses your web application, they make an HTTP request to the webserver.  The server then knows what to do with this request and returns a response.  The user’s request must contain all the necessary information for the server to make a decision.  For example, is the user authenticated?  Is he/she authorized to view a specific page?  Does the user have a shopping cart that needs to be displayed?  All this information that makes the user experience feel seamless, as though he/she is  using one continuous application, must be transmitted from the client to the server.  If the application were to transmit all this data back and forth on each request, you would introduce massive security and performance concerns.  There are many ways to streamline this effort, but for the sake of this article, I will focus on cookie-based sessions.</p>

<p>When a user sends a request to your web application, they will add a session cookie to the request headers.  If this is the first time a user has requested your site, the server will create a new session cookie and return it to the client.  The session is given an ID that both the client and server can reference.  This enables the application to split the session data between that which is stored on the client-side and that which is stored on the server.  For example, the cookie may tell the application the session ID and that the user is authenticated.  The server can use this information to access the user’s shopping cart in the server’s store.</p>

<p>Of course, any time an application sends information to the client it could possibly end up in an enemy’s hands.  The majority of your users aren’t necessarily bad actors, but bad actors are certainly looking for ways to exploit your application.  Most security concerns should be addressed by you, the developer and maintainer of the application and the developer of whatever session management library you’re using.</p>

 Session Management Risks 

<p>As an aside, I should note that it’s generally better to use a well-established session management library than to roll your own.  You will see a few examples of that later in this article.  For now, let’s take a look at some common session security concerns.</p>

 Session Prediction 

<p>Each session has an associated session ID with it.  It is very important that this session ID is properly randomized, such that an attacker cannot simply guess a few options and bypass any security associated with the session ID.  Suppose your session IDs were sequential integers.  An attacker could log in, create a new session, and see their session ID is <code>12345</code>.  The attacker could then try to pass the session ID <code>12344</code> or <code>12343</code> to the server in an attempt to hijack a session from another user.</p>

 Session Sniffing 

<p>In session sniffing, an attacker can use a sniffing application such as Wireshark or a proxy to capture network traffic between a client and server.  As you’ve learned, that traffic will ultimately contain a request with a session cookie in it.  This cookie will have the session ID which can then be hijacked.</p>

 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks 

<p>In a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker sits between the web server and the client.  The attacker can then pass requests from the client to the server and respond without detection from either.  But along the way, the attacker has gained access to the session.</p>

 Client Side Attacks 

<p>There are many strategies for attacking the client.  Some of the best known are Cross-Site Scripting, Trojans, and malicious javascript codes.  Sometimes it just takes some good old-fashioned social engineering to obtain session information from a client.  The idea here is that the attack will attempt to exploit the client itself to get access from the cookie in the browser’s storage.  For example, an attacker that can inject malicious Javascript code could inject the following javascript:</p>

   <code>alert(document.cookie);
</code>   

<p>With that simple line of code, the attack can now gain access to the cookie along with all the session goodies in it.</p>

 Good Session Management Practices 

<p>All of this is probably a little scary,  But many people are working on the other side to help prevent these attacks or minimize their impacts.  Most of these strategies are rolled into session management libraries, and any library that is continuously maintained should be up to date with the latest security enhancements.  But, it’s important for you, as a developer who takes security seriously, to understand what security should be in place.</p>

 Session Secret 

<p>Any good session management library should come with an option to change the <code>session secret</code>.  It may have slightly different names but the idea is always the same.  The secret is used to compute a hash against the session ID.  This helps to prevent session hijacking by ensuring the session cookie hasn’t been tampered with.</p>

 Session Expiration 

<p>Another good practice is to expire the session after some predetermined time.  There are two ways to expire a session: (1) based on inactivity or (2) absolutely.  When you base your expiration on inactivity, it will keep the session open until the user hasn’t made a request for some amount of time.  When you choose to expire it absolutely, then the session will expire after some predetermined time, regardless of activity.  The session will then need to be refreshed.  You should at least set an inactivity session expiration so you don’t have stale and vulnerable sessions available for attack.</p>

 Cookie Expiration 

<p>Similar to session expiration, you can also expire the cookie that was sent to the browser.  Many times, cookies are set to expire when the session expires.  However, it is possible to allow the cookie to remain available indefinitely.  This is a poor decision for the same reason as session expiration.  Generally, session expiration is a strong tool for minimizing the impacts of attack, but implementing cookie expiration is also helpful.</p>

 Regeneration of Session After Login 

<p>When a user first accesses your site, he/she can use an anonymous session.  This is a fairly common practice where you want to track a user’s movements in your application but don’t want to require them to log in.  For example, consider a shopping site where an anonymous user can have a shopping cart but can’t check out until he/she logs in.  In this case, there is still a session ID provided to the user.  When the user does log in, you should regenerate the session ID to prevent session fixation attacks against your web application.</p>

 Session Management in Node.js 

<p>Node.js has become wildly popular over the last 10 years.  With it, several frameworks and session management libraries have cropped up to support it.  Most frameworks use their own session management middleware.  For example, <code>express</code>, the most popular server framework for Node.js, has the accompanying <code>express-session</code> for session management.  Similarly, <code>koa</code> uses <code>koajs/session</code> for its session management.</p>

<p>For this article, I want to focus on <code>express-session</code>, as it is one of the most mature and widely used session management libraries available for Node.js.  For a full rundown of the <code>express-session</code> package, you can view the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session#readme">readme here</a>.  Below are some of the highlights:</p>

<p>Registering the middleware for <code>express-session</code> is very simple.</p>

   <code>var session = require('express-session')
var app = express()

app.use(
  session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
  })
);
</code>   

<p>This is the minimum you need to do to get <code>express-session</code> working in a development environment.  As discussed, the secret is used in hashing the session ID, to ensure it isn’t tampered with between the client and the server.  This should be some very long, complex string that is hard to guess.  This string should be rotated periodically to ensure that if it was compromised, it doesn’t stay that way long. The <code>secret</code> can also take an array of secrets to make it even harder to guess.</p>

<p>The <code>resave</code> option enforces that the session is resaved against the server store on each request, even if the session wasn’t modified.  The <code>saveUninitialized</code> property forces a new session to be saved. Both the <code>resave</code> and <code>saveUninitialized</code> options are left to your discretion on how best to implement.  Generally, <code>saveUninitialized: false</code> is used to reduce the session storage on the server for unauthenticated requests.  <code>resave</code> is defaulted to true, but to reduce overhead you can set it to false if your store allows.</p>

<p>Speaking of the store, you notice in this example you haven’t implemented one.  The default server-side session storage is <code>MemoryStore</code>.  According to the documentation, this is purposely not designed for production.  This means it’s fine to leave the above code this way in development, but you should implement a different store in production.  Not doing so can result in memory leaks and does not scale past a single process.  A list of compatible session stores <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/session#compatible-session-stores">can be found here</a>.</p>

<p>The following example uses <code>express-sessions</code> (note sessions instead of session) as a server-side store using MongoDB:</p>

   <code>app.use(
  express.session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new (require('express-sessions'))({
      storage: 'mongodb',
      instance: mongoose,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 27017,
      db: 'test',
      collection: 'sessions',
      expire: 86400
    })
}));
</code>   

<p>Now your application will use your MongoDB instance to store the server session data.  <code>Express-sessions</code> also supports a Redis implementation.  Furthermore, there are many libraries for supporting other databases and in-memory solutions.  Your stack will likely dictate what package you need to use.</p>

<p>Coming back to the security aspect of sessions, you learned that you should expire the session and the cookie.  The example below builds on our working example to do just that.</p>

   <code>app.use(
  express.session({
    secret: 'SomeSuperLongHardToGuessSecretString',
    resave: true,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new (require('express-sessions'))({
      storage: 'mongodb',
      instance: mongoose,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 27017,
      db: 'test',
      collection: 'sessions',
      expire: 86400
    }),
  cookie: { maxAge: 2628000000 },
}));
</code>   

<p>In the above expression, only the session ID is stored in the cookie, so you can set the <code>cookie.maxAge</code> value to expire the session and the cookie in one shot.  There is also an option for <code>cookie.expires</code>, however it is recommended that you set the <code>maxAge</code> option instead.</p>

<p>Now from your routes, you should be able to access the <code>session</code> object from your request object.  Earlier you learned that you should regenerate your session after the user logs in.  Let’s take a look at that using express and the <code>ExpressOIDC</code> from Okta.</p>

   <code>const oidc = new ExpressOIDC({
  issuer: {yourOktaDomain} + "/oauth2/default",
  client_id: {yourClientId},
  client_secret: {yourClientSecret},
  appBaseUrl: process.env.APP_BASE_URL,
  scope: "openid profile",
  routes: {
    login: {
      path: "/users/login",
    },
    callback: {
      path: "/authorization-code/callback",
    },
    loginCallback: {
      afterCallback: "/users/afterLogin",
    },
  },
});

app.use(oidc.router);

app.get("/users/afterLogin", ensureAuthenticated, (request, response, next) =&gt; {
  request.session.regenerate(function(err) {
    // will have a new session here
  })
});
</code>   

<p>In the above example, you are registering the <code>ExpressOIDC</code> middleware provided by Okta to handle the login.  After the successful login, you redirect the users to the <code>users/afterLogin</code> router, which then has access to the <code>request</code> object.  <code>Express-session</code> has attached the <code>session</code> object to the request for you and you can use the <code>session</code> API to call <code>regenerate</code>.  This will create a new session for the logged-in users.</p>

<p>Session management is a topic that you could spend days researching and understanding.  As I noted, the session management package you will use in Node.js will largely depend on your stack and your server framework.  However, by becoming familiar with implementing safe and optimized session management in one framework, you can carry that knowledge to all other Node.js frameworks.</p>

 Representing base IP with ERC721 and fungible IP licenses with ERC20, to combine benefits of&nbsp;both  Summary <p>The goal of this series is to practically connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard. This article links ERC721 &amp; ERC20, and describes how combining them gets benefits of&nbsp;both.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Scenarios <p>There are two big-picture scenarios on how base IP and sub-licenses relate.</p>  Just base IP. This is quite simple. It’s a single artifact and there is no sub-licenses. For example, an artist paints a painting and has a copyright of it. That painting is sold to a collector who then gets exclusive rights to it. The base IP started as copyright held by the painter, then was transferred to the collector.  Sub-licenses against the base IP. This has many varieties. Typically the sub-licenses are fungible. For example, an author writes a book and has copyright of it; he does an exclusive license of this base IP to a publishing house. The house sells 10,000 physical books, each having its own fungible sub-license against the base IP. As a second revenue stream, it might also sell 20,000 e-books, each having its own fungible sub-license (a different license compared to the physical&nbsp;books).   1.2 Implementing Scenarios in Blockchain <p>Here’s how these scenarios might get implemented in blockchain.</p><p>For scenario 1 above, the Single-Edition ERC721 described in Article 1 is appropriate.</p><p>Scenario 2 is much richer, leading to several implementation possibilities. Article 1 described how Limited-Edition ERC721 could be used, and Article 2 described how ERC20 could be used. This article will describe a third approach that combines both. But first let’s do some comparison.</p> 1.3 Comparing ERC721&nbsp;andERC20 <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC721 for limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  EC721 Benefits. First, if history of each unique token matters, and its provenance needs to be traced. Second, user experience is decent, since ERC721 wallets explicitly hold ERC721 tokens and render images alongside the ERC721. ERC721 markets have good price discovery for truly non-fungible assets, typically using auctions.  ERC721 Challenges. Limited-edition ERC721 assumes the tokens are non-fungible, even if the actual asset is fungible IP licenses. This makes the pricing problem harder, because it converts an apples-to-apples comparison into an apples-to-oranges one. Then, it can’t use AMMs and other powerful ERC20 price discovery tools. Finally, limited-edition ERC721 doesn’t model who owns the base IP at all, let alone make it easy to&nbsp;manage.  <p>Here are pros and cons for ERC20 for Limited-edition / fungible&nbsp;IP.</p>  ERC20 Benefits. First, tokens can go directly in AMMs which allows automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation. Second, tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to loans. Third, base IP is represented by ERC20.owner address, and therefore it can be transferred and&nbsp;managed.  ERC20 Challenges. While base IP can be transferred and managed, tooling doing so is poor. For example, wallets only store the private key for the ERC20.owner address; it doesn’t show up as a&nbsp;token.  <p>Here’s the key takeaways. First, the benefits of one are roughly the challenges for the other. Second, neither does well in managing base IP. It’s nonexistent for ERC721 and poor for ERC20. Yet managing base IP is extremely important! We want to make it easy for people to sell base IP, have multiple revenue streams against it, link it with physical objects and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;How <p>This section describes at a high level how to combine the benefits of ERC721 and ERC20, and better manage base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The basic idea is to tokenize the base IP and tokenize sub-licenses against it. Let’s bring in specific token standards.</p>  Base IP is non-fungible, so ERC721 is a good way to represent it.  Fungible IP sub-licenses are best represented by fungible token standard ERC20. And, we generalize this to multiple revenue streams against the base IP; some use ERC20, some may use ERC721, and others may use other standards or fully custom approaches [1]. A “good default” is simply&nbsp;ERC20.   1.4 Combining ERC721 + ERC20:&nbsp;Benefits <p>This leads to benefits at a high level, benefits from ERC721, and benefits from ERC20. Here are high-level benefits:</p>  Simple mental model non-fungible base IP → non-fungible token standard, and fungible IP licenses → fungible standard.  Enables multiple revenue streams against the base IP, with different sub-licenses. For example, a book might have a kindle version, softcover print version, and hardcover print version&nbsp;[8].  <p>Base IP inherits benefits of&nbsp;ERC721:</p>  Direct wallet support for base IP. Render images, transfer base IP, versus just holding the private key for ERC20.owner  Sell base IP in marketplaces focusing on ERC721 NFTs, with corresponding price discovery tuned for ERC721. E.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>  Easier to link physical objects with base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.wisekey.com/press/wisekey-partners-with-ocean-protocol-to-launch-trustednft-io-a-decentralized-marketplace-for-objects-of-value-designed-to-empower-artists-creators-and-collectors-with-a-unique-solution-for-the-auth/">WISeKey chips in paintings, linked directly to&nbsp;NFTs</a>  Tools to fractionalize ownership of base IP, e.g. <a href="https://www.niftex.org/">Niftex</a> tool. This allows co-ownership of base IP, such as <a href="https://www.vita-dao.io/">VitaDAO</a> for drug discovery data  <p>Fungible IP sub-licenses inherit benefits of&nbsp;ERC20:</p>  Fungible IP tokens can go directly in AMMs, for automatic price discovery, liquidity, and curation.  Fungible IP tokens play well with the rest of ERC20 &amp; DeFi infrastructure, from ERC20 wallets to bridges to&nbsp;loans.  <p>This combines the UX benefits of ERC721 with the fungibility benefits of ERC20. ERC20 doesn’t have to be limited-edition either; for example ERC20 tokens (licenses) could be minted on-the-fly.</p><p>At Ocean Protocol for V3, we built an ERC20-based IP framework. We’re now working on ERC721+ERC20 for Ocean&nbsp;V4.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC721+ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 + ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions   To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self, and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata follows<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721"> ERC721Metadata extension</a>. Then, use ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing. The ERC20 can be linked to ERC721 in one of many&nbsp;ways.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [6]. For legals, T&amp;C states that owning ≥1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. Those sub-license rights associated with the given ERC20 contract, not the ERC721 contract.  Base IP: represented by the tuple of {ERC721 deployment, tokenId}.  Base IP holder: represented by the owner of the address at ERC721.owners[tokenId].  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.   2.2 ERC20 + ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC721._safeMint() to claim the base IP, which sets the value at ERC721._owner[tokenId=7] is set to addressP. Then the publisher calls ERC20.constructor() and ERC20.mint() to mint 3 sub-license tokens with addressP as initial owner; this sets the value at ERC20.owner to addressP, and ERC20.balances value at key addressP is set to&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>Step ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract, and work exactly like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling ERC721.safeTransferFrom() which changes ERC721.owners[tokenId=x] to a new&nbsp;address.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 ERC20 + ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The two images below illustrate.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners[tokenId=7] value is addressP, meaning the publisher is the base IP holder. The ERC20._balances attribute holds one entry with key addressP and value 3.0, meaning the publisher holds three sub-licenses.</p><p>The ERC20 can link to the ERC721 in one of many ways. In this example, we riff on ERC20 Ownable mixin with an NftOwnable mixin, replacing ERC20.owner with ERC20.nftOwner that points to the NFT tuple {ERC721 address, tokenId}. Ability to mint ERC20 tokens and other permissions that Ownable gave to the address at ERC20.owner now go to the address at ERC721._owners[tokenId].</p><p>Steps ❷, ❸ and ❹ only involve the ERC20 contract. They only change ERC20._balances variables just like Limited-Edition ERC20 sub-license steps. ERC721 state is not&nbsp;changed.</p>ERC721+ERC20: UML Structure Diagram, steps&nbsp;1–4<p>When ❺ is complete, base IP has been transferred. ERC721.owners[tokenId=7] now holds the value address3 (not shown). The address3 owner now controls ERC20 minting and other permissions.</p>ERC721+ERC20: Structure Diagram, step&nbsp;5 3. Conclusion <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">article 2</a> on ERC20 fungible token standard.</p><p>This article connected IP to ERC721+ERC20 Solidity implementations, and how it combines the benefits of ERC721 and of ERC20 individually.</p> 4. Appendix: Related Approaches  4.1 NFT&nbsp;Vaults <p>This is another approach represent base IP &amp; fractional licenses. Start with ERC20 setup of article 2, but put the private key that owns ERC20.owner attribute into an NFT “vault” using <a href="https://hack.ethglobal.co/showcase/nfwallets-recErbcXq0xNSP8zX">NFwallets</a>, <a href="https://charged.fi/">Charged Particles</a>, or <a href="https://circuitsofvalue.com/">emblem.vault</a>.</p><p>This seems simple at first glance. However, each ERC20’s owner would be represented by a different NFT, which causes ambiguity if only one of those NFTs is transferred. Also, the workflow to publish is clumsier. Finally, the overall mental model is more complex, which hinders adoptability.</p> 4.2 Fractional ownership of&nbsp;ERC721 <p>Base IP can have fractional ownership. Here’s a traditional example: a company holds a patent, and that company has 10 shareholders. Each shareholder therefore has fractional ownership of the base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Standards like <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1633">EIP1633</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2981">EIP2981</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3601">EIP3601</a>, and tools like Niftex allow one to shard ownership of an ERC721 token, where ERC20 tokens represent the fraction of ownership into the ERC721 token. That’s highly useful to shard ownership for base IP, including the setup in this article where base IP is represented by&nbsp;ERC721.</p><p>The main goal of this article is to contemplate representing ERC20 as fungible IP license against ERC721 base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>In short, there are (at least) two complementary ways to use ERC20 in relation to ERC721: ERC20 to shard an ERC721 token, and ERC20 for fungible IP licenses against base ERC721 IP. This article focuses on the&nbsp;latter.</p><p>Interestingly, by using ERC20 for fungible IP licenses, we get fractional ownership of these IP licenses (if decimals &gt; 0, which is usually the&nbsp;case).</p> Acknowledgements <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series acknowledges the many people that have helped towards the whole series, including this article. Thank you&nbsp;again!</p> Notes <p>[1] Having base IP represented as ERC721 tokens is general enough to allow monetization beyond basic ERC20 IP sub-license datatokens. For example, have Superfluid ERC20 datatokens for streaming payments in C2D or subscriptions. Or, have ERC721 IP sub-licenses. Basically anything, since they just point to the&nbsp;ERC721.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">NFTs &amp; IP 3: Combining ERC721 &amp; ERC20</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<br>
<p>Recently, the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/35">first upgrade</a> to the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/azimuth/">Azimuth</a> smart contracts which make up Urbit ID was
put up to an <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade proposal vote</a> by the
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/senate/">Galactic Senate</a>. This vote is still open and will
last for 30 days (June 20th) or until an absolute majority is reached. We’d like
to take this opportunity to discuss two things. <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#changelist">First</a>, what the
proposed changes are, and <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">second</a>, a review of how Urbit governance
works and where we’re at with respect to the decentralization process.</p>
<p>Before we dive into what the proposed changes are, let’s review what the Senate
is actually capable of changing. Urbit ID is really two sets of smart contracts:
Azimuth and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ecliptic/">Ecliptic</a>. Azimuth is the data of the
public key infrastructure - roughly, this is the list of
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ship/">ships</a> and which Ethereum addresses own them, along
with other data such as networking keys and sponsorship status. The Senate has
no ability to touch this data directly. This is in direct contrast to all
existing centralized services, where your account is always at risk of being
taken away from you. What the Senate can change is Ecliptic, which is the
“business logic” that decides how you can interact with the data in Azimuth.
These are mechanisms such as what powers various
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/proxies/">proxies</a> have, how stars/planets are released over
time, and how sponsorship works. Put another way, the data and database format
must remain the same, but the rules by which we interact with it may change
according to the governance rules we <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/#senate">detail below</a>.</p>
 Changelist 
<p>The currently open vote to Ecliptic contains the following changes: </p>
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility  
 Self-modifying proxies  
 Upgraded Claims contract 
 
 Fixed ERC721 compatibility 
<p>The contract definition of the Ecliptic includes various functions and events
that make it conform to the ERC721 (non-fungible token) standard. However, two
events have <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/issues/8">ever so slightly
non-confirming</a> descriptions. This
causes Ethereum explorers like Etherscan to incorrectly recognize Azimuth as
ERC20 (fungible token), rather than ERC721.</p>
<p>The proposed change simply modifies the event descriptions to accurately match
the ERC721 definition. This does not affect any functionality within the
contract itself.</p>
 Self-modifying proxies 
<p>Owners of Azimuth assets are allowed to configure "proxy addresses" for those
assets: Ethereum addresses allowed to act "as" the owner, but only for a subset
of operations. For example, setting the management proxy will let you change
your networking keys and sponsor using that address, just like your ownership
address can. This is useful for keeping the ownership keys in very cold storage,
while still letting you perform lower-value operations.</p>
<p>Currently, only the ownership address is allowed to change proxy addresses.
Fairly early on after Azimuth's deployment, we realized it might be nice for
proxies to be able to change themselves.</p>
<p>This means that, in addition to being able to configure networking keys and
sponsorship, your management proxy would be able to assign a new management
proxy. This would allow you, or a trusted third party holding your management proxy,
to rotate your proxy keys without needing to take your ownership keys out of cold
storage.</p>
 Upgraded Claims contract 
<p><a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/blob/master/contracts/Claims.sol">The Claims
contract</a>
lets asset managers associate various attestations with their identity. For
example, an Ethereum address to send donations to, or proving ownership of a
Twitter account.</p>
<p>For ease of use by off-chain tools and services, the contract emits events
(notifications) whenever any claims are updated. However, the current version of
the contract has a bug where it does not emit events when all claims are removed
at once (clearClaims()). This "gap" in the event stream makes it much more
difficult to write off-chain tools around this contract. Considering Claims has
seen <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7e7f69b34d7d9bd8d61fb22c33b22708947971a#events">practically no
use</a>
since it was first deployed, it should not be a problem to simply start over
fresh with a new contract that contains <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/32">the
fix</a> for the described bug.</p>
<p>The reason we must do an Ecliptic upgrade to switch to a new Claims contract, is
that it is tied in with the logic for transferring an asset. If the asset is
flagged for "reset" (common when transferring to/from someone other than
yourself), its configured proxies, networking keys and claims are cleared during
transfer. As such, the Ecliptic will need to know about the address of the new
Claims contract.</p>
 Urbit Governance 
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Urbit is to become a digital republic manifested as a peer
to peer network owned and controlled by its users. The goal of Tlon, then, is to
become a company which builds products for Urbit rather than being the primary
driving force behind its development. We’d like to take this opportunity to
spell out our perspective on where we’re at in that process. We’ve already
written a good deal about Urbit governance in the past on this blog, so we avoid
rehashing too much, but the first contract upgrade is an apt time for a routine
checkup. Here are some previous posts that are relevant, but please note that
some of them are several years old and as such may not accurately reflect our
current position, but still serve as useful historical markers. We hope to
revisit and refresh these documents soon. </p>

 Galactic Senate 
<p>The Galactic Senate is composed of all <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/galaxy/">galaxy</a>
holders, which at present consists of more than 100 individuals and a few
organizations, including Tlon and the Urbit.org Foundation. Using the Azimuth
voting contract, the Senate can present and vote on two kinds of proposals:
<a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/docvote/">document proposals</a> and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/upgrade/">upgrade
proposals</a>. Thus far, all matters which the Senate
has voted on have been document proposals. The <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/34">most recent
vote</a> declared the Urbit network as
(i) being secure (as confirmed by a <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/security-audit/">third party
audit</a>) and (ii) having reached continuity (as in, no
further <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/breach/">network breaches</a> are expected). Previous votes
were to declare that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/25">Azimuth is live</a>
and that <a href="https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/pull/24">Arvo is stable</a>.</p>
 Address space distribution 
<p>Perhaps the most informative measure of how decentralized Urbit is in terms of
how many independent parties hold address space. By the very nature of Urbit, it
is impossible to know this with great accuracy (a common feature of
decentralized projects). However, the movement of galaxies is closely watched
and thus we have a fairly good idea of how distributed they are.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Urbit’s creator Curtis Yarvin was in possession of the entire
address space - all 256 galaxies, and everything underneath it. A network of one
is no network at all, and so over the last decade Urbit’s development has been
primarily driven by selling or giving away these galaxies. On <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-urbit-address-space/">June 1,
2016</a>, the allocation was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>95, to the Tlon Corporation. 50, to urbit.org, the future community
foundation. 40, to Tlon employees and their family members (24 to Curtis, who
started in 2002; 16 to everyone else, who started in 2014). 34, to outside
investors in Tlon. 37, to 33 other individuals, who donated to the project,
contributed code or services, won a contest, or were just in the right place
at the right time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the period since then leading up to the present, Tlon has sold a number of
its galaxies to fund development, and others have changed hands, to the point
that Tlon and urbit.org no longer possess a majority share of galaxies. In
January 2019, <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/a-founders-farewell/">Curtis gave all of his galaxies</a> to
Tlon when he left the project. In August 2020 we shared an update on the <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/value-of-address-space-pt3/">known
distribution of address space</a>, where
Curtis’ galaxies are marked as Tlon’s “naked galaxies”. Since then, Tlon
disbursed its naked galaxies among the employees that wanted one who did not
already possess one, thus removing Tlon and urbit.org’s controlling share of the
Senate. Galaxies held by current and former Tlon employees are entirely
independent of Tlon Corporation—they may do with them, and vote with them, as
they please. <code>~ravmel-ropdyl</code> plans to give more color to this decision in the
near future.</p>
<p>Distribution of stars is much more difficult to know. There is an active market
for stars on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id">OpenSea</a>, so we know that
they are changing hands frequently, but checking the number of distinct Ethereum
addresses that hold stars does not tell you very much information since there
are many legitimate reasons one person might hold each of their stars at
different addresses.</p>
 Software and smart contracts 
<p>As was written in <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/the-dao-as-a-lesson-in-decentralized-governance/">The DAO as a Lesson in Decentralized
Governance</a>,
we are keenly aware of the threat of decentralization theater. Urbit has
undergone steady progress towards decentralization, and with the developments we
outline below, it’s never been more clear that the project is beginning to leave
the cradle of Tlon. It’s also important to note that decentralization of a
project is always a procession away from an initial centralized state⁠—you cannot
go from A to Z without first traversing every letter in between. While Urbit was
centralized during its earliest stages, the journey towards a network owned and
controlled by the users is now well underway.</p>
<p>In the past, nearly all Urbit software was written by Tlon. While Tlon is still the only corporation actively updating Urbit’s MIT-licensed open source software, namely <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/vere/">Vere</a> (the runtime), and <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/arvo/">Arvo</a> (the kernel), unaffiliated individuals have been making enormous contributions to Urbit over the past couple of years via the <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/history">grants program</a>. Recent examples include the <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4940">Bitcoin node and wallet integration</a>, <a href="https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/21131866-webrtc-gall-agent-and-external-app">WebRTC integration</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arthyn/port">Port, an Urbit installer and ship manager</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/4820"><code>|fuse</code>, an important primitive for 3rd party software distribution</a>.</p>
<p>The only real power Tlon holds over Urbit is the ability to push <a href="https://urbit.org/docs/glossary/ota-updates/">OTA
updates</a> via <code>~zod</code>, and suggest that people
download our binaries. To the best of our knowledge, all extant galaxies
retrieve their OTA updates from <code>~zod</code>, who forward it to their stars, who
forward it to their planets. This software distribution route is merely a
convenient default setting. Ships initially retrieve OTA updates from their
sponsor, but they have full authority to retrieve updates from whoever they want
with the <code>|ota</code> command, or even to only install software updates by hand if
they so choose.</p>
<p>In the future, one can easily imagine many organizations shipping their own
distributions of Urbit from their own urbit nodes, somewhat analogously to the
large number of Linux distributions which exist today. There is nothing we can
do to stop a group from forking Urbit, declaring <code>~sampel-palnet</code> the new <code>~zod</code>
(both for updates and for sponsorship purposes), and retrieving all OTA updates
via that route and building their own binaries. This is all by design, and we
wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>The use of the Azimuth smart contracts is also somewhat optional. By changing a
few lines of code to point their ships at another set of PKI smart contracts,
they could rid themselves of hierarchical peer discovery entirely and make use
of some other routing strategy such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">Kademlia based DHT
routing</a>. This would likely give rise to
an entirely separate network. The fact that the network is fully capable of such
a schism helps keep the Senate honest and accountable to the users. If they ever
were to vote on a contract modification that greatly angered or upset a portion
of the user base, they would be inviting such a schism and be entirely deserving
of it. In that sense, the power to control the network is already held by the
users, they just have not yet had a reason to make use of it.</p>
 Legitimacy 
<p>The only way by which Tlon and the Senate hold any power is via legitimacy.
Vitalik Buterin recently wrote a <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html">very informative
article</a> on the role of
legitimacy in decentralized governance, and I do not know of a better source to
understand how Tlon and the Senate are kept in check by the users. Besides the
DAO split resulting in Ethereum and Ethereum Classic mentioned in the article,
perhaps the most prominent example of the power users have over a decentralized
network is the saga of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/justin-sun-bought-steemit-steem-moved-to-limit-his-power">Steem and Justin
Sun</a>.
The short version of the story is that Justin Sun bought a controlling share of
the Steem blockchain and attempted to exert control over it, and the users
banded together to fork the blockchain into one called Hive, which was identical
to Steem except with Sun’s token balance set to zero. An analogous outcome for
Urbit would be that the Senate makes sweeping changes to the PKI and invites a
schism like that outlined above.</p>
<p>For these reasons, there are strong disincentives for any one organization or
individual to acquire too many galaxies. The more galaxies one party possesses,
the fewer there are with strong incentives to stimulate efforts to build on the
network, reducing the value of holding that space, and the greater the risk that
the users will perceive this as a power grab by a party without their interests
in mind. This is in contrast to real-life republics, where there is little risk
for one party to accumulate as much power as they can manage since the cost to
the citizens to overthrow that power is enormous. Thus, only especially
egregious displays of power ever result in rebellion. Within the Urbit republic,
users need only to change the code they run to leave the Senate powerless, and
so the threat of rebellion is much more real. We estimate that within a digital
republic like Urbit, the centrifugal forces outweigh the centripetal forces, and
that the outcome of this is more stable than the reverse.</p>
 Why have governance at all? 
<p>An important question the reader may still have lingering is: why does Urbit
need governance at all? The short answer is: (i) there will always be necessary
protocol upgrades that cannot be foreseen, and (ii) a total lack of governance
inevitably gives rise to a shadow government with undefined powers that is
almost impossible to hold accountable.</p>
<p>With (ii), we see this to be the case on many early blockchain projects where
power is shared by the developers and the miners, but what each is capable of
doing has never been codified, and thus users of the blockchain can never have a
great deal of certainty of what changes might occur in the future. This doesn’t
guarantee a bad outcome, but it does create more wariness for individuals to
contribute to a project when they cannot know whether they really have a say in
its direction. Recognizing this issue, many newer blockchain and
blockchain-adjacent projects have built-in governance mechanisms that lay out
exactly what an individual can expect should they join and contribute to that
network.</p>
<p>As for (i), with Urbit being a wholly new kind of network, it would take some
incredible luck and crystal ball gazing to get the PKI exactly right on the very
first try without ever needing another modification. Thus, some mechanism was
needed to guarantee that the PKI’s logic could be altered. Leaving control of
Azimuth in the hands of Tlon would have just granted Tlon dictatorial power and
a future that becomes more uncertain the further one gazes. There’s certainly
room to argue that the Galactic Senate is not a perfect system, but our interim
constitution did outline potential roles for stars and planets to play in
governance in the future, so there is ample opportunity for the system to evolve
in response to the will of the users. As always, it is important to keep in mind
the unfinished nature of the Urbit of today and the still moldable clay of the
Urbit of tomorrow⁠—nothing yet is set in stone.</p>

<p>A lot of what I've shared recently has been about Holo hosting -- getting all the bits really robust so they handle both 'happy path' user interactions (everything is working as expected) and 'sad path' ones (HoloPort goes down, login fails, etc). But I haven't spent much time talking about how Holochain itself is improving -- and when I have, it's usually been about bugfixes to support the aforementioned Holo work.</p><p>But behind the scenes, Holochain has been getting some big upgrades to some of its parts. This is mainly to make it faster -- fast enough for the next stages of Elemental Chat testing. (And of course, Elemental Chat testing is really about Holo hosting and Holochain.)</p> LMDB to SQLite: the road to infinite scalability <p>A lot of peer-to-peer networks, from decentralised social networks like <a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a> to blockchains like Bitcoin, are built on something called '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">gossip protocol</a>'. It's a simple protocol, and it works like it sounds like it would work: I know a bunch of people (or rather, computers), and when one of my friends shares something with me I share it with everyone else I know. With this protocol, messages spread rapidly through networks without a central authority.</p><p>And it also creates a lot of network traffic. That might be fine for blockchains, in which every machine is online most of the time and needs to know about everything anyway. But for networks that power everyday applications, you want to be respectful of your users' bandwidth -- and you can't expect their machines to be on all the time either. (Even blockchains tweak gossip to make it more efficient.)</p><p>Holochain is based on the idea of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">'neighbourhoods' of authority</a> -- each piece of data gets an address, and it's only sent to a group of machines that have taken responsibility for the range of addresses that cover its address. That means traditional gossip is too chatty -- as an authority, you need to constantly make decisions about what to share with your neighbours, given that they aren't responsible for the exact same range that you are.</p><p>It gets more complicated when machines are turning on and off all the time (which happens a lot when they're just users' devices). A machine that's been offline for a while will want to get up to date with the latest gossip, and will ask its peers for a digest of new stuff since they were last online.</p><p>This means you have to be able to ask your own database questions like "which of my neighbours' responsibility ranges start before, and end after, address <code>531993928</code>?" and "what new data have I collected within my neighbour Alice's responsibility range <code>112513216</code> to <code>241661317</code> since yesterday morning at 08:37 UTC?" These sorts of questions, called range queries, are really hard for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database">key/value database</a> like <a href="http://www.lmdb.tech/doc/">LMDB</a> to answer, but they're really easy for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational database</a> like <a href="https://sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a>.</p><p>Because all data in Holochain is just keys (addresses) and values attached to those keys, LMDB initially made sense -- it was much faster than any relational database out there when it came to key/value lookups, as well as being gentle on CPU and RAM. But as the core developers started looking at <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">sharding</a>, it became obvious that the large amount of range queries would hurt performance unacceptably if they stuck with LMDB.</p><p>As a side bonus, SQLite also makes it possible for us to encrypt source chain and DHT data at rest using <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/">SQLCipher</a>. (Note: this doesn't prevent you from reading your peers' published data -- that's not how Holochain works. But it does prevent an attacker from stealing it if they gain access to your computer.)</p> Other gossip upgrades <p>As mentioned, when machines come back online after being offline for a while, the catching-up process has been pretty network-heavy. Now when it happens, machines <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/752">compare their lists</a> of held data using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filters</a>. This technique results in more back-and-forth messages between nodes but less data being exchanged overall. This is already speeding up syncing, even though sharding is yet to be introduced.</p> New versions of Wasmer and Rust <p><a href="https://wasmer.io/">Wasmer</a>, the <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> engine we're using to run the 'rules' of a Holochain app, is now at version 1.0, so we've <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/801">upgraded it</a>. It comes with better memory management, a faster compiler and runtime, and a bunch of bug fixes. It also lets us compile and run Holochain on ARM CPUs like the HoloPort Nano.</p><p>Wasmer 1.0 will also let us implement compute metering for Holo hosting, as well as runtime budgets to prevent infinite loops from <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/halting-problem/">chewing up all of a host's CPU capacity</a>.</p><p>A new version of the Rust programming language has been released as well, so we've upgraded Holochain to use that too.</p><p>As a side effect, macOS developers are now first-class citizens again -- these updates plus some bugfixes have <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/pull/212">resolved</a> the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holonix/issues/211">macOS build issues</a> for Holonix, our development environment.</p> What's next? <p>Wasmer 1.0 and Rust 1.52 have already been integrated into Holochain, and they'll be rolled out along with the SQLite update. Expect to see faster install times soon too; we're researching automated build servers for Holonix so you don't have to wait an hour for everything to compile!</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/767">work of integrating SQLite is done</a>, and the slower performance of key/value lookups is more than offset by the faster performance of range queries. It's currently being tested on a single HoloPort with an automated Elemental Chat test involving 20 hosted users and one self-hosted instance, which has revealed a bug related to clogged processing queues. If there are no other show-stopper bugs, it'll replace the current LMDB-based Holochain on all HoloPorts soon.</p><p>Now that this work is almost ready, the core devs have been able to work on sharding the DHT. So far it's been 'full-sync', which means everybody stores everything, a lot like a blockchain. This is good for redundancy but bad for performance (although community testers have been consistently talking about how fast Elemental Chat already is). So far they've completed about half of the tasks involved in sharding.</p><p>Sharding has always been part of our promise to make dApps fast and scalable, so I'm excited to see this happening.</p> Reminder: Register for Dev Camp! <p>The next community-led <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">Dev Camp is starting at the end of June</a>. The project you'll be working on, a game called Tragedy of the Holocommons, will help you understand how to design an app that works well without a single source of truth. I think it's a brilliant idea.</p><p>Dev Camps are still free, and they’re run by a fantastic and knowledgeable group of volunteers.</p><p>The Holochain developer community is growing, along with the ecosystem of learning materials and open-source libraries, tools, and apps.

<p>Whether your company uses direct deposit or other direct payments through the ACH network, you’re likely leveraging WEB debit transfers in some way. And if you’re using WEB debits, you should be adhering to Nacha’s WEB debit rule. Doing so will not only keep you on good terms with Nacha, but it’s also an opportunity to enhance payment experiences and protect your company. Here’s how.</p>
 How Prevalent Is ACH Fraud? 
<p>Nacha’s WEB (meaning internet-initiated entry) debit compliance rules are designed to protect both the ACH network and your company from rising ACH fraud. The <a href="https://www.afponline.org/publications-data-tools/reports/survey-research-economic-data/Details/payments-fraud/">Association of Finance Professionals</a> (AFP) 2020 Payments Fraud and Control Survey Report found that 81% of businesses were targets of payments fraud and 55% of businesses were directly impacted by ACH fraud, with 33% of that fraud from ACH debits and 22% from ACH credits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud usually occurs when a criminal accesses a customer’s account and submits an unauthorized ACH transaction. In the past, all a criminal needed was an account number and a bank routing number. How many abandoned checkbooks might be floating around in the landfill, waiting for an eager fraudster?</p>
<p>With a third of businesses falling victim to ACH WEB debit fraud, it’s no wonder Nacha is updating its rules to protect both the ACH network and your company.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Nacha WEB Debit Compliance Rules? 
<p>Nacha has established operating rules that keep the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/what-is-ach-6-fundamentals-to-get-you-started/">ACH network</a> secure. As part of those operating rules, originators of WEB debit entries must use a “commercially reasonable fraudulent transaction detection system” to screen those debit transactions for fraud. What that detection system specifically looks like has been largely up to the businesses initiating ACH transfers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Nacha <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">has recently augmented this requirement</a> and now specifically requires that the “fraudulent transaction detection system” includes account validation. Under the new rule, an account must be validated with the first use of the account number, or after any changes to the account number. This updated rule aims to cut down on the WEB debit fraud that continues to climb.</p>
 When Do Businesses Need to Be in Compliance? 
<p>Nacha had originally set January 1, 2020, as the effective date for the new WEB debit rule. The Board of Directors then approved an extension to March 19, 2021 to allow businesses to educate themselves and implement the new processes. As of now, the WEB debit rule is in effect. Originators of WEB debit payments have one year from the effective date of the rule to implement an account validation solution.</p>
 How Can You Ensure Your Payments Are Compliant? 
<p>To be compliant with Nacha’s WEB debit rule, your payment solution must include some form of account validation. This validation can take several Nacha-approved forms:</p>
 
 Prenotification entry: The payment originator sends a zero-dollar entry through the ACH network to the account several days prior to the live entry. 
 Micro-deposit verification: Small amounts—usually between a couple cents and a dollar—are sent to an account and must be verified by the account holder. 
 Instant account validation: The customer provides consent to access their account information, ideally through a direct API connection to the customer’s financial institution. Of these verification methods, instant account validation delivers the most accurate information in real time and doesn’t rely on the customer manually keying their account and routing information. They simply log in to their account and provide consent for the validation. 
 
<p>Nacha also notes that companies may leverage other validation means. For example, proving that an account has a reliable history of prior successful payments may act as a sufficient validation. Ultimately, Nacha recognizes that every company’s position and situation is unique, and so determining whether an account validation method is “commercially reasonable” will differ, and each company should consult their own attorneys, risk department, or other advisors to ensure the validation method is compliant.</p>
 How Finicity’s Instant Account Verification Prevents Fraud and Enables A Better User Experience 
<p>Through our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity Pay</a><a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/"></a>&nbsp;solution set, we offer instant account validation that satisfies Nacha’s updated WEB debit rule and provides additional valuable data to improve the experience and efficiency of ACH payments. Our instant account validation enables money movers to mitigate fraud and maximize the accuracy of payment transactions by providing account and routing numbers, account owner verification, and balance checks to streamline and secure ACH payments. And with easy and fast consumer permissioning, our validation solution empowers consumers to benefit from their own data to have better financial services experiences.</p>
<p>In addition to validating account information, the consumer-permissioned data Fincity’s open banking platform provides can be used to check balances prior to processing payments to avoid fees and returns due to insufficient funds. It can also support Know Your Customer (KYC) by providing the name and address of the account owner on file at the financial institution. While this data is useful for payments, it can also be leveraged in account opening, digital wallet or prepaid card funding, or other use cases where similar information is needed.</p>
<p>Don’t just take our word for it. Nacha has named Finicity a Preferred Partner, which guarantees that our validation solution aligns with Nacha’s core strategies to advance the ACH networks. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/nacha-announces-finicity-preferred-partner-account-validation">According to Nacha</a>, those who are preferred partners:</p>
 
 Facilitate efficiencies in the use of ACH information and messaging formats and standards

  Learn how HYPR’s latest QR code login helps users to initiate web login with the HYPR App to avoid push fatigue and push-based attacks

<p>What are push attacks? Push attacks are used by malicious actors whose goal is to get past mobile push-based multi-factor authentication (MFA). The malicious actor spams the victim with notifications to authenticate until they are fatigued and finally accept it. When deployed on a mass scale, even a low success rate of <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-2-factor-authentication-isnt-foolproof/">less than 3% is significant.</a></p>
      
<p>Push attacks are a growing concern among security experts, and many of today’s MFA solutions offer push authentication as a form of MFA. That’s why the latest HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12 offers a technology preview of QR code login.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>No Passwords, No Push, Just Scan QR to Log In</p>
      
 HYPR’s QR Code Login 
      
<p>6.12 now enables users to log into their SSO-managed web apps by scanning a QR code with the HYPR App or camera on their smartphone.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is a passwordless MFA alternative in situations where push notifications to the mobile device aren’t available, or undesirable from a security standpoint.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Before partnering with HYPR, a higher education customer struggled to secure their 3,500-person University campus with their existing password-based login and potential push-related security risks. Push fatigue inadvertently allowed access to another user who correctly guessed the victim’s username and spammed their account for a push authentication.</p>
      
<p>QR code login is impactful because it prevents push fatigue and its potential for push attacks. It gives more control to the end-user as they initiate their authentication by scanning the code rather than waiting for a push notification to arrive on their smartphone.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>Device pairing is still required to register a trusted device, so the QR code will only prompt the user to verify their identity with their registered device.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>HYPR Cloud Platform 6.12</p>
      
<p>In addition to QR code login, another notable update includes our API Endpoint Security Enhancement feature. This feature further improves the overall security posture across components of the HYPR Cloud Platform by passing an encrypted token to the HYPR Server when making internal API calls.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p>To learn more about what 6.12 has to offer, read our latest release notes for <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/installinghypr/docs/workforce-access-6120">Workforce Access 6.12</a> and <a href="https://docs.hypr.com/integratinghypr/docs/customer-authentication-6120">Customer Authentication 6.12</a>.

 Representing Intellectual Property rights via ERC20 for AMM-based price discovery and&nbsp;more  Summary <p>The goal of this series is to practically connect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP) to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It uses the language of IP and focuses on Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">Article 1</a> of this series focused on the ERC721 non-fungible token standard. This article focuses on the ERC20 fungible token standard for blockchain * IP, and describes how it helps price discovery and more. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">Article 3</a> links ERC721 &amp;&nbsp;ERC20.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 Fungibility &amp; Price Discovery <p>Apple-apple. If you have two identical apples side by side, and one sells for $0.75, then you can readily establish the price of the other apple as $0.75. You can swap them for each other and it doesn’t matter. That is, they’re fungible. With gold, one ounce of can be swapped for another; it’s fungible. Same for TSLA stock. Same for Bitcoin. Same for ERC20 tokens (fungible token standard).</p><p>Apple-orange. If you have an apple and an orange side-by-side, and the apple sells for $2, you still don’t have much information to price the orange. The apple and orange can’t be swapped for each other. They’re non-fungible. This makes them harder to price. An ounce of gold can’t be swapped for an ounce of silver; it’s non-fungible. A one-of-a-kind painting can’t be swapped with another painting; it’s non-fungible. Same for ERC721 tokens (non-fungible token standard).</p><p>Price discovery. Of the two scenarios above, it’s easier to price apples to apples, rather than apples to oranges, because “apples to apples” are fungible. It’s hard to overstate the importance of this: fungibility greatly helps price discovery. It’s easier to price ERC20 tokens <a href="https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1353091225897869312">than ERC721</a>&nbsp;[1].</p> 1.2 Fungible IP&nbsp;Licenses <p>When a publisher prints a book, they print thousands or millions of copies. Coming off the press, each of those copies can be swapped for another. They’re fungible.</p><p>Open up a book to one of the first pages and you’ll find information about the place of publication, and what printing round it was. Importantly, you’ll also see the well-known copyright © symbol, and the name of the base IP rights holder. This matters because the physical copy of that book includes a license to use that copyrighted material, that base IP. Holding that book in your hands gives you physical access to use that IP. A printed book includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>If you rent a movie from Amazon Prime, you’re getting a license to the IP of that movie, that base IP. You get digital access to it for 48 hours. Over time, millions of people may rent that movie, i.e. license that base IP. A rented movie includes a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>Consider a weather station recording temperature, windspeed, wind direction, rainfall, and air pressure over years. The weather station owners hold this dataset as IP, and license it to thousands of weather-prediction agencies throughout the world. Each license is just like the other licenses. A weather data license is a fungible IP&nbsp;license.</p><p>There are plenty more examples in music, video games, photographs, and more. It goes beyond copyright IP; it happens for trademark IP and patent IP as well, anytime there is more than one swappable license.</p><p>Fungible IP licenses may have limited or unlimited editions. Limited edition use cases are around collectibles and the art world. Unlimited edition use cases include licensing stock photos, renting movies, buying e-books, and&nbsp;more.</p> 1.2 ERC20&nbsp;Standard <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20</a> is a fungible token standard. It’s the most popular standard for tokens, fungible or otherwise.</p><p>Most crypto wallets support ERC20. AMM DEXes exploit ERC20 fungibility property for price discovery, to great success: they now have have billions in daily volume. It’s not just for exchanges; the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance"> DeFi</a> community has developed tools for loans, stablecoins, insurance and more, all around ERC20. Even many non-Ethereum chains support&nbsp;ERC20.</p><p>If one wants to tokenize fungible assets, ERC20 is a good&nbsp;choice.</p> 1.3 Fungible IP Licenses via&nbsp;ERC20 <p>IP licenses can be fungible; and ERC20 is the leading fungible token standard. Then, ERC20 is a logical choice to represent fungible IP licenses. The NFT<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70"> field</a> uses it accordingly; let’s review some examples.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC_%28musician%29">RAC’s</a><a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape"> $TAPE</a> token is an example using ERC20. Here, 1.0 TAPE tokens are used to<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/the-democratization-of-value"> redeem</a> a music license in a cassette medium.<a href="https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xc85cdd3240385af9958ef99bc2ff0c4de5640bcb"> TAPE is on Uniswap AMM</a>, enabling price discovery to around <a href="https://store.zora.co/rac/tape">$4K per token</a> these&nbsp;days.</p><p><a href="https://unisocks.exchange/">$SOCKS</a> is another example, where SOCKS tokens redeem a pair of socks. Or, <a href="https://www.saintfame.com/fame">$FAME</a> and<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/introducing-bankless-apparel"> $BAP</a> are used to redeem t-shirts. While the focus is on the physical artifact, each has an associated copyright design. AMM price discovery has led to a single $SOCKS edition hitting $164K, and $thousands for $FAME and $BAP. These are exciting use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>The above are example one-off tokens. <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> scales this, as a platform that makes it easy to publish, stake/swap and redeem<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837"> ERC20 tokens for IP</a> with appropriate<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> legals</a>. It uses<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3"> AMMs for price discovery, liquidity, and curation</a>. Ocean Market is a reference marketplace; more than a dozen teams have forked its Apache2 frontend code to make their own blockchain IP markets for their own&nbsp;niche.</p> 1.4 *Non* Fungible IP Licenses &amp;&nbsp;ERC20 <p>In the book example above, the author got copyright for their book committing their creative writing to paper. The author could then print many copies of the book themselves, as fungible licenses. However, printing books may not be the author’s forte. So they’d typically do an exclusive license of the base IP to the publishing house; then, the house prints the books as fungible sub-licenses.</p><p>Same for music. The musician could license their works directly to their thousands of listeners. Traditionally this has been hard, so musicians would typically do an exclusive license of the base IP (“master tape”) then the label would do fungible sub-licensing to listeners etc. The exclusive licensee takes over the rights that the copyright holder had initially.</p><p>ERC20 has a means to represent the owner of this base IP (copyright / exclusive license): the address that controls ERC20.owner [4]. We elaborate below.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical; it describes what ERC20 code is doing from an IP perspective.</p> 2. ERC20 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP <p>This section describes how ERC20 code-level behavior maps to an IP framing. To emphasize similarity to the limited-edition ERC721 approach given in the first article, here we use an example on limited-edition ERC20 (vs. unlimited edition; without loss of generality).</p> 2.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition ERC20s means there are several licenses (editions) for the same base IP. Here’s how to implement.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. The claim is via ERC20.constructor(), and metadata points to a<a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/terms"> T&amp;C</a> stating this is a claim of base IP. Metadata is stored as an<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1046.md"> extension to ERC20</a> or in a<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/main/contracts/metadata/Metadata.sol"> separate contract</a>. Then, ERC20.mint(to=self, value=n licenses) to prepare for sub-licensing.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC20.transfer(to=licensee, value=1.0) [2]. For legals, the T&amp;C states that owning 1.0 tokens means having a sub-license with specific rights. In deploying the ERC20, one could set decimals=0 to represent exactly 1 license always. Even better, if we set decimals=18 we allow fractional ownership of licenses [3], and enable the token to work for AMMs, loans, etc (a big&nbsp;plus).  Base IP: represented by the ERC20 address from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: Stored in ERC20.owner. This means that ERC20 gives a convenient way to identify the base IP&nbsp;holder.  Sub-licensee: any address holding ≥ 1.0 ERC20&nbsp;tokens.  <p>It’s important that the tokens of a given ERC20 contract can only redeem a single type of license / item, otherwise it inadvertently replaces the semantic meaning of the ERC20 token itself (“it’s a license”) with simply being a unit-of-exchange token.</p> 2.2 Limited-Edition ERC20: Management of Base&nbsp;IP <p>ERC20 tokens themselves are for management of IP licenses. Interestingly, the setup supports managing the underling base IP (copyright or exclusive license). Here’s&nbsp;how.</p><p>First, recall that base IP ownership is stored in a state variable (ERC20.owner). So, one can transfer base IP ownership by changing its value to a new address via<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a>. Base IP ownership is fractional when a multisig wallet or DAO controls the address. Value can accrue to base IP before any licenses are created, ie before ERC20 tokens are minted. To monetize with &gt;1 license types (e.g. e-book vs print book), create one ERC20 contract for each license type, each with the same base&nbsp;IP.</p> 2.3 Limited-Edition ERC20: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls ERC20.constructor() method to claim the base IP, then ERC20.mint() to mint 3 tokens with addressP as initial owner. The ERC20’s owner attribute (an address) gets updated to addressP, and its balances attribute (a mapping) gets updated to 3.0 at index addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of one edition, from Publisher to Licensee1 (address1). ERC20.balances gets updated: the value at addressP is decremented by 1.0, and the value at address1 gets set to&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Licensee1 to Licensee2. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of one edition from Publisher to Licensee3. ERC20.balances gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❺ transfers the base IP to a new exclusive license holder, by calling<a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable"> ERC20.transferOwnership()</a> which changes ERC20.owner to a new address.

As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP holder. ERC20._balances indicates that addressP is the only holder of sub-licenses (3 of&nbsp;them).</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), addressP owner has 2 sub-licenses(from 3) and address1 owner has 1 sub-license (from&nbsp;0).</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then addressP, address2, and address3 owners have 1 sub-license each. The Base IP holder remains addressP&nbsp;owner.</p><p>When Completed ❺, the Base IP holder has changed, to address3 owner (not&nbsp;shown).</p>ERC20: UML Structure Diagram 3. Auto Price Discovery in ERC20&nbsp;IP <p>When ERC20 tokens represent IP licenses, then AMMs and other ERC20 &amp; DeFi tools can help tremendously with automatic price discovery, liquidity and curation. The image below illustrates.</p><p>The ERC20 IP tokens may initially be distributed in an AMM (image: top right), Dutch Auctions,<a href="https://docs.balancer.finance/smart-contracts/smart-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-faq"> LBPs</a>, or any mechanic used for traditional Initial Coin Offerings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering">ICOs</a>). These tokens may go on to secondary markets in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange"> DEXes</a> like AMMs (image: bottom right) or<a href="https://dyor-crypto.fandom.com/wiki/Centralized_Exchanges_%28CEX%29"> CEXes</a>. Being ERC20-based allows for IP index funds (<a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1339534813330628612">example</a>), IP loans, IP-backed stablecoins, and ERC20 DeFi tools applied to&nbsp;IP.</p><p>The DEXes and CEXes naturally allow for automatic price discovery and liquidity. Fees and airdrops incentivize providing liquidity. The amount of liquidity in a particular IP’s pool is a useful curation signal — the more stake the higher the quality of the IP&nbsp;asset.</p>ERC20: Structure Diagram showing automatic price discovery 5.

<p><a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/">Write the Docs Portland 2021</a> has concluded, and I wanted to share a couple of key insights and observations from the conference.</p><p>First, it was fun, a wonderfully nice group of people, and a well-organized event. Virtual conferences are new for many events and Write the Docs pulled it off really well.</p> Docs as Code <p>One repeated theme throughout the conference was technical writers embracing git-based workflows. Writers can more easily collaborate with developers when they work on documentation iteratively. Benefits include avoiding a rush to document at the last minute before a release, less out-of-band communication to understand upcoming changes, and less tooling across an organization.</p><p>The cost is that technical writers must learn git, git-based workflows, and plain-text formats, but the benefits are significant, and many writers are learning or already actively using these tools.</p><p>Write the Docs has a page with more information on <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/">Docs as Code</a>.</p> Evolutionary Documentation <p>One of the more striking talks at the conference was “Always complete, never finished” given by Daniele Procida. The <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/speakers/#speaker-daniele-procida">talk summary</a> states it best:</p><blockquote>an incremental, evolutionary way of working on large documentation tasks that makes every step, from the very first one, a value-adding improvement</blockquote><p>Large documentation refactors taken as a single task can be stressful, time-consuming, and may be out-of-date before they are complete. Instead, documentation can evolve in iterative steps that each improve the overall quality of the documentation.</p><p>Notice the iterative nature of this process and how it relates to Docs as Code. Yes, they are synergistic and work together nicely.</p> Vale: A syntax-aware linter for prose <p>As documentation matures, consistent style and tone grow in importance, and many organizations adopt a style guide or develop their own. While these rules are needed, it can be bothersome and inefficient to need to refer to the style guide manually to keep writing consistent.</p><p>One unconference session was devoted to <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale">Vale</a>, a tool that lints prose based on the rules in a style guide. I love a good code linter, and this tool looks fantastic for prose.</p><p>The Vale ecosystem seems great and includes:</p>  A GitHub action: <a href="https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action">GitHub - errata-ai/vale-action: The official GitHub Action for Vale -- install, manage, and run Vale with ease.</a>  A VSCode extension: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=errata-ai.vale-server">Vale - Visual Studio Marketplace</a>  Emacs support: <a href="https://github.com/abingham/flycheck-vale">GitHub - abingham/flycheck-vale: Flycheck integration for the vale natural language linter</a>  A nix package: <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=20.09&amp;show=vale&amp;from=0&amp;size=50&amp;sort=relevance&amp;query=vale">NixOS Search</a>  <p>It can be used on a variety of plain text formats, comments in code in many languages, and some GUI-based tools (with a paid subscription). See the <a href="https://docs.errata.ai/vale/scoping#formats">complete list of supported formats</a>.</p> So Many More <p>These were just a few of the great things from Write the Docs this year, but there were so many more! All of the talks should now be posted to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr019846MitZUEhc6apDdcQ">Write the Docs YouTube channel</a>.</p> <p>Brian is part of the Developer Success team at Fission and spends a lot of time improving our <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">guide</a> and making better code examples and other ways to help developers succeed in using Fission.</p>

 Elliptic’s analysis of blockchain transactions reveals that a Hamas-linked terrorist group has received a surge of Bitcoin donations since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza clashes. Over $100,000 in Bitcoin donations have now been received by the Al-Qassam Brigades since January 2019. We show how the transparency of the blockchain allows this activity to be monitored and disrupted.

 Compare and Contrast — IRMA vs Verifiable Credentials IRMA vs&nbsp;VC<p>Self-sovereign identity, the next step in the evolution of identity management, revolves around empowering users to own their identity and control how it is&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Given the many concerns revolving around privacy and data sharing that exist today, SSI is being increasingly seen as a potential solution for secure sharing, privacy, and interoperability in the digital world. As a result, the last few years have seen the development of many systems and frameworks to bring SSI closer to&nbsp;reality.</p><p>In this article, we will be comparing two such SSI-based systems, namely, “I Reveal My Attributes” (IRMA) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p> What is&nbsp;IRMA? <p>IRMA was founded by the Digital Security Research group at the Radboud University in the Netherlands. The aim of this group was to create open, secure, and privacy-friendly systems that would give users complete control over their identity.</p><p>This pilot project was called IRMA and it was based on the Idemix technology.</p><p>Idemix is a public-private key pair where the private key is used by the issuer to sign a credential and the public key is used by the verifier to establish that the credential is signed by the issuer and hence is authentic.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable credentials</a>, or VC in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically.</p><p>There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.   Underlying Cryptography <p>Both IRMA and VCs can use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof</a> as their cryptographic foundation, but they use different cryptographic frameworks. While IRMA uses Idemix, many VC implementations rely on the Charm framework.</p><p>Idemix is a Java library while Charm is a Python API that works well for key pairings and signature schemes. The Charm Framework uses a hybrid design that combines mathematical operations in the C language with crypto modules written in high-level languages.</p><p>When you compare the two, Charm is a more advanced crypto framework that supports rapid prototyping. It also reduces the development time and allows the components to be reused. It comes with standard APIs as well that are conducive for digital signatures and encryption.</p> Schemas <p>The schemas used by IRMA and VCs are vastly different too, as VCs use the more popular <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifiers (DIDs)</a>, a type of identifier to enable digital identity. The advantage with DIDs is that it gives users complete control over the usage of verifiable credentials, but the disadvantage is that it lends to the creation of different custom&nbsp;schemas.</p><p>Here’s how a VC schema looks&nbsp;like.</p> {<br>  "type": "<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/schema/1.0/schema.json">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-json-schemas/schema/1.0/schema.json</a>",<br>  "modelVersion": "1.0",<br>  "id": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T;id=06e126d1-fa44-4882-a243-1e326fbe21db;version=1.0",<br>  "name": "PassportCredentialSchema",<br>  "author": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T",<br>  "authored": "2018-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",<br>  "schema": {<br>    "$schema": "<a href="http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#">http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#</a>",<br>    "description": "Passport",<br>    "type": "object",<br>    "properties": {<br>      "PassportNumber": {<br>        "type": "number",<br>      }<br>       “DateofIssue": {<br>        "type": "date",<br>        }<br>        “FirstName": {<br>        "type": "string",<br>        }<br>         “LastName": {<br>        "type": "string",<br>        }<br>    },<br>    "required": ["passportNumber", “dateofIssue”, “firstName”, “lastName”],<br>    "additionalProperties": false<br>  },<br>  "proof": {<br>      "created": "2019-09-27T06:26:11Z",<br>      "creator": "did:work:MDP8AsFhHzhwUvGNuYkX7T#key-1",<br>      "nonce": "0efba23d-2987-4441-998e-23a9d9af79f0",<br>      "signatureValue": "2A7ZF9f9TWMdtgn57Y6dP6RQGs52xg2QdjUESZUuf4J9BUnwwWFNL8vFshQAEQF6ZFBXjYLYNU4hzXNKc3R6y6re",<br>      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018"<br>  }  "proof": {<br>    "type": "RsaSignature2018",<br>    "created": "2020-09-14T21:19:10Z",<br>    "proofPurpose": "authentication",<br>    "verificationMethod": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21#keys-1",<br>    <br>    "challenge": "1f44d55f-f161-4938-a659-f8026467f126",<br>    "domain": "4jt78h47fh47",<br>    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..kTCYt5      XsITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVIw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgREEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qq_PbChOMqs LfRoPsnsgxD-WUcX16dUOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPktb3rk-BuQy72IFLN25DYuNzVBAh<br>      4vGHSrQyHUGlcTwLtjPAnKb78"<br>  }<br>} <p>IRMA’s approach to schemas is a stark contrast to VC.

 How tools of IP can help creators and collectors better protect their rights and&nbsp;monetize  Summary <p>This article aims to improve understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property">Intellectual Property</a> (IP), as a tool to help <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFT</a> creators and collectors. It gives a mini backgrounder on IP, then connects IP to ERC721 NFTs at Solidity code-level implementations.</p><p>Follow-up articles explore <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">ERC20</a>, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">ERC721+ERC20</a> for NFTs &amp;&nbsp;IP.</p> 1. Introduction  1.1 “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;Bitcoin” <p>Ownership of a hundred dollar bill is straightforward: “if you hold it, you own it”. Same for a physical painting. Ownership of real-world objects is defined through physical access control [0]. This has benefits: it’s a simple mental model, it protects the owner, and transfer of ownership is&nbsp;easy.</p><p>We’re half a century into the computer era. Yet it hasn’t been easy to translate ownership of physical assets to intangible assets like electronic money or digital art. As a workaround, the world has used human-readable contracts for these intangible assets. Alas, these “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">wet-code</a>” contracts are tedious to understand, expensive, slow, and error-prone. For example, “this 100-page document says you own it”&nbsp;😬.</p><p>Then along came Bitcoin, a “<a href="https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2006/11/wet-code-and-dry.html?m=1">dry-code</a>” machine-readable approach to electronic money, with blockchain as the basis. Like real-world assets, ownership of digital assets is defined through access control. For Bitcoin this means “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnC5mFaIW3Q&amp;ab_channel=BitcoinIsrael">Your keys, your Bitcoin</a>”. This gains the benefits of real world assets: simple mental model, protects the owner, and easy transfer of ownership. It’s cheaper, faster, and less error-prone than previous “wet-code” approaches to digital assets. Digital tools can track ownership of physical assets as&nbsp;well.</p> 1.2 IP as a Tool → “Your Keys, Your&nbsp;NFT” <p>Inspired by Bitcoin, in 2013 we <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1376105737827594241">built</a> <a href="http://trent.st/content/2015-06-24%20ascribe%20whitepaper.pdf">ascribe</a> for “dry code” digital art and other creative works. ascribe leveraged Bitcoin blockchain. Our mantra was “<a href="https://medium.com/silicon-allee/art-and-tech-in-berlin-a-powerful-combination-c40e9b328f7">own digital art the way you own Bitcoin</a>.” Blockchain technology helped creators and collectors secure their work and monetize.</p><p>Early on in ascribe, we discovered that Intellectual Property (IP) was an incredibly useful toolbox to help creators and collectors protect their rights and earn a living. The language and laws of IP go back literally centuries. All the books you’ve read, music you’ve heard, and movies you’ve watched have IP language backed up by laws to protect the authors, musicians and filmmakers.</p><p>So for ascribe, we used the language of IP to make the rights for creators &amp; collectors maximally clear. It’s a powerful tool, and we leveraged it heavily. We also used <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160606190958/https://www.ascribe.io/terms/">legal contracts</a> to help bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Whereas ascribe was an early IP * blockchain project, IP * blockchain has now evolved into full-fledged <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-difficult-to-explain-fungibility-sightings-in-nfts-26bc18620f70">field</a>: NFTs. The mental model is all about access control: “your keys, your&nbsp;NFT.”</p><p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> has been my focus for several years now. It’s about sharing, buying and selling data as an asset, by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">tokenizing digital access control</a>. Since data is IP, Ocean is about data IP assets. “Your keys, your data.” In Ocean, we also leverage the language of IP and, as a bonus, legal contracts to bridge the “wet code” world’s laws of&nbsp;IP.</p> 1.4 Outline <p>We’ve realized that our experiences over the last eight years may be helpful to others in the NFT field. The aim of this post (and subsequent posts) is to help clarify. This post is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Section 2 is an IP mini-backgrounder. In it, we introduce key terms from the language of IP — copyright, exclusive rights, licenses — along with a brief history and legal implementation.</p><p>Then in sections 3 and 4, we describe what the most popular NFTs standard — <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> — is doing from a framing of IP language, and how to leverage IP law for further protection.</p>  We do this for two specific cases: single-edition ERC721 (section 3) and limited-edition ERC721 (section&nbsp;4).  For each section, we first describe definitions — how “publish”, “sub-license”, “base IP”, “sub-licensee” etc is modeled in smart contracts and license terms. Then we provide a sequence diagram to illustrate the actions, followed by a structure diagram to show system state after each action. It’s fairly technical — we found this necessary in order to have enough clarity, all with the goal of protecting rights of creators and collectors.   2. IP Mini-Backgrounder <p>This section is a mini-backgrounder on intellectual property (IP), which is all about property of the intellectual variety.</p><p>IP and Copyright Law. Rights on digital art, physical art, music, books, and data all fall under IP law, specifically copyright law [1]. The<a href="https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ip/berne/summary_berne.html"> Berne Convention</a> of<a href="https://www.wipo.int/"> WIPO</a> was signed by<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> 179 countries</a> including USA and Germany. Each country enacts its own laws according to its guidelines.</p><p>Copyright. The Convention provides creators “with the means to control how their work is used, by whom, and on what terms”. In it, the “creator of a work<a href="https://copyrighthouse.org/countries-berne-convention/"> doesn’t need to apply</a> for copyright, or to register it.” Rather, copyright automatically exists once it has been put it into “a fixed form”, e.g. as a recording on audio tape or as magnetic bits on a hard disk. However the Convention does suggest registration, to help prove that you’re the creator of the work in the event of&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Exclusive Rights. If a publishing house “buys the rights” to an author’s work, they typically get an exclusive license (a contract) to use that work for their own profit. The base IP goes from the author to the publishing house. If a music label “buys the rights” to a musician’s work, the base IP goes from the musician to the label. And so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>Sub-licenses. When you buy an e-book, you’re buying the license to read it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell 1000 copies, since your contract doesn’t include those rights. When you buy a song from iTunes, you’re buying the license to listen to it, for personal consumption. But you can’t re-sell it or play it on the radio, since you don’t have the license for&nbsp;that.</p><p>The rest of this article gets more technical. It describes what <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721">ERC721</a> code is doing from an IP perspective. We start with single-edition NFTs.</p> 2. Single-Edition ERC721 code &amp;&nbsp;IP  2.1 Definitions <p>This section describes how IP legals get implemented in Single-Edition ERC721 [3]. The two main actions are to publish and to sub-license. They’re defined, and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, i.e. copyright or initial exclusive license. This is implemented as ERC721._safeMint() at a new tokenId with to=self&nbsp;. To implement legals, metadata points to a T&amp;C stating that _safeMint() is a claim of base&nbsp;IP.  To Sub-license means transfer exclusive license to new exclusive licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom(). To implement legals, the T&amp;C states that safeTransferFrom() is a sub-licensing action that grants specific&nbsp;rights.  <p>Base IP, Base IP Holder, and Licensee are defined and represented as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Base IP means the artifact being copyrighted. Represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder means the holder of the Base IP. Represented as the the actor that did the initial “publish” action.  Sub-licensee is the holder of the sub-license. Represented as the entity that controls address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x].   2.2 Single-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example with focus on behavior. The corresponding image is below. We use a UML sequence diagram. Each arrow indicates a Solidity method call to the ERC721 contract. The origin of the arrow is the entity who initiated the call, such as publisher or licensee1. The arrows do not show value transfer, e.g. from publisher to licensee1. The UML structure diagram farther below helps to build intuition on the result of each method&nbsp;call.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls the deployed ERC721 contract’s _safeMint() method, keeping ownership to themselves (to=addressP). An ERC721 contract can hold many NFTs; therefore the publisher must specify which one (tokenId=7). The ERC721’s _owner attribute (a mapping) at tokenId=7 gets updated to addressP.</p><p>Step ❷ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Publisher to Licensee1. The publisher calls ERC721.safeTransferFrom() to send the NFT to Licensee1 (to=address1). The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p><p>Step ❸ is an (exclusive) Sub-License action from Licensee1 to Licensee2. The ERC721’s _owner attribute gets updated accordingly.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 2.3 Single-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each action. The corresponding image is below. It roughly follows the format of a UML Composite Structure Diagram&nbsp;.It focuses on which actor has which IP rights, i.e. who owns&nbsp;what.</p><p>After Step ❶ (Publish), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT hasn’t been transferred yet, then the entity at this address can be interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❷ (exclusive Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now set to address1. The address1 owner is the exclusive licensee. Since the license is exclusive, this entity is also the Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>After Step ❸ is like ❷, except now the address2 owner is exclusive licensee and Base IP&nbsp;holder.</p>Single-Edition ERC721: UML Structure Diagram 3. Limited-Edition ERC721 Code &amp;&nbsp;IP  3.1 Definitions <p>Limited-edition NFTs means there are several NFT tokens for the same base IP [4]. Each token is its own&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Each edition may be considered fungible or non-fungible:</p>  Fungible if the edition can be swapped with another edition and no one cares. For example, a digital visual artwork in a gif has 10 limited editions available and there are no serial numbers. Or an e-book novel with 1000 limited editions.  Non-fungible if a swap does matter. For example, the NFT has a history of ownership or usage (provenance) that influences the price. Or collectors assign higher value to a particular edition number (“edition 3 is more valuable than edition&nbsp;17”).  <p>Here’s the implementation using ERC721. It would be fairly similar if using <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155">ERC1155</a>; for ease of reading we will focus on&nbsp;ERC721.</p>  To Publish means to claim base IP, ready for sub-licensing of limited editions. This is implemented as one ERC721._safeMint() call for each edition. Each call has a unique tokenId input. The IP claim is being made a separate time for each call; this works assuming one address does all initial&nbsp;minting.  To Sub-license means to transfer one (of many) sub-licenses to a new licensee. This is implemented as ERC721.safeTransferFrom().  Base IP: represented by the {ERC721 address, tokenId} from the publish transactions.  Base IP holder: whoever performed the initial publish&nbsp;actions.  Sub-licensee: the owner of address ERC721._owners[tokenId=x,y,z] (example of 3 editions).   3.2 Limited-Edition ERC721: Sequence&nbsp;Diagram <p>Here’s a worked example focusing on behavior. There are 3 limited editions.</p><p>Step ❶ is a Publish action. The publisher calls _safeMint() method three separate times, specifying tokenId=7, 8, and 9 for each&nbsp;edition.</p><p>Step ❷ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7, from Publisher to Licensee1. The limited edition for tokenId=7 is sub-licensed to Licensee1 (address1). This method call is a non-exclusive sub-license; compare to an exclusive sub-license for the same call in the single-edition ERC721&nbsp;case.</p><p>Step ❸ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=7 from Licensee1 to Licensee2.</p><p>Step ❹ is a Sub-License action of the edition with tokenId=8.</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 3.3 Limited-Edition ERC721: Structure Diagram <p>Here’s the same worked example, showing system state after each&nbsp;action.</p><p>When Completed ❶ (Publish), the ERC721._owners at tokenId=7, 8, and 9 are set to the publisher’s address (addressP). As the NFT editions haven’t been transferred yet, the addressP owner is interpreted as the base IP&nbsp;holder.</p><p>When Completed ❷ (Sub-License), the value for ERC721._owners at tokenId=7 is now address1, meaning the address1 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP). There isn’t an explicit way to do an exclusive sub-license of the base IP. This has a different interpretation than single-edition ERC721, where the same method call means an exclusive sub-licensing of the Base&nbsp;IP.</p><p>When Completed ❸ ❹, then the address2 owner is sub-sub-licensee for edition tokenId=7, and the address3 owner is sub-licensee for edition tokenId=8. The Base IP holder remains the Publisher (addressP).</p>Limited-Edition ERC721: UML Sequence&nbsp;Diagram 4. Conclusion <p>This article aimed to improve understanding of Intellectual Property (IP), as a tool to help creators and collectors. It gave a mini backgrounder on IP, then connected IP to ERC721 NFTs in Solidity implementations.</p><p>Subsequent articles cover IP*blockchain implementations in ERC20 (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">link</a>) and ERC721+ERC20 (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">link</a>).</p> Acknowledgements <p>Thanks to the following people who contributed to this article and follow-on articles in this series.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Google has launched <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai" title="Vertex AI">Vertex AI</a>, its fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) platform for the enterprise. It tackles the challenge of operationalizing AI/ML projects with automated pipelines, accessibility for business users, data scientists, and ML engineers, and pre-trained APIs for speech, vision, video, and more. The divide between technical know-how and precise customization and implementation of ML models is shrinking rapidly, thanks to AI Service Clouds.</p>
 Fully Managed will be a Distinguishing Feature 
<p>Fully managed will become a distinguishing feature of AI Service Clouds. Although attention is primarily given to the AI capabilities of AI Service Clouds, such as plug-and-play language, cognitive, and prediction capabilities, the implementation of these is simplified with managed services. For a wide variety of personas to collaborate on an AI project, a few things have to be in place: a user interface that abstracts away complexity from reliable AutoML that assists in data preparation, model selection, feature engineering, testing, validating, and beyond. The computational effort to power AutoML for model development, let alone implementation, is accessed most realistically from the cloud. The requirements are many: data storage of training and operational data, flexible training requirements like distributed, spot, or batch, model versioning, and much more. AI Service Clouds that are managed services abstract away the complexity of running AI/ML projects and hand off managing the computation-intensive tasks.</p>
<p>AI Service Clouds is an emerging market space, with much emphasis on AutoML, automated pipelines, pre-build models accessible via API, and making AI/ML accessible to business users without formal training in the field. But the computational effort that is required to make MLOps appear so effortless remains a fundamental part of this new wave of enterprise AI.</p>
<p></p>
 Our Recommendations 
<p>Be aware of your data: Your data has gravity, and whether intentional or not, the place where your data resides has an influence on the vendors and services you use. Especially in the AI/ML field which is so data-reliant, be strategic about planning where and how data is stored <a></a>so that it can serve your use cases in the best way possible. Security and privacy controls of your ML data should be considered on-prem and especially in the cloud. Google Cloud Vertex AI does provide additional security measures for sensitive data, such as encryption and dataset aggregation and obfuscation.</p>
<p>Be aware of your use cases: It’s okay to dream big when it comes to AI/ML, but don’t let the dream steer strategy. Always consider what the business needs are, then consider which technologies or revised processes could serve it. Don’t pursue AI for its own sake.</p>
<p>Be aware of who your AI/ML project impacts: If there is any time to implement multi-stakeholder practices, it is with your AI/ML projects. You will need a diverse development team to ask the right questions: How was the data that we use for training collected? Is it representative of your customers, or does it identify or alienate any group? Does the data adequately meet the needs of the business case? What communication strategies with end users are in place?</p>
<p>By automating and abstracting away complexity, AI Service Clouds make diverse teams more feasible, offer ready-made MLOps tools to the enterprise, and bring flexibility to the computation question. Read the Market Compass: AI Service Clouds to learn more.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce Anonyome Labs is listed in the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs joins&nbsp;355&nbsp;other&nbsp;qualified organizations in&nbsp;the&nbsp;2021&nbsp;compendium of&nbsp;privacy tech vendors. This is a significant increase from the 44 vendors listed in the inaugural report in 2017.&nbsp;The number of&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories&nbsp;is also higher in 2021: now 11 categories split across two groups&nbsp;—&nbsp;Privacy program management and&nbsp;Enterprise privacy management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this growth in both vendor numbers and&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories as evidence of the explosion in market awareness of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;of&nbsp;the vital need to protect&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;among consumers and enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAPP agrees, saying these changes represent as a “metamorphosis” in the privacy landscape in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the IAPP released its 2017 report, it described the privacy technology marketplace as being “on the precipice of a major evolutionary shift”. You’ll recall the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;was about a year off becoming law and the marketplace had some early tech vendors.&nbsp;(<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;was around at this time—we were established in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">2014</a>&nbsp;through the pioneering foresight of our early founders—but&nbsp;we&nbsp;were still developing our early products.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2017,&nbsp;the world has&nbsp;seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/">California Consumer Privacy Act&nbsp;2018</a>, Brazil’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-vs-lgpd/">General Data Protection Law2018</a>, and other privacy laws around the world, including plenty of&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;movement at the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">state level in the US</a>.&nbsp;This raft of&nbsp;new&nbsp;compliance requirements has brought&nbsp;a corresponding increase in the demand for privacy tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, the rise of privacy&nbsp;tech was the focus of an expert panel at this year’s Data Privacy Day. Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">8 Key Takeaways From the ‘Rise of Privacy Tech’ Panel With Our Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley</a>&nbsp;for some considered insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In releasing the&nbsp;5th&nbsp;edition of the&nbsp;Privacy Tech Vendor Report&nbsp;in&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;the IAPP&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/">observes</a>: “Privacy tech has undergone a paradigm shift over the past five years, affecting everything from the development of&nbsp;privacy tech tools to the attitude toward privacy tech vendors. The five-year mark of the report’s existence is perhaps the proper time to look at how far the privacy tech market has gone and where it will go in the future”.&nbsp;(We’ve been thinking about the future of privacy for a while. Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">10-year forecast</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 2021 report, Anonyome Labs is listed under the Privacy Information Managers category&nbsp;as the best fit, but we acknowledge that our enterprise offering,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, is difficult to categorize given its unique depth and breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;is&nbsp;a scalable developer platform that provides companies with the necessary tools to build privacy and&nbsp;cybersafety&nbsp;solutions into new and existing products for their end users. The&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform’s public APIs and SDKs offer developers various privacy-oriented capabilities including private telephony and email services, end-to-end encrypted communications, private browsing, password management, virtual card payments. These capabilities are available for mobile, desktop, and web applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Inside&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>At the heart of&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform is our&nbsp;innovative digital identity concept called the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo</a>. A Sudo is a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a real, alternative identity that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile and manage it.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudos are the&nbsp;centerpiece&nbsp;of our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a> complete business toolkit for rapidly producing branded cybersecurity solutions, and our exemplar consumer privacy app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank">MySudo</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When enterprises access&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform to rapidly produce branded cybersecurity solutions, they can use the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">menu of high value privacy tools</a> delivered as easy-to-use APIs and SDKs.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>When giving the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/">Engineers Australia</a> Annual Informatics Lecture, our co-CEO and CTO, <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, spoke on <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and the tech driving it this <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>, particularly identity and anonymous profiles online. Paul shared that in developing the&nbsp;Sudo, we wanted to do something that hasn’t been done before. And that’s what the global fight for privacy will demand from us and others in this space, as well as any company that engages with user data: out of the box thinking and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy by design</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Before the Internet was born in 1983, computer networks lacked a standard method of communicating with one another. In the years since — as online communications have grown interwoven with our daily lives and revolutionised the world we live in — there remains a crucial thing we still don’t have a standardised way of talking about in the digital world: you.</p>



<p>Without a standardised way of identifying people online, websites began to use local accounts with usernames and passwords. You likely have several of these that you rely on in your daily life: your Amazon account, your email account, your Netflix account. These sites also began storing usage information, personal data and data about the user obtained through 3rd party sources in the user account. This approach created&nbsp; so-called siloed identities.</p>



<p>As the internet has grown to encompass everything from your private inbox to your grocery orders, your workout regimen and your finances, your personal data is now collected and stored in dozens of places outside your control. You — the digital you that is — are a string of accounts where third parties hold your information on their servers.</p>



<p>This creates big problems. Your data resides in silos that are potentially vulnerable to hackers, data leakage and other privacy breaches. Just ask the 338 million customers of Marriott Hotels whose personal information, including passport numbers, were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54748843">leaked</a> between 2014 and 2018. In 2020 alone, the number of personal records <a href="https://www.riskbasedsecurity.com/2021/01/21/new-research-no-of-records-exposed-increased-141-in-2020/#download">compromised</a> in data breaches grew 141 percent to 38 billion, according to security firm Risk Based Security (RSB). The other problem is that the usage of this data, even if it is secure, cannot be controlled — the user even doesn’t know what is stored where and has no direct access. Not to mention that this approach requires a separate account for every service you use, leaving you with dozens or even hundreds of passwords and logins (remember, you should never reuse a password!), multiplying the spread of your personal data across the internet and contributing to a less-than-satisfactory user experience. What’s more, this situation leaves internet users vulnerable to phishing and other scams that trick people into giving away their personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rise of&nbsp; internet giants like Google and Facebook came the idea of federated identity. That’s when third parties allow you to log in to their site or app using, for example, your Gmail account. If you go to a website and use the “sign in with” functionality, known as “single sign-on”, you’re using a federated identity — Google or Facebook are playing the role of identity provider.&nbsp; In such a setup, the multi-account problem may have been solved, but new, serious problems arise. The companies that dominate the federated identity space, basically acting as middlemen for your digital existence, have huge economic incentive to collect as much data about your online interactions as possible — and mine it for profit. Google, for example, has been accused of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49593830">secretly tracking</a> its own users in Europe, and was fined for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/google-youtube-fine-ftc.html">illegally harvesting data</a> from children in the US. A less obvious issue is that the providers of single sign-on services also have control over where you are allowed to use your identity and can potentially deny its usage according to their will, be it economic interest, opaque&nbsp; ethical principles or governmental pressure. Twitter can ban you forever, Instagram can close your account, Facebook can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/01/facebooks-australian-news-wipeout-showed-it-can-delete-our-history-at-any-time">wipe your page</a>. You could say that they control your digital existence.</p>



<p>Thankfully, a better way is emerging. It’s a third kind of online identity where your personal data is neither strewn across an inefficient patchwork of silos nor controlled by a big company that mines your personal data for money.</p>



<p>It’s called self-sovereign identity (SSI).</p>



 What is SSI? 



<p>Self-sovereign identity is the next major step in the evolution of digital identity. It closes the gap on inefficiencies and privacy concerns around the ways you make yourself known online by putting you in control.</p>



<p>First, here’s the theory behind it.</p>



<p>Basically, SSI means a person, or an organisation, completely owns, controls and manages their identity online. You are your own identity provider — there is no one else who can claim to “provide” your identity for you because it’s intrinsically yours.</p>



<p>In a more formal way we can say that SSI follows 10 key principles, <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">as first outlined by Christopher Allen</a>:</p>



  SSI provides an independent existence and absolute control for its users, who hold the access to their own data. That means no intermediaries owning or sifting through your data: it belongs to you.  SSI is transparent (so that you can understand any system or algorithm involved), interoperable (so it integrates well with other systems) and portable (meaning no vendor or device lock-in).&nbsp;  SSI offers persistence (the identities will last for as long as you want them to last… no need to worry about Facebook deleting your Instagram account) and protection (erring always on the side of protecting individuals’ freedoms and rights).&nbsp;  SSI prioritises consent (users must always agree to how their identity is being used — whether that’s to disclose or restrict data) and minimisation (you should only disclose the data that you need to, supporting privacy as much as you can.)&nbsp;  



<p>To this practical list, <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi</a> adds an 11th principle of our own:</p>



  SSI values usability — it’s&nbsp; easy to use, adopt and understand. There are no complex bells and whistles, just the means to share and use the information you want, when you want, and it’s easy to carry around with you.  







<p>From the user perspective, practical SSI looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the user, you possess a digital identity wallet which stores the data related to your identity and interacts with other SSI-enabled systems. The wallet can be in the form of an app on your mobile phone or a web-based service or, often, a combination of both.</p>



<p>Your personal data is stored in the wallet in the form of verifiable credentials, rather than on centralised servers. It’s kept under the user’s sovereign control and literally in the user’s possession. A verifiable credential itself is a representation of data which is cryptographically tamper-proof and traceable to its origin (more on that later).</p>



<p>What sort of personal data can be stored in the identity wallet? Any statement about you that can be represented digitally! This could include digital representations of personal ID cards, education diplomas, login credentials, property deeds, corporate badges, vaccination passports, COVID-19 test results, any transaction records and much, much more. Using the wallet, you can selectively present some of these credentials to an interested third party, either some of the time or all of the time. You can record your consent to share data with others, and easily facilitate that sharing. Your data is persistent and not reliant on any single third party to be stored or forwarded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we have the basic components, let’s look at the interactions they enable. In the below diagram, we have a mental model for how identity can be managed in a way that delivers on the SSI principles. It is known as the SSI Trust Triangle.</p>







<p>Let’s walk through this diagram step by step.</p>



<p>An issuer makes claims or assertions about a user. These claims are bundled together into verifiable credentials and given to the user, who stores them in their digital wallet. From there, they can decide which verifiers they want to present these credentials to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, let’s say the issuer in this case is a university. The assertion they want to make about you is that you’re a graduate and that you have an MBA. So they issue a verifiable credential that you can store in your identity wallet. Now, let’s say you’re applying for a job at a financial agency. As part of your application, you’re able to prove that you have an MBA by making your credential visible to the company you’re applying to. Note that the verifier — in this case the prospective employer — does not need to contact the university to confirm the authenticity of the diploma credential. Conversely, neither the university, nor anyone else, will know which companies you are applying to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many real-world business interactions involve a similar flow of data.</p>



<p>Need a fishing license? Rather than go to a government office, with SSI you could apply using a digital driver’s license. Want to sign up for an industry conference? Use a digital work ID issued by your employer. Want to rent a flat? Confirm your ID, your proof of solvency and your employment status to your new landlord by presenting the relevant credentials in your wallet.</p>



<p>If you were looking carefully at the diagram you might have noticed that it also has “blockchain” in it — we haven’t mentioned that yet! Read on to learn the role distributed ledger technologies play in SSI and why they work so well together.</p>



 What’s the Technology Behind SSI? 



<p>SSI relies on modern cryptography and decentralisation to make the things described above work.</p>



<p>The core idea is to give users free, unique, machine-readable, user-controlled, persistent and anonymous identifiers that are decoupled from the “personal data” about the user they “identify”. These are called decentralised identifiers, or DIDs. This might sound intimidatingly jargonistic, but the idea of identifiers is of course not new — email addresses, phone numbers, profile IDs and all sorts of other sensitive numbers have a long tradition of being (mis-)used for such purposes. The difference is that they are neither free, persistent, anonymous nor user-controlled.</p>



<p>DIDs can not only be generated&nbsp; for people, but also for organisations, objects, digital documents and more. Every participant in the SSI ecosystem needs at least one, but you can also have more than one DID in the same way that you might have one email address for work and one for personal use. Each DID is cryptographically linked to a secret key that only the DID owner knows, along with a corresponding public key that other users can use to verify claims made by the DID owner. Aside from this, DIDs are anonymous: they don’t contain or reveal any information about their owner.</p>



<p>The blockchain is used to perpetuate this linkage in a way that guarantees that the data associated to the link can be changed by the owner of the DID, cannot be maliciously manipulated and persists forever. (NB: this is of course based on the assumption that a decentralised structure with many autonomous nodes will not go down, as a one single company could. There are also SSI architectures that work without&nbsp; distributed ledgers.)</p>



<p>The second pillar of SSI is the concept of verifiable credentials, or VCs, which can be thought of as a “file format” for storing the claims about an entity which guarantees the authenticity and integrity of the data. They also come with useful features like selective disclosure of claims, Zero Knowledge Proofs, and semantic overlays that do not have analogue alternatives. For now, though, all you need to remember is that a VC contains real-world relatable data about a thing or person — the credential subject — and that it is linked to the DIDs of the issuer and the subject and is tamper-proof.</p>



<p>The main function of your identity wallet is to manage the user’s private keys, store VCs about the user securely and enable safe communication with other identity wallets, in order to exchange VCs and data derived from them in a way that protects your privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever you need to disclose information to a third party, your wallet will let you pick the relevant data attributes from different credentials and combine them with the DIDs of the corresponding issuers, as well as your own DID and a cryptographic signature. This is called a verifiable presentation (VP). From here, the VP can be transferred to the verifier, who, based on the cryptographic signature in the VP, is able to independently verify two things:</p>



  The data contained in the issuer’s claims have not been changed, and  the person who presented the VP is the same person about whom the issuer originally made the claim.  



<p>Of course, this is just an overview and does not cover important aspects such as security, revocation of credentials and governance structure. In the meantime, the <a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi Labs</a> and the SSI community continue to explore and develop these topics. Expect blog posts on them soon!&nbsp;</p>



 The Future of Your Identity 



<p>It won’t happen overnight, but the move away from conventional siloed and federated identities is already underway, giving people more control over their lives as well as more convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, SSI projects exist that:</p>



  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-refugee-funds-idUSKCN1T1025">Help refugees</a> prove their identities and credentials in their new homeland.  Onboard <a href="https://www.evernym.com/onfido-deloitte/">new customers</a> at major financial institutions.  Allow you to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/iata-travel-pass/index.html">present Covid-19 tests and vaccination records</a> when you travel.  



<p>The possibilities for the technology are virtually endless. Policymakers see this, too: The European Union is developing its own European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework (ESSIF), and has invested in companies developing SSI projects and platforms.</p>



<p>The benefits of&nbsp; adopting SSI are also clear: increased privacy, fewer data breaches, and more efficient administration of business and government, which helps in the process of wealth creation. At this point, it’s no longer a matter of if, but when.&nbsp;</p>

 Key insights about scaffolding mental wealth and humane development in the 21st&nbsp;century Drivers of mental health and wellbeing and the investment classes required to build mental&nbsp;wealth<blockquote>This is the second in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #2 is a preview of our international portfolio around mental wealth in Sweden, Dubai, England and South Korea as well as some of the learnings that are coming out of it, externally and internally.</blockquote>Screenshot from the last DM Download on mental&nbsp;wealth What is mental&nbsp;wealth? <p>Remaking our institutional, environmental and cultural contexts will be essential to the development of people’s cognitive, emotional, and social capacities. In a time of complexity and uncertainty, these capacities provide foundational infrastructure for our 21st- and 22nd-century society and economy. We call this societal scale intangible infrastructure — Mental Wealth and scaffolding this will be of the highest priority during our nascent rebuilding phase after COVID-19.</p><p>However, already four years ago Dark Matter Labs started exploring Mental Wealth’s relations to our build environment, our ways of learning, the technological advancement, society’s changing demographics, the development of our ecological systems and how our deep codes (financing, contracting, policy making, regulating, governing) impact these. Below we share a summary and key insights of various streams of work on the ground and we invite you to join the continued conversation and exploration.</p> Invisible Landscapes: <br>We Are&nbsp;They <p>We Are They was an exhibition by DML as part of the Invisible Landscapes series at the RA in 2018. The animation is based around the idea of the built environment as an infrastructure for health and wellbeing, and tries to outline how technology is allowing us to both understand and quantify the effects of the modern city, as well as how we might democratize the power to analyse and update&nbsp;it.</p> Logic Model of ‘Viable* conditions into thriving&nbsp;society” <p>*viability: ability to work as intended or to succeed/ability to continue to exist or develop as a living&nbsp;being</p><p>Our shared timeline to become aware of and act for our planetary future is limited and we realise the need for a radically different thesis in order to unlock our current lock-ins*. Our current version of the world has systems optimised for minimum viability for the whole and maximum viability for the few. For instance, The average income of the top 10% in Sweden, was 6.3 times higher than that of the bottom 10%.* In an age of complexity and uncertainty we recognise the need for a multi-dimensional and multi-actor transition that sees the unprecedented opportunity to create a hyper-viable world. The fundamentals of this transition will be rooted in the way we realise and recalibrate the values on which our ecosystem of relationships is based on. Humane relationships that rely on trust and our sense-making ability to separate signals from noise. In this sense, Viable Cities and Dark Matter Labs have developed the logic models of hyper viability to understand multi dimensional conditions of humane thriving and viable&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Logic model:</p><p>We often use a logic model to understand complex relationships between resources, activities and impacts and to comprehend the underlying logic behind visible data. In other words, the logic model tends to fail (despite its usefulness), because there are always gaps in details &amp; interrelational logics. The logic model of ‘hyper viability’ had various iterations:</p>  The 1st logic model identified three key economies: technology, health and natural systems at the centre of transitions towards a thriving society. There are differences between dimensions of time and speed in each&nbsp;economy.  The 2nd logic model explored key trends and drivers influencing economies impacting humane thriving.  The 3rd logic model discovered that transitions require tapping into multiple layers of the system by understanding new forms of relationships — to self, others, nature and the future, instead of putting humane development as the ultimate aim of a thriving&nbsp;society.  The 4th logic model proposed that the transition towards a viable thriving society requires a thriving life for all within planetary boundaries. This requires a fundamental shift in the way we understand and make sense of our interconnected ecosystem, ranging from our relationships, culture, institutions, psychology/sociology and environment to technology.  <p>In order to collectively move towards a thriving society, we need to understand what kinds of transition capacities and capabilities we need to build. The 5th version of the viability logic model is in the making, which emphasises the need to enable our shared sensemaking, innovation and democratic fitness capacity and capabilities towards transition, alongside an investment into our underlying human development contexts.</p> Mind//Shift: <br>Towards a 21st Century Caring&nbsp;Economy <p>Our 21st century will require us to look at mental health and wellbeing beyond treatment, to systemically embrace prevention and most importantly enable thriving. In 2019 Dark Matter Labs joined the creation of <a href="http://www.mindshift.health/">MIND//SHIFT</a> to better understand and drive deep code experimentation that address Sweden’s most important intangible infrastructure for long-term sustainable development — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/building-mental-wealth-34441f638e3b">Mental Wealth</a>. For advanced knowledge economies where high levels of cognitive, emotional and social functioning are a key advantage, looking after this infrastructure is critical to ensure that people can be creative, productive and imaginative in a rapidly changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>But how do we work towards rebuilding people’s cognitive, emotional, and social functioning when COVID-19 has triggered increases in <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/14-05-2020-substantial-investment-needed-to-avert-mental-health-crisis">depression rates</a>, <a href="https://ki.se/en/nasp/the-coronavirus-risk-for-increased-suicide-and-self-harm-in-the-society-after-the-pandemic">suicides</a>, <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/4/statement-ed-phumzile-violence-against-women-during-pandemic?gclid=CjwKCAiAsaOBBhA4EiwAo0_AnHQc3UlX2TiO7ktE0pmu8edO0KPJwPrfz-jkreF1WkGz37JRJnPkKxoCbJcQAvD_BwE">domestic violence</a>, and <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/government-society-unemployment-covid19/">unemployment</a>? How do we rebuild public good and the ability to imagine another future when hope seem lost? These are the challenges we are facing as we embark on a year of experimenting and campaigning together with the our partners at MIND//SHIFT.</p>Ecosystem for local experimentation RewirEd: <br>Rethinking Education Models and Learning Environments <p>The project involves partners based in Dubai, but the reach (i.e. experimentation) will involve multiple countries. <a href="https://rewired2021.com/">RewirEd</a> stands for “Rewiring education for a prosperous and sustainable future” and we have been developing this global platform for education with our team in Dubai — <a href="https://radicle.studio/">Radicle</a>. In the past year, we have engaged with various stakeholders in education (and beyond) to develop a <a href="https://rewired.kumu.io/rewiring-nodes-in-the-education-system">system map</a> charting the interconnected issues in education and human development. Drawing on these insights, we have begun to develop a set of provocations that would serve as both an anchor and trigger for collective action towards education systems&nbsp;change.</p>On the left: Rewired System Map, In the middle: Rewired Provocation &amp; Experiments, On the right: Rewired Provocations &amp; Experiments v.2<p>There are 6 provocation areas relating to: sustainability, well-being, lifelong learning, ‘humane’ education, coalition building and education financing. The first four areas prompt us to imagine — if we put the human being at the centre, and ask what kind of conditions and support do we need in order for humans (and other beings) to collectively thrive — they would revolve&nbsp;around:</p><p>1. Learning with Nature: building more capacity for consciousness and action on issues of sustainability, as well as incorporating wisdom from indigenous communities and orienting schools towards principles of circular&nbsp;economy</p><p>2. Well-being in Education: measuring mental, physical, emotional health and making them a part of critical school outcomes and community objectives</p><p>3. Learning Beyond School: creating new incentives and infrastructures for lifelong learning and learning beyond the boundaries of the school — such as in communities and&nbsp;cities</p><p>4. Humane Education: nurturing humane values and capacities such as relational intelligence, creativity, empathy, storytelling and sensemaking</p><p>The last two areas are centred on the how — “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?”</p><p>5. Collaboration for Impact: representing the need for cross-sector coalitions, innovation partnerships, and mechanisms to ensure collective commitment.</p><p>6. Novel Financial Infrastructures: creating new incentive mechanisms, innovative funding modalities, and decision-making apparatuses that can allow actors in the system to pursue radical transformations.</p><p>Main partners: <a href="https://www.dubaicares.ae/">Dubai Cares</a>, <a href="https://www.expo2020dubai.com/">Expo 2020&nbsp;Dubai</a></p> Key insights   Provocations must address both the what and the how. Many of our ideas are centred on the what — proposing new learning models, focus &amp; content — however, it is equally important to address the question, “how can we create the conditions necessary for large-scale, system transformation?” because this capacity at the system level needs to be nurtured in order for change to&nbsp;happen.  Radical imagination requires a legitimate foundation. System mapping process engaging multiple stakeholders enables discovering, analysing, cross-validating the challenges together, and strengthens the credibility in the process. This foundation builds legitimacy and reinforces radical imagination.  Through conversations and research it has become clear that the taxonomy of mental health is largely associated with treatment, failure to treat and the clinical space of operation. This reality has structurally limited our capacity to systemically perceive and allocate resources to preventative initiatives and perhaps more critically thriving.  It is often said that we make what we measure. If this is the case, there is a risk that investment in mental wealth could be under-prioritised as a result of missing metrics. Without the metrics that look at mental wealth in a systemic way, we lack the data to build a case. More importantly, we are deprived of the ability to account for, drive, and value the co-beneficial results and spillover effects of a mental wealth portfolio.  Building the human capacity to collaborate horizontally is central to building mental wealth, at the same time as it is dependent on our mental wealth. Without developing people’s social and emotional capacity, it becomes difficult to unlock complex collaboration. It is necessary, therefore, to design capacity-building processes that incorporate social and emotional training. Without it, we will struggle to implement co-beneficial solutions where the human is no longer optimised to be a ‘bad robot’ but, rather, a highly cognitive, emotional, and social&nbsp;being.   From the Inside Out: <br>Our Internal approach to Human Development and Wellbeing <p>We are in the process of exploring what mental wealth means for us as an organisation and how that can be realised and nurtured in our context of increased uncertainty and psychologically demanding work. We are hoping to share a blog post with our take aways and learning towards the end of the&nbsp;year.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this DM Note, please also read <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-1-7ec5cfb1c093">DM Note #1 here</a>, follow us on Medium for more to come and “clap” the article to show appreciation.

He added that the world already has multiple reserve currencies including the dollar, the euro and the Japanese&nbsp;yen.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“For crypto assets to be a significant risk to central banks, there needs to be a considerable amount of currency substitution,” Mancini said, which in this context means countries would have to use a (theoretically) more stable cryptocurrency instead or in addition to the local currency.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2021-lael-brainard">Fed’s Brainard Breaks Down CBDC Policy Considerations — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-cbdc-economic-retaliation-consensus-2021">CBDC May Give China ‘Leeway for Economic Retaliation’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/imf-chief-more-than-one-reserve-currency-stable">IMF Official: ‘A World With More Than One Reserve Currency Is a More Stable World’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-brian-brooks-digital-dollar">Brian Brooks: Digital Dollar ‘More a Discussion Than a Reality’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/jared-polis-colorado-governor-consensus-2021">Gov.

DeFi&nbsp;rising <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-8-questions-ethereum-andrew-keys">DARMA Capital’s Andrew&nbsp;Keys</a>:</p><blockquote>[Decentralized finance] has over $100 billion in [total value locked] with Ethereum settling $1.5 trillion of transactions in Q1 ’21&nbsp;… actual capital deployment is happening right now. Last month, [European Investment Bank], [Goldman Sachs] and [Société Générale] had to spend ether in order to issue a bond. Those entities needed ether for operating expenses. It’s happening right&nbsp;now.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">CMT Digital co-founder and CEO Colleen Sullivan</a> on why Chicago is becoming a DeFi&nbsp;hotspot:</p><blockquote>She puts the Chicago situation down to New York’s BitLicense, the state’s regulatory framework that debuted in 2015 and requires startups to obtain a license for cryptocurrency activities. It got 22 applications in its first round, while 15 companies closed down. Between 2015 and 2020, only 25 firms were approved. New York’s loss was Chicago’s gain and the result has turned the Illinois city into a hotbed of crypto collaboration.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">BlockFi CEO Zac Prince</a> on the appeal of&nbsp;yields:</p><blockquote>“If you try to explain how the blockchain works, or why bitcoin has value, or some of the other more complex and in-the-weeds topics to folks when they’re on their journey into the crypto ecosystem, they might struggle to wrap their heads around it,” he said. “Everybody knows what an interest rate is. And everybody knows that earning 8.6% on something is better than earning&nbsp;0.2%.”</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>“The fact that everyone can participate in affecting what the interest rate will be in these markets is a very big thing because, traditionally, big interest-rate movements have been decided by the banking industry; for example, by a few people sitting down with a room in London,” said Kulechov.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-8-questions-ethereum-andrew-keys">Consensus 2021: 8 Questions for Ethereum’s Andrew Keys — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/defi-chicago-rising">DeFi Is Rising in Chicago — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/high-yield-crypto-ecosystem-offers-alternative-to-low-interest-rates">High-Yield Crypto Ecosystem Offers Alternative to Low Interest Rates — CoinDesk</a>   4.

Half of Top Shot’s users have paid for packs or in trades, and between 150,000 to 250,000 log in every&nbsp;day.</blockquote><blockquote>The sterling growth numbers come as the broader NFT market gradually cools down from the breakneck highs of early 2021. Top Shot was no exception: desirable moments of top National Basketball Association stars traded for hundreds of thousands of dollars during the peak NFT&nbsp;craze.</blockquote><blockquote>“The headlines are always, you know, ‘LeBron sells for $200,000 or $300,000,” Gharegozlou said, “but the reality is, out of the four and a half-ish million transactions on the marketplace in the past few months, over 3 million have been less than&nbsp;$50.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">Christie’s Noah&nbsp;Davis</a>:</p><blockquote>“This is the art world’s Napster, potentially, because it could be that disruptive to the way people do business,” said Noah Davis, Christie’s point person on NFTs, referring to the music-sharing service. The British auction house announced in February it would accept ether, the Ethereum blockchain’s native currency, as a payment method, right before Beeple’s watershed digital artwork went under the hammer. The artwork was eventually sold for $69 million to Singapore-based blockchain entrepreneur MetaKovan, aka Vignesh Sundaresan.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/dapper-labs-nba-top-shot-has-crossed-the-million-user-mark">Dapper Labs’ NBA Top Shot Has Crossed the Million-User Mark — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nfts-are-the-art-worlds-napster-says-exec-at-christies-auction-house">NFTs Are ‘Art World’s Napster’: Christie’s Auction House Exec — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/gary-vaynerchuk-consensus-2021">Gary Vaynerchuk: The Next Mickey Mouse Could Be an NFT — CoinDesk</a>   5.

 Introduction <p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralised data exchange protocol which enables data providers to securely sell their datasets by maintaining their data privacy (using our Compute-to-Data technology). Data consumers can discover and purchase datasets to train their AI algorithms on that&nbsp;data.</p><p>OCEAN is the reserve currency and utility token of Ocean Protocol. It has multiple utilities today and we are adding many more utilities. This article is a compilation of DeFi utilities of OCEAN, focused on staking and liquidity provision opportunities for OCEAN&nbsp;holders.</p><p>If you want to learn about OCEAN dynamics and value accrual, please refer to the post <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">Ocean Token&nbsp;Model</a>.</p> OCEAN Utilities in&nbsp;DeFi  1. Staking / Liquidity Provision  Ocean Market <p>OCEAN holders can stake their OCEAN on datasets in <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> and become stakers. By staking OCEAN, stakers receive guaranteed swap fees from subsequent staking, unstaking and data purchase activities that happen in their staked data pools. By staking on promising datasets, stakers also speculate on attractive future returns on their staked tokens. But needless to say, such staking opportunities comes with some risks. For more info on staking opportunities and risks in Ocean Market, check out <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-staking-on-data-in-ocean-market-3d8e09eb0a13">this blog&nbsp;post</a>.</p> POP! Town <p>OCEAN holders can provide their tokens as single-sided liquidity onto POP! Town’s <a href="https://new.pop.town/">Mutual Liquidity Pool (MLP) marketplace</a>. By participating in the MLP as a farmer, holders will receive rewards in 3 tokens: POP!, OCEAN, and ALBT. In addition, should users experience Impermanent Loss (IL), a portion of it will be mitigated through POP!’s unique Rebalancing Mechanism.</p>  LP Mining Rewards: APY &gt; ~100% at the time of&nbsp;writing.  Provide liquidity on POP! Town&nbsp;<a href="http://new.pop.town">here</a>.   Balancer   Swap Fees earned per transaction: Vary for different pools.

Lend/Borrow  OpenDAO <p>OCEAN holders can borrow ODollars by locking their OCEAN at 0% interest in OpenDAO’s <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. These ODollars can then be swapped with USDC, which OCEAN holders can use however they&nbsp;want.</p>  OCEAN has to be locked into the contract to mint ODollars. Minimum collateral ratio is 1.25 but for safety against black swan events, OpenDAO platform applies collateral ratio of &gt;2. This means that even if OCEAN price decreases by 50% in a day or an hour etc., your OCEAN will be unlikely toreach liquidation point, and you could lock more OCEAN to increase your position or pay ODollars back to unlock your&nbsp;OCEAN.  Locked OCEAN can be unlocked anytime by locking the account by paying owed ODollars back into the <a href="https://odollar.opendao.io/">ODollar portal</a>. Those ODollars are burnt and taken out of circulation to ensure that each ODollar has sufficient value (OCEAN) backing&nbsp;them.  On March 31, 2022 theODollar contract will expire — meaning that anyone holding ODollars can unlock equivalent locked OCEAN (in dollar terms) by burning their ODollars.   C.R.E.A.M. Finance <p>OCEAN was listed on <a href="https://app.cream.finance/">C.R.E.A.M. Finance</a> recently. We are currently working on increasing OCEAN collateral factor on Cream Finance. Once done, OCEAN holders will be able to deposit their OCEAN and earn yields or can stake OCEAN as collateral and borrow against&nbsp;it.</p> Conclusion <p>Today, OCEAN holders can actively participate in theDeFi ecosystem by:</p>  Staking, lending, and/or borrowing to earn attractive yields;  Providing liquidity to earn swap fees and LP mining&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Rest assured that we are actively working on bringing more utilities to OCEAN. We sincerely thank you for being an important part of the Ocean Ecosystem and a proud OCEAN&nbsp;holder.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/where-to-stake-your-ocean-12faf60c93fa">Where to Stake your OCEAN</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hill">Richard Hill</a></p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated IT transformation in many ways. Lessons learned, among other things, is that IT software architecture must be highly flexible and scalable to handle the unforeseen tsunami waves of network traffic and flexible enough to address cyber-attacks in areas least expected or prepared, such as potential vulnerabilities in communication applications like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Trello. Organization's sudden imperative to shore up cybersecurity systems such as Access Management became strikingly apparent.</p>
 Zero Trust 
<p>During the covid-19 pandemic, the in-office workforce abruptly shifted to a work-at-home environment opening the door to many potential attack vectors. Physicians, too, used their personal computers and mobile devices to help care for patients as they did in the medical office remotely through Telemedicine tools. Medical staff needed to authenticate and gain authorization to access patient information in locations outside their typical work areas to provide security while preserving privacy. Taking a zero-trust approach became even more relevant using a zero-trust principle to always verify the user identity before providing access to any resource. Identity assurance begins with Identity proofing and further uses fraud detection capabilities. This industry requirement became apparent in the 2020 KuppingerCole Access Management Leadership Compass, which saw an uptick in the number of Access Management products providing some level of identity proofing and fraud detection features or indicated that those capabilities are on its near-term roadmap.</p>
<p></p>
 Access Intelligence is Stepping Up to Play a Larger Role 
<p>Beyond core Access Management functionality such as authentication, authorization, federation, audit reporting, and even areas of API security, the use of analytics and access intelligence is increasing. Intelligence gives the ability to make access decisions that can be acted upon based on the patterns and trends found through data analytics and other machine learning techniques.&nbsp; Access intelligence can be used to discover new applications or API endpoints introduced to the network, identify potential access risks, make recommendations on security posture improvements, and reduce fraud, as some examples. The level of access intelligence seen in the market today is being driven by its usefulness and has become a significant differentiator between cybersecurity product vendors.</p>
 Automation 
<p>The automation of everyday Access Management tasks is becoming a priority for many organizations. Intelligence can drive automation to reduce the workload of IT security and administrative inefficiency and human error sometimes experienced through the manual completion of Access Management tasks. Organizations use automation with the intent of making their operations leaner and achieve lower TCO. Access Management automation can be applied to tasks such as the management of user access, applying roles, or automated discovery of applications and APIs on the network and then applying the applicable access and compliance policies.</p>
 So, Where Does Access Management Go from Here? 
<p>Although the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many organizations to make some unanticipated changes in their cybersecurity services, Access Management must still provide core functionality. Still, it can enhance its effectiveness by utilizing analytics, intelligence, and automation through more innovative Access Management products and services.</p>
<p>To better understand the challenges of Access Management in this pandemic era and how it continues to evolve to meet recent business environment changes, KuppingerCole invites you to join the German Cyber Access Summit 2021 to hear from the experts and inform yourself on how to make the best decision possible for your organization.</p>

 Kong Konnect and Okta Integration Topology 

<p>The Konnect control plane creates new APIs and policies and publishes them to the data plane running as a Docker container in an AWS EC2 instance.</p>

<p></p>

 Authorization Code Flow 

<p>The authorization code flow goes through the following steps:</p>

 
   First, a user tries to consume the API. 
   If the user doesn’t have a token injected, Kong redirects the user to Okta, the identity provider. 
   The user authenticates on Okta and is sent back to Kong with an authorization code token. 
   Kong validates the parameters and exchanges the authorization code token by calling Okta’s token endpoint. 
 

<p></p>

 Add Your Services and Routes to Konnect 

<p>In Konnect’s ServiceHub, I have a service created already. Follow along in our <a href="https://konghq.com/blog/getting-started-konnect">Getting Started with Konnect tutorial</a> to learn how to create a service and routes.</p>

<p>My service has two routes defined already. I used the first service in the previous Kong and Okta tutorial to show the client credentials flow. In this tutorial, I’ll use the second service to apply the OIDC plugin utilizing the authorization code flow.</p>

<p></p>

 Set Up the Okta Application 

<p>In Okta, I prepared an application to implement the authorization flow already. In the Kong authorization code application, we’re going to use the configured OIDC plugin in addition to the client ID and client secret.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The app has the authorization code option turned on and the signing redirect URI set with the route available in my data plane. That means the authorization code is accepted for this URI only.</p>

<p></p>

 Consume the Route Without a Policy 

<p>Any user is free to consume the route right now since there’s no policy to control it.</p>

<p></p>

 Apply the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Just like we did for the client credentials flow tutorial, let’s go back to the Konnect control plane to apply the OIDC plugin and then implement the authorization code flow.</p>

 
   
    <p>Set the Config.Client ID.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Enter the Config.Client Secret.</p>

    <p></p>
   
   
    <p>Add Okta’s Config.Issuer endpoint.</p>

    <p></p>
   
 

<p>Click Create to enable the OIDC plugin to the route.</p>

 Test the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>If we try to consume the route again, Kong redirects us to Okta’s user interface to present our credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once we have presented our correct credentials, Okta authenticates and redirects us back to the API gateway. At this time, we’ll consume the API because we got the identity token injected inside our request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then we go to <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a> to check the token.</p>

 OceanDAO Roadmap Update — Mid-2021 <p>Towards Scaling Community Funding in&nbsp;OceanDAO</p><p>This article describes challenges identified in <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a>, and the chosen solutions which are being rolled out. Together, these solutions will help improve funding efficiency, scale OceanDAO, and build traction across the Ocean Ecosystem.</p> 1. Introduction to&nbsp;OceanDAO <p>OceanDAO is a community-curated grants DAO that funds community-proposed projects. OceanDAO is a key component of the Ocean system-level design, designed for near-term growth and long-term sustainability.</p><p>OceanDAO has two goals: maximize the amount funded, with the constraint that (on average) every project has positive return on investment (ROI). This in turn will help to drive the health of OCEAN and data consume volume — the main performance indicators of Ocean Protocol.</p><p>OceanDAO sub-components include: Funding Rounds where the protocol unlocks capital to fund community projects, Grant Categories that represent core organizational pillars, Fundamental Metrics that shape product development goals, and Voting on project proposals.The most important parts of OceanDAO are already decentralized and community driven: proposal of projects and curation of projects (voting). Over time we expect to decentralize the entire OceanDAO&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Not every project we fund will succeed; we actually expect many to fail. But some of those that succeed will achieve incredible performance, returning more in value than was originally granted. Funding these successful projects should in theory outperform all other initiatives and create a positive&nbsp;ROI.</p><p>Learning how to repeat success empowers the Ocean community to fund the right projects with confidence and impunity.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the status quo funding structure of OceanDAO and other Ocean community funding programs. Section 3 describes the challenges identified. Section 4 describes candidate tools to help address the challenges. Sections 5 and 6 describe the tools chosen, which collectively address the problems identified. Section 6 converts these into a plan for the near-term OceanDAO&nbsp;roadmap.</p> 2. Status Quo Funding Structure <p>For a more complete picture, let’s review the different funding structures within the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>OceanDAO was initially deployed with small(ish) fixed-size grants, and community-curated voting to fund projects to build, perform outreach, and add data in the Ocean Ecosystem.</p><p>The Shipyard funding program had slightly larger grants where the funding was curated by the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>Additionally, the Ocean Ambassadors represent a very engaged community of individuals in the Ocean ecosystem. This group creates content, runs interviews, moderates social channels, writes articles, organizes events, and provides support to OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO has the ability to scale efficiently because projects are vetted and funded by the community. Basic tools like forums, Discourse, and more advanced Web3 tools like Snapshot have allowed the Proposal and Funding process to be fully managed by the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p>However, Shipyard processes were developed with numerous manual steps to coordinate with proposers, while centralizing the decision and funding process to an internal team at Ocean Protocol Foundation (OPF). This process does not scale well as many processes exhibit 1:1 relationships where the internal team must spend a lot of cycles to support each project, instead of achieving 1:N outcomes.</p><p>Finally, OPF has contracts with several teams to improve core Ocean products — we call these Product Contracts. These contracts typically come with a public announcement, though they could benefit from further transparency.</p><p>The aim of this review and design process was to identify challenges in OceanDAO, Shipyard and related processes to identify possible solutions, tools, and scale the organization.</p> 3. Challenges Identified <p>Below is a list of challenges identified across OceanDAO and other funding structures. Challenges identified have been a result of documenting discussions, community feedback, and internal failures to achieve certain&nbsp;goals.</p><p>OceanDAO Challenges</p>  Quantifying ROI is hard. It’s hard to measure ROI in practice, which makes it hard for voters to judge projects that are coming back for repeat&nbsp;funding.  Fixed grant amounts. It’s harder to have positive ROI with this model as there are projects that will take larger grants more than they would have otherwise asked for, while others will be granted less than they&nbsp;need.  Low voter turn-out relative to number of token holders. Ideally more of the OCEAN in the system is being used to vote — it’s a sign of engagement and helps decentralization.  Sybil on voting and proposals. Multiple proposals are made by the same people who vote for themselves. This is a side effect of lower voter turn-out, and is worse they are large OCEAN holders (whales).  Quarterly targets for OCEAN funded are becoming harder to meet; low proposal turn-out is a contributor  Some people are in &gt;1 teams in a given funding round, it can appear like double-dipping, and it’s harder to quantify&nbsp;ROI  Some teams have &gt;1 proposals in a given funding round, it can appear like double-dipping and it’s harder to quantify&nbsp;ROI  Most proposals and grants have been for the “Build Apps” track. While we think building Ocean apps is great, there’s been less funding going to other tracks (Core sw, Developer Outreach, data, OceanDAO)  We don’t have a mechanism to bias funding towards a given track, or even a more specific sub-track (e.g. “Core Software — Documentation”)  Poor visibility into how much OCEAN went into each track or sub-track  OceanDAO Copy. Current descriptions on the website, wiki, etc. can be hard for new users to navigate. It does not provide sufficient objective, or quantifiable criteria.  <p>Shipyard Challenges with regards to&nbsp;OceanDAO</p>  Poor visibility into how funds are allocated in Shipyard vs OceanDAO; and specific tracks in&nbsp;Shipyard  Shipyard grant process and tooling is more manual, centralized, and does not scale&nbsp;well.  Shipyard tools and processes are not laid out very&nbsp;clearly.  Shipyard promises the time of Ocean core team members to grantees. This scales poorly and uses precious time from the core team (debatable whether time is well&nbsp;spent).  OceanDAO and Shipyard have overlapping processes and challenges, but both require tooling and core team time to perform well, and hit their respective goals.  Worry of double dipping: a single team can receive grants from both OceanDAO and Shipyard. Our policy is “each proposal must have different scope”, but in practice this is hard to track&nbsp;well.  Shipyard Copy. Current descriptions can be hard for new users to navigate. It does not provide sufficient objective, or quantifiable criteria.  Redirection. Shipyard applicants that got turned away got redirected to OceanDAO (good) but with little context, or were not redirected at&nbsp;all  <p>Ambassador Challenges with regards to&nbsp;OceanDAO</p>  Ambassador incentives and OceanDAO. The current integration between OceanDAO goals and Ambassadors make it hard to reward/incentivize ambassadors and contributors for specific activities.  Ambassadors are funded by Shipyard via manual process while OceanDAO can achieve the same in an autonomous manner.  Ambassadors can help drive bottom-up initiatives in OceanDAO and top-down initiatives from Shipyard. We can improve their integration and fund more efficiently by bringing them into OceanDAO.   4. Candidate Tools <p>Over the years, and especially the last few months, we’ve analyzed many DAO architectures, methodologies, and tooling. During the lifetime of OceanDAO we’ve also received many great suggestions from the community. Here is a list of ideas as “candidate tools”. Note that we have not committed to all of these ideas; they are merely listed as ideas, and will continue to be expanded in the future. In a later section we describe the ones that we are rolling out in the near&nbsp;term.</p><p>DAO Product</p>  One-Page OceaDAO website — (Update Landing Page ) — Consideration of Shipyard&nbsp;sunset.  Optimize OceanDAO funnel — Improve conversion, etc using many well-known tools, including removing friction in proposing grants, voting, receiving grants, and reporting progress  DAO v0.2 — Identify No+Low Code solutions that can establish good processes and workflows to scale the pipeline.  Proposal Submission Channels — Add more wallets that can create proposals / automate who can submit proposals to Snapshot.  Better ROI tracking — So that voters can see how each grantee is doing against their ROI. There are many possible things here: improved table, better measure of ROI metric, more. Continually make this better, improve data and ROI discovery. This will take real effort over time, but it’s critical to the long-term success of a grants&nbsp;program.  Vote Results Report — Granular voting will generate many proposals, we need to be able to easily communicate results.  Public DAO Roadmap — Increase transparency and intuition of long term objectives so grant propers, voters, and the community can make better decisions. That includes this blog post&nbsp;:)  <p>Efficient Processes</p>  Retire Shipyard — “Variable Funding’’ can fund large $OCEAN (community-curated), Product Contracts too (core-team-curated), therefore Shipyard is redundant (and keeping it has many problems, see “Shipyard-related Challenges” challenges above). &amp; OceanDAO might be able to leverage Shipyard’s quantifiable ROI+ methodologies, while Shipyard might be able to leverage OceanDAO’s scalable, and more decentralized proposal+vote+funding model (eg what is salvageable?). Migrate shipyard pipeline to&nbsp;DAO.  Fund ambassadors via OceanDAO — “Variable Funding” (see below) allows smaller $OCEAN and we can reduce manual processes.  Treasury via Request — Reduce friction for grantees, helps administration by OceanDAO core team until it becomes more decentralized  Product Contracts — Increase transparency of internal direction, efforts, and $OCEAN&nbsp;funded.  <p>Incentivizing Engagement</p>  Retroactive airdrops to voters in past OceanDAO rounds. (Note: this is an idea, it is not to be taken as a commitment.)  Airdrops to voters in future OceanDAO rounds. (Note: this is an idea, it is not to be taken as a commitment.)  Data Farming % boost weight for LPs who participated in the most recent Snapshot&nbsp;vote  Incorporate time incentive for *voters*, looking forward and/or backward in time. 1 year time frame. Eg vote weight is proportional to time staked forward, and time held backward, up to 1&nbsp;year.  <p>Incentivizing Volume &amp;&nbsp;Quality</p>  $OCEAN not granted is burned — This provides a stronger incentive to down-signal poor proposals, because it helps drive $OCEAN up (in line with Ocean token design). Eg Any project with e.g. &lt; 50% “+” votes will not be granted $OCEAN. In turn, this might encourage participation, as $OCEAN holders see the opportunity to signal more strongly on behalf of&nbsp;$OCEAN.  Align incentives for grant winners: bonus 25% of proposal is paid out 6 months — (Incentivizes project to grow value of $OCEAN).How: use streaming money protocol like Sablier or Superfluid.  <p>Voting Mechanisms</p>  Vote per proposal (Granular Voting) — Voters can vote +/- for each proposal, vs status quo of voters voting + for one of n proposals). Allows voters ability to vote &gt;1 proposal.  Quadratic voting — (1) get fixed amount of votes = # OCEAN tokens. (2) can allocate these votes among the n proposals. Vote weight on a proposal = sqrt(# votes allocated to the proposal). Requires “Vote per proposal”  <p>Funding Mechanisms</p>  Earmark min $OCEAN funding for each track or specific goal — Tracks: {Core dev, app dev, outreach, data, OceanDAO}, or more specific “data” → “climate data” and “core dev” → “documentation”. Emphasize some tracks/goals more than others by different min $OCEAN&nbsp;amounts.  Requested $OCEAN can vary (Variable Funding) among proposals, to allow for small proposals ($1K ish) and large ones ($100K ish). Capped or uncapped rounds? Maybe: no team can request &gt; ⅓ of a given round’s&nbsp;total  1–2–3 Combo — Combine Vote per proposal + $OCEAN proposed can vary + $OCEAN not granted is burned. (These play well together)  Round Funding Cap — Fund Scarcity [set = 65%] By limiting the total amount of funds available to be dispersed per round/track, incentivizes participants to be choosier with how they allocate available resources.  Continuous funding — Shift voting and grant incentives to be more long-term oriented. One example implementation is conviction voting like in Giveth or Commons&nbsp;Stack.  <p>Funding Brains</p>  One-team rule. In a given funding round, a given person may only be part of a team of one funding proposal. If broken, all teams with that person are disqualified.  One-proposal rule. In a given funding round, a given team may only make one funding proposal. If broken, the team is disqualified.  <p>Growth</p>  More OCEAN to teams if voter turnout grows. Bonus +x% funding (beyond the baseline pot) to all teams in a given funding round, if the amount of OCEAN voted grows by x% compared to previous round. Note: must be by OCEAN voted, not number# wallets, because the latter can be Sybil attacked.  New Team Grants. Introduce earmarking for new teams who have never been funded before. This combines well with “$OCEAN burn”, as the community is incentivized to register new quality projects to avoid tokens being destroyed.   5. Towards Solving: Updated Funding Structure <p>To understand where we are, and where we are going, we began by deconstructing our processes, paying attention to the different funding structures that were in place, and how to resolve their immediate challenges.</p><p>OceanDAO has scaled well via decentralized community-driven proposals, and decentralized community-driven voting to curate proposals. Due to this success, it became obvious that OceanDAO should get scaled out more while applying adjustments to improve target outcomes.</p><p>Implementing Variable Funding allows OceanDAO to allocate small grants around ~$1k, up to much larger grants of $100k. This means that OceanDAO can help teams at various stages of maturity: incubate -&gt; accelerate -&gt; scale. This means we can fold Shipyard activities into OceanDAO, as well as Ambassador funding.</p><p>Another key challenge identified is the need to increase confidence in funding projects that are ROI+. We believe that when participants can vote intuitively and fund projects effectively, that we will have begun solving the&nbsp;problem.</p> 6. Towards Solving: Matching Challenges with&nbsp;Tools <p>Increasing intuition and funding confidence</p><p>Quantifying ROI is difficult. We have to simplify complex projects into an intuitive decision-making process, to facilitate voting and capital allocation decisions. This challenge is twofold as project Proposers need to be aligned with Ocean’s goals, while providing voters with the needed information to cast their votes on projects that can deliver on their promise. In order to synthesize these parameters into intuition, we have to agree on a common methodology that captures the unique goals and Product-Market-Fit risks of each&nbsp;project.</p><p>Improving our website, copy, UX, and reducing the complexity for users to engage with the decision-making process is a good first step. We can call this a top-down solution. We can then call product-market-fit, traction, ability to deliver, and efficient use of funds a bottom-up solution.</p><p>The best way to visualize both of these challenges is with a funnel. On the top of the funnel we can improve the UX to reduce complexity and improve the onboarding process. On the bottom of the funnel, we can improve how projects signal progress to the DAO, in order to report their ROI and continue investing in&nbsp;success.</p><p>By integrating mechanisms that align projects towards OceanDAO goals and Ocean high-level goals, we can increase confidence that all processes are aligned towards the greater goals, and so, invest with impunity.</p><p>One Team One&nbsp;Proposal</p><p>Some teams began working on multiple projects in a given Funding Round, while some team members became spread across multiple projects. This becomes increasingly difficult to resolve as we still experience coordination challenges.</p><p>By introducing a One Team One Proposal rule, we can more easily ensure each participant is taken care of, until we have better systems in place that can support wider decentralization efforts.</p> Eliminating funding&nbsp;barriers <p>OceanDAO biased to incubating early-stage projects with fixed grant amounts while Shipyard biased to larger grants. We can fold both into OceanDAO via two mechanisms: Variable Funding and Grant&nbsp;Ceiling.</p><p>OceanDAO had a fixed Grant amount. This forced projects to fit into a particular box. Yet not all projects are the same size. Introducing Variable Funding allows Proposers to request a grant that meets their unique needs. This improves capital efficiency. Smaller projects can now be funded more easily, while bigger projects can receive the capital needed to&nbsp;scale.</p><p>By increasing the Grant Ceiling, OceanDAO would be equipped to solve the goal of both grant programs. Proposers and Voters can now be more “penny foolish and pound wise”, more easily onboarding smaller initiatives, while focusing their efforts on the projects that have a track record, can take on the risk, and are ready to deliver big outcomes.</p><p>Ultimately both mechanisms shift the responsibility to the community to identify strong project proposers and desirable proposals, while maintaining decentralized decision&nbsp;making.</p> Decentralizing processes and reducing&nbsp;overhead <p>In OceanDAO, project proposers are vetted and funded by the community. In Shipyard, processes required more manual coordination with proposers, while centralizing the decision and funding process to the core Ocean&nbsp;team.</p><p>By providing channels for project proposers to share their proposal in OceanDAO, the community can review projects and collaborate. Web3 tooling such as Snapshot allows all participants to vote and curate which projects receive funding. Applying “DAO Tooling” to this decision-making process, shifts the overhead from the core Ocean team, to the&nbsp;crowd.</p><p>We can move these systems closer to our greater goals of decentralization by doubling down on proven processes that remove overhead, provide transparency, and shift decisions to the crowd. Retiring Shipyard then becomes an obvious, net positive decision.</p> Distributing funds across all initiatives <p>OceanDAO experienced an increasing number of teams proposing projects. This is great! Most projects were of similar flavor: “Build and Integrate”, a fundamental pillar of growth in the Ocean Ecosystem. However, we have five vectors to invest and grow including: Core Software, Unleash Data, DAO Engineering, and Outreach. Another unforeseen problem is that new teams encountered a large amount of friction, as early adopters were favored and received the majority of&nbsp;votes.</p><p>To remedy this situation, an Earmarking mechanism to signal and fund more balanced initiatives in the DAO was introduced. This has allowed OceanDAO to increase the number of Outreach projects, and New Entrants building inside OceanDAO. Both decisions represent a need for the DAO to grow its Top-of-the-Funnel metric: “Total Proposals per Funding&nbsp;Round”.</p><p>This Earmarking mechanism has a theoretical basis with roots in the Genetic Programming (GP) literature. The goal there is “diversity maintenance” so that the GP search doesn’t get stuck in local minima while being more efficient than fully-random sampling. One powerful technique is “Age-Layered Population Structure” (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a971/bb2c2cee841702b033cd01bc79f8e35b7893.pdf">ALPS</a>) with the following mental model: kindergartners compete against only the kindergartners, grade 1s against grade 1s, and so on. And, smart kids can skip grades. So, the new “less fit” kindergartners aren’t competing against grade 12s (and losing). We’ve discovered this to work extremely well <a href="http://trent.st/mojito/">in practice</a>. This can translate to a blockchain setting, such as with <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-layered-tcr-56cc5b4cdc45">The Layered TCR</a>. A super-simple version is to have just two layers: the youngest, and the rest. That’s exactly what we are doing here for OceanDAO: the youngest (0 grants received) only have to compete against the youngest.</p> 7. OceanDAO&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Below is the roadmap and schedule to integrate updates. Some of the roadmap has already been rolled out in Round 5 (May 2021) and Round 6 (June) while the remaining will be implemented in Round 7 (July) and Round 8 (August). We may modify it further as we get feedback, identify new challenges, and make progress.</p><p>Round 5 — May&nbsp;2021</p><p>Optimize DAO&nbsp;Funnel</p>  Improve messaging to address Granular Voting&nbsp;nuances  <p>Vote per proposal (Granular Voting)</p>  Each grant request gets its own&nbsp;snapshot  65% of projects funded up to a goal of&nbsp;15  <p>Earmarked OCEAN</p>  3 grants earmarked for developer outreach  What happens if there aren’t enough proposals?

Conclusion &amp; Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>OceanDAO is a young DAO, established by a community of experienced builders who want to seed the future of decentralized data markets. There are many processes and groups involved in the success of the DAO, and we have to be methodical when considering how to tackle these challenges.</p><p>By formalizing challenges, deconstructing problems, and proposing a roadmap, we can begin exploring the problem-solution space and tooling that can help address each problem. Establishing better transparency and improving coordination can increase cadence, and speed up the flywheel.</p><p>One way to look at the grants DAO, is to think of it like a funnel. With the top segment representing proposals, and the bottom representing effective funding towards ROI+ projects. We can observe any part of the funnel and break it down to identify mechanisms, challenges, and solutions.</p><p>Web3 and DAO tooling is increasing in numbers every month, but there is no catch-all that solves our challenges. There are mechanisms not available in current tooling, and we need to consider alternative solutions. An example is choosing Y/N votes per proposal similarly to DASH, which has served as a good model for many years. Downvoting is a desirable feature to test with inside the DAO, but does not work well in Snapshot based on our requirements. Identifying the challenges that are mission critical, and focusing on delivering solutions against these problems, allows us to maintain velocity.</p><p>Voting is a core system that deserves special attention as it’s a well known attack vector. To continue building together at scale, we have to start addressing potential risks. More so, in order to implement many incentive mechanisms we have to resolve the challenge of Sybil tolerance. Quadratic Voting is an elegant solution to many of these challenges, and so, we have begun efforts to move this&nbsp;forward.</p><p>To distribute funds effectively, we have to implement processes that scale coordination efforts between OPF, proposers, voters, and the community at large. Sunsetting Shipyard also allows OceanDAO to increase the funding ceiling. The introduction of solutions like Variable Funding, serve to provide support for both small projects, and professional teams&nbsp;alike.</p><p>Finally, everyone benefits from rewarding those that help grow OceanDAO. Introducing incentive mechanisms for voters and proposers, artificially grows engagement at the top of the DAO funnel. Helping both teams that are building great projects, and voters who are facilitating important decision-making. Similarly, by rewarding project proposers who are bringing in new participants, and earmarking funds to New Entrants to build in the DAO, we can optimize the DAO funnel, mechanically reduce friction, and increase efficiency for all contributors growing the ecosystem.</p><p>By laying down the goals, challenges, tools, and considerations being paid to the overall development of OceanDAO, a roadmap can be formulated, and more transparency can be provided. Our goal is to onboard the community with the outcomes and challenges we are facing, to establish a platform where we can identify new opportunities for collaboration, and to continue improving the DAO for all contributors embarking on this&nbsp;journey.</p><p>…</p><p>This blog was written in consideration of all staff, teams, and community members, whose commitment and feedback allows OceanDAO to continue improving.

 Ontology at Consensus 2021: Why Digital Identity Systems Must Be Decentralized In Order To Bring About A New Era In Data&nbsp;Privacy  Last week Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, took part in a fireside chat at Consensus 2021. <p>It’s that time of year again; the blockchain industry’s flagship event kicked off in style last week and the Ontology team was out in force. Getting things under way on the first day, our Founder, Li Jun, was honoured to hold a fireside chat on “Why Digital Identity Systems Must Be Decentralized In Order To Bring About A New Era In Data Privacy”. The insightful discussion touched on the blockchain and crypto industry, as well as honing in on Ontology’s core offering, including our DID solutions, OScore, and Wing&nbsp;Finance.</p><p>If you didn’t manage to catch Li Jun’s chat, we’ve got you covered! Below is a recap of some of the highlights.</p><p>The Future Of Decentralized Identity Will Put Personal Data In The User’s&nbsp;Control</p><p>Digital identity is not just a passport or an identity card; it has multiple elements, and it is the cornerstone of our offering. Your digital identity can include anything from your ethnic background or your work experience, to your interests and habits, or your favorite places to shop. Ontology’s decentralized identity offering allows you, the user, to control your personal data without a single centralized service maintaining it. For instance, if you wanted to prove your identity to a third party but the only actual information they needed to verify was your nationality, you could share this one piece of data with the third party while keeping your name, date of birth, home address, and any other relevant data points,&nbsp;private.</p><p>Currently, centralized services do not provide this option for individuals. Such identity protocols are flawed because they rely on trust between three parties. For instance, the identity issuers, who are the trusted parties that attest to their validity, the holders, to whom the credentials are issued, and the verifiers, who are responsible for authenticating that the identification is correct. This leaves parties open to human error and duplicitous misuse of data access. While data breaches are gaining in prevalence across the world, this archaic process can only stand to negatively impact the future of digital identity. Luckily, blockchain has provided us with the solution, and we at Ontology are aiming to give the control of data back to the data owners in the form of a cohesive, decentralized identity.</p><p>Decentralized Identity And Data Both Need More Adoption To&nbsp;Mature</p><p>There is an inextricable link between decentralized identity and decentralized data; decentralized identity is more like a connector or an index, which maps the user to each different source of decentralized data. Decentralized data applies to everything, as each piece of data will eventually link back to an end user or identity. The two protocols are similar and work in tandem, and have been applied to complex decentralized corporations and organizations. The greater the interplay between these two protocols grows, the more likely they will be used in different countries and by governments. With greater adoption comes greater maturation, larger data infrastructures, and finer data ecosystems.</p><p>The Blockchain Industry Has Not Focused On Decentralized Data Or Identity Heavily; That Is About To&nbsp;Change</p><p>The blockchain industry is still in its early stages, and currently, the focus remains predominantly on digital assets and market movement. Little over four years ago when we were planning the launch of the public Ontology blockchain, we never expected there to be as much interest in this space as there currently is. People’s concept of identity is rapidly changing as trust in centralized data storage erodes and we expect this to continue in the coming years. Data is perceived as an asset and it can bring real profits for organizations and Big Tech companies such as Facebook and Google. Here, the individual has access to their data yet they do not own it as it is stored on a centralized platform. While individuals can access their data, they can only store said data on these centralized databases themselves; a user cannot move their data off of Facebook to store in another place. Blockchain technology and decentralized data solves for this, as they bring the tools directly to the individual, rather than through a centralized server. In doing this, blockchain will give sovereignty to users. By using Ontology’s solutions, the individual owns the data and can authenticate a third party to access said data, positioning Ontology’s solution at the fore of this revolution.</p><p>Ontology Will Invert Users’ Relationships With Their Data, Placing Them In&nbsp;Control</p><p>Decentralized identity solutions provide integrity and authenticity in data security. It gives control of personal data back to individuals in the form of a digital identity. As our identity begins to grow and evolve over time, our digital footprint becomes greater and the amount of data points identifying us grows, increasing the risk of manipulation. Inverting the existing relationship users have with data and placing the control in their hands is an imperative for us at Ontology. We strongly believe that these decentralized identity and decentralized data frameworks are the way of the future. By doing this, we also leave open plenty of possibilities: you could be the co-owner of your data with a centralized party, which does not mean you must move your data to that centralized server, you can still put your data into one or multiple centralized storage services. The difference here is that you control the data: you can authenticate the data to another third partner service, be it a financial institution or an insurance company, meaning your data is under your&nbsp;control.</p><p>Our identity continues to grow and evolve in complexity, making it more scattered among different centralized systems. With a decentralized identity like ONT ID, users can rest easy knowing that their data will only be stored where they want it to be stored, or shared with whomever they want to share it with; rather than being sold to third parties to advance a companies’ advertising goals. Users allow access to the specific data they want to share and decide whom they wish to share it with. The future of data is decentralized, and we are more committed than ever to be pioneering this effort to bring about a new era of data&nbsp;privacy.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

The release of this new version will help satisfy users’ high-frequency trading&nbsp;needs.  Ontology’s Chief Scientist, Kendall Mao was invited to the IEEE Computer Society Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Standards Committee Plenary &amp; P3200S WG Meeting, where he discussed how to accelerate the development of core standards for blockchain and build a global blockchain ecosystem with more than 70 representatives from 55&nbsp;units.    It was a great month for media coverage. Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was featured in Forbes, CoinDesk, and Forkast News, sharing his thoughts on the future of the DeFi industry and how Ontology and SAGA are creating a regulatory framework for decentralization.  Li Jun also published an article in Nasdaq titled, <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-solution-to-the-internets-data-hoarding-problem-2021-05-05">“The Solution to the Internet’s Data Hoarding Problem”</a>. The article delves into the idea that SSI solutions can help users share data while protecting their&nbsp;privacy.  Ning Hu, CTO of Ontology, published a paper titled “<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/doi/10.1162/dint_a_00095/101024/OpenKG-Chain-A-Blockchain-Infrastructure-for-Open">OpenKG Chain: A Blockchain Infrastructure for Open Knowledge Graphs</a>”, exploring blockchain-based open knowledge infrastructure.  Crypto Briefing recently released a guide for decentralized identity. ONT ID is listed in the guide as one of the top three decentralized identity solutions since ONT ID has practical applications and could be used on multiple blockchains.  Ontology’s 14-day chain statistics report for April and May has been published. From April 25 to May 8, the number of transactions on the Ontology chain, the number of active addresses, the total number of addresses, and the ONT ID data all showed an overall growth trend. This reflects a tremendous increase in new and existing users of self-sovereign decentralized digital identities.

<p>At Magic, we care about the developer experience. After we first introduced monthly subscription plans, we learned there was an opportunity to iterate on pricing, based on your questions and feedback.</p><p>Today, we’re excited to share details on our new, more developer-friendly pricing&nbsp;model.</p> Pay As You&nbsp;Go <p>Pay as you go pricing makes costs crystal clear, so you know exactly what you’re paying. It’s $0.0085 per login. With fair pricing protection, you only pay a max of 4 logins per user in a given month. After that, that user’s logins are&nbsp;free.</p><p>This new pricing model is similar to Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) and Twilio’s, where you only pay for what you&nbsp;use.</p><p>Affordable metered pricing brings new benefits to&nbsp;you:</p> Simpler <p>Transparent and fair pricing, aligned to what you&nbsp;need</p> More flexible <p>No more monthly plans, no vendor&nbsp;lock-in</p> Easier than ever to&nbsp;start <p>10,000 free logins help you get up and&nbsp;running</p> Refer friends to&nbsp;Magic <p>Alongside this pricing update, we are also introducing a shiny new referrals program to share Magic with more members of the developer community.</p><p>For every friend you invite who signs up, you’ll both get 3,000 bonus logins added to your accounts. Share your unique referral link with 30 friends and you can earn up to 90,000 total free&nbsp;credits.</p><p>Passwordless auth made simple is a big win for developers. At Magic, we’re focused on empowering you to build the most delightful and secure login experiences for your&nbsp;users.</p><p>If you have any questions about these changes, message us and we’d be more than happy to&nbsp;assist.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/simpler-pricing-8269e502259a">Simpler Pricing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>Il report è molto utile per classificare i diversi fornitori a seconda delle specifiche capacità e livelli di servizio offerti. È un’ottima fonte dalla quale si possono analizzare gli ultimi Use Case in ambito B2B, B2C e B2E e dà inoltre una vista puntuale sui più recenti requisiti necessari in ambito “Assurance” (ossia del rispetto degli standard di garanzia così come indicato nelle diverse normative europee di riferimento) come in quello tecnologico, aspetti nei quali un’azienda dovrebbe porre particolare attenzione qualora volesse intraprendere un percorso di Trasformazione Digitale.</p>
<p>Il segmento “Full-service, enterprise electronic and digital signature platform”, all’interno del quale InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i leader del settore, è quello che raggruppa i Provider che riescono ad adattarsi meglio ad ogni esigenza del cliente, secondo Gartner infatti, questi Provider possono supportare sia firme elettroniche semplici che quelle avanzate e qualificate, nelle loro soluzioni Enterprise possono venire integrati processi specifici per settore industriale, possono offrire soluzioni “out-of-the-box”, integrabili a piattaforme e software terze parti come Documentali, HCMs, CRMs e CLMs. Infine, supportano anche tool di integrazione API, di Identity verification e knowledge-base verification.</p>
<p>Il report prosegue analizzando le altre due categorie di fornitore che sono: “Stand-alone, workflow-focused, click-to-sign electronic signature platoform” e gli “Enterprise digital signature provider”.</p>
<p>Il team di analisti che ha curato la stesura del report, focalizza la sua attenzione sul fatto che il cliente debba poter accedere a servizi che si adeguino alle proprie esigenze, alle aree geografiche di proprio interesse (caratterizzate spesso da esigenze normative diverse) e al caso d’uso che prende come riferimento. Per questo motivo è essenziale che esso venga messo in grado di poter scegliere il fornitore che soddisfi al meglio i criteri di funzionalità e compliance durante tutte le fasi del processo in questione.</p>
<p>GoSign, la soluzione di firma di InfoCert, è ormai un punto di riferimento sul mercato grazie alla sua versatilità. La possibilità di firmare su qualsiasi dispositivo, di utilizzare diverse tipologie di firma e di personalizzare la soluzione con processi verticali, consente alle aziende di velocizzare i processi approvativi e quelli di firma verso clienti e fornitori.</p>

<p>When your business or application is successful, it needs to scale. Not just technology-wise, but human-wise. When you’re growing rapidly, it can be difficult to hire developers fast enough. Using a microservices architecture for your apps can allow you to divide up ownership and responsibilities, and scale teams along with your code.</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes traces its lineage <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes/">directly from Borg</a>, Google’s long-rumored internal container-oriented cluster-management system.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot and Spring Cloud were some of the pioneering frameworks in Javaland. However, even they stood on the shoulders of giants when they leveraged Netflix’s open-source projects to embrace and extend. In 2018, <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-oss-and-spring-boot-coming-full-circle-4855947713a0">Netflix OSS announced they’d come full circle</a>, and adopted Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’d like to show you how to build and deploy (with Kubernetes) a reactive microservice architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and JHipster. Why reactive? Because Spring Cloud Gateway is now the default for JHipster 7 gateways, even if you choose to build your microservices with Spring MVC.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Spring Cloud Gateway is a library for building an API Gateway on top of Spring WebFlux. It easily integrates with OAuth to communicate between microservices. You just need to add a <code>TokenRelay</code> filter.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
        - TokenRelay</code> 
 
 
 






Spring Cloud no longer supports Netflix Zuul. An <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-gateway/issues/36">open issue</a> adds Spring MVC/Servlet support to Spring Cloud Gateway. It’s scheduled for implementation before the end of 2021.

 A Brief Intro to Kubernetes (K8s) 
 
 
<p>Kubernetes is an open-source project from Google that provides an API for deploying your apps and making them talk with each other. It helps automate deployments and updates, and manages your apps and services with limited downtime. You use Docker containers and YAML to make it all work.</p>
 
 
<p>The YAML can be burdensome, but that’s where JHipster comes in. It can generate the YAML for you!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Kubernetes-Ready Microservices Architecture 
 
 
<p>I showed you how to build <a>Reactive Java microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a> in a previous post. Today, I’ll show you how to generate K8s deployment descriptors, use Spring Cloud Config with Git, encrypt your secrets, and make it all work on Google Cloud (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/">GKE</a> to be specific).</p>
 
 
<p>Start by cloning the JHipster 7 { Vue, Spring Boot, WebFlux } reactive microservices project from GitHub:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>If you just want to see the completed project, just cd into the project’s <code>jhipster-k8s</code> directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../jhipster-k8s</code> 
 
 



 
 
<p>This project has four directories:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>gateway</code>: a Spring Boot + Spring Cloud Gateway project configured for OpenID Connect (OIDC) login. It’s also configured as an OAuth 2.0 resource server. It contains a front-end application built with Vue.</p>
 
 
<p><code>blog</code>: a Spring Boot + WebFlux microservice that talks to a Neo4j database.</p>
 
 
<p><code>store</code>: a Spring Boot + WebFlux microservice that uses MongoDB.</p>
 
 
<p><code>docker-compose</code>: a set of Docker files that describe how to run all containers together.</p>
 
 
 
 






The SPA app on the gateway is currently a monolith. The JHipster team is still working on <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10189">micro frontends support</a>.



 
 
<p>If you don’t have JHipster installed, install it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Generate Kubernetes Deployment Descriptors 
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <code>reactive-jhipster</code> directory. Next, create a <code>k8s</code> directory, cd into it, and run JHipster’s <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/kubernetes/">Kubernetes sub-generator</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mkdir k8s
cd k8s
jhipster k8s</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll be prompted with several questions. Answer them as I did below:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Type of application: Microservice application</p>
 
 
<p>Root directory: ../</p>
 
 
<p>Which applications? &lt;select all&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Set up monitoring? No</p>
 
 
<p>Which applications with clustered databases? select store</p>
 
 
<p>Admin password for JHipster Registry: &lt;generate one&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes namespace: demo</p>
 
 
<p>Docker repository name: &lt;your docker hub username&gt;</p>
 
 
<p>Command to push Docker image: <code>docker push</code></p>
 
 
<p>Enable Istio? No</p>
 
 
<p>Kubernetes service type? LoadBalancer</p>
 
 
<p>Use dynamic storage provisioning? Yes</p>
 
 
<p>Use a specific storage class? &lt;leave empty&gt;</p>
 
 
 
 






If you don’t want to publish your images on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, leave the Docker repository name blank.



 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>After I answered these questions, my <code>k8s/.yo-rc.json</code> file had the following contents:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "generator-jhipster": {
    "appsFolders": ["blog", "gateway", "store"],
    "directoryPath": "../",
    "clusteredDbApps": ["store"],
    "serviceDiscoveryType": "eureka",
    "jwtSecretKey": "NDFhMGY4NjF...",
    "dockerRepositoryName": "mraible",
    "dockerPushCommand": "docker push",
    "kubernetesNamespace": "demo",
    "kubernetesServiceType": "LoadBalancer",
    "kubernetesUseDynamicStorage": true,
    "kubernetesStorageClassName": "",
    "ingressDomain": "",
    "monitoring": "no",
    "istio": false
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I already showed you how to get everything working with Docker Compose <a> in the previous tutorial</a>. So today, I’d like to show you how to run things locally with <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">Minikube</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Install Minikube to Run Kubernetes Locally 
 
 
<p>If you have Docker installed, you can run Kubernetes locally with Minikube. Run <code>minikube start</code> to begin.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>minikube --cpus 8 start</code> 
 
 
 






If this doesn’t work, use <code>brew install minikube</code>, or see <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/">Minikube’s installation instructions</a>.



 
 
<p>This command will start Minikube with 16 GB of RAM and 8 CPUs. Unfortunately, the default, which is 16 GB RAM and two CPUs, did not work for me.</p>
 
 
<p>You can skip ahead to creating your Docker images while you wait for this to complete.</p>
 
 
<p>After this command executes, it’ll print out a message and notify you which cluster and namespace are being used.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default</code> 
 
 
 






You can stop Minikube with <code>minikube stop</code> and start over with <code>minikube delete</code>.



 
 
 
 
 Create Docker Images with Jib 
 
 
<p>Now, you need to build Docker images for each app. In the {<code>gateway</code>, <code>blog</code>, <code>store</code> } directories, run the following Gradle command (where <code>&lt;image-name&gt;</code> is <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, or <code>blog</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>This command should also be in the window where you ran <code>jhipster k8s</code>, so you can copy them from there.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-name&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create Private Docker Images 
 
<p>You can also build your images locally and publish them to your Docker daemon. This is the default if you didn’t specify a base Docker repository name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code># this command exposes Docker images to minikube
eval $(minikube docker-env)
./gradlew -Pprod bootJar jibDockerBuild</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Because this publishes your images locally to Docker, you’ll need to make modifications to your Kubernetes deployment files to use <code>imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: gateway-app
  image: gateway
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Make sure to add this <code>imagePullPolicy</code> to the following files:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>k8s/gateway-k8s/gateway-deployment.yml</code></p>
 
 
<p><code>k8s/blog-k8s/blog-deployment.yml</code></p>
 
 
<p><code>k8s/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Register an OIDC App for Auth 
 
 
<p>You’ve now built Docker images for your microservices, but you haven’t seen them running. First, you’ll need to configure Okta for authentication and authorization.</p>
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit. Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>JHipster ships with <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jhipster-registry/">JHipster Registry</a>. It acts as a Eureka service for service discovery and contains a Spring Cloud Config server for distributing your configuration settings.</p>
 
 
<p>Update <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code> to contain your OIDC settings from the <code>.okta.env</code> file the Okta CLI just created. The Spring Cloud Config server reads from this file and shares the values with the gateway and microservices.</p>

                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To configure the JHipster Registry to use OIDC for authentication, modify <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> to enable the <code>oauth2</code> profile.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that you’ve configured everything, it’s time to see it in action.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Start Your Spring Boot Microservices with K8s 
 
 
<p>In the <code>k8s</code> directory, start your engines!</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can see if everything starts up using the following command.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get pods -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use the name of a pod with <code>kubectl logs</code> to tail its logs.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl logs &lt;pod-name&gt; --tail=-1 -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code>. You’ll need to sign in with your Okta credentials.</p>
 
 
<p>Once all is green, use port-forwarding to see the gateway app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and you should be able to add blogs, posts, tags, and products.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also automate testing to ensure that everything works. Set your Okta credentials as environment variables and run end-to-end tests using Cypress (from the gateway directory).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=&lt;your-username&gt;
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;your-password&gt;
npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Proof it worked for me:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 Plain Text Secrets? Uggh! 
 
<p>You may notice that I used a secret in plain text in the <code>application-configmap.yml</code> file. Secrets in plain text are a bad practice! I hope you didn’t check everything into source control yet!!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your Secrets with Spring Cloud Config 
 
 
<p>The JHipster Registry has an encryption mechanism you can use to encrypt your secrets. That way, it’s safe to store them in public repositories.</p>
 
 
<p>Add an <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to the environment variables in <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  value: really-long-string-of-random-charters-that-you-can-keep-safe</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>You can use JShell to generate a UUID you can use for your encrypt key.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jshell

UUID.randomUUID()</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can quit by typing <code>/exit</code>.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Restart your JHipster Registry containers from the <code>k8s</code> directory.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your OIDC Client Secret 
 
<p>You can encrypt your client secret by logging into <code><a href="http://localhost:8761">http://localhost:8761</a></code> and going to Configuration &gt; Encryption. If this address doesn’t resolve, you’ll need to port-forward again.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy and paste your client secret from <code>application-configmap.yml</code> (or <code>.okta.env</code>) and click Encrypt.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Then, copy the encrypted value back into <code>application-configmap.yml</code>. Make sure to wrap it in quotes!</p>
 
 
<p>You can also use curl:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl -X POST http://admin:&lt;password-you-set-earlier&gt;@localhost:8761/config/encrypt -d your-client-secret</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you use curl, make sure to add <code>{cipher}</code> to the beginning of the string. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>client-secret: "{cipher}1b12934716c32d360c85f651a0793df2777090c..."</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Apply these changes and restart all deployments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
kubectl rollout restart deploy -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Verify everything still works at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>
 
 






If you don’t want to restart the Spring Cloud Config server when you update its configuration, see <a>Refresh the Configuration in Your Spring Cloud Config Server</a>.



 
 
 
 Change Spring Cloud Config to use Git 
 
<p>You might want to store your app’s configuration externally. That way, you don’t have to redeploy everything to change values. Good news! Spring Cloud Config makes it easy to switch to Git instead of the filesystem to store your configuration.</p>
 
 
<p>In <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, find the following variables:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_0_TYPE
  value: native
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_0_SEARCH_LOCATIONS
  value: file:./central-config</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Below these values, add a second lookup location.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_TYPE
  value: git
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_URI
  value: https://github.com/mraible/reactive-java-ms-config/
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_SEARCH_PATHS
  value: config
- name: SPRING_CLOUD_CONFIG_SERVER_COMPOSITE_1_LABEL
  value: main</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Create a GitHub repo that matches the URI, path, and branch you entered.</p>
 
 
<p>In my case, I created <a href="https://github.com/mraible/reactive-java-ms-config/">reactive-java-ms-config</a> and added a <code>config/application.yml</code> file in the <code>main</code> branch. Then, I added my <code>spring.security.*</code> values to it and removed them from <code>k8s/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>See Spring Cloud Config’s <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/multi/multi__spring_cloud_config_server.html#_git_backend">Git Backend docs</a> for more information.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Deploy Spring Boot Microservices to Google Cloud (aka GCP) 
 
 
<p>It’s nice to see things running locally on your machine, but it’s even better to get to production! In this section, I’ll show you how to deploy your containers to Google Cloud.</p>
 
 
<p>First, stop Minikube if you were running it previously.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>minikube stop</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can also use <code>kubectl</code> commands to switch clusters.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config use-context XXX</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The cool kids use <code>kubectx</code> and <code>kubens</code> to set the default context and namespace. You can learn how to install and use them via the <a href="https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx">kubectx GitHub project</a>.</p>
 
 
 Create a Container Registry on Google Cloud 
 
<p>Before the JHipster 7.0.0 release, I tested this microservice example with Kubernetes and Google Cloud. I found many solutions in Ray Tsang’s <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/">Spring Boot on GCP Guides</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1372964263237718026">Thanks, Ray</a>!</p>
 
 
<p>To start with Google Cloud, you’ll need an account and a project. <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/getting-started/google-cloud-platform">Sign up for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>, log in, and create a project. Open a <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">console</a> in your browser. A GCP project contains all cloud services and resources—​such as virtual machines, network, load balancers—​that you might use.</p>
 
 






You can also download and install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/"><code>gcloud</code> CLI</a> if you want to run things locally.



 
 
<p>Enable the Google Kubernetes Engine API and Container Registry:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com containerregistry.googleapis.com</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Kubernetes Cluster 
 
<p>Run the following command to create a cluster for your apps.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud container clusters create CLUSTER_NAME \
--zone us-central1-a \
--machine-type n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autorepair \
--enable-autoupgrade</code> 
 
 
 
<p>I called my cluster <code>reactive-ms</code>. See GCP’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/">zones</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types/">machine-types</a> for other options. I found the <code>n1-standard-4</code> to be the minimum for JHipster.</p>
 
 
<p>You created Docker images earlier to run with Minikube. Then, those images were deployed to Docker Hub or your local Docker registry. If you deployed to Docker Hub, you can use your deployment files as-is.</p>
 
 
<p>For Google Cloud and its Kubernetes engine (GKE), you can also publish your images to your project’s registry. Thankfully, this is easy to do with Jib.</p>
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <code>gateway</code> directory and run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/gateway</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can get your project ID by running <code>gcloud projects list</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Repeat the process for <code>blog</code> and <code>store</code>. You can run these processes in parallel to speed things up.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd ../blog
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/blog
cd ../store
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/store</code> 
 
 
 






You might have to run <code>gcloud auth configure-docker</code> for Jib to publish to your GCP container registry.



 
 
<p>Then, in your <code>k8s/*/-deployment.yml</code> files, add <code>gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;</code> as a prefix. Remove the <code>imagePullPolicy</code> if you specified it earlier. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>containers:
  - name: gateway-app
    image: gcr.io/jhipster7/gateway
    env:</code> 
 
 
 
<p>In the <code>k8s</code> directory, apply all the deployment descriptors to run all your images.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can monitor the progress of your deployments with <code>kubectl get pods -n demo</code>.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you make a mistake configuring JHipster Registry and need to deploy it, you can do so with the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml -n demo
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/jhipster-registry -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to restart all your deployments if you changed any configuration settings that services need to retrieve.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl rollout restart deploy -n demo</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 Access Your Gateway on Google Cloud 
 
<p>Once everything is up and running, get the external IP of your gateway.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get svc gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You’ll need to add the external IP address as a valid redirect to your Okta OIDC app. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the returned URL in your browser, and sign in to the Okta Admin Console. Go to the Applications section, find your application, and edit it.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the standard JHipster redirect URIs using the IP address. For example, <code>http://34.71.48.244:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> for the login redirect URI, and <code>http://34.71.48.244:8080</code> for the logout redirect URI.</p>
 
 
<p>You can use the following command to set your gateway’s IP address as a variable you can curl.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get svc gateway -n demo -ojsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
curl $EXTERNAL_IP:8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run <code>open http://$EXTERNAL_IP:8080</code>, and you should be able to sign in.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Great! Now that you know things work, let’s integrate better security, starting with HTTPS.</p>
 
 
 
 Add HTTPS to Your Reactive Gateway 
 
<p>You should always use HTTPS. It’s one of the easiest ways to secure things, especially with the free certificates offered these days. Ray Tsang’s <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/deployment/kubernetes/load-balancing/external-load-balancing">External Load Balancing docs</a> was a big help in figuring out all these steps.</p>
 
 
<p>You’ll need a static IP to assign your TLS (the official name for HTTPS) certificate.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud compute addresses create gateway-ingress-ip --global</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can run the following command to make sure it worked.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gcloud compute addresses describe gateway-ingress-ip --global --format='value(address)'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, create a <code>k8s/ingress.yml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: gateway
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "gateway-ingress-ip"
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /*
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: gateway
            port:
              number: 8080</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy it and make sure it worked.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f ingress.yml -n demo

# keep running this command displays an IP address
# (hint: up arrow recalls the last command)
kubectl get ingress gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To use a TLS certificate, you must have a fully qualified domain name and configure it to point to the IP address. If you don’t have a real domain, you can use <a href="https://nip.io/">nip.io</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Set the IP in a variable, as well as the domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get ingress gateway -ojsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
DOMAIN="${EXTERNAL_IP}.nip.io"

# Prove it works
echo $DOMAIN
curl $DOMAIN</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To create a certificate, create a <code>k8s/certificate.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; certificate.yml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
  name: gateway-certificate
spec:
  domains:
  # Replace the value with your domain name
  - ${DOMAIN}
EOF</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the certificate to <code>ingress.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
metadata:
  name: gateway
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.global-static-ip-name: "gateway-ingress-ip"
    networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: "gateway-certificate"
...</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy both files:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f certificate.yml -f ingress.yml -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Check your certificate’s status until it prints <code>Status: ACTIVE</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl describe managedcertificate gateway-certificate -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>While you’re waiting, you can proceed to forcing HTTPS in the next step.</p>
 
 
 
 Force HTTPS with Spring Security 
 
<p>Spring Security’s WebFlux support makes it easy to <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.5.x/reference/html5/#webflux-http-redirect">redirect to HTTPS</a>. However, if you redirect all HTTPS requests, the Kubernetes health checks will fail because they receive a 302 instead of a 200.</p>
 
 
<p>Crack open <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> in the gateway project and add the following code to the <code>springSecurityFilterChain()</code> method.</p>
 
 
 src/main/java/…​/gateway/config/SecurityConfiguration.java 
 
 <code>http.redirectToHttps(redirect -&gt; redirect
    .httpsRedirectWhen(e -&gt; e.getRequest().getHeaders().containsKey("X-Forwarded-Proto"))
);</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Rebuild the Docker image for the gateway project.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=gcr.io/&lt;your-project-id&gt;/gateway</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Run the following commands to start a rolling restart of gateway instances:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl rollout restart deployment gateway -n demo</code> 
 
 
 






Run <code>kubectl get deployments</code> to see your deployment names.



 
 
<p>Now you should get a 302 when you access your domain. <a href="https://httpie.io/">HTTPie</a> is a useful alternative to curl.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Update your Okta OIDC app to have <code>https://${DOMAIN}/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> as a valid redirect URI. Add <code>https://${DOMAIN}.nip.io</code> to the sign-out redirect URIs too.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Encrypt Your Kubernetes Secrets 
 
 
<p>Congratulations! Now you have everything running on GKE, using HTTPS! However, you have a lot of plain-text secrets in your K8s YAML files.</p>
 
 
<p>"But, wait!" you might say. Doesn’t <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/">Kubernetes Secrets</a> solve everything?</p>
 
 
<p>In my opinion, no. They’re just unencrypted base64-encoded strings stored in YAML files. There’s a good chance you’ll want to check in the <code>k8s</code> directory you created.</p>
 
 
<p>Having secrets in your source code is a bad idea! The good news is most people (where most people = my followers) manage secrets externally.</p>

 The Current State of Secret Management in Kubernetes 
 
<p>I recently noticed a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/daniel_bilar/status/1379845799086022661">Daniel Jacob Bilar</a> that links to a talk from FOSDEM 2021 on the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/kubernetes_secret_management/">current state of secret management within Kubernetes</a>. It’s an excellent overview of the various options.</p>
 
 
 
 Store Secrets in Git with Sealed Secrets and Kubeseal 
 
<p><a href="https://bitnami.com/">Bitnami</a> has a <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets">Sealed Secrets</a> Apache-licensed open source project. Its README explains how it works.</p>
 
 
<blockquote>
 
<p>Problem: "I can manage all my K8s config in git, except Secrets."</p>
 
 
<p>Solution: Encrypt your Secret into a SealedSecret, which is safe to store - even to a public repository. The SealedSecret can be decrypted only by the controller running in the target cluster, and nobody else (not even the original author) is able to obtain the original Secret from the SealedSecret.</p>
 
</blockquote>
 
 
<p><a href="https://dev.to/stack-labs/store-your-kubernetes-secrets-in-git-thanks-to-kubeseal-hello-sealedsecret-2i6h">Store your Kubernetes Secrets in Git thanks to Kubeseal. Hello SealedSecret!</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/aurelievache">Aurélie Vache</a> provides an excellent overview of how to use it.</p>
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to install the Sealed Secrets CRD (Custom Resource Definition).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl apply -f https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/download/v0.16.0/controller.yaml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Retrieve the certificate keypair that this controller generates.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl get secret -n kube-system -l sealedsecrets.bitnami.com/sealed-secrets-key -o yaml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the raw value of <code>tls.crt</code> and decode it. You can use the command line or an <a href="https://www.base64decode.org/">online base64 decoder</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo -n &lt;paste-value-here&gt; | base64 --decode</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Put the raw value in a <code>tls.crt</code> file.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, install Kubeseal. On macOS, you can use Homebrew. For other platforms, see <a href="https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets/releases/tag/v0.16.0">the release notes</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>brew install kubeseal</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The major item you need to encrypt in this example is the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> you used to encrypt the OIDC client secret. Run the following command to do this, where the value comes from your <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl create secret generic encrypt-key \
  --from-literal=ENCRYPT_KEY='your-value-here' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml &gt; secrets.yml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, use <code>kubeseal</code> to convert the secrets to encrypted secrets.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubeseal --cert tls.crt --format=yaml -n demo &lt; secrets.yml &gt; sealed-secrets.yml</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Remove the original secrets file and deploy your sealed secrets.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm secrets.yml
kubectl apply -n demo -f sealed-secrets.yml &amp;&amp; kubectl get -n demo sealedsecret encrypt-key</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Configure JHipster Registry to use the Sealed Secret 
 
<p>In <code>k8s/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code>, change the <code>ENCRYPT_KEY</code> to use your new secret.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
- name: ENCRYPT_KEY
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: encrypt-key
      key: ENCRYPT_KEY</code> 
 
 
 






You should be able to encrypt other secrets, like your database passwords, using a similar technique.



 
 
<p>Now, redeploy JHipster Registry and restart all your deployments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can use port-forwarding to see the JHipster Registry locally.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761</code> 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Google Cloud Secret Manager 
 
<p>Google Cloud has a <a href="https://spring-gcp.saturnism.me/app-dev/cloud-services/secret-management">Secret Manager</a> you can use to store your secrets. There’s even a <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-gcp/current/reference/html/#secret-manager">Spring Boot starter</a> to make it convenient to retrieve these values in your app.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, you could store your database password in a properties file.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.datasource.password=${sm://my-db-password}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This is pretty slick, but I like to remain cloud-agnostic. Also, I like how the JHipster Registry allows me to store encrypted secrets in Git.</p>
 
 
 
 Use Spring Vault for External Secrets 
 
<p>Using an external key management solution like <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault">HashiCorp Vault</a> is also recommended. The JHipster Registry will have <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry/pull/498">Vault support in its next release</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the meantime, I recommend reading <a>Secure Secrets With Spring Cloud Config and Vault</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Scale Your Reactive Java Microservices 
 
 
<p>You can scale your instances using the <code>kubectl scale</code> command.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>kubectl scale deployments/store --replicas=2 -n demo</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Scaling will work just fine for the microservice apps because they’re set up as OAuth 2.0 resource servers and are therefore stateless.</p>
 
 
<p>However, the gateway uses Spring Security’s OIDC login feature and stores the access tokens in the session. So if you scale it, sessions won’t be shared. Single sign-on should still work; you’ll just have to do the OAuth dance to get tokens if you hit a different instance.</p>
 
 
<p>To synchronize sessions, you can use <a>Spring Session and Redis</a> with JHipster.</p>
 
 






 
<p>If you leave everything running on Google Cloud, you will be charged for usage. Therefore, I recommend removing your cluster or deleting your namespace (<code>kubectl delete ns demo</code>) to reduce your cost.</p>
 
 
 
 gcloud container clusters delete &lt;cluster-name&gt; --zone=us-central1-a 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Monitor Your Kubernetes Cluster with K9s 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Using <code>kubectl</code> to monitor your Kubernetes cluster can get tiresome. That’s where <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s">K9s</a> can be helpful. It provides a terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters. K9s was created by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/kitesurfer">Fernand Galiana</a>. He’s also created a commercial version called <a href="https://k9salpha.io/">K9sAlpha</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>To install it on macOS, run <code>brew install k9s</code>. Then run <code>k9s -n demo</code> to start it. You can navigate to your pods, select them with Return, and navigate back up with Esc.</p>

 Continuous Integration and Delivery of JHipster Microservices 
 
 
<p>This tutorial doesn’t mention continuous integration and delivery of your reactive microservice architecture. I plan to cover that in a future post. If you have a solution you like, please leave a comment.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Spring on Google Cloud Platform 
 
 
<p>JHipster uses Docker containers to run all its databases in this example. However, there are a number of Google Cloud services you can use as alternatives. See the <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gcp">Spring Cloud GCP project on GitHub</a> for more information.</p>
 
 
<p>I didn’t mention Testcontainers in this post. However, <a href="https://atomfrede.gitlab.io/2019/05/jhipster-with-testcontainers/">JHipster does support using them</a>. Testcontainers also has a <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/modules/gcloud/">GCloud Module</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Why Not Istio? 
 
 
<p>I didn’t use Istio in this example because I didn’t want to complicate things. Learning Kubernetes is hard enough without learning another system on top of it. Istio acts as a network between your containers that can do networky things like authentication, authorization, monitoring, and retries. I like to think of it as AOP for containers.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’d like to see how to use JHipster with Istio, see <a href="https://dev.to/deepu105/how-to-set-up-java-microservices-with-istio-service-mesh-on-kubernetes-5bkn">How to set up Java microservices with Istio service mesh on Kubernetes</a> by JHipster co-lead <a href="https://twitter.com/deepu105">Deepu K Sasidharan</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Fernand Galiana recommends checking out BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and <a href="https://cilium.io/">Cilium</a>. Cilium is open source software for transparently providing and securing the network and API connectivity between application services deployed using Linux container management platforms such as Kubernetes.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Kubernetes, Spring Boot, and JHipster 
 
 
<p>This blog post showed you how to deploy your reactive Java microservices to production using Kubernetes. JHipster did much of the heavy lifting for you since it generated all the YAML-based deployment descriptors. Since no one really likes writing YAML, I’m calling that a win!</p>
 
 
<p>You learned how to use JHipster Registry to encrypt your secrets and configure Git as a configuration source for Spring Cloud Config. Bitnami’s Sealed Secrets is a nice companion to encrypt the secrets in your Kubernetes deployment descriptors.</p>
 
 
<p>For more information about storing your secrets externally, these additional resources might help.</p>

<p>We hosted Part 1 of a talk series called Tools for Thought Interchange on May 27th, 2021. Tools for Thought — also known as second brains, digital gardens, or simply personal note taking apps — is seeing a lot of interest right now, with more being built every day. The question we posed was: how do we work on interchange between these systems?</p><p>Not just import or export (although those play a role as well). Rather, can we work on ways to interchange data between systems in a way that preserves the unique capabilities of each system, while also allowing users and developers to more easily use different tools to work with their own data?</p><p>It became clear that many people were interested. We talked to a number of speakers about presenting, and ideally it will turn it into a community of interest and speaker series of its own, distinct from our Fission Tech Talk Thursdays.</p> Fission Building Blocks for Tools for Thought <p>Fission provides a <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative">Webnative SDK </a>for developers that provides portable identity, end-to-end encrypted data &amp; file storage, and web publishing today. This is perfect for the peace of mind of your important second brain notes, without being stuck in a single SaaS database.</p><p>On the public side, the permanent content addressing and graph structure of the <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a> has the potential to be a commons network that helps with annotation and linking of tools for thought resources.</p><p><a href="https://tiddlywiki.fission.app">TiddlyWiki already has a Fission enabled app</a>, and previous presenters like <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/kosmik-app-tool-for-thought-ipfs-database/">Kosmik App</a> are also building on IPFS for global data.</p><p>If this sounds interesting, <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by the Fission Discord chat to find out more »</a></p> Part 1 Presentations <p>Here are the presentations, notes, and video from Part 1. <a href="https://lu.ma/yd1w65cq">Join us for Part 2 on June 3rd »</a></p> Blaine Cook: atJSON as potential format for interchange <p><a href="https://twitter.com/blaine">Blaine Cook</a> kicked us off as the main presentation for the first event. He has been working at Condé Nast on atJSON, which has this to say in its <a href="https://github.com/CondeNast/atjson">GitHub README</a>:</p><blockquote>For Condé Nast, it is essential for our stories to be a format that doesn’t age quickly – we have over a hundred years of articles from publications across the world. It is extremely important for us to be able to put these stories written for digital media in our archive for the future. Many current content formats do not strive for rigorousness in this, instead tying the constraints of the format to the current platform of choice. When constructing this format, we chose to separate the original text from the data associated for this purpose.</blockquote>  <a href="https://ipfs.runfission.com/ipfs/bafybeigp5nuiey5wadfnj54nh2ioey4hmu5d4c2nizxqx6fzycy25jp7k4/2021-05-27%20Fission%20Atjson%20Talk%20Blaine%20Cook.pdf">PDF Slides »</a>  <p>Said perhaps a bit more succinctly, atJSON is designed to be a "100 year document format".</p> Jeremy Ruston, TiddlyWiki <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jermolene">Jeremy</a> showed some in progress work on transforming ePUB into <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> format for in browser annotation and linking, which you can try out online at <a href="https://twpub-tools.org/">twpub viewer</a>.</p><p>TiddlyWiki already supports multi formats, and using something like atJSON as an interchange format would allow for the ePUB code to be used by multiple projects. Maybe this is a <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/discussions/3">good starting point for some shared code</a>?</p>  Check out the GitHub for more info: <a href="https://github.com/TWPUB/TWPUB-Tools">TWPUB/TWPUB-Tools</a>   Gordon Brander, Subconscious <p><a href="https://twitter.com/gordonbrander">Gordon</a> is building a new tool for thought called <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/">Subconscious</a>, and walked us through the design of <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subtext-markup-for-note-taking">Subtext</a>, a new type of markup, designed for note taking.</p>  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/gordonbrander/subtext/">gordonbrander/subtext/</a>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y58oa44sWowFU9_XZa9tqKLTpWrHxF7GYNg2Xzc_e2w">Google Slides »</a>   Christina Bowen, Social Roots <p><a href="https://twitter.com/csageland">Christina Bowen</a> did an amazing job rounding out the presentations with a discussion about the usage of notes and note-taking tools for cross-group coordination and collaborative work to address social mess problems. Socialroots is a worker-owned platform cooperative, the first coop to receive funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). They are currently researching healthy teams and social coordination, especially around things like food, climate, health.</p>  <a href="https://www.socialroots.io/">Sign up for early access and find out more at socialroots.io »</a>   Video <p>At almost 2 hours long, this video has a lot to get through. It was fantastic to have these three great presenters, as well as an active and engaged audience who themselves added tons of questions and shared resources in the chat. The chat log is checked into the <a href="https://github.com/TFTInterchange/ToolsForThoughtInterchange/">TFT Interchange GitHub Repo »</a></p><p>Have further links to share or comments to make? Leave them in the comments below or on the initial event <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/tools-for-thought-atjson-as-a-potential-format-for-interchange/1880">forum thread »</a></p> Kicking off TFT Interchange Community <p>If you’re interested in getting involved in organizing future presentations, please <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">ping Boris in the #tools-for-thought channel on the Fission Discord</a>. We'll discuss building a community around curating an ongoing speaker series, identifying open source code to work on as a group, and anything else related to forming and growing a "Tools for Thought Interchange" community of interest.</p> Register for Part 2 <p>Join us for Part 2 on <a href="https://lu.ma/yd1w65cq">June 3rd, 6pm PDT / June 4th, 11am UTC+10</a>, featuring:</p>  Iian from <a href="https://www.patreon.com/codexeditor">Codex Editor</a>, our main presentation on standoff editing and how it is functionally similar to atJSON  Frode Hegland from Augmented Text Company on <a href="http://visual-meta.info/">Visual Meta</a>, including metadata visibly  Brian Rubinton on <a href="https://kanopi.io/">Kanopi</a>, a graph first tool for thought which uses RDF as primary import/export.  <a href="https://lu.ma/event/evt-KpeCEWsecuWy7QO">

Some organisations want to know lots about an individual, while others want to limit how much is known about them — as my colleague puts it, <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-difference-between-digital-identity-identification-and-id-41580bbb7563">there are 1.4 billion people without an identity, but many more who are over identified</a>.</p><p>I find this a fascinating topic — it brings out the challenge of politics, power and control, which we’ve explored in our work on <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27">digital identity ecosystem mapping,</a> such as in<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/kenyas-identification-ecosystem-7cbc2ee27"> Kenya</a>, and in our work supporting <a href="http://good-id.org/">the Good ID initiative</a>. So I was privileged to be invited to host a discussion on Digital Identity by the SIDA, the Swedish government’s development agency, as part of the <a href="https://stockholminternetforum.se/">Stockholm Internet Forum.</a> We brought together a diverse group of people from the digital identity industry, supporting Government digital identity in the Global North and the Global South, from the social protection sector, United Nations, civil society and academia.</p><p>We tackled diverse issues, such as the tension between inclusion and exclusion, noting that all identification systems <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0?t=2466">— digital or not — are predicated on inclusion and exclusion</a> and we need systems to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0?t=2582">One approach</a> discussed is forcing firms to proactively think about how they’re excluding people and to justify those exclusions upfront. And in the context of COVID-19, we talked about inclusion responses being high-coverage and timely but a key question: for whom? We still don’t know the toll of who’s been left out, but <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/indonesias-invisible-people-face-discrimination-and-sometimes-death-by-database/">this article in Rest of World begins to explore that toll.</a> We also discussed the tensions between legal and stand-alone digital identity schemes, and between biometric data and privacy. There was a strong emphasis on trust, and a recognition that context is key to defining both trust and what constitutes ‘Good’ digital ID. It is a conversation that will continue so long as there are competing visions about the social contract between the identifier and identified. And there certainly are competing visions: watch the full recording below.</p><p>For more information, please <a href="https://claudiommachado.medium.com/good-digital-id-at-the-stockholm-internet-forum-sif-81a337d350e3">do read one of the participants own reflections</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/aIBdSrPLPv0">watch the recording of the session&nbsp;here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/what-does-good-digital-identification-look-like-b8af547aebd8">What does ‘Good’ Digital Identification look like?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   By: Research Team at Caribou Digital, in collaboration with Qhala, University of Ghana, Lagos Business School and Value for&nbsp;Women  In Kenya, the COVID-19 pandemic meant the genesis of new business lines, especially for home supplies and deliveries, and the slowed growth or shutdown of some businesses for luxury goods and travel. This ultimately impacted people’s livelihoods, especially women.

These trends expose the vulnerabilities of gig workers and their lack of savings and <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-african-gig-workers-and-what-needs-to-be-done-97301">other protections</a> amidst rising living&nbsp;costs.</p>Caption: Mary Ikugu is a budding Kenyan agripreneur uses social media to find markets and customers. So what can we learn from the stories women have to tell of their experience? <p>How did the COVID-19 pandemic impact a woman who delivers homemade food through WhatsApp orders in Nairobi? How did a female freelancer on Upwork in Lagos juggle her workload?</p><p>We’re excited to share that, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, Caribou Digital is kicking off a year-long research project on the lives and livelihoods of young female platform workers and sellers in Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria through and beyond the pandemic.</p><p>This gender lens is part of our broader and continuing work on platforms through which we’ve explored the real lives behind platforms (<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">Platform Livelihoods</a>), including our <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/female-livelihoods-in-the-gig-economy-tensions-and-opportunities-f14982b6aaad">diagnostic discussions</a> and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling</a>.</p><p>We’ve put together a great group of research partners following a comprehensive selection process who we’re excited to work&nbsp;with:</p>  <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala </a>in&nbsp;Kenya  <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">the University of&nbsp;Ghana</a>  <a href="https://www.lbs.edu.ng/">Lagos Business School</a> and <a href="https://v4w.org/">Value for Women</a> in&nbsp;Nigeria  <p>This research will be conducted sequentially in Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria, in each case with a landscape review and expert interviews, as well as focus groups and interviews with female workers from different types of platform-related work. Each research team will also deploy a survey or social media scraping of keywords and discussions that arise in workers and sellers groups. Through interviews and participatory video storytelling, young women will tell their story in their own words, in partnership with<a href="https://www.storyby.design/"> Story x Design</a>, a multimedia production company based in&nbsp;Nairobi.</p>A screenshot of the female respondents from our previous video storytelling project<p>At Caribou Digital, we see <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">platform livelihoods</a> as more than just earning an income — a livelihood encompasses other factors including growth of the individual, their safety, the support they need and get, and whether they find purpose in their work as they navigate this new way of working. In <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">earlier work</a>, we defined platform livelihoods as how people rely on “digital platforms” to make money as workers (in the gig economy) or sellers (in e-commerce and social commerce). As we’ve seen in our research so far, livelihoods are constantly being negotiated between workers and platform owners, through digital means, including algorithmic interaction. As a demographic who may face barriers to participation, we were especially curious to understand the challenges that young women face, and how we can make platform livelihoods better for&nbsp;them.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">gender lens on platform work</a> often surfaces structural barriers such as lack of access to capital or infrastructure, or varying levels of digital skills. It also questions the notion of flexibility, as childcare places additional constraints on women’s time compared to men, as <a href="https://odi.org/en/publications/women-in-the-gig-economy-paid-work-care-and-flexibility-in-kenya-and-south-africa/">an ODI study found in Kenya and South Africa</a> found. Our new project investigates how COVID-19 impacts these existing challenges.</p><p>The gender lens will also help capture how unconscious biases and prejudices (for example, that a woman shouldn’t be driving) become obvious tangible barriers for women wanting to enter platform work on a ride-hailing app (the woman is denied a loan for a vehicle to drive for work). We’ll apply and explore Andrea Cornwall’s work on the levers of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3210">empowerment</a>, seen as a combination of “individual change, institutional or social change, informal and formal practices.” This might nuance the discussion from “women use cheaper phones and therefore we should build platforms for cheaper phones” to why women use cheaper phones and how that can be addressed. This research will also provide insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted such norms, from unconscious biases and prejudices to tangible&nbsp;biases.</p>Dathive is one of only two female motorcycle drivers on the Safeboda app in Uganda (<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">from our previous video storytelling project</a>)<p>Finally, we use the word “we” in the research question: “how can we make platform livelihoods better for young women”? But who is the “we”? The research asks exactly that — who is the “we” that needs to <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/female-livelihoods-in-the-gig-economy-tensions-and-opportunities-f14982b6aaad">make the platform work better for women</a>? Is it the platforms themselves? Is it female workers who might demand better conditions through women’s rights groups and activists? Is it policymakers like foundations and governments? And, related, how do we define “better”?</p><p>As we progress through the research, we’ll keep blogging and sharing the emerging themes on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/cariboudigital">@cariboudigital</a>) and here on Medium (<a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a>). We’re excited about this research and look forward to discussing it more with&nbsp;you!</p> Acknowledgements <p>This research is supported and funded by the Mastercard Foundation as part of Young Africa Works, an initiative that focuses on finding solutions to the youth employment challenge and reducing poverty in&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>Thanks to (in alphabetical order):</p><p>Prof. Nana Akua Anyidoho, Centre for Social Policy Studies, University of&nbsp;Ghana</p><p>Prof. Akosua Darkwah, Department of Sociology, University of&nbsp;Ghana</p><p>Prof. Olayinka David-West, Lagos Business&nbsp;School</p><p>Dr. Shikoh Gitau, Qhala&nbsp;Limited</p><p>Renée Hunter, Value for&nbsp;Women</p><p>Nasubo Ongoma, Qhala&nbsp;Limited</p><p>Raymond Onuoha, Lagos Business&nbsp;School</p><p>Note on photos: All photos published with permission.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-can-we-make-platform-livelihoods-better-for-young-women-especially-during-and-after-covid-19-696b3974bf61">How can we make platform livelihoods better for young women, especially during and after COVID-19?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Borrowing from the field of electrical engineering, a breadboard is a fully

<p>I got the idea of breadboards from Ryan Singer in his book <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>.</p>
<p>Borrowing from the field of electrical engineering, a breadboard is a fully functioning prototype without the industrial design. We can do the same for an interaction idea and choose not to specify any visual design.</p>
<p>To do this we specify three things:</p>
 
 Places — Things you can navigate to, like screens, modals etc. 
 Afforandances — Things users can act on, like buttons, menus but also interface copy. 
 Connection Lines — These show how affordances take users to different places. 
 
<p>Places go on top, affordances go underneath, connections define the flow.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  











  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>By staying in low-fidelity, the breadboarding and fat marker sketching leave room for designers later in the process.</p>
 The problem 
<p>One problem with breadboards is that the connection lines can get messy.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>A slightly different approach is using a <a href="https://miro.com">Miro</a> board and using its ability to link to objects. Clicking on a link will move the current view to the linked object.</p>
<p>Because Miro zooms into the object that was linked, once you click a link, it can be helpful to link to a frame around the place/location in the breadboard. That way you never zoom in too far.</p>









  

    
  
    

      

      
        
          
        
        

        
          
            
          
            
          
        
          
        

        
      
        
      

    
  


  


<p>Here's a animated gif of how it works in practice.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated housing issues across the world, drawing attention to the challenges of access, sustainability, and public health and wellbeing. Each city is tackling its own set of location-specific obstacles that intersect with global forces in different ways.</p>



<p>On the plus side, the situation has sped-up digitisation and ushered in long-overdue changes that improve efficiency, help democratise access to housing and boost sustainability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So how can governments, citizens and landlords of all types harness these opportunities and collaborate to shape housing of the future so that it works for everyone, everywhere? We take a look at some of the challenges highlighted by the pandemic, and a selection of exciting initiatives being pioneered to address them.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Addressing supply 



<p>As digitisation gathers pace, the power of data is being used across the world by forward-thinking policymakers to improve housing outcomes. In the UK, local and national governments are employing AI-powered geospatial technology that uses big data to map and analyze urban land, revealing its development potential for a range of use cases. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2020/10/29/geospatial-technology-could-solve-the-uk-housing-crisis/">According to Forbes</a>, “Supporting the UK government’s need to build efficient housing, organizations such as LandClan and Esri use this technology to identify the right living and working environments, helping facilitate building plans that take into account the best outcomes for residents, developers and investors alike.</p>



<blockquote><p>Catalyzed by the Covid-19 crisis, the construction industry is leveraging technology to address key inefficiencies – and passing savings on to buyers and renters.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/08/here-s-how-smart-construction-could-transform-home-building-after-covid-19/">Catalyzed by the Covid-19 crisis</a>, which limits the number of workers allowed on site and extends the completion time of projects, the construction industry is leveraging technology to address key inefficiencies – and passing savings on to buyers and renters. Building Information Modelling, for example, has seen more widespread uptake in the past year, allowing stakeholders to meet virtually and share data across disciplines, significantly speeding up the process at the design phase. At the same time, artificial intelligence is being <a href="https://fluxus-prefab.com/fluxhouse-generative/">used to assess</a> things like cost and locale in a virtual environment – massively speeding up the decision-making process at an early stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, technology developments like <a href="https://3dprintedhouse.nl/en/project-info/project-milestone/">3D printing are being used</a> to support faster, cheaper, more environmentally friendly methods of construction.</p>



 2. Empowering citizens and community&nbsp; 



<p>Initiatives to <a href="https://www.mobie.org.uk/">engage the community in housing development</a> existed already, but the onset of the pandemic prompted government, industry and citizens to collaborate in unprecedented ways. Across Europe, events like <a href="https://wirvsvirus.org/">Wir vs Virus</a> and <a href="https://theglobalhack.com/">The Global Hack</a> were set up to tap into the collective insights and expertise from different parts of the community to address emerging shortfalls in urban and community infrastructure. Last year, Housing 2020, Europe’s largest housing festival, hosted a <a href="https://cihhousing.com/virtual-festival-hackathon/virtual-festival-hackathon/climate-change-hackathon">climate change hackathon</a> to spark ideas to engage, educate and motivate the entire housing sector to adopt a climate emergency approach to all their decision making.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The onset of the pandemic prompted government, industry and citizens to collaborate in unprecedented ways.</p></blockquote>



<p>Covid restrictions, including social distancing and lockdowns, also saw <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coliving-insights-no2-here-stay-lachlan-sloan/">loneliness skyrocket</a>. Yet, despite the challenges of living in large groups during a pandemic, many <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201208-how-communal-living-groups-are-riding-out-the-pandemic">intentional communities</a> and <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/11/how-has-covid-19-changed-proptech-and-how-are-startups-fighting-back/">co-living spaces</a> have thrived – with residents enjoying a heightened <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/coliving-insights-no2-here-stay-lachlan-sloan/">sense of community and wellbeing</a> while retaining access to <a href="https://www.ic.org/intentional-communities-fared-pandemic/">reliable digital resources</a>.</p>



 3. 100% digital rental process 



<p>Perhaps the most significant impact in the last 12 months has been the accelerated push for the real estate industry to be more digital. Digital contracts are starting to become the norm, with Vonovia, one of Germany’s largest housing companies, recently introducing <a href="https://presse.vonovia.de/de-de/aktuelles/210421-digitaler-mietvertrag-kunden-app">digital lease signing</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bureaucracy is a major hurdle for renters and landlords alike. Real estate agencies have tended to <a href="https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/11/how-has-covid-19-changed-proptech-and-how-are-startups-fighting-back/">work mostly offline</a>, dealing with piles of paperwork and in-person meetings. For renters, applying for a home can be a major upheaval, especially for new arrivals, freelancers and those with non-traditional forms of income. At the same time, landlords and property managers are sometimes unable to access suitable tenants due to communication issues and data privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digitisation provides an opportunity for the industry to address legacy issues and recognise the realities of renting in the 21st century. They can better respond to customer demand for digital end-to-end processes, and select tenants efficiently while accommodating a diversity of applicant backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Digitisation provides an opportunity for the industry to address legacy issues and recognise the realities of renting in the 21st century.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://domilabs.io/">Domi</a> is using a cutting-edge, decentralised technology called self-sovereign identity (SSI) to provide a unique solution. Their digital passport allows users to own and control their own data, and provides a verifiable and transparent way for individuals, companies and governments to exchange private information. Potential renters can share only the data that’s relevant, while proving their income and other essential details that landlords require. Landlords and property managers get peace of mind through access to relevant information about their tenants, while guaranteeing data privacy and digitally managing contracts and tenant relationships.&nbsp;</p>

 Audi trusts in IDnow platform for new mobility concept „Audi on demand Subscribe“ 
<p>Munich, June 1st 2021, IDnow, a leading platform-as-a-service provider for identity verification, supports the international automotive company AUDI AG with a digital solution for identity verification for the new subscription offer “Audi on demand Subscribe”.</p>
<p>In mid-May, the fully integrated subscription model<a href="https://audiondemand.de/subscribe/"> “Audi on demand Subscribe”</a> was launched in the first dealerships of the brand with the four rings in Germany. Customers can use it to digitally rent an Audi for a period of four to twelve months. For Audi, the focus is on flexibility and convenience for the user. In order to offer customers a fast and smooth process that fits in with the digital strategy, Audi relies on IDnow’s AutoIdent. In this process, the customer’s ID and driving license data are automatically read in a user-friendly process and checked for authenticity with the help of AI and machine learning technologies.</p>
<p>“For us, the focus is on the customers and their customer journey. When designing the subscription model, it was particularly important to us to integrate a fast and completely digital process for identity verification – this is what our target group expects. We are pleased to be working with IDnow and to be able to offer our customers this smooth process,” says Martin Wallenborn, Head of Business Development Sales Germany at AUDI AG. With “Audi on demand Subscribe”, the automobile group is supplementing its previous “Audi on demand Rent” offer, which enables short-term rentals of up to 28 days.</p>
<p>“With its subscription offer, Audi has created a service that needs a convenient and fast application route. Our team has come up with a great solution that fits exactly the requirements of the Audi brand and its customers,” says Oliver Obitayo, Chief Sales Officer at IDnow.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its capabilities in recent years far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers of online and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe.</p>

<p>The excitement that accompanied the recent pilot concert in Liverpool showed that after enduring 14 months of lockdown, the UK public has been craving the return of music and good times. This is further supported by a <a href="https://www.festicket.com/magazine/news/roadmap-out-of-lockdown-survey-over-90-of-uk-festival-goers-feel-confident-attending-a-live-event-th/">survey of music fans</a>, which found that 90% of the 140,000 people polled feel confident to attend a live festival this year. However, with potential issues around Covid safety, cancellation insurance, customer experience, ticket touts and data breaches hanging over organisers in this new post-Covid world, it’s clear that new solutions are needed if the summer festival season is going to be successful.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">Government having so far fa</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">iled to put cancellation insurance in place for festival organisers</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-56828608">no official guidance having yet been published for mass gatherings</a> after June 21st, to say that festival organisers are nervous would be a gross understatement. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/may/04/more-than-a-quarter-of-uk-music-festivals-cancelled-over-insurance-fears">Glastonbury and Download are among some of the big names to have cancelled so far</a> – in what should have been the year where glorious live events returned triumphantly.</p>
<p>It’s really no surprise to see some festival organisers decide that staging an event simply isn’t worth the risk. <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/984501/S1235_Eighty-eighth_SAGE_meeting.pdf">Sage’s latest minutes</a>, from its meeting on 5th May 2021, predict that any new Covid variant that is highly transmissible or that substantially escapes immunity could lead to a “very significant wave of infections”.</p>
<p> With the average cost of staging an independent festival coming in at a whopping £6 million, the recent AIF member survey – which showed that almost 93% of respondents do not plan on staging their events without some form of government-backed insurance or indemnity scheme – makes perfect sense as organisers won’t want to risk forking out on events that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/festival-insurance-remains-single-biggest-worry-as-government-is-urged-to-back-up-events-2924299">could yet be cancelled by the Government</a> if there’s another spike.</p>
<p>Greater Responsibility for safety</p>
<p>This year, the responsibility organisers have for the safety of their attendees is far greater than ever. Now, on top of their previous safety protocols they will need to think about things like minimising Covid infection risk and protecting valuable personal health data.</p>
<p>Over the last 14 months, enforcing social distancing has become a key responsibility for venue owners who are dedicated to keeping patrons safe – but at a festival this will be nigh on impossible. Add packed mosh pits and inhibition-reducing alcohol to the mix and any chance of distance diminishes even further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If people already infected with Covid are allowed entry into a festival, there is a real risk of creating a Covid hotspot. This, of course, would be incredibly damaging for organisers, whose reputation would come under fire and it&nbsp;could lead to the closure of future festivals – which would damage confidence in the industry. It is because of this that organisers will need to combine testing and technology to ensure only people who are attested Covid safe; either through a negative test or fully immunised, are granted entry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart technology to avoid irritating queues</p>
<p>Festival organisers will also need to do better at managing delays than other sectors. In recent weeks, we’ve seen <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56743571">Heathrow airport reporting delays of up to six hours</a>. This would be catastrophic at a festival – to keep festival goers waiting, after they have already waited for months to have a great time, would only lead to frustration and likely cause a bad reputation for the festival itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To minimise this and to prevent the&nbsp;risk of infected people trying to gain entry to the festival onsite – which would pose another safety risk – organisers should look to the combination of testing and technology to allow people to capture their Covid status in advance and demonstrate they meet protocols through a private and secure digital health pass.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to ticket touts</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/25/parasitic-ticket-touts-undermining-music-festivals-covid-tracing">Reports have revealed that ticket touts </a>are taking advantage of the Covid situation and pent up demand to really rip-off consumers.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.sharonhodgson.org/ticket_touts_campaign">Labour MP, Sharon Hodgson</a>, has rightly called for the Government – which has itself been promising to ‘Build Back Better’ – to use this opportunity to introduce measures that make events Covid secure and stop ticket touts from deceiving customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self Sovereign Digital IDs are the answer to this. Implemented effectively, this system allows festival organisers to provide customers with a completely private digital ID wallet, where they can also store their entry ticket and Covid status as part of a slick entry process that would instantly make ticket touts a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Keeping personal and health data completely safe</p>
<p>Medical data is at least <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/nhs-cyber-attack-medical-data-records-stolen-why-so-valuable-sell-financial-a7733171.html">10 times more valuable than financial data on the dark web</a> so any record that is made of individuals’ Covid status by festival organisers needs to be watertight. Over recent years, numerous music festivals have reported major data breaches. In 2014, Belgian festival <a href="https://www.scmagazine.com/home/security-news/data-breach-compromises-64000-tomorrowland-festival-attendees/">Tomorrowland saw a data breach</a> involving the information of 64,000 festival-goers and, in 2017, details of nearly <a href="https://www.itpro.co.uk/data-leakage/28259/1-million-coachella-festival-goers-hacked">one million Coachella attendees were leaked</a> from its database. Closer to home, only last year, industry giant <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54931873">Ticketmaster was fined £1.25m for failing to keep their customers’&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54931873">personal data secure</a> following a cyber attack on the website in 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These instances demonstrate that the data threat is all too real. Add Covid data into the mix though, and the risk becomes even greater.</p>
<p>This is another way that a digital health pass based on Self-Sovereign ID can help. Whereas most data breaches are the result of centralised databases being hacked, with SSID, an individual’s personal data is stored on their individual phone and is never seen or accessed by anyone else. It is as secure as it is possible to be and removes the responsibility from the event organiser for processing their customer’s data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The future of safe festivals awaits</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see live music get back on track with the pilot event at Liverpool but it’s unclear how this system will scale if expanded from the 3,000 attendees at that event to the more than 100,000 who visit some of the UK’s biggest festivals, nor indeed is it clear how it will work when numerous events are happening all over the country at around the same time.</p>
<p>That’s why many festival organisers will rightly remain concerned about issues such as Covid safety, cancellation insurance, customer experience, ticket touts and data breaches – and will know that they need to take action themselves to tackle these issues.</p>
<p>The answer to all of these problems lies in the combination of a smart implementation of testing and technology. At BLOK BioScience, we are helping our partners to deliver testing on a large scale and using our unique Self-Sovereign ID technology-based digital health pass – which is the only health pass in the world to be certified by the ID2020 – to enable event organisers to provide visitors with a completely secure and private record of their Covid status.</p>
<p>Our flexible system is completely interoperable, meaning that it can plug into a festival’s existing systems, and can allow customers to store their digital ID, Covid status and festival ticket all on one device. The system enables super-fast entry as visitors use their BLOK Pass to prove they meet the entry criteria in less than 30 seconds, with a green QR code granting them access, amber meaning they need to take a test and red illustrating they are a potential Covid risk. It’s delivered by security and customer service teams via the super-easy BLOK Verify app, which sits on their mobile device.</p>
<p>If you are planning an event this year then a system like this could be the key to you providing a safe environment that protects the health and the data of your customers, that ensures a smooth entry system and minimal queues and that completely eradicates the ticket tout problem. All of this will boost the reputation of your event and could even protect your festival from being closed if there is a spike in infections between now and the event – as you can prove you have robust safety measures in place.

 19 FAQs on Verifiable Credentials and Self-Sovereign Identity <p>This article has some FAQs on the basics of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI)</a>.</p> What is an Identity? <p>An identity is a unique characteristic, value, or document that has a one-to-one relationship with only one entity. For individuals, identity is biometric information, a unique number such as a driver’s license number, etc. However, the key aspect is that this information must be owned solely by that&nbsp;entity.</p> What is Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI)? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">SSI</a> is a digital movement that aims to enable individuals or organizations to have sole ownership of their identity, and to have control over how their data is shared and&nbsp;used.</p> What are Verifiable Credentials (VCs)? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">Verifiable credentials</a>, or VCs in short, are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically.</p><p>There are three essential components of verifiable credentials, and they&nbsp;are:</p>  It is machine verifiable  It is secure and tamper-proof  Has been issued by a competent authority.  <p>Here’s how a VC looks&nbsp;like</p> {<br>  // set the context, which establishes the special terms we will be using<br>  // such as 'issuer' and 'alumniOf'.<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/context">@context</a>": [<br>    "<a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1">https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/examples/v1</a>"<br>  ],<br>  // specify the identifier for the credential<br>  "id": "<a href="http://example.edu/credentials/1872">http://example.edu/credentials/1872</a>",<br>  // the credential types, which declare what data to expect in the credential<br>  "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "AlumniCredential"],<br>  // the entity that issued the credential<br>  "issuer": "<a href="https://example.edu/issuers/565049">https://example.edu/issuers/565049</a>",<br>  // when the credential was issued<br>  "issuanceDate": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",<br>  // claims about the subjects of the credential<br>  "credentialSubject": {<br>    // identifier for the only subject of the credential<br>    "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",<br>    // assertion about the only subject of the credential<br>    "alumniOf": {<br>      "id": "did:example:c276e12ec21ebfeb1f712ebc6f1",<br>      "name": [{<br>        "value": "Example University",<br>        "lang": "en"<br>      }, {<br>        "value": "Exemple d'Université",<br>        "lang": "fr"<br>      }]<br>    }<br>  },<br>  // digital proof that makes the credential tamper-evident<br>  // see the NOTE at end of this section for more detail<br>  "proof": {<br>    // the cryptographic signature suite that was used to generate the signature<br>    "type": "RsaSignature2018",<br>    // the date the signature was created<br>    "created": "2017-06-18T21:19:10Z",<br>    // purpose of this proof<br>    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",<br>    // the identifier of the public key that can verify the signature<br>    "verificationMethod": "<a href="https://example.edu/issuers/keys/1">https://example.edu/issuers/keys/1</a>",<br>    // the digital signature value<br>    "jws": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImI2NCI6ZmFsc2UsImNyaXQiOlsiYjY0Il19..TCYt5X<br>      sITJX1CxPCT8yAV-TVkIEq_PbChOMqsLfRoPsnsgw5WEuts01mq-pQy7UJiN5mgRxD-WUc<br>      X16dUEMGlv50aqzpqh4Qktb3rk-BuQy72IFLOqV0G_zS245-kronKb78cPN25DGlcTwLtj<br>      PAYuNzVBAh4vGHSrQyHUdBBPM"<br> }<br> } <p>Who are Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers in a Verifiable Credential?</p><p>An issuer is an entity that is authorized to issue a credential. These issuers are typically government organizations, healthcare centers, banks and financial institutions, schools and universities, startups, etc.</p><p>A holder is someone who is the owner of the credential and has complete control over how it can be managed, with whom these credentials can be shared, or revoked. Holders are typically individuals or organizations.</p><p>A verifier is an entity that verifies a credential and ensures that it comes from a competent issuer, is tamper-proof, and is still relevant (not expired or revoked). A verifier takes the verifiable presentation from the holder to determine its authenticity.</p> What’s the Difference Between a Verifiable Credential and a Verifiable Claim? <p>At the basic level, a claim is a statement. A claim becomes a credential when it is verifiable and backed by evidence.</p><p>In the digital identity world, a verifiable claim is a piece of information about the subject, and these are made by an issuer. To become a credential, each of these claims must be verifiable in some&nbsp;way.</p><p>Specifically, the verifier must be able to ascertain the following.</p>  Who issued the credential?  That the credential has not been tampered with since it was&nbsp;issued  That the credential has not expired or been&nbsp;revoked   How to Verify a Credential? <p>With physical credentials, this is accomplished through some proof of authenticity embedded directly in the credential itself like a chip or hologram. It can also be done by checking directly with the issuer that the credential is valid, accurate, and current. But this manual verification process can be difficult and time-consuming — a major reason why there is a worldwide black market in falsified credentials.</p><p>This brings us to one of the fundamental advantages of verifiable credentials: using cryptography and the Internet, they can be digitally verified in seconds. This verification process can answer the following four questions:</p>  Is the credential in a standard format and does it contain the data the verifier&nbsp;needs?  Does it include a valid digital signature from the&nbsp;issuer?  Is the credential still valid, that is, not expired or&nbsp;revoked?  If applicable, does the credential (or its signature) provide cryptographic proof that the holder of the credential is the subject of the credential?  <p>(Credits to the book “Self-sovereign identity“ for this explanation)</p> What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)? <p>A basic building block of SSI is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>. These are a type of unique identifiers (URI) that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>These DIDs come with certain properties and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Does not require a centralized registration authority  Many DIDs use the distributed ledger technology or any other decentralized network, though it is not mandatory  It is a permanent identifier because it does not depend on a single third-party or centralized registry for its existence.  Can be cryptographically verified  They connect a DID subject (the entity identified by the DID) with a DID document (a set of data that describes the DID subject) to enable the subject to have trustable interactions.  They are interoperable and portable, provided they conform to the existing standards laid down by&nbsp;W3C   What is a DID Document? <p>A DID document is a JSON-LD object that contains a set of data that describes the DID subject including the cryptographic signatures, verification methods, or just about anything that will enable the DID subject to have trustable interactions with other entities on the&nbsp;network.</p> What is a DID Resolution? <p>DID resolution is the process of getting from a DID to its DID Document. It is analogous to the resolution of DNS name to IP&nbsp;address</p><p>DID Document contains metadata of a DID subject. It contains the minimum amount of information to connect with the DID subject. The key information contained in a DID document is public keys, service endpoints, and authentication methods.</p> What is a DID&nbsp;Method? <p>DID methods are the component that helps a DID to resolve a DID document. It defines how DID documents are created, read, updated, and deleted on a&nbsp;network.</p><p>DID methods are often associated with a verifiable data registry, which is a system that brings together DIDs, DID documents, and DID methods. Some examples of verifiable data registries are trusted databases, decentralized databases, distributed ledger, and government ID databases like DigiLocker. Sometimes, more than one type of registry can be used in the same ecosystem.</p><p>A DID document looks like&nbsp;this:</p> {<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/context">@context</a>": [<br>    "<a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1">https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1">https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1</a>"<br>  ]<br>  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br>  "authentication": [{<br>    // used to authenticate as did:...fghi<br>    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",<br>    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",<br>    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br>    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"<br>  }]<br>} <p>In terms of implementation, a DID method is defined by its specification that precisely defines how DIDs and DID documents are created, updated, deactivated, and resolved.</p> What is a Sidetree Protocol? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">Sidetree protocol</a> is an open blockchain-agnostic protocol developed by DIF and supported by Microsoft. The core idea of this protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger&nbsp;system.</p><p>This protocol is designed to overcome many technical problems in existing implementations that include high throughput and cost, presence of centralized authorities, lack of scalability, and more. The Sidetree protocol bridges the need for a decentralized and open protocol as it batches together JSON (a standard for representing structured data) operations to lower the associated costs, improve throughput, enhance scalability, and at the same, allow these operations to be anchored to any decentralized identity&nbsp;network.</p><p>It also helps to create unique identifiers that are controlled and managed by users with their public key infrastructure. Further, it conforms to the W3C specifications, so developers can use the decentralized identifier (DID)&nbsp;methods.</p> What are Peer&nbsp;DIDs? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/peer-dids-an-off-ledger-did-implementation-5cb6ee6eb168">Peer DIDs</a> are implemented as a direct interaction between the two parties to a transaction.</p><p>The way that two entities interact with each other directly without involving a network is the core principle of peer DID&nbsp;methods.</p><p>The idea behind creating these peer DID methods is to ensure a cheap, fast, secure, and scalable way to create and maintain private relationships between two entities. Let’s say, Alice and Bob are two entities who are interacting with each other, so only both of them care about the transaction and have a need to resolve their respective DIDs.</p> What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs? <p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)</a> is a cryptographic protocol where one entity can prove its identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p><p>When you say that an entity has an identity, what you mean is that the entity has a series of claims that are used to uniquely identify it. Breaking it down further, we can say that this process comprises of two&nbsp;steps,</p>  Creating a claim, where each claim is a subset that contributes to making an individual unique. Some examples of claims are date of birth, passport number, driver’s license, Social Security Number, or any other government-ID that belongs only to an entity and can be used solely to identify&nbsp;it.  Proving the claim — A means by which this claim is proven without the actual information.   What is&nbsp;IPFS? <p>InterPlanterary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing files and tracking their versions in a distributed file system. It works by connecting all devices on a network to the same file system, and each file in it is identified by a unique crypto hash of its contents.</p> What are BBS+ Signatures? <p>The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/deciphering-bbs-signatures-e853bbf437bf">BBS+ signature</a> scheme is a Digital Signature Scheme (DSS) with two distinct parties, namely, the signer and the signature holder. Here the signature holder is the owner of a signature while the signer is the entity authenticating that the signature belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>It is based on Pedersen commitment, a scheme that allows a sender to commit to a secret value that can be revealed in the future. Until then, the sender transmits a commitment to preserve the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>This commitment is the connecting aspect between the signature holder and the signer, and the contents are blinded until the holder decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, these signatures give complete control to the holder to decide when and what must be revealed, and follow the principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) where the holder can prove the required identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p> What is a Custodial Wallet? <p>In the context of a decentralized wallet, having private keys means that you have full control over the contents of your wallet. A decentralized wallet may be capable of holding your crypto funds or holding your digital identity, typically on your hardware (i.e. no central servers CRUDing your data). However, many people are not acquainted with digital wallet, blockchain technology, and the concept of public-private keys. A Custodial Wallet is defined as a wallet in which the private keys are held by a third party. Meaning, the third party has full control over the contents of your wallet while you only have to permit CRUD operations on wallet contents. That way you don’t have to worry about losing your private&nbsp;key.</p> What is&nbsp;PKI? <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a>, or PKI in short, is a cryptographic system that consists of a key pair, one private and the other public. Both these keys work in tandem and are used for encrypting data and sharing it with others, so the contents can be seen only by the intended recipient.</p><p>Let’s understand how it works with an example. When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she encrypts the message with Bob’s public key and sends it. In turn, Bob uses his private key that’s associated with the public key to decrypt and read the&nbsp;message.</p> What is a Verifiable Presentation? <p>A verifiable presentation is the collation of credentials that a holder wants to share with a verifier.</p><p>A holder can get signed credentials from different issuers and store them in the digital wallet. When the holder wants to share a set of credentials, they are collated into a presentation, and this is shared with the verifier.</p> What is&nbsp;SSIaaS? <p>SSI as a service is what Affinidi’s core aims to build for our applications. An application (i.e. an organization, a developer) that wishes to leverage SSI principles for their users’ identity can currently consume our SDK methods. The idea is to enable applications to do things like DID creation, VC sharing, etc. via API endpoints i.e.&nbsp;SSIaaS</p><p>To learn more about what we do, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.

 Ocean Protocol works with Raven Protocol to add Federated Learning to Ocean Market via Compute-to-Data <p>Ocean democratizes access to datasets and AI while Raven’s decentralized algorithms allow cost-efficient training of neural&nbsp;networks</p><p><a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> is partnering with <a href="https://www.ravenprotocol.com/">Raven Protocol</a>, a decentralized and distributed deep-learning training protocol providing cost-efficient training of deep neural networks.</p><p>Raven will become a Compute Provider on <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>, publishing a range of algorithms from Machine Learning to Federated Analytics and Federated Learning. <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a> on Ocean Market resolves the tradeoff between the benefits of using private data, and the risks of exposing it. It lets the data stay on-premise, yet allows 3rd parties to run specific compute jobs on it to get useful compute results like averaging or building an AI&nbsp;model.</p><blockquote>AI is at the heart of what Ocean Protocol does, so we’re very excited by this partnership. Ocean’s mission is to democratize access to data sets and AI capabilities; this aligns perfectly with Raven’s mission to provide cost-efficient and faster training of deep neural networks using a decentralized and distributed network of compute nodes. Together we are one step closer to unlocking the Open Data&nbsp;Economy.</blockquote><blockquote>— Razvan Olteanu, Chief Operating Officer at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Ethically handling the privacy and security of AI training data has been a priority for Raven, who have been working on integrating various encryption techniques into their protocol. Compute-to-Data on Ocean Market fits this need perfectly:</p>  First, Data Publishers approve AI algorithms to run on their data. These algorithms could be published by Raven Protocol or other third&nbsp;parties.  Then, Compute-to-Data orchestrates remote computation and execution on data to train AI models. The remote computation could be handled by the Raven Network or other Compute Providers approved by the Data Publisher.  <p>In Ocean, a Compute-to-Data infrastructure is set up as a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on, for example, AWS or Azure in the background. This Kubernetes cluster is responsible for running the actual compute jobs, out of sight for marketplace clients and end users. While this is an incredible feat in itself, users and Data Publishers may want an alternative option in the Compute Providers they choose to approve. The spirit of decentralization may be a philosophical choice for some, but a strict requirement for others. Raven Protocol provides the decentralized option when choosing a Compute Provider.</p><p>On top of that, Raven provides an additional layer of privacy for Ocean Compute-to-Data. Raven Protocol could publish, for example, a Federated Learning algorithm. When run, a neural network is randomly initialized. Weight updates are computed next to the data itself in a data silo and then sent to the neural network. This is repeated in data silo #1, data silo #2, data silo #3, and so on.

<p>In this post, we explore recent trends in data regulation and discuss their implications for businesses at large, with a particular emphasis on the ASEAN region. In addition, we outline how businesses can utilise Credify’s suite of products to facilitate compliance with these regulations and — importantly — monetise their data in a lawful manner.</p>



<p>Sound too good to be true? Read on!</p>



 Data Protection Is Trending 



<p>The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018 and introduced a comprehensive, harmonised data protection regime. With limited exceptions, the regime applies to all data processing entities that deal with individuals in the EU, regardless of where they are based. As such, ASEAN businesses need to also familiarise themselves with the GDPR’s implications.</p>



<p>The GDPR contains a suite of rights designed to place consumers at the helm. As we have mentioned in&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/credify-mission-statement-products-and-research-directions-aea975d26436">previous&nbsp;articles</a>, many businesses have sought to exploit users’ personal data by selling it off to third parties in an opaque manner. Social media platforms have engaged in particularly egregious instances of abuse, with the Cambridge Analytica scandal still looming large over our heads.</p>



<p>Amongst the GDPR’s most consequential rights are the following:</p>



  Lawfulness of processing&nbsp;(Article 6): the user needs to have consented to the types of processing that the business will undertake (including transfers of user data to third parties).  Right of access&nbsp;(Article 15): this requires businesses to provide users with a copy of the personal data that they hold upon request.  Right to erasure&nbsp;(Article 17): users can request that their personal data be completely erased from a businesses’ systems, unless this needs to be kept for regulatory purposes.  Right to data portability&nbsp;(Article 20):users have the right to request that their data be transferred from one service provider to another.  



Key principles underpinning the GDPR



<p>Note that the GDPR requires businesses to&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;these actions, as opposed to being mere bystanders. The fines for business that process personal data and do not comply with the GDPR can reach €20 million or 4% of global turnover (whichever is greatest!).</p>



<p>Although these fines may seem unnecessary punitive, they reflect the seriousness with which regulators are taking data processing activities. After all, many people spend the bulk of their working hours in front of a laptop, generating a greater footprint in the digital economy than in the tangible world. Regulators view personal data as a valuable form of personal property, no different than our tangible possessions. Consequently, unauthorised activities by data processing businesses are regarded as forms of data abuse or identity theft.</p>



 Strengthening Local Regulations 



<p>businesses need to act upon. There are, of course, local regulations that also come into play when dealing with users in specific geographies. Nonetheless, the GDPR is influencing the development of these regimes, pushing regulators towards a more comprehensive and consumer-centric model.</p>



<p>Vietnam is the perfect example to highlight this trend. At present, the country’s data protection regime is highly fragmented. Data protection laws are spread across 50 legal instruments on diverse subject matters, which hinders consistency and interpretability (to the detriment of both businesses and consumers). [1]</p>



<p>To address this situation, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security has presented a draft decree that aims to lay down a unified and extensive set of data protection rules. Many provisions in the decree mirror those of the GDPR, such as the need to process data within the boundaries of users’ consent and to notify users of activities involving their personal data. [2]</p>



<p>Singapore is in the process of updating their data protection regime, while Indonesia is in the process of finalising comprehensive data protection legislation (scheduled for November 2020). [3] We expect other countries in the ASEAN region to revamp their local regulations too. So far, Japan is the only neighbouring nation to have been granted GDPR-adequacy status by the European Commission, confirming the compatibility of their respective data protection regimes. [4]</p>



The World Federation of Advertisers maintains a helpful privacy map



 The Comply Advantage 



<p>Now is the time for businesses to evaluate their data management processes and consider whether sufficient protections are being afforded to their customers. The failure to do so can leave businesses liable to not only regulatory sanctions, but also exposed to the potential loss of customers. As a result of this regulatory shift, consumers will increasingly demand that their data be handled in a lawful and transparent manner. On that basis, data management strategies should be at the forefront of businesses’ minds.</p>



<p>If you’ve come across our previous articles, you may already be aware of work that we’re pursuing at Credify (see e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/credify-mission-statement-products-and-research-directions-aea975d26436">here</a>&nbsp;for an outline of our products). We think that Credify can be the perfect partner for businesses looking to undertake this regulatory transition. Credify’s business model is grounded on the need to provide consumers with greater control over their data. As such, its products respect the principles enshrined in regulations like the GDPR, facilitating the data management process in a transparent and efficient manner.</p>



<p>In particular, Credify’s idX system enables businesses to associate personal data with individual user accounts. Through Credify’s idPass application, users can monitor the personal data that each business is holding and track how their data is being used in an auditable log. The application also allows users to check whether their personal data is up to date; everyone hates correspondence that is sent to an old email or residential address. Importantly, businesses can obtain users’ consent for specific activities (such as sending data to an affiliate or commercial partner) through the idX system — a notification will appear on the idPass application and will record the users’ consent (or refusal) to the transfer.</p>



<p>Credify’s solution is privacy-centric, since Credify’s ability to access users’ data is highly restricted. In fact, we are proud to be working with world-renowned cryptographers and technologists to provide users and businesses with strong security assurances. At present, Credify is using proven technical standards (such as Open ID Connect) and the latest auditing technologies (such as blockchain) to meet our privacy and security objectives.</p>



 Gaining An Edge 



<p>Although this wave of regulation may pose initial challenges, it will also open up new opportunities for forward-thinking players. Businesses can still adopt processes to monetise their user data and acquire data from other businesses, so long as users’ rights are fully respected.</p>



<p>As we hinted above, Credify’s tools can also be used to support a lawful monetisation strategy. Let’s imagine that a marketplace is willing to share a user’s data with an insurance company, which is looking to build a diverse profile about a potential client. The marketplace requests the specific user’s consent and, once accepted by said user through the idPass, Credify can open up a direct channel between the businesses to handle the transfer. In turn, the audit log will be updated to reflect this activity.</p>



<p>We&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/credify/the-next-data-frontier-c6e6e6dc9c72">previously</a>&nbsp;introduced the concept of a data highway. To move data from one end-point to another, users are likely to ask for some sort of incentive (or “toll”). After all, their data is valuable and they are entitled to refuse the transfer if they so choose. Popular incentives can take the form of discounts or vouchers. In the example above, the insurance company may pass on savings attained in the due diligence process (as a result of the data transfer) in the form of lower premiums for participating users. We would also expect the insurance company to compensate the marketplace for each user that they are able to acquire. In short, every party is able to benefit from this transaction.</p>







 Summing up 



<p>We have provided a roadmap for the future of data regulations, with a focus on the ASEAN region. We encourage all businesses to start adapting to this regulatory shift, irrespective of how developed local data protection regimes currently are. This trend is set to strengthen in the coming years and there are significant risks to being caught off guard.</p>



<p>If you’re a business looking for a technological solution to these problems, as well as an avenue to monetise your data in a lawful manner, look no further. Credify has the tools that you need and is willing to work with you to facilitate your success.</p>



Which side of the road are you on?

<p>InsideBitcoins: ...Among Ignis’s unique selling points is its ability to run what it calls lightweight smart contracts, which means that not every node on the chain needs to be involved in computing and verifying the transactions. That makes smart contracts quicker to deploy and cheaper to run, especially compared to current market leader Ethereum.</p>

 How I built a decentralized marketing department powered by NFTs in just 13&nbsp;minutes Vive la Sybil resistance! The gift <p>In about 13 minutes we gonna create both an immense amount of value and a decentralized marketing department. A task impossible for a regular article. Thus this is not a regular one. This is the craziest and the sanest thing you’ve stumbled upon in the crypto space recently. Take a moment, relax and read&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Inspired by <a href="https://kernel.community/module-0/">Kernel modules</a> (thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptowanderer">Andy</a>) that conclude with <a href="https://kernel.community/module-7/">the gift</a> — a beautiful article on&nbsp;giving.</blockquote><p>It all started with a gift. On March 14, 2021, <a href="https://twitter.com/BokkyPooBah">The Officious BokkyPooBah</a>, a famous frog and fossil photographer (and Ethereum dev), <a href="https://twitter.com/BokkyPooBah/status/1371096562089164807">gave away</a> a considerable number of <a href="https://mooncatrescue.com/">MoonCats</a> to Ethereum developers. Surprisingly enough, I had one&nbsp;too.</p><p>After that, I started to see MoonCats almost daily. A <a href="https://twitter.com/songadaymann/status/1372987465234059266">song</a>, an <a href="https://twitter.com/icebergy_/status/1372404295581188096">AR-kitten</a>, a kitten on a <a href="https://twitter.com/SprinklesNFT/status/1373015859254415362">tiny electronic photo frame</a>, kittens on avatars (<a href="https://twitter.com/nicksdjohnson">Nick.eth</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness">Evan Van Ness</a>), and <a href="https://twitter.com/cybercodetwins/status/1372597926518657031">all</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Don_keyedjote/status/1373126907642793989">other</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/KeramDesign/status/1371173184188383238">sorts</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1372776576731901952">stuff</a>. Some people are celebrating, some appreciating BokkyPooBah, paying back to him and paying forward (I made a <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1375339243128639490">doughnut</a>), some are trying to increase the value of their own&nbsp;cats.</p><p>There’s definitely something here. Intentionally or not all cat owners are promoting the myth of cat rescue. As a consequence the average MoonCat price on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wrapped-mooncatsrescue">OpenSea</a> increases. The act of giving effectively created a marketing department for the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Kittens have no utility (yet). They are “just” collectibles that are first of their kind, a part of blockchain history, and widely recognized by the community. All the kittens have is a myth and they sell nothing but a&nbsp;myth.</p><p>What about projects that do have utility™️? Think of virtually any project in the blockchain space. They have mission, art, memes, they do super-novel stuff, they are first of their kind, they are widely recognized and they are building history. They have their own strong myths. But they usually call it “marketing” and use it to build relationships with customers and sell their product. They never sell their myths directly and usually pay to promote them. There’s probably a better way for&nbsp;them.</p> Non-fungible myths <p>Imagine you want to sell your utility-first project myths directly. You put price tags on logos, icons, article header images, community calls background, etc. You turn all those into NFTs. It may sound weird, but let’s explore&nbsp;further.</p><p>We gonna call those non-fungible myths or NFMs. Same standard, same functionality as NFTs, just a special case of it — myths and their part on sale. We’ll explore if it is possible to bootstrap an additional marketing department for your project with NFMs. We’ll see what it takes to create dynamics similar to the one of MoonCats and what benefits are there for you if you select this&nbsp;path.</p> Easy to&nbsp;try <p>Simplicity. It doesn’t require a lot of effort. The artifacts you need are already there — the ones already mentioned above, logos, icons, etc., plus memes, sketches, prototypes, tweets — a lot of work that is usually considered a byproduct. Just put a “verified” mark on them, wrap them as NFTs and you get some NFMs for a start. Byproduct becomes a product and can be monetized.</p><p>Monetization. Start selling NFMs and you get an additional source of income at almost no&nbsp;cost.</p><p>These are a couple of instant benefits of using NFMs. But really just the tip of the iceberg. There are many wonderful properties of NFMs (inherited from NFTs) that could be leveraged.</p> Self-promoting <p>NFMs are personal. Unlike ERC20 tokens, every NFM is perceived as an item, not a number. It does have an extrinsic (market) value, but also a story, relationship, affection, an intrinsic value.</p><blockquote>Would you prefer to have an Apple stock or the first iMac prototype?</blockquote><p>Every item's price is defined by its owner — not only the market. Every owner is thus incentivized to promote their own item, meaning to sell it in the future or just celebrate ownership.</p><blockquote>How many profiles with <a href="https://twitter.com/thepxlportraits">pixel-portrait</a> avatars do you follow on&nbsp;Twitter?</blockquote><p>And as we’ve seen with MoonCats, promoting a single item promotes the whole project’s mythology and adds value to it. Promotion happens naturally as every holder is a promoter. An NFM-powered project gets an additional promotion channel.</p> Welcoming <p>NFMs are viral. There’s always something to share, to show, to tinker with. Any item could be modified and the number of modifications is unlimited. Even the whole myth could be extended. Any medium works — Image, video, text, sound, and code (programming new mechanics). Any type and any level of skill can&nbsp;benefit.</p><blockquote>How many spin-offs (<a href="https://twitter.com/bganpunks">bastard gan punks</a>) and add-ons (<a href="https://twitter.com/punkbodies">bodies</a>) to <a href="https://twitter.com/larvalabs">cryptopunks</a> you’ve seen so&nbsp;far?</blockquote><p>Creators have incentives to collaborate as they are sharing the popularity of the project’s mythology. Same as owners promote their items, creators promote their modifications and spin-offs. Same as owners, they inevitably promote the original mythology (the project’s) and add value to it. An NFM-powered project naturally attracts contributors.</p> Anti-fragile <p>NFMs are self-sufficient. Let’s expand this one a bit more as we are approaching some really cool&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>The Sky Commuter flying car prototype from the 1990s was <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/flying-car-prototype-from-1990-going-up-for-auction-1678077004">sold on eBay for $130,000</a> and again <a href="https://barrett-jackson.com/Events/Event/Details/1990-CONCEPT-SKY-COMMUTER-AIRCRAFT--178603">here</a>. It has no antique value, the Sky Innovations company is dead and forgotten. What makes the prototype valuable is the myth of “flying cars”, which is still relevant today and will be relevant in the future. In relation to the company, this myth is a super-set myth — it includes the company’s mythology entirely. This myth is strong and lives on its own. Over time it keeps growing and keeps adding value to all the sub-myths and artifacts within&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>Imagine if somebody puts the first mouse prototype by Xerox on auction. Would you be interested to have&nbsp;it?</blockquote><p>Similarly, NFMs get automatically attached to a super-set mythology, the one that is bigger than the project’s. Public goods, automated markets, future of work — these are all super-set myths, that a related project will passively attach to. And there’s always bonus fallback mythology — blockchain history.</p><p>These mythologies will live longer than most of the projects. And NFMs will belong to those myths forever. The stronger the mythology gets, the more valuable the artifacts within that mythology are.</p><p>Thus NFMs are antifragile. Unlike ERC20 tokens they don’t care where the market goes. They are almost insured from dropping to 0. And in the early days, there’s only one way for them — up and to the right. Holders/traders/creators understand that. Which creates an additional FOMO (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out#:~:text=Fear%20of%20missing%20out%20(FOMO,with%20what%20others%20are%20doing.)">definition on wiki</a> incentives for them. NFM-powered project passively acquires value over time by just being&nbsp;there.</p> Nobody is selling their&nbsp;myths <p>Creating non-fungible myths does not require a lot of effort. Project’s byproducts don’t have to be wasted anymore, all the little memes and all the big ones can be monetized. Putting a price tag on those creates strong incentives for anyone to expand the project’s mythology, buy into it, or just share it. Any of those actions increase mythology’s and project’s value.</p><p>This already does look like a marketing department. Owners, creators, traders being its dedicated employees. Marketing becomes diluted through NFMs in the same way as governance is being diluted through airdropped ERC20&nbsp;tokens.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/kicking-off-the-epns-nft-community-drops-6a5c49808cf">EPNS project is issuing NFTs</a> to support their community. As well as <a href="https://app.chiev.net/community/0xdead">MetaGame</a>. <a href="https://badgerdao.medium.com/badger-to-launch-nft-themed-spaceships-with-the-cometh-defi-gaming-platform-7bcc0d325c8">Badger is minting starships</a> together with <a href="https://twitter.com/MUSTCometh">Cometh</a>. <a href="https://zora.co/syndicate/2195">Syndicate protocol</a> and <a href="https://zora.co/mochi">Mochi</a> are selling their NFTs to support development.</p><p>I couldn’t find other utility-first projects that sell NFTs and I found none that sell their myths (NFMs). I see it as an opportunity and gonna take some first-mover advantage for <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a>. In the next section. That would be insane. But before that let’s have a short talk on&nbsp;myths.</p> Super-set myths <p>We’ve seen how projects can make use of their existing myths by wrapping them into NFTs. And how those NFMs are then being auto-attached to its natural super-set myths. This is a kinda passive way to deal with myths. There’s probably a better way. What if we deliberately create our own super-set mythology?</p><p>Hm… But we’ve just discussed how easy it is to build a marketing department with NFMs. It may seem that we are about to diminish its benefits. Creating myths is what marketing departments do. And it requires a lot of&nbsp;effort.</p><p>True, but we can use a vastly underrated blockchain super-power to cut corners. We’ve seen how we can count on artists, buyers, holders, and other individuals that share value through NFMs. To build a myth from scratch we need even more help. For that, we need to share even&nbsp;more.</p><p>The super-power that we can use is synergy. We can create a super-set myth wide enough to include multiple project mythologies. If these projects would then acknowledge the myth, they’d have a shared value. Building the myth would be a much simpler&nbsp;task.</p><p>Synergy is often explained as 1+1 &gt; 2. I believe projects that share value are just about to show us what it really means. In clear&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>One example is <a href="https://twitter.com/PanvalaHQ">Panvala</a>. Panvala puts synergy at its core and creates incentives for projects to share value. Its Digital Identity Coalition (aka <a href="https://t.me/bladerunnerDAO">Bladerunner</a>) brings projects related to human uniqueness and digital identity together. Many projects within that coalition would be considered competitors in the traditional business environment. In the blockchain world, they have a shared budget in PAN token. They decide together what to spend it&nbsp;on.</p><p>Another example is <a href="https://twitter.com/nowdaoit">DAOhaus’s</a> DAO of DAOs (called UberHaus) in which over 50 member DAOs govern the DAOhaus ecosystem, including the HAUS token supply and the development priorities. <a href="https://twitter.com/PrimeDAO_">PrimeDAO</a> has a similar approach. There’s an emerging term for the phenomenon — Federated DAOs. I bet it is worth watching&nbsp;closely.</p><p>Apart from those, I couldn’t find other examples of projects that share any real value. That’s another opportunity — not only for <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> but for you as well. In the next part of the article, we gonna create our own example of value shared by multiple projects. This time the value is going to be shared through NFMs. This time you’ll have a first-mover advantage too.</p> Starting the resistance <p>Thank you for reading to this point. You are awesome, smart, and beautiful. Despite my clumsy attempts to deliver the message clearly, you started to see something. You are reading between the lines. [I’m gently switching to emotional you — we gonna need that soon]. WE gonna create a myth with an immense amount of value, a marketing department, and an army of fans - in the next 5&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>We have <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> — a decentralized identity solution — at the input. Its <a href="https://www.notion.so/Mission-d39324031ffd457381ade12f4ed0f960">mission</a> is to unite people at scale, it promotes the <a href="https://ethresear.ch/t/price-of-forgery-digital-identity-measuring-human-uniqueness-score-in-dollars/8328">price of forgery concept</a> and the importance of distinguishing humans from bots. Strong mythology is already there, but it “belongs” to Upala and is not suited for sharing. WE gonna create a super-set myth for that. Wide enough to include mythology of any project related to digital identity. For better experience follow the article carefully.</p> Bringing the myth into existence <p>[Broaden your consciousness here]. Upload the following into your memory ̶p̶o̶o̶l̶: Terminator, Bladerunner, Matrix, sad robots, raise of the machines, artificial intelligence, robots rights, replicants seeking love. Stop for a moment and wait for other associations… Got a couple? Great. ̶N̶o̶w̶ ̶t̶r̶y̶ ̶h̶a̶r̶d̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶g̶e̶t̶ ̶i̶t̶!̶!̶!̶</p><blockquote>Try to remember when Boston dynamics started abusing their creatures?</blockquote><p>Now imagine. The opposition of humans and machines is already happening. We cannot see it, because it evolves slowly and naturally. The resistance forces are here too. Invisible, as they are scattered, have no coordination, and — most importantly — are not treated seriously. Individuals are considered mad. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/16/17978596/stephen-hawking-ai-climate-change-robots-future-universe-earth">Precautions</a> from authorities like Stephen Hawking are referred mostly for&nbsp;fun.</p><p>Nevertheless, WE are the ancestors of those who will defeat Skynet (this thing is <a href="https://twitter.com/SkynetLabs">real AF</a>). It is our grand-grand-grand-… children who gonna inhabit the <a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Zion">city of Zion</a> It is us, who will refuse to treat robots as equals. It is us who will desire no&nbsp;peace.</p>  The resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it (your associations) are&nbsp;real.  It is not fiction — it is prediction. It is the&nbsp;future.  The resistance has already&nbsp;started.  <p>Take a moment and realize the meaning behind the last three lines… Close your eyes… Let your mind wander for a couple of seconds… Congratulations! We got our new myth! It exists now. You and everyone, who’s reading this are the carriers. And you know&nbsp;it.</p><p>Well, ok, not that exciting so far. I need your thoughts in this article, they are in&nbsp;italic.</p> Taking responsibility <p>Probably this is not very exciting so far. The myth still feels a bit humorous. In that sense, it is not much different from a <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1381911969402388484">random Twitter meme</a>. But WE don’t want it to come and go like thousands of similar memes. Let’s add some value to it. First, I tell you the following…</p><p>UNLIKE all those tweets I’m totally fucking serious! WE ARE starting the resistance. The real one. The coordinated one. I do realize it may sound crazy. But I’m not crazy. ̶M̶y̶ ̶m̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶h̶a̶d̶ ̶m̶e̶ ̶t̶e̶s̶t̶e̶d̶.̶ You already know I’m sane. You’ve read to this point. You already trust my judgment.</p><p>More importantly, I’m not a random person to make a declaration like that. I’m already building an anti-Sybil system, already started to spread awareness (<a href="https://docs.upala.id/en/latest/state-of-knowledge.html">Upala’s anti-Sybil academy</a>), contacted many like-minded people. I already started to&nbsp;resist.</p><blockquote>“anti-Sybil” simply means “resistant to bots” or “one human — one account”. When entering a website you are sometimes asked to select all images containing buses or (worst of all) traffic lights. This is an example of an anti-Sybil system. <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> is an anti-Sybil system because it provides a human uniqueness score. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Wiki on Sybil-attack</a>.</blockquote><p>Even more importantly I have something to lose. I’m putting my reputation at stake. Right now Upala is actively looking for contributors and investors (<a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/an-open-letter-to-investors-a59c3813fc4b">an open letter to investors</a>). Hardly everyone gonna accept this wild move. Some people will feel doubtful about my judgment. It is a&nbsp;risk.</p><p>I’ve already taken some responsibility for the resistance and now taking even more. Check out the new section in our <a href="https://docs.upala.id/en/latest/state-of-knowledge.html">Sybil-resistance academy</a> — feel free to contribute. Join the new <a href="https://discord.gg/HPtfD3VZ6M">awareness</a> channel at Upala’s discord for coordination. If you wanna resist I’m your point of contact (<a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p">Twitter</a>).</p><p>You now know: this is where the resistance actually started. Right at THIS&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Hmm, this guy is totally nuts, but it all kinda makes sense. Or rather feels right. I wonder what comes&nbsp;next.</p> Sharing responsibility <p>Next stop. You. We are starting the resistance WITH you. That’s right if you are reading this you are a part of the resistance. I’m sharing responsibility with you. You now bear this knowledge. And you are now responsible to direct anyone who humbly mentions “the resistance” to this&nbsp;post.</p><p>Am I a part of the resistance? Well,&nbsp;ok.</p><p>You probably felt how the article became a bit bumpy. That is on purpose. I’m bumping and bumping it up in your head. The myth needs it. It came into existence thanks to you. Thanks to you it already has some strength and momentum.</p><p>Looks like it does have momentum. At least in my&nbsp;head.</p><p>Thank you for still being here. Take a deep breath, relax [and broaden your consciousness a bit more].&nbsp;Because…</p> Pumping up the&nbsp;value <p>I hereby declare the ownership of this myth. The whole thing. The resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it (your associations). The whole damn thing is now mine! Wait, what? For real? Yep, just like that. If you are curious this is how art works (to do links <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp">readymades</a>). I’ll explain in a moment what it all&nbsp;means.</p><p>Nah, no big deal, let him have&nbsp;it.</p><p>And this is quite a big&nbsp;deal!</p><p>Dough!</p><p>We can proceed to discuss the value&nbsp;now.</p><p>I created a tiny bit of value by defining the myth. Then you added a bit more by paying attention to it — I asked you to do it. Then we kept increasing the value together. I addressed the rational you many times during the article. I made you think and sometimes even feel. You made pauses to reflect and build associations. You noticed how this article is more penetrative to your brain than most of the regular articles out there (I told you this is not a regular one). You have a vague feeling that you gonna return to it soon. And you know that many other people will feel the same. You also know that there’s a reputation behind this myth, some actions made, responsibility, and your share of it. We did a good job in growing the value of the myth. And it raised significantly.</p><p>But it was nothing comparing to the value added when I made the first transaction. I unlocked the value by capturing it and making it mine. Minted it to myself, if you will. Or better say, you minted it to me. THANK! YOU! You thought of it as insignificant at first, but it is getting more and more real. It is easier to perceive it as valuable. Probably you feel a bit of regret and even&nbsp;envy.</p><p>No! I’m actually glad for this&nbsp;guy!</p><p>It is not clear yet, what owning a myth actually means. You’ll see that in a moment. But it is already clear that I can do whatever I want with it… And first… I’m gonna blow the value so high, that your fingers will tremble. You’d better sit down. Here we&nbsp;go…</p><p>Now… when everything is clear with the ownership of the myth… I hereby declare… that I present it all to you! WHAAAT? Yes, the resistance narrative above and everything in closest relation to it, the whole damn thing is now YOURS!… yeah!!!…&nbsp;YEAH!!!</p><p>ARE YOU FUCKING FEELING IT?!!! WHAT A MOMENT!!! THIS IS SO AWESOOOME!!! THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE!!! [Shouting hard and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3gbAut2reI&amp;t=5s">burning a teddy&nbsp;bear</a>!]</p><p>If you are reading this you are an owner. Just like me. Just. Like. That. Now you share not just the responsibility, but the value as well!!! And this is where the value skyrocketed…</p><p>Now it is easier to discuss what WE can do with it. [Proceed with a comfortable consciousness level].</p> Takeaways <p>Now that we have this shared myth what is possible? How you can benefit? There are a couple of examples below. Short answer — acknowledge the myth, join the resistance and be active. Grow the resistance, spread awareness of it for your own benefit and for the benefit of humankind. It is your luck is to stumble upon this among the first. It is your choice now how to act. And when to&nbsp;act.</p> Build it <p>Explore the myth, create within it and expand it. If you are an artist (in a broad sense, a creator) you now have an additional channel to get heard. You are one of the myth owners. Owning the myth is like owning a smart contract, e.g. <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKitties">CryptoKitties</a> contract. But Unlike CryptoKitties the contract is social, there is no code. And unlike CryptoKitties the myth is general. You can attach (breed) any type of art to it: text, visuals, audio, or code (interaction mechanics). Or it is like <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Earth-616">Marvel’s Earth-616</a> universe, except that it is not built yet. Anyone can fill it with characters, events, and&nbsp;stories.</p><p>Just create a piece of art that is relevant to the myth. Then acknowledge the myth. Mention one of the following lines: “Vive La Sybil Resistance”, “Welcome to resistance”, “This is resistance”, “Humans vs Machines”, “You are now part of the resistance”. Use #ViveLaSybilResistance or a shorter #NoBots hashtag on Twitter. Mention this article. These are the ways to find people with shared values (and shared value😉). These are the breeding mechanics I can think of. Other ways of attaching to this meme are possible. Explore&nbsp;them!</p><p>At the start, while your node of resistance is not strong enough, you’d probably gonna need some support. Ping me and I’ll mention your work, so it could be discovered easier. Don’t be humble — I got incentives for that. I’m one of the owners and I acknowledged the myth — by sharing I increase the value of the whole myth and of my share as a consequence. A gift is an addition.</p> Hodl it <p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p">me</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a> on Twitter and wait for #NoBots or #ViveLaSybilResistance tags. Follow <a href="https://discord.gg/vhNZBPFXxU">NFMs channel</a> on Upala Discord. You can be among the first to grab a part of history. Fun fact — you cannot be 100% selfish. Buying is acknowledging. Buying increases the value of the bought item and the value of the entire resistance myth as well. Buying is a&nbsp;gift.</p><blockquote><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/upala-sybil-resistance-forces">Official OpenSea collection</a> is part of the resistance, as well as this <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1381911969402388484">tweet</a>, this <a href="https://themillionetherhomepage.com/">ancient project</a> with broken front-end, <a href="https://mooncatrescue.com/">Mooncats</a>. Everyone I mentioned in this article is a part of the resistance. Everything they do is important for this myth, for blockchain, for humanity, for&nbsp;good.</blockquote> Share it <p>Spread the knowledge — share this article, shill artists you like and their works, bring new people into the resistance. Fun fact — you cannot be 100% altruistic. When dealing with history, timing matters the most. By sharing you become an early adopter. Sharing regularly increases your weight in the resistance. One day you may use your weight for your own benefit. Sharing does have&nbsp;value.</p> Conclusion <p>Our new resistance mythology includes Upala’s Sybil-resistance mythology entirely. Both are interconnected. When mentioning the resistance you also mean that humans are important, they have rights by the mere fact of being born, you mention <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/identification-development-global-dataset">1 bln people without ID</a>, who need help. Moving down to earth you make people aware of decentralized ID systems and the term Sybil-resistance. Lastly, you promote <a href="https://twitter.com/TheUpala">Upala</a>. The resistance is now Upala’s marketing department.</p><p>But WE created a lot more! As the scope of the resistance mythology is much wider than Upala’s many other projects may find that their mythology can be a subset of it. As the ownership is shared they may acknowledge the myth and start expanding it with no approval. It is like creating a project-specific flavor of Linux. It may look very different, but everyone would know it is still Linux. The more a project contributes to the myth, the stronger its resistance node becomes. And the stronger the entire resistance gets. Every member of resistance is incentivized to support other members. Because both creating and sharing an NFM increases the entire myth’s value. Incentives aligned. Win-win. We created the basis for a decentralized shared marketing department. Thank&nbsp;you!</p><p>WE started it all TOGETHER. The resistance already gained strength and value. With a little help, it may become self-sufficient and live longer than any project or even humans involved. The value behind it is uncapped. It is all up to us. Remember this is the genesis and you are as close to it as one can get. Be among the first to add value to it. Share it&nbsp;now!</p><p>Share this <a href="https://twitter.com/porobov_p/status/1398209330260893697">tweet</a>.

<p>In the physical world, you sign a document and become responsible for its contents, including the duties and liabilities entailed in it. While it’s possible to forge or duplicate these physical signatures, it’s not&nbsp;easy.</p><p>But what about the digital&nbsp;world?</p><p>The option to copy and paste signatures makes it a breeze to forge&nbsp;them.</p><p>Hence, it became necessary to have Digital Signature Schemes (DSS) to establish the signer’s identity and to reduce the risk of&nbsp;forgery.</p><p>Broadly speaking, digital signature schemes have two components,</p>  A private signing algorithm to securely identify the&nbsp;signer  A public verification algorithm to verify the authenticity of the&nbsp;signer.  <p>Many digital signature schemes have these two components, and today, we’ll talk about one such signature schema — BBS+ Signatures.</p><p>This digital signature was created by Dan Boneh, Xavier Boyen, and Hovav Shacham using the strong Diffie-Hellman encryption technique, and hence the name BBS (after their respective surnames). The original signature was modified later to include proof of knowledge, and hence the name&nbsp;BBS+</p> What is the BBS+ Signature Scheme? <p>The BBS+ signature scheme is a DSS that can have two distinct parties, namely, the signer and the signature holder. Here the signature holder is the owner of a signature while the signer is the entity authenticating that the signature belongs to the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>Essentially, what happens is that the signature holder enters into a Pedersen commitment with the&nbsp;signer.</p><p>Before moving further, let’s digress a bit here to understand the Pedersen commitment as this is the building block of BBS+ electronic signatures.</p> Understanding the Pedersen Commitment <p>A Pedersen commitment is a scheme that allows a sender to commit to a secret value that can be revealed in the future. Until then, the sender transmits a commitment to preserve the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Until the sender chooses, the secret remains private and can be revealed only when the sender displays a necessary parameter that’s agreed as a part of the commitment process. This commitment allows senders to commit to a ton of data in one-go and at the same time, no hacker or even an advanced quantum computer can access all of that data until the sender decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Let’s understand this with a simple&nbsp;example.</p><p>Let’s say, Bob creates a secret and sends a commitment of the secret to Alice. Here, the commitment can be a cryptographic value like a hash function or discrete logarithms, and this is stored by Alice. Remember, she doesn’t know Bob’s secret and can’t find out with the commitment value&nbsp;either.</p><p>In the future, Bob decides to reveal the secret, and Alice checks this secret against the commitment to verify that Bob hasn’t changed the&nbsp;secret.</p><p>Besides Bob and Alice, no one else knows about its existence.</p><p>Now, let’s extrapolate this Pedersen commitment to BBS+ signatures.</p> BBS+ Signatures and Pedersen Commitment <p>As mentioned above, BBS group signatures create the possibility for the signer and the signature holder to be two different entities, like Alice and Bob. The commitment is the connecting aspect, and the contents are blinded until the holder decides to reveal&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, these signatures give complete control to the holder to decide when and what must be revealed, and follow the principles of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-1-the-basics-163478f8c7f9">Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> where the holder can prove the required identity to another entity without having to reveal the identifiable data of the transaction.</p> BBS+Signatures in Verifiable Credentials <p>All these features make it a good DSS for implementing verifiable credentials. Also, a key advantage of BBS+ Signatures is that it allows a part of a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credential</a> to be shared with&nbsp;others.</p><p>For example, let’s say the issuer is a startup company that issues VCs containing the date of birth and address of the holder. Next, the holder wants to share the address with a verifier for a delivery process, so the holder can share a part of the VC (only the address) without sharing the date of birth. This is possible only when the verifiable credential is fragmented into multiple individual fields, each secured by a signature.</p><p>Here is an example of a VC implementation with BBS+ signature.</p> {<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/context">@context</a>": [<br>    "<a href="http://schema.org/">http://schema.org/</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://w3id.org/security/v2">https://w3id.org/security/v2</a>",<br>    "<a href="https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1">https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1</a>"<br>  ],<br>  "<a href="http://twitter.com/type">@type</a>": "Person",<br>  "firstName": "Jane",<br>  "lastName": "Does",<br>  "jobTitle": "Professor",<br>  "telephone": "(425) 123-4567",<br>  "email": "<a href="mailto:jane.doe@example.com">jane.doe@example.com</a>",<br>  "proof": {<br>    "type": "BbsBlsSignature2020",<br>    "created": "2020-04-25",<br>    "verificationMethod": "did:example:489398593#test",<br>    "proofPurpose": "assertionMethod",<br>    "proofValue": "F9uMuJzNBqj4j+HPTvWjUN/MNoe6KRH0818WkvDn2Sf7kg1P17YpNyzSB+CH57AWDFunU13tL8oTBDpBhODckelTxHIaEfG0rNmqmjK6DOs0/ObksTZh7W3OTbqfD2h4C/wqqMQHSWdXXnojwyFDEg==",<br>    "requiredRevealStatements": [4,5]<br>  }<br>} <p>Each field in the VC, like the firstName, lastName, jobTitle, etc, is a separate signature and the holder has the option to pick one or more of these fields and include them in a verifiable presentation.</p><p>This example can be extended to any of the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world VC use-cases</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-proof-of-concept-poc-for-verifiable-credentials-edf684b592f2">PoCs</a> from Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">Hackathon</a>.</p><p>In fact, this ability to share just the required information follows the principle of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/applications-of-zero-knowledge-proofs-part-2-nuclear-disarmament-abb5c879a7c5">ZKP</a> and is a secure way for the holder to safely share what’s required to the concerned verifier. At the same time, note that BBS+ signatures are not identical to ZKPs as there’s an option to fragment and reveal just some parts of the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>In this sense, BBS+ signatures are selective disclosures controlled completely by the holder where every field in the VC has a signature. Hence, the VC itself becomes a compilation of individual signatures, one for each&nbsp;field.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of BBS+ Signatures <p>At Affinidi, we’re in the process of implementing this BBS group signature schema where we allow the holder to build a presentation with only the required fields from a credential. There’s also a process in place to verify that the fragmented credential is&nbsp;valid.</p><p>To learn more about what we do, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.

			 Barbora Prochazkova is Project Manager at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Barbora, I am 32 and currently live in Mondorf-les-Bains, a little thermal town in Luxembourg. I was born and raised in Komarno, a lovely town in the south of Slovakia. As a child of socialism in former Czechoslovakia, I have been fortunate to have parents that made my childhood wonderfully ‘Pippi Longstocking’ like – adventurous but disciplined, filled with books, outdoor activities, household chores, and exciting travels to the close and faraway towns and lands :).</p>
<p>Despite how good or less good our financial situation was, I greatly admired their ability to take us on a few trips every year, which considerably contributed to the hodophile I grew into. My wanderlust has fully surfaced during my teenage years and I owe it (and the books) invaluable life lessons on humility, gratefulness, and appreciation of being here and now. Reading about and observing how we humans from different corners of the world live, think, collaborate, love and mourn, (hopefully) taught me to be more open-minded, understanding, helpful, and patient in daily interactions with my fellow humans.</p>
<p>I have always been amazed by the great that can come out when people from different cultures exchange their ideas and openly collaborating. And as no university offered a paid degree in ‘travelling, yoga, reading books and becoming a better human’ ( I strongly hope this has changed since :)), I chose what seemed the second-best option at that time and went to study international business. I spent part of my studies in Tuscany, where apart from travelling, eating, and learning how to relax (a skill I so wish to get better at), I met my travel buddy and partner in crime and life, Alex. After Italy, we lived and worked in Slovakia for a couple of years, but soon felt the need to put on our travelling pants again and move out for a few years. And we landed in Luxembourg.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I often joke that be it not for Daniel Coheur’s persistence and incredibly charming interpersonal skills (I am sure people who know Daniel will attest to this), I would have been long gone from Luxembourg – most probably some place sunnier 😉</p>
<p>While I was at my previous company, I was handling and wrapping up a service migration project for clients of a telecommunication operator when I received the email from Daniel. At that time, he was actually my client, representing the company for whom we’ve been doing the migration and was on the copy of most of the emails I was sending out. In his email, he complimented me on my working style, congratulated me on a job well done, and told me that together with a partner of his, Luc, Tokeny’s CEO, they are currently starting a new company and looking for someone to manage the clients and the implementation of the technical solutions and thinks I would be a great fit.</p>
<p>I was very flattered, but I thanked him and politely explained that I am not searching for a change at the moment. He wasn’t ready to let it go yet, wrote me a bit more about the company and also mentioned that his wife is also Slovak and that graduated from the same university. What are the odds? I came clean and told him that the job definitely sounds interesting but that I want to be 100% honest and admitted that I am planning to leave Luxembourg in less than a year and wouldn’t find it fair to start in a new position. He quickly responded that if that is my only worry, worried I shan’t be and if I would want, I can move out with my job if I want to. We all met for lunch, had a very good talk, exchanged ideas and expectations, and soon after I started at Tokeny as Account Success/Implementation Manager.</p>
 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Dynamic, ever-changing, sometimes stressful, but very supportive, open-minded, and fun. The team is everything, a soul of the company, and they are wonderful. I have worked with various tech teams, but never have I ever experienced such a strong commitment to delivering the best possible solution, striving to go above and beyond. This invaluable and comforting feeling that we have our back. When the fit hits the shan, which it sometimes does, we stress later, pull our sleeves up and if possible, get the job done in the best possible way. If not possible, we make sure we learned the most of it so that we can build on it and avoid it in the future. I very much appreciate how very different we all are, speak different languages, have various working styles and cultures that shaped us. Working with a remote team definitely has its challenges and is not always a piece of cake, but a kind Slack message and regular calls are doing wonders.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>About learning to live a better life I would say. The complexity of the consciousness, wonders of minds, and the existence of the world as we know it fascinate me. When I can, I read or listen to audiobooks on mindfulness, neuroscience, moral philosophy, psychotherapy, the use of psychedelics in it… I truly LOVE walking (a day without a walk is a day wrongly planned), gardening, and just being outdoors in general.</p>
<p></p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is to be able to say to myself that I did the best I could with what I had, learned how to be genuinely present, undistracted, and most appreciative of the one life I have. I like to think of it as striving to live up to one’s potential and honouring the gift of life. The traveller in me would also say that I wish to work no more than 4 hours a week and dedicate the rest of the time to my family, my human kindred spirits, reading, exploring, walking, and giving back. However, I do hope to become a parent one day, and seeing my children grow into wonderful, engaged, morally strong, and happy humanists would be the ultimate dream.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Oh, so many things. I would love for all of us to be able to feel and acknowledge that helping our less fortunate fellow humans is not an extra, a nice, or big-of-oneself thing to do, but simply our moral obligation. Randomness plays a huge role in where and to whom we are born and hugely predetermines the paths most of us can take, the education we can get, the people we can become or connect with, the jobs we can get. I would love to get everyone from the ‘well-off’ side of the pond which I myself am a lucky occupant to dedicate at least 1% of their net annual income towards shrinking the fast-growing gap between the rich and poor. I am a big proponent of effective altruism myself and hope to be strong enough to dedicate 5% of my net annual net income by 40. I would also ensure that everyone has the same access to high-quality education, which would result in a significant rise in critical thinking and information processing, which would eventually lead to the end of violent religions as we know them now.</p>

On the site, you can find everything from insights into the biggest events shaping the crypto industry to content that meets readers where they are in their journey of learning about blockchain and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>As a fan of the publication, I was thrilled to talk with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukemhamilton/">Luke Hamilton</a>, Senior Software Engineer. In this post, I’ll cover how the Decrypt team streamlined development and onboarding to launch Decrypt Tokens and Drops — along with how crypto DNA and a leading product and team drove their trust in&nbsp;Magic.</p> Incentivizing readers to earn as they&nbsp;learn <p>Decrypt is the gateway into the decentralized world. What’s unique about the reader experience is its clear-eyed storytelling and accessibility. Decrypt content caters to various levels of existing crypto knowledge.</p><p>Back in 2019, the team had ambitions to deepen the reader experience and connect further to their ethos of education through using decentralized technology.</p><p>Fast forward two years of behind-the-scenes work by their product team, that vision is now brought to life with the launch of Decrypt Token (DCPT), a new reader token that lives inside the Decrypt mobile app. According to the team, “The token is our way of participating in the decentralized industry we cover, and experimenting with how cryptocurrency can spur reader engagement.”</p><p>So, what’s in it for readers? The opportunity to earn as they learn. Every week, unique digital rewards — called <a href="https://drops.decrypt.co/">Drops</a> — become available and redeemable with Decrypt tokens. It’s an ingenious way to assign value to actions, thank readers for their loyalty, all while also encouraging hands-on interaction with&nbsp;crypto.</p> Novel reader tokens and rewards inside a mobile&nbsp;app <p>During the development process, Luke and the team tackled the question of how to authenticate users. They explored whether to build their own authentication or integrate with an existing auth solution.</p><p>Internally, there was already substantial discussion about going passwordless for the tokens MVP (minimal viable product). For Decrypt, the biggest benefits to passwordless login were improvements to UX and that several forward-thinking brands had started to make passwordless login increasingly popular with&nbsp;users.</p><p>At the time, work on traditional username and password flow had already begun. But after assessing where the app was and what was left to do in the critical path, Luke realized they had not yet solved issues around account recovery. After evaluating the large effort it’d require their lean engineering team to build out forgot password, reset password, and so on, Luke decided not to continue to invest in a traditional auth flow and instead, implement Magic.</p><p>Natural excitement for Magic sparked at first discovery because of the companies’ shared philosophies on&nbsp;crypto.</p><blockquote>“Choosing Magic further bolstered the credibility of our&nbsp;ethos.”</blockquote><p>The product also stood out as the passwordless auth solution with future-proof crypto and identity tech under the&nbsp;hood.</p><blockquote>“The clear aha moment came when we realized Magic does exactly what we wanted, functionally and philosophically: frictionless login for users and decentralized identity aligned to our&nbsp;mission.</blockquote><blockquote>There weren’t that many competing solutions or anything remotely comparable; it’s fully-featured and production-ready.”</blockquote><p>Luke estimates that continuing to build password-based auth would have added “at least another month” to their roadmap. In just a week, email magic links were up and running in Decrypt’s mobile app for their private&nbsp;beta.</p><p>The process of implementation was streamlined primarily thanks to Magic’s simple documentation and proactive customer support. Luke counts the responsiveness to his questions and genuine partnership mindset as most impressive, highlighting the customer-centric team behind the&nbsp;product.</p> Successful user adoption at&nbsp;scale <p>Decrypt has seen remarkable success in the months immediately following their beta and public launches. Over 50,000 users have already downloaded their mobile app to engage with content and earn tokens, and Decrypt is expecting hundreds of thousands more users by the end of&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Luke is certain Magic played a key role in appealing to broader audiences who want to get their hands on the latest technology and trends in crypto. Sign up and login is easy and fast; users can set up their in-app wallet in literally a few&nbsp;seconds.</p><blockquote>“User growth is the best proof there is. Less friction for users leads to higher conversion.”</blockquote><p>He’s also the first to recommend Magic to colleagues and is now solely building auth with Magic for his passion projects as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote>“I’m working on my own rewards app and had to switch from Auth0 to use&nbsp;Magic.”</blockquote><p>The coolest part: innovation around tokens is just getting started. To kick off the first season of Decrypt Drops, the team launched an exclusive NFT (<a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain">non-fungible tokens</a>) series. In the future, Drops will evolve to include a host of different rewards and functionality.</p><p>Together with Magic, Decrypt is reaching record reader growth and engagement. Through seamless onboarding and innovative experiences powered by blockchain technology, the Decrypt and Magic teams are co-advocating for the future of the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/decrypt-trusts-magic-to-onboard-record-new-user-growth-with-the-launch-of-reader-tokens-and-rewards-14d791e582d5">Decrypt trusts Magic to onboard record new user growth with the launch of reader tokens and rewards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the alpha launch of Tezos Profiles (TZP), which can be found at <a href="https://tzprofiles.com/">tzprofiles.com</a>.</p><p>TZP is a web application that helps users regain control of their digital identity for use across platforms, and enables the creation of portable verified profiles by demonstrating control over public social media accounts and by self-attesting information. These verified profiles are then linked to Tezos accounts, allowing any platform to resolve and establish trusted information to mitigate identity&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>We encourage users to start creating and launching their profiles as we begin integrating Tezos Profiles support across the Tezos ecosystem. Currently, we are focused exclusively on publicly available information and accounts to avoid privacy issues. We will support private verifications in the future, once the proper security and privacy measures are in place for those workflows.</p><p>We’ve also open-sourced Tezos Profiles and the repository can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/tzprofiles">here</a>.</p> Integrations <p>We wanted to make it easy for any development teams to use Tezos Profiles within their own applications. Therefore, we are releasing an SDK that tzprofiles.com itself uses to resolve, verify, and update claims. It can be found within our GitHub, with improved documentation on the&nbsp;way.</p><p>We are currently helping Tezos ecosystem members such as Hic Et Nunc, TzKT, Kukai, and Tezos Domains to integrate Tezos Profiles, enabling new forms of Sybil resistance and creator authentication. If you would like first-class support on an open-source Tezos Profiles integration for your application, please reach out in our <a href="https://t.me/tezosprofiles">support telegram</a>.</p> How to Launch Your&nbsp;Profile <p>**Note: In this alpha release, only tz1 addresses are supported. However, we’re working quickly to add tz2 support (e.g. DirectAuth via Kukai) via our next upgrade.**</p><p>First, visit <a href="https://tzprofiles.com">https://tzprofiles.com</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>To start, select the network you wish to connect to and connect your wallet using&nbsp;Beacon.</p><p>Once connected, you will be presented with two available credentials: Basic Profile Information and a Twitter Account Verification for the alpha launch. To start, click on “Basic Profile Information” to begin filling in some core profile information about yourself.</p><p>Once you’ve filled in your profile information, click “Sign Profile” in order to self-issue your credential. After this, you can move on to your Twitter Account Verification.</p><p>This workflow will require you to first enter your Twitter handle, sign a message using your wallet, tweet that message and signature, and lastly, verify that message using the service. Once that’s complete, return to your profile to launch your associated smart contract.</p><p>Once you have uploaded your credentials to Kepler and deployed your smart contract, congratulations — you now have an on-chain Tezos&nbsp;Profile!</p><p>Using our viewer, you can now view anyone’s public profile with their associated credentials.</p> Future Plans <p>We have an additional number of features and verifications lined up to be integrated into Tezos Profiles in the near future. Some of these&nbsp;include:</p>  A redesign of the interface that enables users to view, update, and delete their credentials.  An Instagram account verification for&nbsp;artists.  Public messaging account verifications such as Telegram and&nbsp;Discord.  Tezos domain ownership proofs.  <p>— -</p><p>Follow us on<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">&nbsp;LinkedIn</a></p><p>We’re always looking for user feedback on our products.

<p>This month, Gravity joined some of the largest international NGOs in the world to launch the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">Dignified Identities in Cash Programming (DIGID)</a> project in Kenya. The goal of this project is to help the Kenya Red Cross leverage Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol on Tezos to provide much-needed cash transfers to vulnerable Kenyan populations.</p><p>Gravity’s vision is to build human-centered digital ID solutions for easy, transparent and secure data sharing for all people, anywhere in the world. With Gravity, individuals and small business owners can safely store and share their personal data to access humanitarian aid, financing, employment, and government services. In cases like the DIGID project, international organizations can also leverage our digital ID solutions to efficiently collect verifiable data for improved service delivery, interoperability, and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>With humanitarian aid projects like DIGID, Gravity’s goal is to help end-users and partners progressively adopt and implement this decentralized identity protocol to open the door to even greater financial inclusion for vulnerable populations. The reality is that Gravity’s humanitarian aid solution supports populations who are not yet familiar with advanced blockchain technology. By taking a human-centered design approach and meeting our partners and end-users where they are at, we will continue to adapt and build our protocol on Tezos based on real-time needs.</p><p>The DIGID project is a manifestation of our ongoing collaboration with the <a href="https://tezos.com/">Tezos</a> ecosystem to bring our decentralized identity solutions to vulnerable populations of humanitarian aid recipients, refugees, and displaced persons around the world. Among the latest <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-test-suite/implementations/">verifiable credential implementations recognized by W3C standards</a>, Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol is built on Tezos to ensure that our protocol is more scalable, standardized, and transparent.</p><p>With Gravity’s protocol built on Tezos blockchain, together we can empower all individuals to access key services (humanitarian aid, financing, educational certification, e-government services) and accelerate their path toward financial inclusion. Gravity’s use cases include facilitating humanitarian aid and cash transfers to remote communities in East Africa, supply chain financing for small business owners in Kenya, and educational certification for Syrian refugees to access greater employment opportunities in&nbsp;Turkey.</p> Why Tezos? <p>The Tezos protocol aligns with Gravity’s high security standards and our vision for a digital identity platform that builds trusted digital identities on blockchain that are private, portable, and persistent. We believe in Tezos ecosystem’s focus on formal verification of smart contracts and on-chain governance, which allow for everyone to participate by submitting proposals to be voted on to update the Tezos environment.</p><blockquote>According to Gravity co-founder Johannes Ebert: “The Tezos ecosystem’s democratic, community-based, decentralized form of on-chain governance is consistent with Gravity’s vision for our own ecosystem. Like Tezos, Gravity’s solution focuses on decentralizing and community-sourcing our protocol to comply with the latest W3C standards.”</blockquote><p>Tezos also fits in with Gravity’s human-centric vision, which values community-based input and a decentralized approach to create more innovative and effective solutions that truly meet the needs of all stakeholders along the data supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Lastly, Tezos is particularly suitable for Gravity’s decentralized identity use cases due to its affordable transaction costs and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance) compatibility.</p> What’s on-chain? <p>Following <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/">Spruce</a>’s initial implementation of the <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/decentralized-identity-with-the-tezos-did-method-d9cf6676dd64">Tezos DID Method</a>, Gravity implemented our own version of the Tezos <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID Method</a> and <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID&nbsp;Manager</a>.</p><p>Gravity’s strong beliefs in maximum privacy and a user’s right to be forgotten mean that we only store specific pieces of personal data on-chain. The on-chain attributes contained within the DID manager&nbsp;include:</p>  Authentication public key: Used by remote parties to verify a signature with an “authentication” purpose (in W3C terms), most frequently used during the sharing of credentials,  AssertionMethod public key: Also for use by remote parties to verify signatures with an “assertionMethod” purpose (in W3C terms), usually used during credential issuance,  KeyAgreement public key: Used by remote parties to compute the shared secret necessary for end to end encryption.  Link to credential repository: A link to a dedicated space on the credential repository which allows issuers to know where to send credentials post encryption, and  TZIP-16 metadata link: Standard that helps attach off-chain metadata to the DID manager, allowing for the inclusion of metadata&nbsp;views.  <p>These attributes are all retrieved by <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">Gravity’s specific DID Resolver</a> which is embedded within the Universal DID Resolver to allow for the re-computation of the related DID document.</p><p>Most recently, we integrated the much-anticipated <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/contract-metadata-on-tezos-e4c692e2f6ba#:~:text=TZIP%2D16%20proposes%20a%20method,custom%20extensions%20(e.g.%20a%20multimedia">Contract Metadata (TZIP-16) standard</a>, which makes integration, discoverability and querying of Tezos smart contracts easier and scalable for applications and&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>The sky’s the limit for Tezos and Gravity, and we are excited to continue growing with and learning from the global Tezos community!</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravity-earth">LinkedIn</a> for recent updates. <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/subscription">Sign up for our Gravity newsletter</a> for the latest Gravity&nbsp;news!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravitys-decentralized-identity-protocol-built-on-tezos-to-power-digid-project-in-kenya-a85069f2a027">Gravity’s Decentralized Identity Protocol, Built on Tezos, To Power DIGID Project in Kenya</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">Gravity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The Urbit community has grown at a rapid clip throughout 2021. There are so many exciting things going on that it's hard to convey them all, even with Developer Calls happening every two weeks. This event will function as a virtual "mini-conference" where we'll give a series of important and exciting announcements, including both formal and informal talks from many members of our community.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what we'll be discussing:</p>
 Introduction: State of the Network 
<p>12:00 PDT, Josh Lehman</p>
<p>Urbit is under heavy, active development by both Tlon and a wide range of contributors. Josh Lehman will discuss some of the most important areas of work being undertaken, provide a picture of where Tlon and community efforts are going in the future, and even has a few exciting announcements to make.</p>
 Taisho, Urbit's Port City 
<p>~12:20 PDT, Hunter Miller</p>
<p>Piloting an Urbit ship requires expertise that many lack. To achieve the rich and prosperous ecosystem we've all envisioned requires making that journey easier. In this talk, Hunter Miller introduces a new way for users to join the network with minimal effort.</p>
 Keynote: The Revenge of Teleology 
<p>~13:00 PDT, Justin Murphy</p>
<p>Teleology—or inquiry into ultimate ends—has been out of fashion since the seventeenth century, when Francis Bacon said that, “like a virgin consecrated to God,” it “produces nothing.” I argue that the digital revolution is inverting Bacon’s claim. Baconian instrumentalism is now suffering from diminishing returns—it is what the youth today call a Boomer Ideology. Rather, the greatest gains are going to individuals and communities with teleological attitudes. This talk will observe some examples and present a model consistent with the observations. Bitcoin inquires after the telos of money, the most winning independent “content creators” inquire after the telos of media, and Urbit inquires after the telos of personal computing.</p>
 Lightning Talks 
<p>14:00 PDT, you?</p>
<p>After the scheduled talks we'll break out into a series of 30 minute talks led by community members. There will be up to three talks given in parallel at each of 14:00 PDT, 14:30 PDT and 15:00 PDT (so nine talks total).</p>
<p>If you'd like to give a talk, please use <a href="https://airtable.com/shr0Xmqcv1HSy47EP">this form to sign up</a>. You can see the full list of <a href="https://airtable.com/shreGQ4kCU8RA5GJS/tblTZxCpqedJBwSkE">proposed talks here</a>, and if you'd like to voice your support for any of these specifically, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrhNRUAGCqZ38VXA">cast a vote using this form</a>.</p>

 Could store edits as diffs. Graph-store is probably fine for this, but a native storage format could work as well and would be good to think through tradeoffs. Interesting extensions would be things like line annotations.

  <p>A fun client app that would be a good way to get acquainted with Urbit's networking and p2p abilities. While it would be possible to create a fully decentralized version that uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_poker">mental poker</a> <a href="https://github.com/kripod/mental-poker">algorithms</a> to make the game fully p2p, it is probably more tractable initially to implement the game with a centralized server.</p>
<p>The game can be implemented such that the central server only handles queries about current deck state, and so could be swapped out for a solution with no trusted third party at a later time.  Everything else can be handled player-side, including signing attestations of game state at different points.</p>
 User Stories 
<p>As a gameserver admin I can:</p>
 
 set up a server to handle shuffling/dealing 
 take API calls from players who want to initiate a game. 
 
<p>As a player, I can:</p>
 
 connect to another player with the app to initiate a game 
 specify which gameserver I trust to handle card shuffling/dealing 
 play iterated hands of poker 
 update a game state that is either tournament-based (first to win all the chips) or cash-based (continually updating stacks of chips on each side, possibly with injections of money along the way)

  <p>In today’s digital environment, the bar has been reset when it comes to remote working, e-commerce, e-learning, e-health and streaming services. The demand for simple and secure digital experiences for customers has never been higher. And while logging in is such a common process, it’s easy to take for granted. However, that entry point to your application or service is also when organisations become responsible for the user’s digital identity. Combined with the current, fast evolving landscape and the continuous innovation in, and use of technology to deliver products and services, there is an explosion in the number of sources from which users can gain that access. Overlaying all of that, is the constant evolution of the threat landscape and regulations that inevitably follow.</p>
<p>For leaders who are managing changes in revenue-generating business models, while still working to grow their position in the market, they must balance two goals: delivering security and customer experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join Auth0 as we discuss, and provide some insights on how to utilise a strategic approach to digital identities, that has helped customers such as Siemens, GrandVision and The Economist to:</p>
 
 
<p>Maintain and improve the user experience</p>
 
 
<p>Provide an innovative - and differentiated - product or service, that can adapt and scale as the business grows</p>
 
 
<p>Achieve the above two points, while still ensuring security and trust for their customers’ digital identities</p>

<p></p><p>This has been a good year so far for Cardano. It successfully <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-hard-fork-multi-asset-blockchain">forked to become a multi-asset blockchain</a>, enabling users to create tokens that run on Cardano natively, similar to how tokens operate on Ethereum. (Full smart-contract functionality remains <a href="https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/goguen/">on their roadmap</a>.) Its token, ADA, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/cardano-ada-coinbase-listing">became tradeable on Coinbase</a> in mid-March. And investors lined up: the price of ADA rose 560% over Q1, the most among the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk20">CoinDesk 20</a>, a core group of cryptocurrencies tracked by the news site. Then in April, Cardano announced a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/from-paper-to-cardano-blockchain-iohk-in-ethiopia">major blockchain-identity initiative in Africa</a>, beginning with a partnership with the Ethiopian government to improve the quality of education.</p><p>Cardano <a href="https://iohk.io/projects/cardano/">makes some promising claims</a> about its platform that seem mainly aimed at differentiating from Ethereum, still the giant in the smart contract space with a market capitalization roughly six times as large as Cardano’s as of this writing. Among its core features:</p>  Protocols for scalability and security are supposedly more scientific, based on “peer-reviewed academic research”.  A unique algorithm, called Ouroboros, billed as “the most environmentally sustainable blockchain protocol”. Ourobouros’s consensus system empowers various types of stakeholders, including “input endorsers'' and “slot leaders”, to mine coins and verify transactions.  A hierarchical structure that includes a settlement layer for accounting and a control layer for executing smart contracts, supposedly making Cardano ideal as both a medium of exchange and a decentralized world computer.  <p>Whether Cardano is actually better than other blockchain protocols isn’t something we’ll try to settle here. What we can say is that Cardano is seeking to be a better blockchain protocol, which is fundamentally different than what Holochain is doing. Cardano and Holochain may ultimately be solving some of the same problems, but they face very different challenges along the way.</p><p>For example, one of blockchain’s biggest challenges is efficiency (or scalability). The computing costs of recording everything that happens on every node of a blockchain are huge, as is the storage load of keeping all of that data forever, so it’s hard to imagine blockchain being suitable for applications involving any kind of big media files. Another issue is latency: blockchains often take several minutes or more to record even simple events, so they’re not very suitable for collaborative applications that rely on fast update times. Users have recently reported transaction wait times on Cardano <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/lkbkq0/how_long_does_ada_take_on_average_to_reach_your/">ranging from 1 to 18 hours</a>.</p><p>For these reasons, blockchain projects seem to be primarily setting their sights on financial services applications, which tend to hold relatively little data and don’t require real-time processing. Cardano is no exception, making “interoperability with legacy financial systems” <a href="https://why.cardano.org/en/interoperability/the-grand-myopia/">one of its core objectives</a>.</p><p>Holochain is not limited in the same ways and, as a result, is capable of enabling virtually all the activities you’re accustomed to doing on the internet now. Holochain is so flexible and scalable because:</p><p>Cost: Holochain is completely free to use and run. Because users host themselves and each run a local copy of the application to perform a small amount of the shared workload of validation and storage, there is no need to pay any intermediary miners or stakers. No gas fees also means no built-in token is required to run Holochain apps, eliminating a major usability hurdle. (The tokens people commonly associate with Holochain, Holo Token [HOT] and HoloFuel, actually power the Holo Hosting Network, a peer-to-peer hosting marketplace which enables anyone to participate in a Holochain application through a web browser without having to purchase any cryptocurrency or have a crypto wallet.)</p><p>Storage: Holochain is capable of handling large-media applications. Shared data is replicated only enough times to provide a healthy amount of redundancy – perhaps 25 or 50 times, not on every single node as in blockchain – so it is completely feasible to store and serve large documents, images, and videos. Even live video streaming is possible through the shared data environment of a Holochain app.</p><p>Speed: &nbsp;Holochain has a number of features that combine to make for near-zero latency:</p>  You write data to your local chain instantly. Once your data is recorded on your own source chain and then published to the network, the other computers update to your change in their own time – seconds for most computers, perhaps minutes for some – but you typically don’t have to wait for that to happen to continue moving forward. For example, if you’re posting in a social media application, you see your own post immediately, and you can add a comment to it right away.  In addition, you can send ‘signals’, which are real-time updates transmitted to the specific parties you’re interacting with, ahead of validation by the network. In a chat application, for example, the person you’re chatting to gets a signal so that their screen updates right away with your message, as fast as in any centralized chat application.  When you are interacting in a way that needs to be validated before you can interact again – such as if you’re transacting with currency – your next transaction only depends on your history being validated by the user you’re transacting with, not by the whole network. (Because all users host a copy of the application, including the app’s validation rules, they don’t need to consult anyone else.) So if there are computers on the network that are slower to update or are offline, that doesn’t slow you down. Incidentally, this feature also makes for infinite transactions per second, increasing with the number of users on the network: if there are a billion people using a currency app, there could be half a billion transactions taking place at the same time – one transaction for every pair of people who are transacting.  <p>For all of these reasons, Holochain is suitable not just for financial services applications but for collaborative applications like:</p>  Chat applications like Slack or WhatsApp. (<a href="https://app-registration.holotest.net/elemental">Elemental Chat</a> is now live.)  Project-management systems like Trello and Asana. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBCsQHRLsGA">Acorn</a> is one example in development.)  Social media applications similar to Twitter, Facebook, and so on. (<a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto</a> is one example.)  Wikis and other knowledge bases. (<a href="https://github.com/eyss/h-wiki-front">H-Wiki</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/fractal-wiki">Fractal Wiki</a> are both in development.)  Calendaring and scheduling applications. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events">CalendarEvents</a> is one under development.)  Real-time collaboration tools like Google Docs and HackMD (We created <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Syn</a> as a simple but powerful protocol for these types of apps.)  Marketplaces and e-commerce networks for any imaginable good or service, from vacation rentals like Airbnb to ride-sharing networks like Uber to general-purpose marketplaces like eBay or Amazon. One exciting marketplace in development is <a href="https://redgrid.io/">RedGrid</a>, a peer-to-peer, clean-energy power network.  Media-sharing platforms like YouTube and Spotify.  Innovative <a href="https://medium.com/@joshmzemel/the-holocene-explosion-game-changing-possibilities-in-a-world-of-unenclosable-carriers-a432e7a476cd">social organisms</a> like collaborative land stewardship, <a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">supply-chain tracking</a>, and novel currency systems.  <p>So what advantages does Cardano have relative to Holochain? The biggest one might be awareness – both of the project itself and of the underlying technology. Cardano has gotten a lot more press than Holochain to date. And Cardano aims to improve on technologies that are already widely understood: distributed ledgers, block production, and consensus-based adoption of global state.</p><p>Holochain, by contrast, needs to overcome deep-seated beliefs in order to get developers and users to understand its capabilities. People are so used to the idea that global consensus and universal data replication are the only way to make data secure and immutable that they tend to have trouble believing that it’s possible to guarantee data integrity in a more efficient way. Holochain is a technology at least as disruptive as Ethereum, and remember how many years it took for developers to basically understand Ethereum smart contracts and start building with them? Holochain’s path to awareness is probably more like Ethereum’s in 2014-2017 than Cardano’s today. Then again, more people do seem to be taking notice: the price of Holo Token (HOT) rose even more than ADA over Q1 2020.</p><p>The bottom line: Cardano may be positioned to meet a market demand for a better blockchain and give Ethereum a real run for its money. But Holochain may be poised to leapfrog beyond the lot of them, since it is capable of addressing a set of use cases that blockchain protocols simply cannot, with even higher data integrity and the kind of scalability blockchain can only dream of.</p>

<p>Lots of factors can make renting difficult. Not least, like many cities around the world, Berlin is in the <a href="https://domilabs.io/how-do-you-solve-a-problem-like-berlin-housing/">midst of a housing crisis</a>. But some factors, rather than being large-scale societal problems, are simply missteps, complications or hangovers from old, bureaucratic ways of working in the way we do business in the rental market. For an everyday tenant trying to find a new home, or for a property manager wading through paperwork, bureaucracy and the problem of trying to find someone who will respectfully and consistently take care of an apartment, there are still too many hurdles to cross. Tenants shouldn’t have to wait weeks to know if their application has even been received; property managers shouldn’t have to wade through piles of bureaucracy and data protection difficulty to rent an apartment.</p>



<p>Neither of these situations is the fault of either the tenant or the landlord. But because the rental process offers challenges and concerns for both sides of the relationship, the relationship between property managers and their tenants can sometimes become complicated. This relationship has always been an intricate and fascinating one. On the one hand, tenants and property managers have a shared interest and a common goal: creating a happy and stable home that is mutually beneficial to both sides of the equation. On the other hand, challenges within that relationship, misunderstandings and missteps can create tension and even distrust. This seems a pity. At Domi, we want to work to change this.</p>



<blockquote><p>Domi is working towards improving the landlord/tenant relationship by dealing with three integral issues.</p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, there are some issues – like a situation where the rent is in arrears, or an apartment isn’t in good condition – that require mediation or extra steps. But in general, most problems that arise in the landlord/tenant relationship are expressions of larger issues rather than individual shortcomings. At Domi, we operate on the basis that most people are good people, and as such we’re looking at some of the reasons relationships between tenants and property managers might break down – and how we can address them.</p>



<p>Domi’s digital renting passport makes your life easier in many ways, whether you’re <a href="https://domilabs.io/for-property-managers/">a property manager</a> or <a href="https://domilabs.io/for-tenants/">a tenant</a>. It offers security, efficiency, accessibility and more. But along with these technical and organisational benefits, Domi is also working towards improving the landlord/tenant relationship by dealing with three integral issues – and offering its own solutions.</p>



 Representation 



<p>There’s a strange kind of intimacy inherent within the landlord/tenant relationship. Even before the relationship is formalised with a contract, as a tenant you’re sharing a lot of personal information with a landlord in a bid to get the new home you want. On the other side, as a property manager you want to make sure that your apartment will be in good hands, which means wading through dozens of applications highlighting a candidate’s financial situation, rental history and more. And at the same time, the two of you don’t actually know each other!</p>



<blockquote><p>On the one hand, property managers need trusted insights to help them select a compatible tenant. On the other, a prospective tenant needs to be in control of the information they share and how they present themselves.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is why tenants can sometimes feel as though they’re discriminated against. Perhaps a less traditional working situation (as a freelancer, for example), a lack of rental history (maybe because they are a newcomer who has just arrived in the country) or a reliance on social funding make them feel as though they don’t look good on paper.&nbsp;At the same time, property managers are facing a large and unwieldy amount of data about prospective tenants, as well as the rise of “Mietnomaden”: people who move into a property with no intention of ever paying the rent. According to a recent survey by <a href="https://www.immobilienscout24.de/wissen/vermieten/mietnomaden.html">ImmoScout 24</a>, 52% of landlords have already had experiences with rental nomads, and 35% said they have experienced missed and irregular rent payments.</p>



<p>There are two problems here, affecting both sides of the relationship. On the one hand, property managers need trusted insights to help them select a compatible tenant. On the other, a prospective tenant needs to be in control of the information they share and how they present themselves.</p>



<p>Domi understands this. That’s why our application system allows tenants to create a fuller and more accurate picture of themselves for landlords. Our interface highlights ideal candidates for each property based not just on one element like a high wage but a full picture of the individual, provided using verifiable credentials that a property manager can trust and a tenant can control access to. At the same time, Domi’s filtering of prospective tenants based on verified data removes the majority of the workload from property managers, allowing them more time to assess tenants on a range of factors.</p>



 Speed 



<p>There’s nothing more irritating than a slow process on something you’re both excited about and really need. Tenants need somewhere to live; property managers need their properties to be filled. When processes are slow, this gets frustrating for both parties. It’s a bad first impression and an annoying start to an important relationship!</p>



<p>Speed isn’t just an issue in signing that first contract. It can crop up again around contract renewals, maintenance requests, rent payments and more. It’s an issue on both sides, but our studies of the rental market have found that for the most part, it’s not the people slowing things down, but the processes.</p>



  



<p>Domi digitises the entire rental process, making everything smoother and faster for both parties. With its intuitive user experience, Domi ensures that every step along the way of the rental journey is easy to navigate. Because it’s all digital, it cuts out those time-consuming steps of preparing, presenting and analysing paperwork that testifies to the tenant’s suitability.</p>



<p>Because Domi operates using the principles of self-sovereign identity, the platform is designed around verifiable data. While other property management software uses “smart tenant matching”, this is based on self-assessment forms tenants fill out themselves with unverified data, and additional verification is still needed for identity, financial and credit data. But using Domi, tenants verify their identity, financial and credit information in advance, and then disclose them as verifiable presentations to a property manager. This means that from the first inquiry stage, the property manager has a clear sense of who might be the ideal tenant. Even better, there’s no need to handle or open a PDF, let alone any physical paperwork! Reliability is baked right in, removing yet another time-consuming process.</p>



<p>Speed is also built into the tenant side of the relationship, with a fast and guided acquisition of verifiable identity, financial and credit data, followed by a one-click-apply process. This means that everything happens much more quickly across the relationship, avoiding frustration and waiting times!</p>



 Communication 



<p>In a recent Domi survey, several tenants highlighted the lack of communication as something that caused distrust and distress: “You don’t even know if you are selected [as the tenant] or not. Nobody sends you a message to inform you. It takes forever to find a place, you lose hope.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“It’s almost impossible to reply to everyone – even though I would like to.”</p></blockquote>



<p>On the other side, one property manager shared: “I often receive 300 applications for an apartment in just three days. It’s almost impossible to reply to everyone – even though I would like to.” Another agreed, “I would love to have an overview with all the conversations I had with applicants. But it’s hard to keep track since some call, some… email, and still others send you a message on WhatsApp.” Going through all of these disparate messages is its own fulltime job!</p>



<p>That’s why Domi locates all communication about a property in one place, making it easy for tenants and property managers to stay in touch. You won’t be distracted by other messages piling up, and there’s no need to be confused about whether an email, WhatsApp message, phone call or even snail mail is the appropriate way to get in contact. Domi’s straightforward notifications make it easy to stay in touch, and means that both people know exactly where they need to go to communicate. Because the entire application is processed in the same place on the Domi interface, it makes it easy for tenants to get an update on the status of their application and for property managers to keep on top of communication.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs strives to support the decentralized identity community and to further enhance interoperability between different networks. Doing this also helps us&nbsp;grow and strengthen&nbsp;our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;decentralized identity services. We put privacy at the forefront of our solutions; protecting personal data and individual privacy and upholding international privacy standards are&nbsp;central&nbsp;to our core values.&nbsp;So&nbsp;we were excited to be invited to join the Indicio MainNet as a validator node operator and to set up the&nbsp;ledger’s&nbsp;10th&nbsp;node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, we go through how we went about standing up our Indico node.&nbsp;In brief:&nbsp;</p>



  The Indicio MainNet is an enterprise-grade ledger for&nbsp;use by&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;applications.&nbsp;  We&nbsp;brought up&nbsp;the node&nbsp;using&nbsp;AWS&nbsp;Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) instances within a&nbsp;Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).&nbsp;  We pulled the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;algorithms from the open-source project,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>.&nbsp;  A supporting machine operates the&nbsp;command line interface used to&nbsp;perform steward operations onthe ledger.&nbsp;  We used security&nbsp;groups at&nbsp;the&nbsp;network interface level to create a firewall.&nbsp;  We set up monitoring&nbsp;in AWS CloudWatch using&nbsp;a variety of&nbsp;bash scripting in conjunction with&nbsp;Ubuntu&nbsp;and AWS provided utilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;  We created a&nbsp;regular maintenance schedule.&nbsp;  



<p>The Indicio MainNet&nbsp;is an&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">enterprise-grade&nbsp;network</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;use by&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;applications. It is a&nbsp;distributed ledger&nbsp;which&nbsp;allows&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identifiers, verifiable credential&nbsp;schemas&nbsp;and other non-personally identifiable information to be written to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>MainNet is based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>, an open-source project for distributed ledgers.&nbsp;A&nbsp;number of Hyperledger Indy&nbsp;ledgers exist for a variety of purposes.&nbsp;A different provider runs each ledger (e.g.&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrinnetwork</a>).&nbsp;All Indy-based ledgers are&nbsp;intended to be&nbsp;interoperable&nbsp;by design,&nbsp;meaning their DIDs, DIDs methods and DID Docs are cross-ledger compatible.&nbsp;Anonyome Labs supports compatibility with different Indy-based ledgers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an emerging&nbsp;developer of&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;software,&nbsp;we know&nbsp;relationships with existing ledgers areinvaluable, so&nbsp;when&nbsp;new ledgers are brought up in the&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;identity&nbsp;space,&nbsp;our team finds opportunities to&nbsp;get&nbsp;involved.&nbsp;In this case, we were proud to be invited to&nbsp;join the Indicio&nbsp;Node&nbsp;Operator Program&nbsp;to&nbsp;run a&nbsp;production level&nbsp;MainNet&nbsp;ledger node.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some&nbsp;technical requirements&nbsp;must be met&nbsp;to become a&nbsp;validator&nbsp;on the Indicio MainNet.&nbsp;Since&nbsp;Anonyome joined&nbsp;the&nbsp;MainNet directly&nbsp;(i.e.,&nbsp;as opposed to progressing through sandboxed test environments first),&nbsp;we made&nbsp;additional security and efficiency decisions to ensure&nbsp;we set up&nbsp;a robust&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The&nbsp;two&nbsp;nodes&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Figure 1 shows the&nbsp;architecture of the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node and supporting systems. The&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node runs the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;algorithms developed under the open-sourced project Hyperledger Indy.&nbsp;We set up another&nbsp;node to run the&nbsp;command line interface&nbsp;(CLI) used to interact with the ledger.&nbsp;While it was not a requirement for the CLI node to be&nbsp;hosted on&nbsp;an AWS server, it better suited&nbsp;our use case&nbsp;because it kept the&nbsp;node&nbsp;accessible.&nbsp;We have&nbsp;node&nbsp;administrators across Australian and US&nbsp;time zones, so&nbsp;it was desirable to&nbsp;host the CLI on an EC2 instance that all administrators&nbsp;could&nbsp;manage&nbsp;at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these nodes run&nbsp;Ubuntu&nbsp;16.04 LTS&nbsp;(an upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 is imminent), with the CLI&nbsp;node&nbsp;as a t2.micro&nbsp;instance&nbsp;and the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node as a t3.xlarge&nbsp;instance.&nbsp;T2 and T3 are different EC2 instance types offered by Amazon. Each of these instance types offer tiers that differ in CPU, RAM and billing prices. In terms of memory,&nbsp;we allocated&nbsp;the&nbsp;CLI node&nbsp;one disk with&nbsp;10GB. This is sufficient for the administrative duties carried out on that node.&nbsp;We allocated the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;instance two disks, one with 10GB EBS and the other with 250GB EBS. The 250GB disk is&nbsp;used for the Indy ledger databases. All of these disks are&nbsp;also volume level&nbsp;encrypted, and&nbsp;we allocated&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra&nbsp;2&nbsp;CPUs&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node to&nbsp;account for the&nbsp;extra level&nbsp;of encryption.Our nodes run in AWS&nbsp;Asia Pacific (Sydney)&nbsp;ap-southeast-2.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 1:&nbsp;The&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node and the CLI&nbsp;node&nbsp;



<p>The&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node&nbsp;provides&nbsp;capacity to run&nbsp;the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;consensus&nbsp;algorithm&nbsp;which&nbsp;keeps&nbsp;its&nbsp;node database in sync with the network.&nbsp;The&nbsp;CLI&nbsp;node&nbsp;is used for&nbsp;ledger related operations and&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node&nbsp;administration.&nbsp;The separation&nbsp;is for security purposes,&nbsp;because&nbsp;the two tasks require different firewall settings and stored credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 1&nbsp;also&nbsp;shows&nbsp;two subnets:&nbsp;a public&nbsp;subnet&nbsp;and&nbsp;an&nbsp;inter-validator subnet. Within&nbsp;these two&nbsp;subnets&nbsp;are three network interfaces:&nbsp;</p>



  the&nbsp;CLI&nbsp;interface&nbsp;  



  the&nbsp;client-to-validator network interface&nbsp;  



  the&nbsp;validator-to-validator network interface.&nbsp;  



<p>There is a single network interface attached to the CLI instance. This is called&nbsp;the CLI network interface. It resides within the public subnet&nbsp;to provide&nbsp;an endpoint for communications involving ledger utility.&nbsp;This includes SSH requests from the Anonyome node administrators,&nbsp;access to software repositories, and access to CloudWatch alarms for monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two network interfaces attached to the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;node:&nbsp;the validator-to-validator network interface and the client-to-validator network interface.&nbsp;The&nbsp;validator-to-validator network interface resides within the inter-validator subnet.&nbsp;An&nbsp;AWS elastic IP&nbsp;endpoint within the inter-validator subnet allows for&nbsp;communication with other validator nodes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The client-to-validator network interface is in the public subnet. This&nbsp;provides&nbsp;a&nbsp;publicly exposed endpoint,used&nbsp;for&nbsp;cloud agent and wallet&nbsp;communications to the validator node.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Security&nbsp;groups&nbsp;as a&nbsp;firewall&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>The firewall is implemented&nbsp;using&nbsp;AWS security groups that are added to network interfaces.&nbsp;Security groups&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html">control inbound and outbound traffic</a>, allowing administrators to limit traffic to certain addresses on specific ports and message protocols. As the security groups are implemented at the network interface level, different interfaces could be assigned a different firewall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security groups contain rules that permit or deny certain IP addresses over specific protocols. Such rules target certain types of traffic. For example, there may be a rule that&nbsp;permits SSH requests from certain IP addresses into the nodes.&nbsp;Another permissible rule could be for outbound traffic to the address of AWS CloudWatch to send monitoring updates&nbsp;over the HTTPS protocol.&nbsp;The three network interfaces have differentsets of&nbsp;security groups&nbsp;determined by&nbsp;what types of traffic are permitted and denied&nbsp;for&nbsp;each network interface.&nbsp;</p>



 Monitoring&nbsp;the&nbsp;nodes&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Monitoring is set up using&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">AWS CloudWatch</a>,&nbsp;Slack&nbsp;hooks and bash scripts.&nbsp;We chose&nbsp;CloudWatch&nbsp;so we could&nbsp;set up alarms on custom metrics.&nbsp;Metrics are values of certain node states that&nbsp;must be&nbsp;monitored, such as&nbsp;any files with permissions&nbsp;that leave them vulnerable&nbsp;to compromise.&nbsp;Anonyome uses&nbsp;a cron job&nbsp;thatperiodically runs&nbsp;a script to&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;certain system states&nbsp;and writes these states&nbsp;to a log file.&nbsp;The same cron job also runs another&nbsp;script&nbsp;that&nbsp;then reads the log file and posts the state of each metric to CloudWatch. If the metric is in a predefined alarmable state, CloudWatch will run a Lambda function that posts a&nbsp;warning message&nbsp;to a dedicated Slack monitoring channel.&nbsp;This is how Anonyome&nbsp;administrators&nbsp;monitor the Indicio nodes.&nbsp;You can see this approach in Figure 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Figure 2:&nbsp;We monitor the&nbsp;validator&nbsp;and CLI nodes using&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">AWS CloudWatch</a>, Slack hooks and bash scripts&nbsp;



 Going&nbsp;forward&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>After joining MainNet, nodes need to be kept up to date with the latest software.&nbsp;Node administrators are responsible for updating security&nbsp;patches every week&nbsp;where necessary.&nbsp;We have set up an&nbsp;AMI management policy to create&nbsp;timely&nbsp;backups of the validator and CLI nodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yahoo Finance: In 2013, people were in shock that the price had climbed from $1 to $1000 in a few short years. This coincided with NXT by Jelurida, the first to implement a pure proof-of-stake consensus protocol. It was both reliable and energy-efficient, and required minimal hardware. The proof-of-stake algorithm coined by NXT has stood the test of time, with no successful attacks since it launched.</p>

<p>How new forms of digital-physical ownership can provide financial security in a volatile era, presented by Lohko Wallet and Mattereum (Co-written by Vinay Gupta, Antti Saarnio, and Garrison Breckenridge)</p><a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/y-BIhyjjHv4">Gold &amp; Bitcoin</a> by Aleksi Räisä via&nbsp;Unsplash<p>In the following, we propose that the union of gold and the emerging crypto asset class can provide an alternative means for securing financial resilience in times of crisis as monetary policies continue to favor corporations over people, all the while maximizing upside and minimizing downside in these volatile&nbsp;markets.</p><p>Specifically, we introduce the Gold NFT, a form of tokenized gold bullion that denotes and enforces true ownership with physical delivery capabilities rather than mere “exposure.”</p><p>In the long view, this feat in legal and software engineering could effectively bring hundreds of trillions in underutilized physical assets into the growing crypto economy, providing much needed stability and variety to this new era of virtual&nbsp;economy.</p> The Many Facets of Gold and its Challenges <p>For millennia, cultures across the world have ascribed value to gold in numerous forms: from collectibles fashioned into jewelry, to physical coinage, to global reserve currency, to inflation hedge in turbulent economic times (say, for example, a global pandemic.)</p><p>While this shiny yellow rock once formed a large portion of the monetary base, since the 1970s the global economy has moved further and further from an asset-backed system to a debt-based one.</p><p>While gold is largely used as a hedge against volatility by institutional investors and the wealthy, it has also been proposed as an ideal form of non-state store of value by retail investors and enthusiasts (“gold&nbsp;bugs.”)</p><p>However, gold ownership provides certain challenges and considerations:</p>  Custody: Gold ownership is highly custodial, with trusted third parties tasked with securing the gold in vaults. Being a physical asset difficult to transport in any high-velocity manner, this is unavoidable.  Abstraction: In practice, customers do not own the actual gold but rather IOUs in the form of gram-denominated tokens or certificates that promise backing by a reserve. In some cases, if the custodian goes under, however, the customer is left with a promise, not the actual asset&nbsp;itself.  Liquidity: Liquidity of physical gold outside of major markets like London is difficult to maintain as it is a physical asset rather than bits on a balance sheet. Physical ownership is also becoming less prominent with gold ETFs providing exposure in lieu of owning the “real” thing, which is fine… until it&nbsp;isn’t.  Scalability: There is an argument to be made that fiat arose from the systemic and infrastructure limitations of scaling gold ownership. As central banks increasingly abstracted ownership over time, eventually a methodology of pure abstraction took over in the form of&nbsp;fiat.  <p>Gold is not the only form of non-state money to catch fire over the years. After over three decades of experimentation in digital currencies, a new global financial network has risen to prominence, producing perhaps the perfect portfolio asset to pair with gold as well as an infrastructure capable of securing digital-physical ownership of&nbsp;gold.</p> The Emergence of the Crypto&nbsp;Economy <p>The invention of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain did not occur in a vacuum. The technical pedigree of this enigmatic asset goes back decades, encompassing diverse fields such as public-key cryptography, shared ledgers, distributed systems design, and many others. Satoshi Nakamoto’s genius was in how they synthesized these established concepts into a whole system that persisted into the future, much to the surprise (and chagrin) of&nbsp;many.</p><p>Much of Bitcoin’s design is influenced by that precious yellow rock, gold. When people refer to Bitcoin as “digital gold,” they are usually referencing shared qualities of scarcity (limited in supply), production cycle (both expend work to mine/produce over time), and use as a non-state store of&nbsp;value.</p><p>In fact, one of the biggest influences on Bitcoin’s design was <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/bit-gold/">bitgold</a>, a proposed cryptocurrency which sought to emulate gold’s inherent characteristics through a digital&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Despite and perhaps due to their explosive growth (with the exception of a few specially-designed cases), cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are incredibly volatile, to a degree which can inhibit utility and adoption.</p><p>We propose that through leveraging the relatively stable and long-term store of value of physical gold and the emerging paradigm of digital value through Bitcoin and the crypto asset class, individuals can secure their financial security and sovereignty on their own terms and participate in a new era of digital-physical ownership.</p><p>So how do we do&nbsp;this?</p> Digitizing Gold Ownership and Beyond with Mattereum and Lohko&nbsp;Wallet <p>As outlined above, the challenges of gold ownership as it is conducted today are not trivial. Ultimately, this is a fundamental problem stemming from a lack of integration between the legal structures that govern the realm of physical property and the software systems which facilitate and enforce&nbsp;it.</p><p>So how do we legally enforce and digitally execute ownership of gold such that the bearer truly owns uniquely identifiable gold bullion in a vault, rather than vicariously through an IOU in the form of a gram-denominated token or certificate?</p><p>Enter: the Gold&nbsp;NFT.</p><p><a href="https://lohkowallet.com/">Lohko Wallet</a> is a digital wallet provider that specializes in secure custody of tokenized financial assets, including physical assets such as gold and silver. In order to properly enforce true ownership of gold bullion through a digital interface, Lohko has partnered with <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> to provide the necessary legal engineering to bind globally-tradable digital assets in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to unique gold bullion securely held in vaults maintained by gold exchange,<a href="https://www.bullionstar.com/"> BullionStar</a>.</p><p>The owner of the NFT can at any time redeem the token for full physical delivery of the uniquely identifiable gold bullion. No IOUs. True ownership.</p><p>The legal innovation at work that bridges this digital/physical divide is the Mattereum Asset Passport. Similarly to how a passport for international travel bundles various information to identify an individual, the Asset Passport is a bundle of legal and digital agreements which denotes true ownership of an object while providing secure digital provenance, certificates of authenticity, insurance frameworks, and dispute resolution in the event of any systemic or commercial fallout. These legal agreements are cryptographically signed and secured on-chain and stored in distributed storage networks such as&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>Potential investors in Gold NFTs include NFT digital artists wishing to mint premium editions of their works backed by redeemable physical gold bars (and soon, even have the bar physically cast with their art on it), collectors aiming to acquire an altogether new class of NFT with the bound gold providing a base and less-volatile value, and investors seeking to hedge against volatility of the crypto and fiat markets through direct ownership as opposed to gold ETFs or other abstracted means.</p><p>The launch of Gold NFTs and other classes of Real-World Asset NFTs is an attempt at bridging the virtual economy with the physical world in a lasting way, giving rise to some incredible capabilities in the realm of finance, commerce, and our quality of&nbsp;life.</p><p>In the realm of finance, the panoply of asset classes which colossally dwarf crypto even at the height of a bull market can be accessed through the same global payment rails and open protocols which define the crypto phenomenon. This breaks the constraint of crypto in the realm of bits to encompass the material world. More importantly, this new territory is open to&nbsp;all.</p><p>In commerce, tokenized physical goods can be transacted securely peer-to-peer with properly engineered legal mechanisms in place to help allay the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has historically produced price distortions of goods in digital commerce.</p><p>Ultimately, maintaining a secure identity and provenance system around physical goods along the supply chain can allow us to see the truth in what we bring into the world. By bridging this divide, we can get a clearer picture of inefficiencies and injustices throughout the global machinery of trade (carbon tracking, anti-counterfeiting, anti-slavery, etc.)</p><p>This novel experiment in asset ownership by Lohko and Mattereum showcases the potential of Real-World Asset NFTs. Finally, new forms of ownership and utility can be programmed around an object: democratizing access to capital, unlocking trillions in stranded value, and paving the path to a more egalitarian and sustainable society.</p><p>About Mattereum</p><p>London-based Mattereum was established in 2017 by a trans-disciplinary team with a track record in designing and launching nation state-level infrastructure and headed by former Ethereum release coordinator Vinay Gupta. With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p><p>About Lohko&nbsp;Wallet</p><p>Lohko is an easy-to-use digital wallet for real assets that helps investors safely buy, hold, control, and transfer their assets.

			<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny Solutions</a> and <a href="https://monerium.com/">Monerium</a> have teamed up to improve the accessibility of security tokens by bringing the digital euro to secondary transfers. Tokeny’s Billboard solution provides a white-label secondary market platform for security tokens, whilst Monerium is a regulated e-money issuer on blockchains. The partnership aims to allow traditional investors to benefit from the investment opportunities brought by blockchain at ease.</p>
<p>The Monerium IBAN solution allows investors to send euros directly between their bank accounts and blockchain wallets. Tokeny has added this fiat-gateway solution within the Billboard platform to allow investors to express their intentions and trade security tokens pairs for digital euro.</p>
<p>As the market grows, more and more investors from the traditional financial world want to take part in the secondary trading of security tokens. Thanks to Billboard, issuers already have the technology to provide a secondary market for their investors. However, investors have been forced to exchange fiat money for stable coins on crypto exchanges prior to their peer-to-peer security token transaction, making the transfer complex, costly and slow.</p>
<p>With the addition of the digital euro in the Billboard ecosystem, investors no longer need to use exchanges to “buy” e-money tokens. Instead, they can send money directly from their bank accounts to blockchain wallets, and back, instantly, seamlessly and without the slippage and costs of going through an exchange. This user-friendly experience is essential to allow investors to benefit from direct digital ownership of fungible money tokens and fosters financial inclusion, mass adoption, and improved liquidity.</p>

		 
	 
    Monerium’s easy-to-use e-money solution brings accessibility to non-crypto investors while Billboard provides issuers with a secondary market solution to improve liquidity for their financial instrument. Issuers can now enhance their value proposition to investors. The more investors that join the ecosystem, the more they will benefit from positive network effects.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions       Tokeny is pioneering peer-to-peer marketplaces for digital securities and helping bring more liquidity to private markets. Having money and securities on the same ledger enables real-time delivery-vs-payment at lower cost and with lower execution risk than in current systems. We look forward to providing issuers and investors using the Tokeny Billboard ecosystem with authorized forms of money.  Sveinn ValfellsCEO of Monerium

  In the digital era, IT is increasingly being provided and consumed as cloud-based services, including Identity and Access Management (IAM). As more workloads and IT services move to the cloud, it makes sense to move IAM to the cloud as well. The most common path is to opt for an Identity as a service (IDaaS) solution, but this is not without its risks and challenges.

<p>Modern-day mobile apps do so much. They communicate with different back-ends via network APIs. They store and retrieve data from the local database, do heavy media processing, and communicate with web sockets. It’s hard to keep track of all the information from different asynchronous data sources, especially knowing that the users are accustomed to constantly having a fluid experience with the apps they use.</p>
 
 
<p>In the early days of Android, developers used the class <code>AsyncTask</code> from the Android framework for doing all the work outside of the main UI thread. Even though async tasks did what they’re supposed to, using them wasn’t the most pleasant experience because of all the boilerplate code you would ultimately end up writing and due to scalability issues. If you had a more advanced use case (i.e., presenting data from a local database on the UI while making an API request to fetch the latest data from the backend, updating the local database, and presenting the latest data on the UI), things would quickly get out of hand. You would end up with code that is hard to understand and maintain.</p>
 
 
<p>Many of those problems were solved by releasing the Java version of the ReactiveX API, called RxJava. It is a library that introduced the concept of data streams and functional programming to the Android platform. It became quite popular with the developer community because of the advanced features and boilerplate reduction it introduced. Chaining tasks from different threads into one logical sequence became easier to write and understand.</p>
 
 
<p>In this post, you’ll learn the basics of RxJava on Android by building a real-world example of server-client communication. Then, you’ll create a production-ready back-end app that will provide an API to authorized users from the Android app. The OIDC authorization will be implemented with the help of Okta OIDC SDKs on both apps.</p>
 
 
<p>Fasten your seatbelt; your reactive journey starts here!</p>

 Create Android RxJava and Reactive Java Apps 
 
 
<p>As mentioned, you will create both back-end and Android apps. The good news is that you won’t need to do it from scratch; cloning them from GitHub will suffice.</p>
 
 
 Clone the Backend Reactive Spring Boot App 
 
<p>The back-end app is based on the <a>Build Reactive APIs with Spring WebFlux</a> blog post. The app is a Java API that uses the Spring Boot framework and the WebFlux library for reactive streams, and it relies on a MongoDB database for storage.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the finished app on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-webflux-react-example">GitHub</a>. Run the following command to clone the project:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-webflux-react-example.git reactive-spring-boot
cd reactive-spring-boot/reactive-web</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Select Other.
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and use <code>http://localhost:8080</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Copy your Okta values from <code>.okta.env</code> into the  <code>reactive-spring-boot/reactive-web/src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also use the instructions in the repo’s <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-spring-webflux-react-example#getting-started">getting started section</a>.</p>
 
 






Please ignore the set-up of the React native app since it’s not needed for this example. But if you’re interested in it, feel free to set it up and see how it works!



 
 
<p>The next step is to remove the scope on the MongoDB dependency so it runs along with our web app. Do that by removing the string <code>&lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;</code> from line 49 of the file <code>reactive-spring-boot/reactive-web/pom.xml</code>. This will make it so an embedded MongoDB server starts when you start your app.</p>
 
 
<p>Now you can run the server by running the command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see something like this in your terminal:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>To test this, open a new terminal window and run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl http://localhost:8080/profiles -v</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This API call should fail because you need to be authenticated to access that resource, and it should look like this:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>That’s all from the web app. The rest of this tutorial will focus on building a reactive Android app that will communicate with the web app. Leave the server running in the terminal and proceed to the next step.</p>
 
 
 
 Clone the Android App 
 
<p>The Android app you’ll use for this guide is based on the <a>Android Login Made Easy with OIDC</a> blog post. Please go ahead and clone the result of the blog post by running this command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-android-login-example.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Native and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/</code>
    (where <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Native App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Native App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Once you have the credentials for your new app, don’t forget to update both your <a>build.gradle file</a> and the <a>OktaManager’s</a> class with the credentials from your newly created Okta mobile app.</p>
 
 
<p>Once you have the credentials for your new app, update <code>app/build.gradle</code> to use your reversed Okta domain name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>manifestPlaceholders = [
    "appAuthRedirectScheme": "com.okta.dev-133337"
]</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, update <code>src/main/java/dev/dbikic/oktaloginexample/OktaManager.kt</code> to have your client ID, issuer, and other Okta settings.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>val config = OIDCConfig.Builder()
    .clientId("{yourClientID}")
    .discoveryUri("/oauth2/default")
    .redirectUri("{yourReversedOktaDomain}:/callback")
    .endSessionRedirectUri("{yourReversedOktaDomain}:/")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>And voilà, the setup is done! Now you just have to start the server by running the following command in the root folder of the Spring Boot app:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Reactive Android App 
 
 
<p>Now it’s time to modify the existing Android app, set up the networking, and add the RxJava library. You’re going to use the <a href="https://square.github.io/retrofit/">Retrofit</a> library for networking, which is the de-facto standard for Android. The plan is that you connect to your Spring Boot web app API and reactively do a few API calls. Let’s get started!</p>
 
 
 Add RxJava and Retrofit Dependencies 
 
<p>To add the needed library dependencies, paste the following lines into the <code>dependencies</code> block of the <code>app/build.gradle</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>dependencies {
    ...
    // RxJava
    implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxjava:3.0.0' (1)
    implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava3:rxandroid:3.0.0' (2)

    // Retrofit
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0' (3)
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0' (4)
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:adapter-rxjava3:2.9.0' (5)
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The main <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a> library


2
The <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid">RxJava bindings for Android</a>, needed for thread management


3
The main <a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit">Retrofit</a> dependency that includes the HTTP client you’ll use


4
The converter for <a href="https://github.com/google/gson">Gson</a>, used to deserialize data from the API automatically


5
The <a href="https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-adapters/rxjava2">RxJava version of CallAdapter.Factory</a> from Retrofit, used to make the API calls reactive functions


 
 
 
 






Please don’t paste the <code>…​</code> into Android Studio; it’s just an indicator that some other code exists either above or below the code to paste.



 
 
 
 Set Up Networking 
 
<p>This part consists of a few parts, the most important being the Retrofit client. Once you instantiate it, you’ll use it for making all the API calls. Create a new package called <code>network</code> (just for the sake of code organization), and create the <code>RetrofitClientInstance</code> Kotlin file:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network

import okhttp3.Interceptor
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
import retrofit2.Retrofit
import retrofit2.adapter.rxjava3.RxJava3CallAdapterFactory
import retrofit2.converter.gson.GsonConverterFactory

object RetrofitClientInstance {

    lateinit var retrofit: Retrofit

    private const val BASE_URL = "http://10.0.2.2:8080/" (1)

    private var token = ""

    val retrofitInstance: Retrofit
        get() {
            if (!this::retrofit.isInitialized) {
                val headersInterceptor = Interceptor { chain -&gt;
                    val requestBuilder = chain.request().newBuilder()
                    requestBuilder.header("Authorization", "Bearer $token") (2)
                    chain.proceed(requestBuilder.build())
                }
                val okHttpClient = OkHttpClient() (3)
                    .newBuilder()
                    .followRedirects(true)
                    .addInterceptor(headersInterceptor) (4)
                    .build()
                retrofit = Retrofit.Builder() (5)
                    .baseUrl(BASE_URL) (6)
                    .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create()) (7)
                    .addCallAdapterFactory(RxJava3CallAdapterFactory.create()) (8)
                    .client(okHttpClient) (9)
                    .build()
            }
            return retrofit
        }

    fun setToken(token: String) { (10)
        RetrofitClientInstance.token = token
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code><a href="http://10.0.2.2:8080/">http://10.0.2.2:8080/</a></code> is the URL representing your computer’s <code>localhost</code> address. More info about it can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking">here</a>.


2
Adds the JWT token as a header of all the API calls you make. Without it, our server would fail all the requests to it with <code>401 Unauthorized</code>.


3
<a href="https://square.github.io/okhttp/">OkHttp</a> is an HTTP client that comes bundled with Retrofit.


4
Add the <code>headersInterceptor</code> to <code>okHttpClient</code>. The interceptor code block will execute on every API call you make, allowing us to always send our JWT token.


5
Creates an instance of Retrofit.


6
Defines the base URL for convenience purposes. Now when you define the endpoints, you can omit the base URL part.


7
Creates the converter factory for Gson, which allows automatic deserialization of values received from the API.


8
This line adds RxJava support to Retrofit, allowing you to define the API calls as reactive functions.


9
Sets the <code>okHttpClient</code> as the HTTP client.


10
Setter to the JWT token field. Once you log in to the app, you’ll receive the JWT token from the Okta OIDC SDK and use it for every API call.


 
 
 
 
<p>In order for you to connect to the Spring Boot app, which is running at the localhost of your machine, from the Android emulator, you need to add the following line in the <code>application</code> tag of your <code>app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  package="dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample"&gt;
  ...
  &lt;application
    ...
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/application&gt;
&lt;/manifest&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Let’s talk a bit about the API you’ll connect to. The idea of connecting the API from the Spring Boot app is to provide you with endpoints to create, read, update and delete user profiles. A user profile is a relatively simple model, consisting only of a unique id and an email. Create a new package <code>model</code> (just for organizational purposes, the same as the <code>network</code> package), and create two Kotlin files, <code>Profile</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model

import com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName

data class Profile(
    @SerializedName("id") (1)
    val id: String,
    @SerializedName("email")
    val email: String
)</code> 
 
 
 


1
The <code>SerializedName</code> annotation from Gson allows you to define the name of a field when it’s serialized/deserialized into/from JSON.


 
 
 
 
<p>And <code>ProfileRequest</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model

import com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName

data class ProfileRequest(
    @SerializedName("email")
    val email: String
)</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The next step is defining the API of the Spring Boot app. It’s pretty simple to do it with the help of Retrofit; you define endpoints as a function of an interface and configure them using annotations. Create the <code>ProfileService</code> interface in your <code>network</code> package:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network

import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model.Profile
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model.ProfileRequest
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Completable
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Observable
import retrofit2.http.*

interface ProfileService {

    @GET("/profiles") (1)
    fun getProfiles(): Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt; (2)

    @POST("/profiles") (3)
    fun createProfile(
        @Body profile: ProfileRequest (4)
    ): Completable (5)

    @DELETE("/profiles/{profile_id}") (6)
    fun deleteProfile(
        @Path("profile_id") profileId: String (7)
    ): Completable

    @PUT("/profiles/{profile_id}") (8)
    fun updateProfile(
        @Path("profile_id") profileId: String,
        @Body profile: ProfileRequest
    ): Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code>GET</code> annotation defines that this is a GET HTTP request.


2
The return type is an <code>Observable</code> of a list of profiles. Please ignore what <code>Observable</code> is for now; the next section will explain it.


3
<code>POST</code> annotation defines that this is a POST HTTP request.


4
<code>Body</code> annotation defines the body of the <code>POST</code> request.


5
The return type is a <code>Completable</code>. Please ignore what <code>Completable</code> is for now; it will be explained in the next section.


6
<code>DELETE</code> annotation defines that this is a DELETE HTTP request.


7
<code>Path</code> annotation defines the path to a specific profile via its <code>profileId</code>.


8
<code>PUT</code> annotation defines that this is a PUT HTTP request.


 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! You’re now ready to start using reactive networking in your app!</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Use RxJava to Access the Profile API 
 
 
<p>Now that the API is defined, you are ready to consume its endpoints.</p>
 
 
<p>The reason why RxJava is so useful and popular on Android is that it brings the concepts of the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming to the platform. But, it has a steep learning curve, and it’s a bit harder for people used to writing procedural code to understand at first.</p>
 
 
<p>RxJava introduces the concept of data streams, where different sources of data (like a network API or the local database) are evaluated as data streams that can be observed, combined, or modified, all depending on the use case. This manipulation of data streams is performed by different operators that you get out of the box, which hides the complexity of the logic they do in the background. Once you learn how to use the operators (and how to explore the library to find more of them), complex manipulation of different data sources, which would be super hard and complex to implement on Android using the platform provided async tasks, can be as simple as a few lines of code.</p>
 
 
<p>Operators won’t be used or explained in-depth in this post, but if you want to learn more about them, please check the <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html">official docs</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>As part of this tutorial, you’ll learn about data streams and how to observe them. There are two basic parts of every data stream: (1) the data source and (2) the data consumer. In RxJava, the basic data source is called <code>Observable</code>. All that an <code>Observable</code> does is emit data in some time interval. If you want to listen to the emitted items, you need to create an <code>Observer</code> and subscribe to the <code>Observable</code> updates.</p>
 
 
<p>That’s exactly what you’ll do in this example. You’ve already defined that the Spring Boot API is returning an <code>Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;</code> when you fetch the profiles from the API. When you call the <code>getProfiles()</code> function,  an <code>Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;</code> object type is created and returned.</p>
 
 
<p>You will subscribe for the updates, but there won’t be any updates the moment you do the API call.  Sometime in the future (or maybe never, as  Retrofit has a mechanism to fail an API call if a specified timeout has passed), the API will respond. That response can either be a success or a failure - it doesn’t matter. What matters is that a callback will notify the subscriber, and you can handle either response gracefully.</p>
 
 
<p>Let’s see how you’ll add this functionality to the codebase!</p>
 
 
 Fetch Profiles 
 
<p>As described above, the purpose of our API is to provide access to profiles, but only for authenticated users. In the Android app, the user login is handled by the Okta OIDC SDK. Once the user is authorized, he/she is navigated to the <code>HomeActivity</code>. The sign-in process will generate a new JWT token for the user, and he/she can use it to access the API.</p>
 
 
<p>First, add a method to expose the JWT token to the <code>OktaManager</code> class:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
fun getJwtToken(): String {
    return sessionClient.tokens.accessToken.orEmpty()
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the <code>HomeActivity</code> class (in <code>app/src/main/java/dev/dbikic/oktaloginexample/ui</code>):</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network.ProfileService
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network.RetrofitClientInstance
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.network.RetrofitClientInstance.retrofitInstance
import io.reactivex.rxjava3.disposables.CompositeDisposable
...
class HomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    ...
    private val profileService: ProfileService = retrofitInstance.create( (1)
        ProfileService::class.java
    )
    private var compositeDisposable = CompositeDisposable() (2)

    ...

    override fun onStop() {
        compositeDisposable.clear() (3)
        super.onStop()
    }

    ...

    private fun getUserProfileCallback(): RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
        return object : RequestCallback&lt;UserInfo, AuthorizationException&gt; {
            override fun onSuccess(result: UserInfo) {
                binding.userLabel.text = "Hello, ${result["preferred_username"]}!"
                RetrofitClientInstance.setToken(oktaManager.getJwtToken()) (4)
                fetchProfiles()
            }

            override fun onError(msg: String?, exception: AuthorizationException?) {
                Log.d("HomeActivity", "Error: $msg")
            }
        }
    }

    fun fetchProfiles() { (5)

    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Create an instance of the <code>ProfileService</code>. Interacting with it will allow you to access the API.


2
<code>CompositeDisposable</code> is a class that provides you a simple way of canceling your reactive data streams.


3
You want to stop listening for the data stream updates once this activity is destroyed.


4
Here, you’re setting the JWT token from the logged-in user in your <code>RetrofitClientInstance</code>, with the help of the Okta OIDC SDK and the <code>OktaManager</code> class.


5
Once the user is logged in, you want to fetch all the profiles from the API. You’ll implement this method in the next step.


 
 
 
 
<p>Fetching profiles is done by creating a new <code>Observer</code>, which will observe all the changes from the <code>getProfiles()</code> data stream. Add the <code>fetchProfiles()</code> method to the end of <code>HomeActivity</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun fetchProfiles() {
    compositeDisposable.add( (1)
        profileService.getProfiles() (2)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) (3)
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) (4)
            .subscribe( (5)
                { profiles -&gt; (6)
                    displayProfiles(profiles) (7)
                },
                { throwable -&gt; (8)
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
You are adding the result of the subscription, which is a class that implements the interface <code>Disposable</code> to our list of subscriptions, so you can cancel it once the current activity gets destroyed.


2
Fetch the profiles from the API; this returns <code>Observable&lt;List&lt;Profile&gt;&gt;</code>.


3
This defines that the actual subscription is done on the <code>I/O</code> thread, which is the one used for networking.


4
Observe the result of the subscription on the main thread. This is also called the UI thread because that’s the only thread that can modify the UI. More info about this can be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/processes-and-threads#Threads">here</a>.


5
The <code>Observer</code> object is created here. It consists of two consumers, which are just callbacks, for the <code>onNext</code> and <code>onError</code> events.


6
The <code>onNext</code> consumers.  Here you’ll receive the list of profiles in the UI thread, ready to be displayed to the user.


7
Update the UI with the received profiles. This will be implemented in the next section.


8
The <code>onError</code> consumer. This will be invoked when you receive an error from the API, or you mess things up with the deserialization.


 
 
 
 






You will have to add imports manually by clicking the red text and pressing the key combination <code>Option + Enter</code> on MacOS or <code>Alt + Enter</code> on Windows. This step may be required when pasting the code. You can also enable the "Add unambiguous imports on the fly" option (<code>Preferences | Editor | Auto Import</code>) to add imports automatically in Android Studio.



 
 
 
 Create Profiles 
 
<p>Let’s move on to creating a profile. The idea here is to create a new profile with a button click. For simplicity, you won’t implement email validation; you’ll just send the current timestamp as the profile’s email. Add the <code>createProfile()</code> method to the bottom of <code>HomeActivity</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun createProfile() {
    val profile = ProfileRequest(email = System.currentTimeMillis().toString()) (1)
    compositeDisposable.add(
        profileService.createProfile(profile) (2)
            .andThen(profileService.getProfiles()) (3)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .subscribe(
                { profiles -&gt;
                    displayProfiles(profiles) (4)
                },
                { throwable -&gt;
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Create a new profile.


2
Send the new profile to the API. This method doesn’t return an <code>Observable</code>, but it returns a <code>Completable</code>. The difference between the two is explained below this code snippet.


3
Once the profile is created on the API, request all the profiles from the API.


4
Display the new list of profiles, including the one you just created. You will implement this method in the next section of this blog post.


 
 
 
 
<p>In the example above, you used <code>Completable</code>. It’s a type of observable that has only two consumers, <code>onComplete</code> and <code>onError</code>, as opposed to <code>Observable</code> which has three consumers (<code>onNext</code>, <code>onError</code> and <code>onComplete</code>).</p>
 
 
<p>You can look at <code>Completable</code> as a data stream for which you don’t care about the possible events that can be emitted. You don’t even care if multiple events are being emitted in a time interval. You only care if at least one item has been emitted or if the data stream has failed. This is different from <code>Observable</code>; in <code>Observable</code>, you do care about all the events that have been emitted in a time interval, hence the naming of the method in which you receive the result, <code>onNext</code>. This indicates that the transmission of the data isn’t over, but rather that a new item has been emitted.</p>
 
 
<p>With <code>Completable</code>, you simply want to know when an operation is done. Here is a simple example. You created a profile and you submitted it to the API. You already know what that profile is, and you just want to know when it’s created on the API, so you can fetch the most recent profiles list and display it on the UI.</p>
 
 
 
 Delete a Profile 
 
<p>Code for deleting is practically the same as the one for creating the profile. The only difference is the API call that is being made. The rest of the logic is the same, once the <code>deleteProfile()</code> completes, fetch the profiles and display them on the UI. Add the <code>deleteProfiles()</code> method:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun deleteProfile(profile: Profile) {
    compositeDisposable.add(
        profileService.deleteProfile(profile.id) (1)
            .andThen(profileService.getProfiles())
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .subscribe(
                { profiles -&gt;
                    displayProfiles(profiles)
                },
                { throwable -&gt;
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code>

Send the id of the profile you want to delete to the method that does the delete API call.


 
 
 
 
 
 Update a Profile 
 
<p>Updating profiles is similar to creating a profile; you’ll create a new profile and do the update API call with the id of the profile you want to update. Add the <code>updateProfile()</code> method like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...
private fun updateProfile(oldProfile: Profile) {
    val profile = ProfileRequest(email = System.currentTimeMillis().toString())
    compositeDisposable.add(
        profileService.updateProfile(oldProfile.id, profile) (1)
            .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .subscribe(
                { newProfiles -&gt;
                    displayUpdatedProfile(oldProfile, newProfiles.first()) (2)
                },
                { throwable -&gt;
                    Log.e("HomeActivity", throwable.message ?: "onError")
                }
            )
    )
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Sends the newly created profile to the method that updates the profile on the API, along with the old profile’s id.


2
Don’t worry about this method, you’ll implement it in the next section.


 
 
 
 
<p>And that’s it! You’ve implemented all the logic and now it’s time to add a simple UI.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Set Up the Android UI 
 
 
<p>In order for you to display the list of profiles, the UI of the <code>HomeActivity</code> will be changed a bit. Please replace the contents of the <code>activity_home</code> file (found in <code>app/src/main/res/layout</code>) with the following code:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="match_parent"
  android:orientation="vertical"
  tools:context=".HomeActivity"&gt;

  &lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/userLabel"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="54dp"
    android:layout_weight="0"
    android:layout_marginTop="16dp"
    android:gravity="center"
    android:textSize="22sp"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText"
    tools:text="Hello, user!" /&gt;

  &lt;androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
    android:id="@+id/profilesRecyclerView" (1)
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="0dp"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    app:layoutManager="androidx.recyclerview.widget.LinearLayoutManager"
    tools:itemCount="4"
    tools:listitem="@layout/item_profile" /&gt;

  &lt;LinearLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:paddingBottom="16dp"
    android:paddingTop="16dp"
    android:orientation="horizontal"&gt;

    &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
      android:id="@+id/createProfileButton" (2)
      android:layout_width="0dp"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:layout_weight="1"
      android:layout_marginStart="32dp"
      android:layout_marginEnd="16dp"
      android:text="Create profile"
      tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;

    &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
      android:id="@+id/signOutButton" (3)
      android:layout_width="0dp"
      android:layout_height="wrap_content"
      android:layout_weight="1"
      android:layout_marginStart="16dp"
      android:layout_marginEnd="32dp"
      android:text="Log out"
      tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;

  &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
This is the recycler view, which will display the profiles.


2
This is the create profile button.


3
This is the sign-out button that ends the user’s session.


 
 
 
 
<p>Next, create a new layout file that represents a single profile in the list. Call it <code>item_profile.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
  xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
  android:layout_width="match_parent"
  android:layout_height="72dp"
  android:orientation="horizontal"
  tools:context=".HomeActivity"&gt;

  &lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/profileNameLabel"
    android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_weight="1"
    android:layout_marginStart="16dp"
    android:layout_gravity="center"
    android:textSize="18sp"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText"
    tools:text="Test username" /&gt;

  &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
    android:id="@+id/updateProfileButton" (1)
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginEnd="8dp"
    android:layout_gravity="center"
    android:text="Update"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;

  &lt;com.google.android.material.button.MaterialButton
    android:id="@+id/deleteProfileButton" (2)
    android:layout_width="wrap_content"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:layout_marginEnd="8dp"
    android:layout_gravity="center"
    android:text="Delete"
    tools:ignore="HardcodedText" /&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;</code> 
 
 
 


1
Button that updates the email of the profile.


2
Button that deletes the profile.


 
 
 
 
<p>Now you need to create an adapter that will display the list of profiles on the UI. Call it <code>ProfilesAdapter</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample

import android.view.LayoutInflater
import android.view.View
import android.view.ViewGroup
import android.widget.TextView
import androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
import dev.dbikic.oktaloginexample.model.Profile

class ProfilesAdapter(
    private val onDeleteClickListener: (Profile) -&gt; Unit,
    private val onUpdateClickListener: (Profile) -&gt; Unit
) : RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;ProfilesAdapter.ViewHolder&gt;() {

    val items = mutableListOf&lt;Profile&gt;()

    class ViewHolder(view: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(view) {
        val name: TextView = view.findViewById(R.id.profileNameLabel)
        val updateButton: TextView = view.findViewById(R.id.updateProfileButton)
        val deleteButton: TextView = view.findViewById(R.id.deleteProfileButton)
    }

    override fun onCreateViewHolder(viewGroup: ViewGroup, viewType: Int): ViewHolder {
        val view = LayoutInflater.from(viewGroup.context).inflate(R.layout.item_profile, viewGroup, false)
        return ViewHolder(view)
    }

    override fun onBindViewHolder(viewHolder: ViewHolder, position: Int) {
        with(viewHolder) {
            name.text = items[position].email
            deleteButton.setOnClickListener {
                onDeleteClickListener.invoke(items[position])
            }
            updateButton.setOnClickListener {
                onUpdateClickListener.invoke(items[position])
            }
        }
    }

    override fun getItemCount() = items.size
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now it’s time to connect everything together in the <code>HomeActivity</code>. Add the following code snippets:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>...
class HomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private var adapter = ProfilesAdapter(
        onDeleteClickListener = { profile -&gt; deleteProfile(profile) },
        onUpdateClickListener = { profile -&gt; updateProfile(profile) }
    )

    ...

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        ...
        binding.createProfileButton.setOnClickListener { createProfile() }
        binding.profilesRecyclerView.adapter = adapter
    }

    ...

    private fun displayProfiles(profiles: List&lt;Profile&gt;) {
        adapter.items.clear()
        adapter.items.addAll(profiles)
        adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()
    }

    private fun displayUpdatedProfile(oldProfile: Profile, newProfile: Profile) {
        val index = adapter.items.indexOfFirst { profileToReplace -&gt;
            profileToReplace.email == oldProfile.email
        }
        adapter.items[index] = newProfile
        adapter.notifyItemChanged(index)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>And that’s it! The result is a reactive Android app that connects to your local API. Now, run the app, click on the sign-in button, enter the credential of your user, and log in.</p>

 Learn More About RxJava and Android 
 
 
<p>RxJava is one of the most popular libraries on Android, and there is good reason for it. The concepts it introduces go way beyond Android development, but its application fits perfectly for it, and mobile development in general. If you look at it that way, all the work that a phone does is a data stream. From communication with network APIs and caching data in the local database, to handling user inputs and processing huge amounts of data, almost everything can be looked at as a data stream.</p>
 
 
<p>The tricky part is how to combine and manipulate those data streams, in a way that is clean, easy to maintain, and understand. RxJava gives us all that and more. It’s proven as a robust, scalable, and production-ready framework. It has its disadvantages, the most obvious being its steep learning curve and its size and complexity, which isn’t always needed for many apps. But once you grasp its concepts and set it up properly in your codebase, it will become a quite powerful tool for writing complex logic.</p>

 Transitioning from Sustainable Biotech to Web3 
<p>Mathieu: All right, Caspar. As a starting point, I would be interested to hear about your background and how you found your way into blockchain and Self-sovereign Identity. I know that not too long ago, in a past life, you did Ph.D. research in sustainable biotech innovation. I’d love to hear about that. I’m quite interested in the biotechnology space as a whole, and I’m interested to hear about you going through the process; what research you did, and what you published in that space. How did you transition out of the space, and how did you find your way into this Web 3 world?</p>
<p>Caspar: Thank you for having me, Mathieu. My background has indeed had a few turns. Before I founded <a href="https://www.gimly.io/">Gimly</a> two years ago, I was doing my Ph.D. research at the University of Groningen. I have a background in biomedical science. However, while I was doing my master’s, and afterwards, I pivoted away from the laboratory type of work, more towards the social sciences. I was asking questions such as, “What is knowledge? And, why do some artifacts of knowledge end up being successful and embraced by a wider majority, and others remain unembraced and never accepted — less successful?” I was interested in the understanding that this isn’t really about one type of knowledge being better than the others. Rather, it’s more about the context around it and the societal systems around it; the alignment of stakeholders around it.</p>
<p>How strong is your network of stakeholders when you’re thinking of something new? That all influences how our knowledge is shaped. From that perspective, I started focusing on a field called ‘Science and Technology Studies’. That’s all about the co-evolution of society and technology and politics, and how they all influence each other. That’s a topic that I usually find interesting, and also now in blockchain industry and innovation.</p>
<p>You’re right. At the time, the research was about biotechnology. The question was around the ways in which biotech innovation is shaped by the societal context and political context, specifically in African countries. That was a topic focusing on genetic modification of crops and how all kinds of political narratives and societal narratives around this technology are very much shaping its innovation.</p>
<p>Mathieu: That’s super interesting. We often see good examples of cross-disciplines or amalgamation, and it’s not only one thing that is the driver. There’s a very good COVID-topical piece about the fact that different aerosol scientists were trying to drive forward the thinking that this was a virus that was carried in the air. It outlines the troubles they had getting people to believe that and looks at how they had to involve historical data and research. So, when you start talking about societal context or involving the social sciences around a science like biotechnology, that is quite interesting. As you moved towards the chain and Self-sovereign Identity space, it’s quite true that you have all these different layers that play together. It’s not like, “Yeah, I’m doing technology now.”</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, absolutely. I do want to make it clear to the listeners and to put it out there for clarity; after four years of Ph.D. research, I didn’t finish the Ph.D. Part of the reason for that is that I felt it was becoming very difficult to continue pursuing my theoretical interest in these types of questions. I wanted to explore questions around why certain innovations are taking place and what the drivers might be behind that. More often than not, the drivers are not, per se, an objective view on what is best. Often, the drivers are economic and political, or sometimes, what is convenient or coincidental at the time. That became a bit more difficult. Meanwhile, in my free time, I had become very interested in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. I had started reading more and more and spending an increasing amount of time on the topic of discovering more on this blockchain technology, to identify why it is so interesting and potentially disruptive.</p>
<p>I also wanted to look into how decentralization, blockchain technology, and, of course, Self-sovereign Identity can be differentiated from many of these other technological revolutions that have been previously hailed as ‘THE’ next revolution, democratizing the world and resolving poverty. There are a lot of cross-pollinations in those interests, that’s for sure.</p>
<p>Mathieu: As we talk about societal context, there are clearly a lot of social movements where people generally are becoming more socially aware; people want to have more transparency, more insight and information into the items that they buy or purchase. They want to have more visibility and transparency in the different relationships that they have. They care more about social responsibility today.</p>
<p>So, you have all these trends that, on a societal level, align very well with the whole Web 3.0, or blockchain; call it whatever you want. What were some initial use cases once you got into Bitcoin? I think it’s a similar story, with most people getting into Bitcoin or Ethereum or some other project. I’m always curious; if someone starts a project outside of those two, what drew them to that?</p>
<p>When people get into the space, you start understanding how fundamentally different these decentralized properties are for storing assets and then being able to do other stuff with them. What were some of the initial use cases that interested you on the enterprise side?</p>
<p>Did you see that these were some things that you thought you could contribute to or help build?</p>
 Using NFC &amp; Blockchain: 
<p>Caspar: At the beginning of my journey, my interest went out towards the nexus of the physical and the digital worlds. That is, you have the immutability of the blockchain; but then, what happens at this interface of the digital blockchain when it starts touching on the physical world? What type of data do you get in there in the first place? How can people, or machines, or organizations interact with this blockchain technology? How do you connect those difficult-to-connect worlds?</p>
<p>As a result, I was looking a lot at solutions where, for example, IOT sensors are being connected to blockchains. Quite early after I started Gimly, I ran into Tangem. Tangem is a Swiss manufacturer of NFC (Near Field Communications) chips that have the capability to sign a blockchain transaction right in their NFC chip. At the time, they were mostly using it for what is still the most well-known use case; signing cryptocurrency transactions. In that way, you would basically have a crypto hardware wallet on your NFC card. You could sign a transaction by tapping that card, or you could give that card to someone else. When you do that, you hand over the cryptocurrencies that are on that wallet because you’re handing over the private key which is inside the chip.</p>
<p>Immediately, I said, “Well, that’s very interesting,” and indeed, I haven’t seen any other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a> chip that can do that. There are some similar chips that can be connected to blockchain, but, the signing and the private key management happen somewhere in the cloud or on the server. I thought it was interesting, but I also determined that it’s even more interesting for these supply chain use cases, to connect the physical goods shipments in a secure and immutable way to their digital twins within the blockchain network.</p>
<p>So, that was the first topic of interest: the supply chain and provenance and anti-counterfeit capabilities. Quite quickly, that led me to the topic of Self-sovereign Identity. I was thinking about identities for objects, and ways for people (humans, but also machines) to identify themselves in a blockchain system. I ended up being focused on Self-sovereign Identity as the core building block for pretty much everything related to the future of the internet.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think you and I had similar entry points into Self-sovereign Identity, by looking at these decentralized use cases, and seeing that certain properties were potentially missing the main property to do with verifiability. It’s great that I’m building a supply chain system, and I’m trying to increase the transparency in a supply chain; I’m trying to give more visibility to the end consumers, or even regulators, throughout the supply chain or whoever is a stakeholder there. It’s great that I have an immutable record, but it’s the same old concept: if it’s garbage data, then you’re going to get garbage data out of it. How do you control the data inputs coming in? Through that property of verifiability, so it’s the same thing.</p>
<p>Is the whole concept, then, that with these NFC chip cards, you could essentially transplant that concept into an IOT device to ensure that it’s the right IOT device that’s signing off on transactions? Is that the idea?</p>
<p>Caspar: That’s definitely one of the ideas that I’m exploring for more longer-term. Yes, exactly that — to have the same capabilities. That is, to have an embedded a private key in a secure element within the IOT device, and be able to verify the identity or the source of your IOT data through an <a href="https://northernblock.io/self-sovereign-identity-for-organizations/">SSI mechanism</a>. That’s the longer-term, broader vision when talking about the supply chain, for sure.</p>
<p>There are smaller steps in between. I don’t feel I need to do everything with the chips directly, but they do open up a lot of potential for Self-sovereign Identity in many more use cases. These may be in supply chain and enterprise, but there are also other use cases. For example, use cases where you don’t want to rely solely on the use of personal smartphones, either, because not everyone in this whole world has a smartphone. Sometimes, we tend to forget that when talking about Self-sovereign Identity, which has such an important philosophical background.</p>
<p>I find it important to realize that a lot of the things that we are developing and working on now, are very much focused on the use of personal smartphones. For the time being, that will be largely for a small proportion of this world. It’s possible that using these cards as a way to identify and verify yourself could contribute to that. I’m also very realistic that even for the time being, with the use of these smart cards, you will probably also want to have a smartphone, in order to be able to manage the credentials that you’re sharing, or not. I have one project running; we’re using these cards when there’s a single purpose. For example, they could work as a student ID card, and then they would also work for students who do not have a smartphone.</p>
<p>There are some complexities in there; I’m very well aware of that. However, I think it’s interesting and important to explore how we can expand the concept of Self-sovereign Identity more broadly than just for smartphones.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Good point. I think it does open up a lot of other use cases, if we talk about financial inclusivity use cases or, you mentioned, single-purpose use cases. Building access is a single-purpose use case; potentially, it’s a much more straightforward implementation than selling a mobile or some other type of wallet, to an enterprise that doesn’t want to have their data or their assets sitting outside of their four digital walls. It also opens up a space we see a lot more discussion about right now, which are the connection-less use cases. When you talk about <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallets-and-internationalizing-ssi-products/">mobile SSI wallets</a>, today, they basically do two things: they help you manage your credentials, and they help you manage your connections. However, there are certainly some use cases that are very valid and valuable, without having the need to have a connection.</p>
<p>Caspar: This is a very important use case for Gimly. We see this as a way to enable <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Self-sovereign Identity in enterprise settings</a>, where we don’t want your employees to run around with their personal mobile phone, signing off on potentially sensitive data, or every time that they need to identify themselves, such as when they pick up a shipment (to stick with the supply chain use case). When employees are using company-managed devices on the premises, then we propose to use these cards for the employees to log in and to sign with their personal card. The card is connected to their personal identity, or their employee identity; however, you want to structure this, of course. They can log in with that card into the application on the company-managed device, and then two hours later, a different employee can log into that same device, signing off with their own decentralized identifier, for example. That’s another very important direction that I see this going.</p>
<p>Mathieu: In any use case where you have a quadrant of high volume/low volume and high risk/low risk, it could make sense to adopt something like that into a high-volume and low-risk type of transaction. For example, getting into a building; it’s probably just like signing off on a shipment.</p>
<p>I find it quite interesting; the supply chain use cases can be difficult, because of the different fragmentation that inherently exists within any mature supply chain. Where there’s a lot of specialization across the supply chain, generally, there are tons of different organizations and people involved. That means there are tons of different systems involved. When you start going down into the ERP rabbit hole, you can get lost in the complexity, and you realize that, “Wow, that’s a crazy space.” Potentially, without suggesting that you’re going to connect all these ERP systems together to get transparency, you could simply use the signing with credentials to create some type of a chain of verifiable credentials, instead of having everything sitting on a blockchain. Was this the particular use case that you ran through?</p>
<p>Earlier, you were describing the Momentum 2020 event; that was all about physical world stuff, but due to COVID, it had to go digital. What did you do at this event, and was it this exact supply chain use case? </p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, it was. Indeed, that was Odyssey Momentum, which used to be one of the largest physical hackathons, at least in Europe. But, that was also very much about the physical experience of being in that old factory in England. Of course, then came COVID, so it was postponed a few times. Ultimately, they decided to give it an entirely new direction and make it a fully virtual event, and since then, it has become Momentum.</p>
<p>The idea behind that, is not to have it as a single moment in time where people do a one-time trick, and after that, it’s over. The idea is to really build ecosystems, and keep the momentum of innovation continuing. So, now it was fully virtual.</p>
<p>We participated in the KLM challenge for a compliant air cargo flow, and we proposed to use these Tangem cards as a physical identifier in Self-sovereign Identity. That’s pretty much in the way that I just described it, where you could use it for an employee to log in or to sign off on a certain shipment.</p>
<p>In fact, we won the challenge as one of two teams. The other team was CryptoMice, who developed or proposed a solution to track a shipment and to analyze if there are any potential red flags. For example, if in the electronic data, it was stated that Shipper A is going to pick it up, but now we see that Shipper B picked it up, so maybe we need to look into that in more detail. Very roughly speaking, that was their proposal. I hope I don’t make them angry by describing it in that way. Using our ‘signature’ from the employees could then feed into that analysis tool.</p>
<p>We did quite a lot of work on the use case, together with KLM and DHL. However, then came COVID, and still, it’s COVID, so things got a bit stalled and slowed down. It’s still on the shelf somewhere, I think, but I hope to pick that up again with them someday.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It’s a really good use case. Simply being able to use the cards to sign off on it, too: it’s back to the connections use case, potentially, for a chief compliance officer or someone to review afterwards. It doesn’t need to be done all on the spot. It’s not for every use case; you need to have the proof requests, and the verification, and that decision at that point right away. However, there are some use cases, where potentially I just want to log stuff for it to be audited later, but I want to have verifiability of who actually signed off on these things. I find that super cool.</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes. It is also an offline use case, or a semi-offline use case, where one party is offline, but the other party is online, and where you do the immediate verification. This would be like the example that you gave to enter a building, or when someone is coming to pick up a shipment at the Schiphol Terminal. Then, the driver doesn’t need to be fully connected, but, of course, the receiving party will manage that connection.</p>
 Europe’s SSI Ecosystem 
<p>Mathieu: Would you mind talking about the European ecosystem, overall? It’s of interest to me, being in Canada. There are many European listeners here, but we have a lot of listeners in North America as well, who are either in the public or private sector. I think, overall, what’s happening in the EU right now is extremely exciting, with the momentum and the investment and the traction we’re starting to see. Would you mind talking about how you fit into the European SSI ecosystem, and what are some of the organizations or ecosystems that you’re part of, or that you really see momentum behind?</p>
<p>Caspar: Sure. Your community here in Canada is an inspiring example in terms of Self-sovereign Identity, but you are right; in Europe, there’s also a lot of momentum and <a href="https://northernblock.io/removing-roadblocks-to-ssi-adoption/">traction for Self-sovereign Identity</a>. There’s a lot of public interest, and also governmental interests, specifically in terms of funding. I shouldn’t even try to explain the funding ecosystem in Europe, but there are a lot of funding programs; most of them are bundled under the grand Horizon 2020 initiative, as it has been called up to now. The new program is going to be called Horizon Europe, I believe.</p>
<p>If you look into several of the more recent goals in a lot of the programs, Self-sovereign Identity and the principles behind Self-sovereign Identity are really a core concept in those goals. Not all of them will mention it as explicitly as some others; one of the most explicit ones is <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">eSSIF-Lab</a>, the European Self-sovereign Identity Framework program. I am participating there now, in the second infrastructure call — that’s one big one. There are a few more; there was also the NGI (Next Generation Identity) ONTOCHAIN project, where we made a Self-sovereign Identity proposal, because it was also about trust and verifiability and data exchange. There are a lot of programs like that, that are really <a href="https://northernblock.io/">focusing on Self-sovereign Identity</a>. Let’s see, what else is there?</p>
<p>I think it might be interesting to share this also: we started two years ago, and from the start, my focus has been very much on collaboration; building partnerships, and working with other companies that have certain expertise. One of those companies has been Sphereon. Sphereon is a Dutch company that has been in the space a bit longer than I have. They’ve had a lot of <a href="https://northernblock.io/about/">experience in Self-sovereign Identity</a>, and in infrastructure building and components building, and we collaborated quite a bit. We also participated together in the first eSSIF-Lab call, which was mostly focused on business solutions. There was a project with Off-Blocks, where Sphereon is the technology provider.</p>
<p>Since then, things have moved quite nicely, to be able to develop new things and to make new proposals in these NGI (Next Generation Identity) programs. In fact, there’s an NGI Atlantic program coming up, which is aiming to foster cross-Atlantic collaboration. This could be something that you and I might want to explore. Do you have specific questions about the European ecosystem on SSI?</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think the one that I personally see a lot of material come out of is the eSSIF-Lab ecosystem. Is the eSSIF-Lab defining what a governance framework or looks like in its funding projects? What is the role of eSSIF-Lab? Is it effectively an incubator type of organization?</p>
<p>Caspar:  Well, it’s both. eSSIF-Lab has two tracks: one is focused on the infrastructure, and the other one is focused on business applications. The second one is really more of an incubator-type where project proposals are made. It’s also a contest. You start with something like 17 teams participating, I think, and then in two or three different steps, more and more teams get eliminated. The idea, there, is to also help the teams in their business development, in sharpening their business plan, and on product-to-market fit.</p>
<p>The other track is the infrastructure track; that’s where Gimly is participating now. We’re building an open-source SSI / NFC bridge, which of course relies on the NFC chips that we talked about before. We aim to make it possible to implement these NFC cards easily into any Self-sovereign Identity solution or platform. That’s very much a track that is focused on open source, and it’s also focused on defining the European Self-sovereign Identity framework. So, it’s a bit more about different types of wallets, and more and more on the infrastructure side rather than on the application side.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Got it. It’s great that there’s a business side as well, looking at business focus and product/market fit. One of the bigger challenges with any new or revolutionary type of technology is finding fit, and that’s not simply trying to ‘push tech.’</p>
<p>Now, I’d like to switch a little bit; I think it’s still loosely on the topic of trust and verifiability. We’ve been talking a lot about NFC, and let’s just switch the acronym slightly. Rather than talking about NFC, let’s jump over to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) — which is a totally different space. However, I think that a lot of the stuff that you’ve been talking about is applicable here. You wrote a piece on something happening in the NFT space recently. Do you mind talking about what the problem statement is behind what you had written in your piece?</p>
 Verifiable Credentials Use Cases for NFTs 
<p>Caspar: Yes, definitely. I think <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFTs</a> are very exciting; if not for the technology itself, then definitely for the movement that it’s bringing about, and the new opportunities and new ways of approaching art and artists, for example. I find that very interesting.</p>
<p>At the same time, with NFTs, there are some issues that I believe remain to be resolved. <a href="https://www.gimly.io/blog/nfts-the-need-for-self-sovereign-identity">The article that I wrote</a> was a blog post that I wrote together with Jack Tanner, our Tech Lead at Gimly. It takes an example where someone took a screenshot from an artist’s work, from Petek, who is a bitcoin artist. She makes beautiful artworks representing the stock-to-flow model from Plan B, and she uses all kinds of very rare materials. She uses the stock-to-flow data points in the artwork, and creates limited editions. People have been asking her,” Hey, when are you going to make an NFT?”</p>
<p>However, we were talking about, “Okay, but NFTs, what does it really mean? What is so special about NFT, and what does it convey actual ownership of to you? What do you prove ownership of? Basically, you’re proving ownership over that NFT, and you can prove that there’s only one of those NFTs. However, it’s a lot more difficult to prove that there’s only one of those objects, be it digital or physical, that the NFT is referring to. This becomes even more difficult when you’re talking about physical objects, of course. Obviously, I would have a solution there, of using these NFC chips and implementing those into physical objects. But, that still doesn’t resolve one key issue; when you create the NFT, it’s very difficult to also verify that the creator of that NFT is actually legitimate. Is that person who created the NFT legitimately authorized to convey ownership over the object that it’s conveying ownership over? In this use case, we saw that someone had simply taken a screenshot of her artwork, put an NFT on it, and tried to sell it on Wareable.com. They didn’t succeed, because some fans of Petek contacted her and asked her, “Hey, did you really make an NFT?” and she said, “No, I didn’t.” It turned out to be a scammer, and then the screenshot with NFT was taken off of Wareable.</p>
<p>What this illustrates, is that NFTs lack some type of identity layer, where you can verify the creator of the NFT, and the legitimacy of the NFT. Now, of course, some people will say that you can look up the public key of the first owner, and then you will see that he or she created multiple NFTs. Yes, that may be true, but there’s no way for an average consumer to instantly see the authenticity and the legitimacy of this NFT. I think that’s a very important aspect. It doesn’t mean an absolute no-go, but there is this idea around NFTs that because of the NFT technology, it is impossible to defraud, so to speak. In the current hype, I think that opens up a lot of possibilities for all kinds of scams. I would be interested in solving that by ensuring a connection to a verifiable identity of the creator, and the buyer, or the seller. I think that would be very interesting to explore.</p>
<p>Mathieu: It only increases the value of these things, if you have verifiability behind the creator of it. There are the ones that make the news, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8p1B8NHLFQ">Christie’s auctioning the Beeple compilation of digital artwork for 69 million dollars</a>. Just last week, there was another one that went for some tens of millions; I think that they were just avatars. But, they’re going through Christie’s.</p>
<p>Christie’s is an established auction dealer of art; so that is interesting, where there’s more that goes into it than just the technology. People trust Christie’s. Christie’s has been doing this for however long, and they’re reputable. If Christie’s is saying, “Hey, we’re selling this piece of art,” there’s a level of trust that this is a legitimate piece of art — this is a one-of-one, or whatever the different properties are. I think, then, when you start getting to more direct sales (which is the whole promise of a blockchain) is that you could go directly to creator-to-consumer. I don’t need to go through a broker or an intermediary. Maybe someone like Christie’s performed a valuable service, and made sure that they got the right marketing, and the price of that thing went up, I’m sure. But, for more community-driven initiatives, or grassroots initiatives, where people are trying to sell ownership or a stake into digitally-native assets, whether it’s a piece of art or whether it’s a piece of music or whatever it is, that’s where I think you’ve said it correctly: for the average consumer, it’s so easy to fall victim to phishing, or account takeovers, or to stuff like that.</p>
<p>Caspar: I also find that the Christie’s example, and there’s also SuperRare: these platforms that do the due diligence, they will make sure that the one that’s creating the NFT, that’s creating the artwork, is also the legitimate creator. So, in those cases, it’s a bit less important.</p>
<p>I have a good friend of mine; Hessel Stuut. He’s a digital artist, and he made a really cool digital video that went viral, where you see Amsterdam as if Amsterdam is surrounded by mountains, which it is not. We live in the Netherlands, and it’s completely flat. Hessel was on a podcast just one week ago, with John Crane from SuperRare, and one of the things that Hessel and I were also discussing, was about this verification of identity. In the case of a SuperRare web platform, it is a bit less of an issue. However, at the same time, the whole idea behind NFTs for artwork is to enable any artist to become successful, in a decentralized world. That’s one of the arguments of why NFTs are good for art. But then again, if you end up needing to be part of these curated platforms like Christie’s or SuperRare, then that defeats the purpose of “anyone can get funded.” I think that’s two different directions, you could say. I fully see the value of a platform like SuperRare, and at the same time, it’s also slightly contrarian to what NFTs are about.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think the Christie’s example is an interesting one because, on one side, you’re using a blockchain as an immutable store for the asset itself. Being a piece of digital art, you could be using smart contracts around that token, around that smart contract itself, too. So, you’re using a blockchain to store an asset, as well as potentially for some other computation. The trust, in this case, is in the physical world because I’m trusting that Christie’s has done the proper due diligence, as you described. Everything is legal, and I trust that. When I don’t have that physical trust, and I’m looking to create digital trust, that’s where I see Self-sovereign Identity being quite interesting. Although, some could argue that if you have compliance or due diligence, these other things take away from the self-sovereignty of a blockchain overall. However, you’re able to create digital trust by simply having the right credentials there, at least to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Caspar: Don’t get me wrong, I’m not anti-NFTs. I think it’s a very interesting technology. I think in many use cases, where they are used for verification or authentication of something, you’ll be better off using verifiable credentials in the SSI system than NFTs. However, in some other use cases, like in art, I think it’s a very legitimate and interesting development.</p>
<p>One of my oldest partners is Europechain: it’s an EOSIO-powered blockchain that aims to be the first, or maybe the only, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant blockchain. They’re also working on several NFT projects, where they very much focus on getting all these legal questions around it in order. For example, what happens if the creator decides to make another NFT of exactly the same piece of art? NFTs are not going to prevent an artist from creating two NFTs, where he says he was planning to make one. Of course, there are social systems that will prevent that, because the artist would be throwing rocks in his own windows — that’s probably a different expression in English. There’s a social system around it, that prevents artists from scamming in that way, so to speak, but there are still legal questions, such as,” What does it mean that I own something, that you own something, that you get ownership over a piece of art or a piece of music? Are you allowed to display it? And, if so, in which ways?” These are all interesting things that you need to consider as an artist, if you’re thinking to NFT your work. Yes, there’s some work to be done there.</p>
<p>Mathieu: You could add more and more layers; for example, using verifiable credentials and using different mechanisms, for even more digital trust for some of the problems we’re discussing here regarding NFCs. I think we agreed that using an NFC as an identifier may be a whole other question. Acronyms are kind of mixing now; it’s tough to follow all these acronyms. However, you could digitize more and more, where I’m really trying to create as much digital trust as possible, but you still always have to have that element of human trust.</p>
<p>I think this is something you’ve said yourself, too, that NFTs don’t solve legal requirements. You still need to have a human system, or another system above this digitally native, automated system, to manage the governance, and the legal rules, and all this stuff above it.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about Self-sovereign Identity, or <a href="https://northernblock.io/verifiable-credentials-for-fintech/">verifiable credentials in the decentralized finance space</a>? Is that something that you thought about, and would you know just a simple use case? I see there could be value there. In that DeFi space, we’re able to conduct all sorts of different financial transactions, without relying on a bank to do so. It’s peer-to-peer, but if I want to lend to someone, or I’m lending crypto to someone, I want to make sure they have a certain reputation or a certain credit score, for example. It seems like that could be done in a Self-sovereign way as well. Have you thought about that whole space?</p>
 Using SSI for DeFi 
<p>Caspar: Yes, absolutely. I think that’s again why I referred to Self-sovereign Identity as a pivotal building block, for anything related to the future of the internet and Web3, actually. Exactly as you’ve said; there is also a need for identity in DeFi, and of course, there are different levels of identity. SSI doesn’t mean that you need to disclose your passport number with every DeFi transaction. Rather, it’s a way of reputation management, and I see a lot of potential in there as well. Nothing too concrete, at the moment, to talk about in terms of ongoing projects, but I absolutely agree with you; that’s an important building block in DeFi as well. I’ll be curious to see what happens; you’ve probably seen the launch of Bullish Global, the new exchange from Block.one, the company behind the technology?</p>
<p>Mathieu: I haven’t seen that; what is that about?</p>
<p>Caspar: Well, I should have read more about it before stating this, actually. They’re calling it the pro-finance, regulated DeFi, let’s say. It’s a new type of exchange. They just raised a good sum of money to bring this to market — around 10 billion was put into this. I’ll be curious to see how they will be handling this identification part; if their aim is to enable decentralized finance, but ensure compliance with all kinds of global regulations, there must be some SSI component in there, as well.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think that’s a huge market for SSI. Especially if you look at the top exchanges out there today; just naming a couple, such as Binance or Coinbase, for example. They’re all central companies that are managing this, and managing the compliance and onboarding of users to allow them to get into the crypto world. But, it doesn’t protect the sovereignty of an individual; where you’re going into a site, and you’re giving them your driver’s license, or your passport, or whatever information, and they are reporting that, too. We could argue about what you should or should not be reporting; that’s a whole different topic.</p>
<p>It doesn’t ensure sovereignty, so that is quite interesting. If you could come into a crypto exchange, you could prove something through a credential. Maybe you might be partially disclaiming something, but that checks the box for their compliance. I would be quite interested to keep exploring that.</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, absolutely. I think many of us have copies of their passports with dozens of more or less reputable exchanges. Especially if you’ve been in the space for more than two years, like before the bear market, you probably have your passports at quite a few exchanges that actually no longer exist, so who knows what happens there. But, yes, I agree with you. It’s something to keep an eye on, where a lot of benefits might be possible for multiple parties.</p>
<p>Mathieu: I think the users of these systems get it, anyways. It feels like an easier sale, sometimes. For someone that’s already sold on crypto for different reasons, being sold on decentralized identity should be very easy to understand and digest. So, when you talk about gaining more adoption of Self-sovereign Identity, that is an interesting crowd. You can really see people buying into that a lot quicker, just because they understand it right away; they already think about this stuff.</p>
<p>Caspar: That’s true, yes.</p>
<p>Mathieu: Caspar, thank you very much for doing this with me today. I very much enjoyed this conversation, and I look forward to doing this again.</p>
<p>Caspar: Yes, thank you, and I look forward to it.</p>

 Case study: Gravity’s work with refugees in Turkey featured in latest report from Oxford Centre for Technology and Development, “Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector” <p>This month, Gravity’s digital ID solution to support refugees in Turkey increase their employment opportunities through digital education profiles is featured in the new report <a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">“Digital Identity: An Analysis for the Humanitarian Sector”</a> written by the <a href="http://www.octd.co.uk/">Oxford Centre for Technology and Development</a>, commissioned by the <a href="http://IFRC.org%20-%20IFRChttps://www.ifrc.org%20›%20...">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)</a>, and supported by the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">DIGID </a>consortium (Norwegian Red Cross, Norwegian Refugee Council, Norwegian Church Aid, Save the Children&nbsp;Norway).</p><p>The report includes a case study on Gravity’s work to help refugees in Gaziantep, Turkey struggling to find employment because they do no have adequate proof of their educational experiences. As part of a pilot with the <a href="https://www.sdgia.org/">Sustainable Development Goals impact accelerator (SDGia)</a> established by the <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.tr/">Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a href="https://www.undp.org/">United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</a>, Syrian refugees created verifiable education profiles using Gravity’s digital ID platform that they could then share with potential employers to increase their employment prospects.</p><p>With Gravity, refugees can easily compile all of their education credentials from different livelihood training programmes all in one place and digitally share this information with potential employers to increase their employment and livelihood prospects.</p><p>According to the report written by Aiden Slavin, Franziska Putz and Dr. Emre Eren&nbsp;Korkmaz:</p><p>“Gravity’s work is selected as a case study here because their solution included close collaboration with four other organizations from the start. It thus offered a rife example of interoperability challenges associated with digital ID systems, as well as how the same systems may be used to overcome existing coordination challenges. Moreover, Gravity has made more documentation of this project publicly available.”</p><p>Collaboration is key to real impact and innovation, which is why Gravity builds human-centered digital ID solutions that improve interoperability between organizations. Gravity collaborated with <a href="https://sertifier.com/">Sertifier</a>, <a href="https://www.marklabs.co/">Mark Labs</a>, the <a href="https://www.gso.org.tr/">Gaziantep Chamber of Industry (GSO)</a> and the Gaziantep Chamber of Artisans and Craftsmen (GESOB) to make this work with Syrian refugees in Turkey possible.</p><p>Key takeaways from the report’s analysis of the Gravity case study in&nbsp;Turkey:</p><p>“Gravity’s experience in Gaziantep demonstrates the value of public-private partnerships as well as how substantial interoperability can be achieved without sacrificing data privacy or individuals’ control over their own data. The example also demonstrates a valuable use-case of how digital ID systems can help migrants throughout their&nbsp;journey.</p><p>“Digital ID systems are commonly piloted to support crisis response or more immediate humanitarian assistance, including initial registration for aid as well as short-term assistance, whether in the form of food or cash transfers. Gravity’s work facilitates a vital next step: helping refugees acquire and prove their education and training credentials so they can advance their level of socioeconomic inclusion. Crucially, the Gravity solution was able to help all stakeholders: beneficiaries, aid and training organizations and employers.</p><p>Through a series of expert interviews and case studies, the report shows that digital ID has great potential for use in the humanitarian sector, with benefits to organizations and affected communities alike, while also outlining its limitations and the challenges to overcome.</p><p>It is hoped that this report will be useful to anyone in the humanitarian sector looking to invest in or develop digital identity solutions like Gravity for their organization.</p><p>For the full report and additional readings, please visit the <a href="https://preparecenter.org/resource/digital-identity-an-analysis-for-the-humanitarian-sector/">Prepare Center website</a> hosted by the Global Preparedness Center and the American Red Cross and the <a href="https://hiplatform.org/blog/2021/5/19/digital-ids-in-the-humanitarian-sector-whats-the-big-deal">DIGID&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>Interested in learning how Gravity can help your organization optimize its impact and service delivery? <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/contact-us">Contact our&nbsp;team.</a></p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/gravity-earth">LinkedIn</a> for recent updates. <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/subscription">Sign up for our Gravity newsletter</a> for the latest Gravity&nbsp;news!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/case-study-gravitys-work-with-refugees-in-turkey-featured-in-latest-oxford-centre-for-technology-ecb515a18464">Case study: Gravity’s work with refugees in Turkey featured in latest report from Oxford Centre for…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">Gravity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Why Bitcoin&nbsp;matters Image: Bermix&nbsp;Studio<p>A rough week if prices are concerned, but if the scene’s historical price action is any indication, a major correction was probably overdue with all of the intense early market hype concentrated at the beginning of this&nbsp;year.</p><p>My colleague /jvs asked me the other week what my thoughts were on speculation and whether or not it’s good or bad for the industry. Speculation is sort of a bad word — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/china-vows-zero-tolerance-for-commodities-market-violations">especially in China</a>. It’s also one of crypto’s killer features. In creating the opportunity to create digitally native value that isn’t reliant on any central authority, the industry has been able to attract an eye-watering amount of&nbsp;capital.</p><p>The type of people and organizations who would get into this space super early are a unique bunch. Many of those people and organizations have amassed a huge amount of capital — much of which is being recycled back into the system in order to fund and execute on their vision of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It’s the PayPal Mafia — except blockchain this time&nbsp;around.</p><p>After all, where else are you going to find someone to buy a jpeg for $69&nbsp;million.</p><p>For this new generation of decentralized, digital-native citizens, that’s exactly what they’re looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>We’re still at the early innings of this thing. What will these people want tomorrow? How would they expect their platforms and services to operate? What sort of control and ownership would they demand over their digital&nbsp;lives?</p><p>[Insert something about GlobaliD and digital identity.]</p><p>In that sense, this is a growing cultural movement with a very specific set of values as it is a technological or financial one.</p><p>That’s what the early internet was like,&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>When Netscape went public in 1995, about 14% of Americans had internet&nbsp;access.</p><p>When Coinbase went public in 2021, about 14% of Americans owned a cryptocurrency.</p> 2. Goldman sachs: Bitcoin is a new asset&nbsp;class <p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-is-officially-a-new-asset-class-goldman-sachs-103540636.html">Yahoo</a>:</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin is now considered an investable asset. It has its own idiosyncratic risk, partly because it’s still relatively new and going through an adoption phase,” said Mathew McDermott, Goldman Sachs’ global head of digital assets, in a new piece of research. “And it doesn’t behave as one would intuitively expect relative to other assets given the analogy to digital gold; to date, it’s tended to be more aligned with risk-on assets. But clients and beyond are largely treating it as a new asset class, which is notable — it’s not often that we get to witness the emergence of a new asset&nbsp;class.”</blockquote> 3.

This is done by creating an MLP, whereby users can participate directly through Single-Sided Liquidity Provisioning (SSLP) or through Standard Liquidity Mining. The MLP will cement Ocean’s and AllianceBlock’s already strong partnership while simultaneously providing our communities with a unique opportunity to reap the rewards of our partnership.</p><p>For the creation of our MLP, we have locked together USD 100,000 worth each of our native tokens (OCEAN and ALBT) through POP!’s smart contracts, <a href="https://poptownplatform.medium.com/certiks-audit-results-on-pop-5ee857c852c2">which have been audited by CertiK</a>. In other words, we have created an OCEAN/ALBT Liquidity Pool worth USD 200,000 at the time of writing on Uniswap (V2), which will be reflected on POP!’s platform for user participation. The MLP is running for 85 days from May 25th, 2021 at approx. 13:00 (11:00 UTC) CEST till August 18th, 2021 at approx. 13:00 CEST (11:00&nbsp;UTC).</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p><a href="https://new.pop.town/">The MLP is live and active on the POP! Platform</a>, so OCEAN and ALBT holders can already provide their tokens as single-sided liquidity onto the MLP marketplace.

<p>On May 20th, 2021 <a href="https://eucoc.cloud/en/detail/news/the-eu-cloud-code-of-conduct-becomes-first-gdpr-code-of-conduct-to-receive-green-light-from-data-pro/" title=" it was announced">it was announced</a> that the <a href="https://eucoc.cloud/en/contact/request-the-eu-cloud-code-of-conduct.html" title=" EU Cloud Code of Conduct">EU Cloud Code of Conduct</a> had received official approval by the Belgian Data Protection Authority, following the positive opinion issued by the European Data Protection Board.&nbsp; At the same time, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) comprised of all the European Data Protection Authorities (DPA) <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2021/edpb-adopts-opinions-first-transnational-codes-conduct-statement-data-governance-act_en" title="provided a favourable opinion">provided a favourable opinion</a> that the <a href="https://cispe.cloud/code-of-conduct/" title="CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct">CISPE Data Protection Code of Conduct</a> complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>This has been a long journey – in 2017 we published a <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70276/cloud-provider-codes-of-conduct-and-gdpr/" title="Leadership Brief Cloud Provider Codes of Conduct and GDPR">Leadership Brief Cloud Provider Codes of Conduct and GDPR</a>.&nbsp; This compared how the 2 codes of conduct at that time would match the obligations from GDPR which had yet to come into force.&nbsp; Four years on, what is the significance of this announcement to organizations using cloud services?</p>
<p>When using a cloud service, the tenant does not have control over how the service is designed, secured, and run.&nbsp; Therefore, the tenant needs to trust that the cloud service meets their security needs and compliance obligations.&nbsp; These Cloud Codes of Conduct provide transparent frameworks that define the technical and organisational measures that a cloud service must implement to ensure that its processing of tenants’ data will meet the requirements of GDPR.</p>
 
 Good News but with a Caveat 
 
<p>The good news is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The EDPB is of the opinion that both draft codes comply with the GDPR and fulfil the requirements set forth in Art. 40 and 41 GDPR. According to the GDPR, adherence to approved codes of conduct may be used as an element to demonstrate legal compliance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is still more work to do. The key caveat in the EDPB announcement is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They [the codes of conduct] are not to be used in the context of international transfers of personal data”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When looking at the two codes there are many similarities but some differences. The CISPE Code only covers Infrastructure as a Service while the EU Code of Conduct is more general. To some extent this explains the difference between the CSPs that support the different codes. Unsurprisingly, the CSPs supporting EU Code of Conduct include those providing several different kinds of service (SaaS and PaaS as well as IaaS) which are all covered by this code.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the existence of 2 codes increases the burden on the end user organizations.</p>
<p>The major remaining challenge for organizations using cloud services to hold and process the personal data of EU residents in compliance with GDPR when this involves international transfer of data to Third Countries.&nbsp; This challenge stems from the so called Schrems II judgment and the subsequent EBPB <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="recommendations 01/2020">recommendations 01/2020</a> relating to this.</p>
 
<p></p>
 Independent Verification 
 
<p>Much has been written on the subject of Zero Trust in the context of cyber security.&nbsp; &nbsp;Zero Trust is often defined to mean never trust always verify.</p>
<p>When highly regulated industries use cloud services and for certain kinds of data processed in them it essential for the tenant to be able verify the existence and effectiveness of service controls to demonstrate compliance.&nbsp; However, it is not practical for large CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) to allow tenants to individually audit the services they use, and so tenants must rely on independent third-party attestations that the services comply with standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The Cloud Codes of Conducts described above provide frameworks that have been validated by the EDPB and accepted by EU Data Protection Authorities.&nbsp; This is an important step towards what is needed but validation of the framework is not the same as verification of service compliance.</p>
<p>Currently the CSPs that are members of the framework bodies agree to provide self-certification of compliance.&nbsp; What is needed is independent verification.&nbsp; Setting up the processes for independent verification of compliance with the Codes of Conduct will be the next key step along the journey.</p>
 
 GDPR and Zero Trust Data Processing 
 
<p>The EDPB has not approved the Codes of Conduct in the context of international transfers of personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these circumstances what is needed is Zero Trust Data Processing – Never Trust the Cloud Service where this involves international data transfers.</p>
<p>During processing of the data there are three points at which the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the personal data can be compromised by public authorities in Third Countries:</p>
 
 During its transfer across networks, it may be accessed by third parties including governments. This access may be passive where the contents of the communication are simply copied. However, public authorities may also interpose themselves into the communication process and not only read the content, but also manipulate or suppress parts of it. 
 During its storage, by either accessing the processing facilities themselves, or by requiring the recipient of the data to locate, and extract data of interest and turn it over. 
 During processing, the data could be accessed while it is being used or analysed. For example, when a service is being provided remotely. 
 
<p>Cloud services currently provide controls for the first two of these areas of risk through strong encryption where the tenant has full control over the keys.&nbsp; However, protection during processing depends upon what is being termed as “Confidential Computing”.&nbsp; Confidential Computing is an essential element of Zero Trust Data processing and there are several basic approaches to Confidential Computing:</p>
 
 Trusted environments – such as Intel SGX enclaves and AMD EPYC 3rd&nbsp;Generation CPUs where the data is only decrypted in a protected environment. 
 Pseudonymization&nbsp;–&nbsp;as opposed to&nbsp;anonymization - providing that the&nbsp;addition data needed to reconstitute the relevant (usually personal) data is adequately&nbsp;protected.&nbsp;But not the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/data-pseudonymisation-advanced-techniques-and-use-cases/" title="ENISA recommendations for data pseudonymization advanced techniques and use-cases">ENISA recommendations for data pseudonymization advanced techniques and use-cases</a>. 
 Homomorphic encryption – where the encrypted data can be processed without decryption but with additional computing overheads and usually the need to change the application.
 
 Multi party&nbsp;computing&nbsp;–&nbsp;protocols&nbsp;that split the data into parts that can be processed&nbsp;independently&nbsp;without any of the processors being able to&nbsp;reconstitute any personal data.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>To overcome the concerns processing personal data in third countries under GDPR, as well as those of regulated industries, CSPs will need to provide industrialised and easy to use approaches based on one or more of the above approaches.</p>
 
 Opinion 
 
<p>It is good news that both of these cloud codes of conduct have received approval from European Data Protection Authorities.&nbsp; However, the boards behind these codes of conduct cannot afford to rest on their laurels - they must now work to define and set up independent verification processes to enable cloud tenants to have greater confidence than that provided by self-certification.&nbsp; It is also essential that cloud services provide greater levels of controls – especially for confidential computing - for tenants to implement Zero Trust Data Processing.</p>

<p>Sidetree protocol is an open blockchain-agnostic protocol <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-sidetree-scalable-dpki-for-decentralized-identity-1a9105dfbb58">developed by DIF</a> and supported by Microsoft. The core idea of this protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger&nbsp;system.</p><p>This protocol is designed to overcome many technical problems in existing implementations that include high throughput and cost, presence of centralized authorities, lack of scalability, and more. The Sidetree protocol bridges the need for a decentralized and open protocol as it batches together JSON (a standard for representing structured data) operations to lower the associated costs, improve throughput, enhance scalability, and at the same, allow these operations to be anchored to any decentralized identity&nbsp;network.</p><p>It also helps to create unique identifiers that are controlled and managed by users with their public key infrastructure. Further, it conforms to the W3C specifications, so developers can use the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifier (DID)&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>So, now that you have an idea of what is sidetree protocol, let’s delve into its architecture.</p> Sidetree Protocol Architecture <p>Sidetree protocols are layer 2 protocols that anchor to the underlying decentralized ledger system. That said, it is ledger agnostic and its primary role is to anchor batches of signed JSON operations to the&nbsp;network.</p><p>What this essentially means is that using this protocol, you can create tree nodes that sit side by side on the network and perform CRUD (Create, Recover, Update, and Deactivate) operations according to the W3C specifications. These nodes interact with a Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) like IPFS to create, recover, update, and deactivate a DID document stored in&nbsp;it.</p><p>In this sense, the sidetree protocol is wedged between the CAS at the top and the underlying decentralized network at the&nbsp;bottom.</p> Working of a Sidetree&nbsp;Protocol <p>Moving on, let’s understand how this protocol&nbsp;works.</p><p>A transaction can be any of the CRUD operations that are implemented in JSON and signed by the holder/issuer’s public key. Each of these transactions is batched together and stored in a batch&nbsp;file.</p><p>The number of transactions that can be stored in the batch file is limited by the file size. So, developers can determine the size of the batch file depending on the average rate of transactions in the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Next, this batch file is connected to an anchor file that has a Merkle root. Here, a Merkle root is something that’s commonly used in cryptography to ensure that data blocks that are transmitted between peers are unaltered. In this implementation, the Merkle root also verifies that a particular transaction was included in a batch file. These anchor files, in turn, are attached to the anchoring networks.</p><p>As you may have guessed, the anchor file is the only thing that’s associated with the network and the rest of the implementation are ledger-agnostic. So, depending on the ledger you choose, the anchor file will&nbsp;vary.</p><p>An important aspect to note is that the JSON operation is signed by the entity’s public/wallet key while the signed ledger transaction is signed by the sidetree node that’s performing the anchoring operation.</p><p>So, this is how a sidetree protocol&nbsp;works.</p><p>Now comes an important question — how do you access the contents of your DID document?</p><p>Simply reverse the&nbsp;process!</p><p>Start with the ledger and get the hash for the anchor file. From here, get the hash for the batch file, and in it, you can find all the operations related to your DID as they get grouped and are replayed in the order in which they were recorded. From this, you can navigate to your DID document.</p><p>If you look at this reverse anchoring process, the indexing on the anchor file is the key aspect as it helps to weed out corrupted or bad batch files. In fact, the overall process and workflow greatly reduce the chances of&nbsp;errors.</p><p>Next, we’ll explain a bit about how this is implemented in Affinidi.</p> Affinidi’s Implementation of the Sidetree&nbsp;Protocol <p>At Affinidi, we implement sidetree protocol using SidetreeJS, the JavaScript implementation of the Sidetree protocol v0.1.0. Though we did consider using element-api methods, they were deprecated, so we decided to go ahead with SidetreeJS. Also, the fact that it is easier to implement, added to our list of reasons for going with SidetreeJS.</p><p>Our infrastructure consists of SidetreeJS integrated into the DID registry with IPFS as the content addressable storage. On top of it, sits the MongoDB as the long term cache while the Ethereum Ledger via ChainStack is the ledger&nbsp;address.</p><p>To learn more about Affinidi APIs, check out our <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/developers">Developer resources</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">Decoding the Sidetree Protocol</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			 What Are Stock Tokens? 
<p>As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, Binance has been aggressively pursuing and exploring a wide range of services for its users. Its latest initiative is to allow users to trade ‘stock tokens’ that represent shares of publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>The transactions are settled in stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD). Since 12 April, Binance has released stock tokens for Tesla, Coinbase, MicroStrategy, Apple and Microsoft. This is a milestone in the tokenization field as it opens up the security tokens to the masses. In fact, Binance is not the first company to do this, as FTX and Bittrex, two other cryptocurrency exchanges, started tokenized stocks trading back in late 2020.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that all of these tokenized stocks are mirrors of securities, meaning that the tokens are not shares and only give exposure to the underlying shares. In other words, investors don’t have direct ownership of the shares, and the tokens are not transferable between investors. The digital asset marketplace (Binance, etc.) is the issuer, controlling the tokens for its token holders. It is a delegated system.</p>
 So Why Does It Concern Regulators? 
<p>Binance has also declared that holders of their stock tokens will qualify for economic returns on the underlying securities, including potential dividends, making the tokens securities. As those familiar with legislation on security tokens, tokenization doesn’t change the fact that they have to comply with securities regulation, especially when they are distributed to the public. Digital securities must be issued as permissioned tokens to comply with international regulations.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			<p>Permissioned tokens apply compliance checks during transfers to make sure that only eligible investors can hold the security tokens. And Binance’s stock tokens don’t appear to have been issued as permissioned tokens. They control the stock tokens for their users. No surprise that it didn’t take long for BaFin, Germany’s financial regulator, to knock on Binance’s door. On 28 April, BaFin has published <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Verbrauchermitteilung/weitere/2021/meldung_210428_binance_deutschland.html">a note</a> on its website warning Binance that they are selling shares in Germany in the form of stock tokens without offering the necessary prospectuses. This could result in a 5-million-euro fine or a forfeit of 3% of Binance’s 2020 turnover.</p>

		 
	 
          BaFin has grounds to suspect that Binance Germany is selling shares in Germany in the form of 'share tokens' without offering the necessary prospectuses.  BaFinGermany’s financial regulator         
	 
		 
			 Security Token Protocols Are Getting Traction 
<p>It’s essential for securities issuers to choose a resilient infrastructure and the right security token protocol to issue securities on blockchain in order to properly enforce securities regulation. This infrastructure should provide solutions for issuers to natively tokenize shares with compliance rules embedded in the security token smart contracts. There are plenty of open-source protocols in the market that can provide these services, such as the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX Protocol</a>, the most adopted one used for tokenizing securities, having issued over&nbsp; €8.5 million assets to date. Here, we compare the differences between delegated security tokens and native security tokens issued via T-REX Protocol in the table below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Issuers also need to keep in mind that they must be authorized by regulators to distribute securities. In Binance’s case, there are certain documents such as prospectuses that need to be provided to investors. And these documents should be easily accessible by investors.</p>
<p>Binance is not a regulated exchange for securities, but they have apparently chosen to distribute securities to their users and to keep their security tokens in custody. It is not hard to see why regulators are looking into them. Unlike unregulated exchanges, broker-dealers, ATS, regulated exchanges, asset managers, and many other players are already allowed to distribute securities to their clients. These entities should launch <a href="https://tokeny.com/whats-the-purpose-of-a-digital-asset-marketplace/">Digital Assets Marketplaces (DAM)</a> and be sure that they only accept native security tokens in order to remain compliant.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 What are the key components of a security token marketplace? 
 
 Select serious securities issuers; 
 Onboard investors and verify their eligibility; 
 Distribute security tokens with documents required by regulators; 
 Issue and allocate permissioned security tokens to investors’ wallet; 
 Authorize transferability in P2P. 
 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			<p>With the right protocol, marketplace operators will be in line with lawmakers, allowing their investors to benefit from fractional and direct ownership, while receiving all the rights that directly associate with that securities.</p>
<p>Overall, we are pleased to see the progress that has been made in the tokenization market, as well as the attention it has recently attracted. Now, the technology is ready, and mass adoption will come as soon as institutions start to move and choose the right infrastructure.</p>

   Using Kong’s OpenID Connect (OIDC) plugin, Kong and Okta work together to solve three significant application development challenges: 

 
   Connectivity 
   Authentication 
   Authorization

<p>This series will show you how to implement service authentication and authorization for <a href="https://konghq.com/kong-konnect/">Kong Konnect</a> and Okta using the OIDC plugin. In this tutorial, we’ll cover client credentials flow for application authentication. Parts 2-4 will cover:</p>

 
   Authorization code for user authentication 
   Integral introspection for token validation 
   Access control based on Okta’s groups and planes

 Kong Konnect and Okta Integration Topology 

<p></p>

<p>In the above diagram, the API gateway splits into two sublayers. The first is the control plane used by admins to create new APIs and policies. The second sublayer is accountable for request processing and API conception and contains the control plane responsible for publishing those APIs and policies to the data plane.</p>

<p>My topology has two data planes: the first running locally, and the second running as a Docker container in an AWS EC2 instance. The integration is possible because Kong provides a specific plugin to implement the OAuth/OIDC flows from the API gateway. The OIDC plugin will submit the consumer to Okta’s authentication processes before consuming the API.</p>

 Set Up Konnect Service and Route 

<p>Konnect is a cloud native service connectivity platform hosted as a service. It can take care of all connectivity use cases across any environment, including virtual machines (VMs) and <a href="https://konghq.com/learning-center/kubernetes/what-is-kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>.</p>

<p>Start by going to the ServiceHub in the Kong Konnect Enterprise Admin GUI. In my example, I’ve already set up a service. If you haven’t already, follow the Kong Documentation to set up a service before continuing to the next steps.</p>

<p></p>

<p>My service has only one version. We could define multiple versions with different definitions and policies if necessary.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We could click on the service version to see the routes that are already exposing a service.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In my example, I’m going to consume and protect the <code>/oidcroute</code>. With no policy enabled, anyone can start consuming the route without any restriction. That’s why it’s critical to define and apply policies, like OIDC with Okta, to control this consumption.</p>

 Set Up Okta 

<p>My demo environment has two previously created Okta applications. In this example, I will use the Kong client credentials app.</p>

<p></p>

 Create Konnect Data Plane 

<p>We’ll run our Konnect data plane on an AWS EC2 instance in a Docker container. The control plane has a specific component called Runtime Manager. The Runtime Manager handles monitoring the currently installed data planes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Configure Runtime to see the script we’ll run to instantiate a Docker-based data plane.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Run the script in the EC2 terminal to get our first data plane up and running. In my example, I have already updated the script to use my Kong Konnect credentials. It will pull from the Kong Docker image.</p>

<p>Ready to launch, enjoy the flight! I’ve now deployed the data plane, and all the APIs are already available to consume.</p>

<p></p>

 Consume the Route Without a Policy 

<p>If we try to consume the route now by sending a request to <code>http :8000/oidcroute/get</code>, we’ll be able to consume the route as expected.</p>

<p></p>

<p>However, since we haven’t set any policy to control the route consumption, anyone could send as many requests as they want. To solve this, we’ll need to set up the OIDC policy to control the route consumption.</p>

 Add OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>To add the OIDC plugin, go to the ServiceHub &gt; Service &gt; Versions &gt; Service Version &gt; Add Plugin.</p>

<p>The plugin expects four parameters to integrate with Okta.</p>

 
   Config.ClientId—issued from Okta 
   Config.Client Secret 
   Config.Issuer—Okta’s endpoint 
   Config.Scopes 
 

<p>After configuring those four settings, click Create to save our settings.</p>

 Test the OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Let’s go back to our terminal and try to consume the route using <code>http :8000/oidcroute/get</code>. The API gateway won’t allow us because we’re not providing the credentials.</p>

<p>If we try to send the same request, including our credentials (the client ID and client secret), we can consume the route.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We can also decode the token issued by Okta on <a href="https://jwt.io">jwt.io</a> and check all the fields inside it.</p>

<p></p>

 Upstream Header Injection 

<p>The OIDC plugin provides upstream header injection. That means we can extend requests with extra headers. Doing so sends the upstream or microservice more information about the authentication process. As an exercise, we can inject a header based on the ISS field, which is Okta’s issuer endpoint.</p>

<p>To set extra OIDC plugin parameters, use the Kong Konnect control plane to:</p>

 
   Edit the OIDC plugin and enter iss into the field: Config.Upstream Headers Claims. 
   Enter Issuer_Header in the field: Config.Upstream Headers Names. 
   Click Update. 
 

<p>Let’s consume the route one more time and inject a brand-new header into our request.</p>

<p></p>

We will be updating to the latest version in the future but first, we want to ensure that integrators can handle the DIDs of our users.</p><p>You can create an Element DID with key pairs or a mnemonic phrase, or you can simply generate a fresh DID.</p> WACI Core &amp; WACI jose <p><code>@bloomprotocol/waci-core</code> and <code>@bloomprotocol/waci-jose</code> are libraries for the WACI spec, which Bloom has recently donated to DIF. (Look for a blog post about WACI soon!) waci-core &nbsp;exports TypeScript types and schemas to be used by any other implementation, and waci-jose uses waci-core to sign and verify JWTs with<a href="https://github.com/panva/jose"> jose</a>. A library that uses <a href="https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken">jsonwebtokens</a>, in lieu of jose, would also be able to use waci-core.</p> WACI Kit React <p><code>@bloomprocotol/waci-kit-react</code> is the UI part of the WACI flow. Those who have used our old (now deprecated) <code>@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react</code> will find this interface familiar. This library renders either a QR Code or a link, depending on the platform, that starts an interaction with our mobile app.</p><p>Get the mobile app <a href="https://go.onelink.me/9Fr3/bf30b5a3">here</a>!</p> Presentation Exchange <p><code>@bloomprotocol/presentation-exchange</code> contains TypeScript types and JSON schemas for the different objects in the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> specification. In the future, this library will also contain implementations of the behavior aspects of the spec (e.g. filtering credentials, pulling credentials out of a Presentation Submission, etc.)</p> Credential Manifest <p><code>@bloomprotocol/credential-manifest</code> contains TypeScript types and JSON schemas for the different objects in the frozen working copy of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/wallet-and-credential-interactions/versions/v0.1.0/#credential-manifest-working-copy">Credential Manifest</a> specification. Once the Credential Manifest specification is finalized, this library will be updated.</p> Future Work  EcdsaSecp256k1Signature2020 &amp; EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2020 <p>While the 2019 versions help to ensure that we have better future interoperability, we still must implement the 2020 versions. In the more current version, key pairs are encoded in the "multibase" format rather than in base58. Beyond this, little has changed between the two iterations.</p> VC Taxonomy <p>This library will provide TypeScript Types, JSON-LD contexts, and JSON schemas for specific types of VCs, as well as for building on top of VC.</p> Documentation <p>We need proper documentation setup. We want to create a<a href="https://docusaurus.io"> Docusaurus</a> package within the SSI SDK repo and host it on GitHub pages. The package will include walkthroughs, examples, and any other resources &nbsp;that we believe can help integrators. If you have any ideas for how to enhance this documentation package, please share your thoughts <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/ssi-sdk/issues/6">here</a>.</p>

Under lockdown and unable to access brick and mortar, as usual, we’ve warmed to the idea of using e-commerce for everything, from grocery shopping to financial transactions. Consumers are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that their future customer interactions will be digital in&nbsp;nature.</p><p>What we’ll see, even post-vaccine is an increasingly omnichannel society in which the physical and digital worlds will come together in a way that makes it much easier and convenient for people to buy and access the services they&nbsp;need.</p> So what does this mean for identity proofing? <p>Simply put, every customer interaction with your products and services should be carefully considered and purposeful.</p><p>This starts with deeply understanding people’s attitudes and behaviours regarding digital identity and accessing services online. We must take time to understand our customers, their needs, motivations and the challenges they face when using our products and services.</p><p>We know this because our team at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/onfido/">Onfido</a> invests significant effort into talking directly to our users and observing them using our products. As a result, we’ve been able to tailor and improve our user experience to meet a diverse set of needs, environments and use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>In doing so, we’ve made a surprising observation: A truly frictionless experience is not necessarily the optimal outcome when it comes to identity.</p><p>When removing friction compromises other usability constraints such as user security and safety, it can actually be harmful to both users and businesses, especially when designing highly critical&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Adding strategically architected friction can guide users in an intended direction, better prepare them for success, and ensure that your business gets the strongest signals on which to make security decisions. <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/good-friction-for-great-ux-5151bace3bfa">In our own work at Onfido</a>, we’ve directly observed the benefits of adding purposeful and thoughtfully designed moments of friction to our&nbsp;users.</p><p>There’s a great example of this called the Locksmith Paradox:</p><p>When a locksmith is new, they are slow. But as they get more skilled, they can look at the lock and open it in 5 seconds flat. But doing that will impact the customer in three&nbsp;ways:</p>  There’s an Emotional impact: The customer will be embarrassed it was so easy, and they wasted the locksmith’s time.  It changes the customer’s perception of value: They will immediately get annoyed that they have to pay so much for five seconds of&nbsp;work.  It impacts their sense of security/trust: They will never feel safe with that (or any other) lock ever&nbsp;again.  <p>The combination of these three things means that customer satisfaction actually goes down the better at your job you&nbsp;are.</p><p>Experienced locksmiths quickly learn to take their time — They might poke at the lock with various tools from their toolkit or blow into the lock with compressed air (which accomplishes nothing), then “click!” it comes open, and the client is SUPER GRATEFUL.</p><p>By adding purposeful and deliberate friction to the experience, locksmiths have improved outcomes for themselves and their clients. Our digital experiences are precisely the&nbsp;same.</p><p>So, when evaluating and optimising for friction on your own platforms, I’ll leave you with three pieces of&nbsp;advice:</p><p>First, we must respond to the seismic shift in customer expectations.</p><p>How you handle identity is not only important at onboarding but throughout the entire customer journey. The onboarding phase is critical because if you get that part right, you have a lot more confidence in your customers on your platform. This shift to digital that we’ve been talking about is a massive opportunity to meet our customers where they are and to add tangible value to their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Secondly, exceeding customer expectations starts with deeply understanding your customer’s needs. Take the time to observe them using your products in real environments, and you’ll start to see patterns emerging around the friction they experience and what you can to do&nbsp;respond.</p><p>Finally, look for that balance when designing experiences in ID proofing, consent and authentication. As our Locksmith taught us, it is helpful to distinguish between negative friction — the kind that makes your customers frustrated and annoyed — and positive friction, the type that offers tangible benefits to people. Being mindful of this will help you manage their perception of your value and improve their security and emotional response to your&nbsp;brand.</p><p><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/onfido">See our open roles on&nbsp;Lever</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/improving-user-experience-in-identity-proofing-4e812f06c4d5">Improving User Experience in Identity Proofing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Ontology partners with <a href="http://rocki.app">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain, to provide decentralized identity (DID) solutions to its&nbsp;users. <p>Ontology is proud to collaborate with ROCKI, a next-generation music streaming service and music NFT platform built on Binance Smart Chain. We aim to provide decentralized identity (DID) solutions to ROCKI’s music creators and users to ensure they are authentic and&nbsp;secure.</p> Why the NFT Market Needs&nbsp;DID <p>The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) exploded in 2021. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/youngjoseph/2021/03/29/nft-market-rages-on-nfts-market-cap-grow-1785-in-2021-as-demand-explodes/?sh=2f7dac317fdc">Forbes</a>, since the start of the year, ‘the combined market cap of major NFT projects has increased by 1,785%.’ These projects, which specialise in the creation and sale of tokenized images, songs, virtual real estate, and other artistic creations, are now valued at over $400&nbsp;million.</p><p>NFTs offer creators a novel way to monetize their creations. Unfortunately, there have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art">reports</a> of artists having their artwork sold by impersonators. This is, in part, due to popular NFT platforms lacking a robust verification process for determining a creator’s identity.</p><p>The potential for fraud in the growing NFT market recently attracted the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fatfs-new-guidance">attention</a> of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the inter-governmental watchdog that establishes standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, which is currently drafting new guidance proposals for both DeFi and NFT&nbsp;markets.</p> How Ontology Empowers ROCKI’s&nbsp;Userbase <p>Ontology’s Decentralized Identity (DID) Registration Management SDK will enable ROCKI to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and help buyers avoid purchasing inauthentic NFTs. Ontology’s DID technology relies on global trust anchors to verify user credentials that can then be used to establish a digital identity across multiple blockchains (e.g. Ontology, BSC, Ethereum, OKExChain).</p><p>ROCKI intends to have all creators on the platform go through an initial KYC/AML process to verify their identity. Upon completion of the verification process, creators will receive a public stamp of approval, similar to Twitter’s blue checkmark.</p><p>Initially, the verification process will be used to verify national ID credentials. However, there are also plans to enable users to verify social media accounts such as Spotify and Instagram. This way, artists with large social media followings will be able to create a robust assortment of verified credentials, leaving little doubt that their NFTs are authentic.</p><p>ROCKI spent months searching for a suitable KYC provider and decided Ontology was the best fit for securing its users’ accounts. Their previous partners include Bounce, a decentralized NFT marketplace, and Ankr, a provider of blockchain node hosting solutions.</p><p>ROCKI has <a href="https://medium.com/rockiapp/rocki-announces-partnership-with-ontology-b18ffe6cfc3d">expressed</a> interest in implementing other Ontology services such as <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-id-2-0-take-charge-of-your-identity-with-customized-data-control-and-disclosure-features-c54bd9305e2d">ONT ID</a>. When announcing the partnership, ROCKI wrote&nbsp;that</p><blockquote>Ontology’s <a href="https://ddxf.ont.io/">DDXF</a> (Decentralized Data Exchange Framework) and <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, which provides credit and reputation scoring based on user ONT ID data, is a powerful tool that may bring further benefits to ROCKI’s creators.</blockquote><p>Stay tuned for future news and updates about Ontology Network’s progress.</p><p>About ROCKI</p><p><a href="http://rocki.app/">ROCKI</a> is a user-centric music streaming ecosystem that incentives both the artists and the listeners by rewarding them with its in-house ROCKS token. Specifically, ROCKI’s marketplace provides artists with near-real-time royalty payments, paid in ROCKS — thereby solving one of the major challenges in the modern, COVID-stricken digital music industry, where most artists have to fight for streaming pay.

Awards such as FinTech Australia’s Finnies are a testament to Australian innovation. Australia is often considered as a great test market. Despite the relatively small population compared to the USA or Europe, the high adoption of new technologies makes Australia a great market to test, validate and chart a pathways for solutions to take off globally.




 




Indeed, Australia is proudly home to a lot of innovative start-ups, which makes the start-up industry in particular worth considering. The synergy of technological shifts, market opportunities and a vigorously growing digital culture has developed several <a href="https://planetmedia.com.au/blog/unique-innovative-companies-that-have-reached-unicorn-status/">FinTech</a><a href="https://planetmedia.com.au/blog/unique-innovative-companies-that-have-reached-unicorn-status/"> Unicorns</a>.



In October 2020, Meeco was the proud recipient of the FinTech Australia Finnie for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxRkChGHa8k&amp;list=PL4ITSyTPE_Itre7yk5wSinhYGVxE_IhsM&amp;index=12">Excellence in Industry Collaboration &amp; Partnerships</a>, for our push into Belgium and collaboration with KBC Bank. So we are more than thrilled to keep the momentum going when we received news that we are been shortlisted again this year.




 




We are proud to announce we made it to the <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/fintech-australia-is-proud-to-announce-the-2021-finnies-finalists/">finalists for FinTech Australia’s Finnies 2021</a>. This year, Meeco was nominated in the Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger category, for the development of our decentralised identity wallet.  Contenders for the award this year include AgUnity, BOULEVARD Global, CommChain, Hutly, Oxen, Pellar Technology and RelayPay.




 





 “Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger” finalist 





 




Meeco’s submission results from our work in collaboration with with <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au">eftpos</a> and <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a>. The Australian payments giant eftpos recently announced joining the Hedera Governing Council after successfully conducting tests to determine the <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/37360/australias-eftpos-to-set-up-hedera-hashgraph-node-for-micropayments">feasibility of a digital Australian dollar stablecoin for micropayments</a>. Meeco plays an important part in this world-leading initiative as the wallet provider for the proof-of-technology.




 



<blockquote>
“When we were running the eftpos micropayments PoC with Hedera Hashgraph, we needed a wallet partner. We had had great experience of working with Meeco on our connectID PoC and needed aspects of digital identity for the micropayments PoC too, so they were a natural fit.

This enabled us to combine the provisioning of an eftpos debit card, identity credentials and a stable coin in one wallet. The PoC was very successful and resulted in a technical platform that demonstrates micropayment capability in a way that no other payments provider has. Our next phase is to look at ways to commercialise this capability.” 

Rob Allen, Entrepreneur in Residence, eftpos

 Everything will be Tokenized 





 




Earlier this month, Meeco was invited to share our vision of a tokenised work at an <a href="https://fsclub.zyen.com/">FSClub</a> webinar hosted by <a href="https://www.zyen.com/">Z/Yen</a>‘s Chairman, Professor <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mrmainelli">Michael Mainelli</a>. Meeco’s CEO and Founder, <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a> delivered the presentation titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">Everything Will Be Tokenized: The Future of Identity</a>. Katryna shared some of the exiting things we have been working on along with where the tokenised world is heading.




 





<blockquote>“We’re on track towards a world where everything can be tokenized. Tokenization plays a critical part in enabling more equitable value creation for people, organisations and things. Providing the means to issue and store value, trace provenance, and most importantly achieve consensus to instantly trust. 

In order for this tokenized world to emerge we will need the infrastructure for people and their digital twins to participate. This will include digital identity, verifiable credentials and payments.”

Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder, Meeco</blockquote>





 




Since 2012, Meeco has been pioneering the access, protection and value exchange of personal data and identity. Over the past year we have been working towards making much of this possible, and this webinar featured some of the use-cases and practical steps along the way, such as:

 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">Watch the webinar</a> 
 





 




Over the past year, we have been working in conjunction with Hedera to launch a multi-purpose wallet that will enable decentralised identity, verifiable credentials, micropayments and tokens. The wallet will be available as a white label solution, with SDK and supported by Meeco’s Secure Value Exchange credential solution. We look forward to sharing more news soon along with updates to our <a href="https://www.meeco.me/developers">developer portal</a>.




 




In the meantime, the category winners for the FinTech Australia Finnies 2021 will be announced in-person this year&nbsp;on&nbsp;21 July, 2021&nbsp;at The Forum, Melbourne.




 




From all of us at Meeco, huge congratulations to all the finalists. 




 




In closing, a very special thank you to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roballennodl/">Rob Allen</a> at eftpos and <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/mchalet">Tim McHale</a> at Hedera, for enabling us to stand on the shoulders of giants. It’s an honour to be counted in such great company, thank you!

<p>If you’re interested in cryptocurrency, at some point you’re going to come across Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and court jester of Twitter. He has strong opinions, he’s not afraid to share them, and apparently he’s also not afraid to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203">completely reverse them</a> due to ecological concerns over blockchain mining.</p><blockquote><p>Tesla &amp; Bitcoin <a href="https://t.co/YSswJmVZhP">pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 12, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>In the midst of the furor over one man’s opinions, I also sense growing <a href="https://thedefiant.io/people-are-outraged-about-nft-energy-consumption/">anger</a> over the energy consumption of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>, which are blockchain-based certificates of ownership for digital art. One artist, Joanie LeMercier, calculated that the sale of six of his pieces consumed <a href="https://joanielemercier.com/the-problem-of-cryptoart/">more electricity in ten minutes</a> than his art studio had consumed in the previous two years.</p>Source: https://joanielemercier.com/the-problem-of-cryptoart/<p>Granted, determining blockchain’s real ecological cost is not simple. Some argue that kilowatts per transaction is the <a href="https://medium.com/superrare/no-cryptoartists-arent-harming-the-planet-43182f72fc61">wrong equation</a>. Others claim that roughly <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019">three quarters</a> of the electricity used to mine blocks comes from renewable sources (though still others say it’s <a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/36672/renewable-energy-not-as-prominent-in-cryptocurrency-mining-as-previously-claimed">more like 40%</a>, and most of the remaining power comes from coal and natural gas). Finally, proponents claim that cryptocurrency <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf">drives adoption of renewables</a> and might be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-energy-consumption-is-far-more-efficient-and-greener-than-todays-banking-system/">a lot greener</a> than the global banking system.</p><p>But as blockchains become more popular and their tokens increase in value, more miners get in on the game, increasing the total electricity consumption. Even if you use the more favourable figures, with non-renewables accounting for only 25%, 25% of a lot will still be a lot.</p><p>Public blockchains consume so much electricity because they have a lot of entropy to deal with. In thermodynamics, entropy is noise, waste, meaninglessness. The problem blockchain is trying to solve — dishonest agents trying to corrupt the global ledger — certainly fits that description.</p><blockquote>Any time you have too much entropy, you’re going to need to spend a lot of energy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/mgjfkn/eli5_what_is_negentropy/gstkwly/">moving it somewhere else</a>. My hot take: Bitcoin is basically converting dishonesty into CO₂. It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory">simple physics</a>.</blockquote><p>We get it. Bitcoin is burning the world. Ethereum is burning the world. NFTs are burning the world. There are more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">planet</a>-<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/">friendly</a> <a href="https://101blockchains.com/blockchain-vs-hashgraph-vs-dag-vs-holochain/">consensus</a> designs out there, along with <a href="https://medium.com/the-capital/layer-1-vs-layer-2-what-you-need-to-know-about-different-blockchain-layer-solutions-69f91904ce40">layer 2 protocols</a> to ease the burden, and I appreciate these innovations. If the world is gonna use blockchains, it ought to figure out ways to make them greener.</p><p>But I think it ignores two important questions: Regardless of the consensus mechanism used, is consensus even necessary? And more importantly, could we be doing better things with that electricity?</p> Consensus: an irrelevant starting point? <p>Programmers love a ‘single source of truth’, a canonical representation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">system state</a> that everyone can rely on. That naturally led people to look for a way to get everyone to agree on the contents of one single, shared ledger of events.</p><p>This problem — reaching consensus among all honest agents in a low-trust system — is big. And the solutions are brilliant. As an engineer, I love them. But they all feel like answers to the wrong question.</p><p>What if we started with different questions?</p><p>Moving one step backwards, do we really need consensus on everything? The real world seems to do just fine without it, for the most part. And I’d like to move backwards even further and ask, what are we actually trying to achieve?</p><p>We just want to interact with each other on the internet without having to constantly worry about getting cheated. That’s a simpler framing, and it opens the door to novel solutions.</p><p>Evolution has been working on this problem for a long time. And it’s come up with lots of great solutions (you could call them games) that all share three simple meta-rules (you could call this the meta-game of living systems).</p>  Everyone knows and agrees to the rules of the specific game they’re playing.  Each participant takes responsibility for following the rules.  If anyone sees anyone else breaking the rules, they take action against them and spread news of what they saw.  <p>We see this meta-game popping up over and over again — in ecosystems, bee colonies, flocks of birds, and even human social structures (though we seem to pick really terrible games and break the rules a lot). Considering the small energy input, it’s a surprisingly robust defense against threats.</p><p>The human immune system is a great example: the rules of the game are encoded in each cell’s DNA, so each cell knows how to play nicely with the other cells. If any cell acts up — maybe it goes cancerous, maybe it’s infected with a virus — special immune cells recognise it as a bad actor and trigger an immune response. The body protects itself without spending a lot of energy, simply by launching a small, targeted response against the rule-breaker.</p><p>That’s how a Holochain application’s network works. Each user has their own application cell, with a chunk of code (we even call it a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#layers-of-the-application-stack">DNA</a>) that defines the rules of the game. They’re responsible for the actions they take, which get written onto their own <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">personal ledger</a>. Each action is witnessed by a small set of randomly chosen peers, who <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/#finding-peers-and-data-in-a-distributed-database">store its data,</a> <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/">check it</a> against their copy of the rules, and broadcast an alert if they see anything wrong.</p><p>With this arrangement, you can get 'good enough' security with a fraction of the effort that full consensus would require.</p><blockquote>Holochain makes a bold claim: Consensus is unnecessary for most of the things blockchain is interested in doing.</blockquote>Two Holochain networks with different proportions of dishonest users. At 50%, each piece of data only needs 7 witnesses to achieve 99% integrity. Even with 90% dishonest users, the number of required witnesses is still only 43. Adding more doesn't improve integrity that much.<p>With such a lightweight approach to security, a Holochain network can scale almost infinitely. Even as the number of users go up, each user is still only responsible for witnessing a small portion of their peers’ data.</p> Making sense of the energy costs <p>So what does this all mean for energy consumption? This is a hard question to answer, because blockchain's consensus and Holochain's peer witnessing are such different approaches. But I'll try my best.</p><p>In the graphs below, I attempt to show how three different systems – proof-of-work consensus, proof-of-stake consensus, and Holochain – perform compared to each other. To make things simple, I assume that every single user is perfectly average; they all want to make the same number of transactions per day. Don't think too hard about these graphs, though; they're 'napkin scribbles' that show the character of these systems' performance, not actual precise measurements.</p><p>The first graph shows how many average users each system can comfortably handle. Higher numbers are better. Blockchains don't get any faster as you add more machines; in fact they get slightly slower. The cloud industry would probably describe this as 'anti-scalability'. Holochain, on the other hand, keeps climbing roughly linearly in its ability to serve users, because each user takes care of their own business and helps validate a small portion of everyone else's. As with blockchain, performance drops slightly at larger network sizes, but it's more like 'doesn't climb quite as fast anymore'.</p><p>The other graphs show energy consumption, where lower numbers are better. The second shows the total system energy overhead, or 'cost to keep the thing running'. For all three systems, this grows linearly as the network grows. But for PoW blockchains, the mining overhead is massive — regardless of how much useful work is actually getting done.</p><p>Lastly, let's look at the marginal energy cost per transaction, or the energy it takes to commit data beyond the system overhead. All three systems get exponentially more expensive as the network grows, because each machine needs to talk to more peers in order to complete a transaction. But in Holochain that number grows much more slowly, because the number of witnesses you need to submit your transaction to is capped at 5, 10, 50, 100, whatever the network requires. (For the comp sci nerds, insertion time complexity for blockchain is <code>O(n^2)</code> while Holochain is <code>O(n log(n))</code>, where <code>n</code> &nbsp;is the number of nodes in the network.)</p><p>This means that Holochain can serve more users with less energy. Why does it perform so much better? Two really simple reasons (and please forgive me for repeating myself):</p>  Consensus is expensive, while peer witnessing is cheap.  Consensus forces everyone to behave like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)#Single-threaded_vs_multithreaded_programs">single-threaded program</a>, while agent-centric peer-to-peer is highly parallel.   Closing loops and extending lifecycles <p>So Holochain appears to be faster and less energy-intensive than blockchain. But there are two other ecological advantages that are easy to miss.</p> Heat: waste or resource? <p>Blockchain miners and cloud servers usually live in a data centre somewhere. In this building, hundreds or thousands of machines spend all day thinking about math and logic. That generates a lot of heat — so much heat that <a href="https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/">up to 50% of the electricity goes to cooling</a>.</p>Source: https://www.masonandhanger.com/blog/data-center-energy-consumption/. Note: 'chiller', 'CRAC', and 'humidifier' are all part of the cooling system.<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Permaculture</a> designers say that waste is just a resource in the wrong place. All that heat could be put to good use — say, to heat my home in the winter. But there’s no practical way to do that.</p><p>Because Holochain apps run on our own devices (or on someone else's device, if we're accessing them via the <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting</a> network), that heat is automatically spread out across the world and captured in our homes and offices. (Fun fact: Holo hosting first caught my attention because I saw the possibility of keeping my greenhouse lemons warm during the cold Canadian winters!)</p> It's about the hardware too <p>Every time I use a blockchain or cloud-hosted app, I’m leaning on faraway hardware and thousands of miles of network infrastructure. This seems wasteful when I have a supercomputer in my pocket and all I’m trying to do is talk to my dad on the other side of town. My precious devices take <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2013/08/01/whats-in-a-life-cycle-assessment/">a lot of energy</a> to make, with <a href="https://friendsofthecongo.org/coltan/">blood</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1566445/pdf/envhper00514-0024-color.pdf">toxic chemicals</a> spilled along the way. Knowing this, I’d like to use them to their full capacity before I start making demands on other devices.</p><p>Once again, Holochain apps run on our own devices. And even with the Holo hosting network, where the apps are hosted elsewhere, the hosting software will eventually be available for desktops and laptops. This means we're getting more use out of the machines that already exist.</p><p>That all sounds pretty green to me.</p> From ‘less bad’ to ‘more good’ <p>It's probably pretty clear that I think Holochain could replace blockchain for a lot of the crypto applications we see today. As we've seen, a well-designed Holochain app can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/nfts-on-holochain-easy-as-passing-the-ball-2/">deliver the same safety guarantees</a> as blockchain, with better performance, at zero cost, for a fraction of the resource consumption.</p><p>That excites me. I see a lot of creative things happening in crypto space, and I think Holochain could fill those niches in a way that’s gentler on our planet.</p><p>And I’m also curious about what’s next.

<p>Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers may feel like one of those invisible processes that go largely unnoticed yet have become essential to everyday life, especially in business. When you received your last paycheck through direct deposit to your bank account, that was made possible through an ACH transfer. When you paid your utility bill directly from your checking account, you likely used an ACH transfer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re already passively benefiting from ACH transfers, imagine the positive outcomes that could come from actively leveraging the ACH network. Here are six fundamentals to get you started.&nbsp;</p>
 What Is ACH? 
<p>“ACH” stands for “Automated Clearing House,” which is a payment network built by the National Automated Clearing House Association (Nacha). An ACH payment is an electronic bank-to-bank payment enabled through the ACH network, rather than through a card network. ACH payments are also frequently called ACH “transfers” or ACH “transactions.” The ACH network is used in the United States, but there are also International ACH Transactions (IAT).</p>
<p>Banks and other financial institutions use the ACH network to aggregate transactions for batch processing. In a given year, the ACH network processes around <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/what-is-ach">25 billion transactions</a>, likely including your paychecks and monthly bill payments. There are three types of transactions:</p>
 
 Direct Deposits: These transactions are any electronic transfer made from a business or government entity to a consumer. Direct deposit transactions may include:&nbsp;
 
 Paychecks and other employee expense reimbursements, bonuses, and commissions 
 Social security payments and other government benefits 
 Pension/401(k) disbursements 
 Annuities 
 Tax refunds 
 Interest payments 
 
 
 Split Deposit: This transaction enables deposits to be split into different accounts. For example, an employee could have a percentage of their paycheck deposited into a savings account while the rest is put in checking. 
 Direct Payments: If you’re sending money through the ACH network, then you’re making a direct payment. Payment solutions can enable any consumer to make these kinds of payments with their bank account:
 
 Charity donations 
 Bill payments 
 Tuition payments 
 Send money through social payment apps 
 Send money to friends and family 
 Make ACH-enabled purchases 
 
 
 
 How Do ACH Transfers Work? 
<p>The ACH transfer happens in two key steps: initiating the payment and receiving the payment. Before you can initiate the transfer as the payment originator, a customer must first give the business approval to initiate the transfer. This approval usually happens by signing an ACH authorization form or through verbal agreement. During this initiation process, the customer can set up one-time payments, recurring payments, split deposits, and so on.</p>
<p>Once the customer has authorized the transfer, your bank account will “pull” the payment from the customer’s bank account. If your customer has insufficient funds, then the payment can “bounce” just like a paper check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Pulling” money from an account is known as an ACH debit transaction. An ACH credit transaction, on the other hand, allows you to “push” money from one bank account to another.</p>
 What Are The Benefits Of Accepting ACH Transfers? 
<p>More and more businesses are leveraging ACH transfers in their business transactions. That increasing adoption has likely come as more businesses realize the benefits of ACH transfers for both them and their customers:</p>
 
 Low cost: ACH transfers tend to be a cost-effective method of moving money. We’ll cover more on costs below. 
 Open and inclusive: As long as you have a bank account, you can pay and receive money through the ACH network. No need to worry about having a credit or debit card. 
 Fast and easy: ACH transfers are much faster than delivering checks through snail mail, and you don’t have to worry about losing payments in the mail or dealing with paper check deposits. 
 Better customer experience: Since ACH transfers can be customized for recurring purchases, customers don’t have to worry about receiving and paying a bill, which reduces friction between them and your business. ACH transactions are also easier than customers filling out a check, which may additionally increase the chances of converting prospects. 
 
 What Are The Costs Of ACH Transfers? 
<p>ACH transfers will save your business much more than processing fees or wire transfers (which we’ll get to in more detail shortly). The <a href="https://gocardless.com/guides/ach/ach-fees-how-much-does-ach-cost/">median cost per transfer</a> is $0.29, but that number can rise or fall depending on:</p>
 
 The average transaction size 
 Volume of transactions you submit 
 Whether or not a bank uses same-day ACH 
 Size of the bank 
 Other incidental or bank fees 
 
 What’s The Difference Between ACH Transfers and Wire Transfers? 
<p>In many instances, ACH transfers have replaced more traditional wire transfers. But that doesn’t mean that wire transfers have completely lost their utility. For example, wire transfers happen in real time, which means they can process within minutes or hours, where ACH transfers could take a few days. However, wire transfers cost more, typically between $20 and $30 for the customer, and the recipient frequently has to pay a fee as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bottom line: wire transfers are likely better for large-sum, international, or time-sensitive transactions, where ACH transfers are more appropriate for smaller, more frequent transactions that can stand to take a little longer to process.</p>
 How Does Finicity Enable ACH Transfers? 
<p>What does all of this have to do with Finicity? On March 19, <a href="https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits">Nacha implemented a new WEB Debit Rule</a> that requires account validation with the first use of an account number, or following changes to the account number. The purpose of the rule is to reduce the chances of fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to help businesses satisfy Nacha’s new operating rule, Finicity delivers an instant account validation solution as part of our Finicity Pay solution set. In fact, Finicity is a <a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/nacha-announces-finicity-preferred-partner-account-validation">Preferred Partner</a> of Nacha for using instant account validation to mitigate fraud and maximize the accuracy of payment transactions by providing account and routing numbers, account owner and balance checks to make ACH payments even simpler. The speed and security of our open-banking-powered validation solutions also empower consumers with a streamlined, easy, digital-first experience.</p>
<p>ACH transfers are an innovative way for both businesses and consumers to move money while also cutting costs and saving time. Learn more about how <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity is enabling secure and less risky ACH transfers</a>.</p>

					<p>On Tuesday, May 18, 2021, Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes sat down with <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/">One World Identity</a> (OWI) CEO Travis Jarae to have a one-on-one conversation about <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/session/trinsic/">“The Rise &amp; Adoption of Verifiable Credentials”</a>. Below is a short summary of the conversation as well as answers to the questions that were asked by the audience during the Q&amp;A portion.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 An overview 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>As the title of the event suggests, Riley and Travis discussed the state of adoption for verifiable credentials and self-sovereign identity (SSI). Travis started the conversation by stating that critics of SSI claim adoption will be a hurdle too high to jump for any SSI platform or product to be successful at scale. Riley agreed that adoption is the most important hurdle to overcome, and explained that early technologists building SSI technology didn’t build tech that was easy to adopt. Today’s SSI approaches, partially pioneered by Trinsic, are now being built so they are adoptable today and not just in a fully decentralized, 20-year Web 3.0 future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Riley went on to more specifically address where verifiable credentials are at in terms of adoption. About a year and a half ago, there was essentially zero real-world adoption. Today, there’s between 100,000-300,000 verifiable credentials being used by real end users. In the last 18 months, demand has skyrocketed and there have been strong adoption signals, but the adoption of verifiable credentials is still very early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic is addressing this adoption problem for its customers with the recent launch of its enterprise-grade product—<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-ecosystems/">Trinsic Ecosystems</a>. Riley explained how Trinsic found that a large subset of its customers were wanting to use SSI to enable secure, privacy-compliant data sharing between multiple organizations and customers (or in other words, within an ecosystem). Trinsic Ecosystems is an out-of the-box solution that enables just that with all of the governance and technical tools to make adoption within any ecosystem easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Travis and Riley then focused on what role the COVID-19 pandemic has had in impacting the adoption of verifiable credentials. Riley explained how the pandemic has greatly accelerated interest and demand in verifiable credentials, but it is yet to be determined whether the recent uptake of verifiable credentials adoption is causation or correlation. However, the pandemic has created a major emphasis in creating a solution for digital health passes where health information (like COVID-19 test results or vaccination records) can be shared in a way that abides by data privacy regulation, safeguards the individual, and is standardized.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Travis brought up that health passes related to COVID-19 will eventually not be needed as the world fully recovers from the pandemic. Riley expressed that he looks forward to that day because that means we have beaten the pandemic. Until then, for jurisdictions and businesses that do have policies around COVID-19 test results and/or vaccinations, verifiable credentials provide a good way to enforce those policies in a standardized way, while putting the individual in control of their data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With that being said, if Riley had to make a prediction of what will be the next big use case for verifiable credentials, he said that it would be around taking the identity verifications that are done by Onfido, Passbase, Jumio, and others and simply codifying them in a way that can be reused by the individual.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They ended their conversation talking about the future of Trinsic. Riley said that Trinsic’s biggest priority right now is adoption and because of that, they are buckling down on refining the Trinsic Ecosystems product for the foreseeable future.</p>

					<p>Q: What verifiable credentials use cases are enterprise and businesses using Trinsic for?</p><p>A: From the enterprise side, we are mostly seeing customers want to use Trinsic to make data sharing secure, privacy-preserving, and standardized between multiple organizations and their customers. Essentially, instead of disjointed systems having to build and maintain a custom API to share data, with Trinsic, the customer becomes the API, enabling a seamless data sharing process that puts the customer in control of his or her data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How does self-sovereign identity reduce costs?</p><p>A: Because credentials can be reused by the individual, organizations no longer have to go through the costly and time-consuming process of re-verifying their customers and their data and can instead do it instantaneously. Additionally, SSI reduces costs for credential issuers in that issuing companies no longer need to be “on call” to vouch whether or not the information is accurate or not, and they no longer need to outsource that role to companies like Equifax and give them access to their database.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How involved are governments in deploying SSI?</p><p>A: Governments are some of the most active proponents of SSI. The USA, Canada, various governments in Europe including the UK and the EU, as well as Asian governments are all investing money in SSI projects. Smaller governments such as state or large jurisdictional governments are also deploying SSI at a surprisingly rapid pace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Do you think that we will have one wallet containing all our credentials or separate wallets by use case based around health, employment, identity, etc.? In the UK, the covid passport is being built around the NHS app, for example.</p><p>A: I think in the near-term we’ll see separate wallets by use case (actually, I think they’ll be by ecosystem). That’s the signal we’re seeing strongly from the market with interest in our Wallet SDK and Ecosystems product.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How does this differ from Civic’s&nbsp;<a href="http://identity.com/">identity.com</a>&nbsp;(open source ecosystem providing access to on-demand, secure ID verification)?</p><p>A: There are a variety of differences, but the primary one is that <a href="http://identity.com">identity.com</a>, to my knowledge, is an identity verification solution, whereas Trinsic is infrastructure for creating such solutions. Trinsic’s customers span not just identity verification, but government, B2B, and IoT use cases as well. <a href="http://identity.com">Identity.com</a> is also a solution built around the CVC cryptocurrency and leverages smart contracts, whereas Trinsic uses blockchain only as an optional dPKI for organizations. See more about how blockchain fits <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/blockchain-is-the-least-interesting-thing-about-self-sovereign-identity-75c1b56ce497">here</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How do you get people to care about adoption? How do you talk about decentralized identity outside of enterprises to encourage people to take action?</p><p>A: People will adopt something if it has a clear benefit to them. It’s too much to expect people to pick up a random SSI wallet from the App Store and start using it throughout their lives. The adoption process will be gradual and may be happening without end users really knowing what’s going on under the hood. For example, a digital health pass might just appear in an app on their phone. The user probably thinks about it in terms of the ability to travel that it affords, not in terms of self-sovereign control over their data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Do you see a use case around account takeover for financial institutions?</p><p>A: Yes, account takeover is one of many use cases we’ve seen financial institutions look into. One of the most challenging parts of securing an account is the different authentication methods for different channels. For example, calling-in uses security questions while in-person uses a physical ID card. Verifiable credentials are an ideal solution for omni-channel authentication, meaning the same factors of authentication can be used in any scenario (login, drive-through, ATM, etc.).

<p>With ongoing developments in the field of smart citiies and digitalization in general, data is becoming a driving factor and value stream for new and existing economies alike. However, there exists an increasing centralization and monopolization of data holders and service providers, especially in the form of the big US-based technology companies in the western world and central technology providers with close ties to the government in the Asian regions. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) provides the technical building blocks to create decentralizied data-driven systems, which bring data autonomy back to the users. In this paper we propose a system in which the combination of SSI and token economy based incentivisation strategies makes it possible to unlock the potential value of data-pools without compromising the data autonomy of the users. </p>

<p>The May 2021 edition of Fission's monthly Demo Day featured our announcement of joining the Decentralized Identity Foundation and our DID interop plans, our updated VS Code plugin, a demo of our Account Backup approach, and lots of TiddlyWiki-related news and demos.</p><a href="https://presentations.fission.app/demodays/2021-05-20-fission-demoday.pdf">Slides for the presentation »</a> Joining the Decentralized Identity Foundation <p>Fission is now an Associate Member of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p>Logo wall of many of the DIF members. Happy to see our home Province of British Columbia once again be an early adopter of these standards!<p>Fission accounts have always been designed with portability in mind, being based on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) from the very beginning.</p><p>We're working with the Secure Data Storage / Personal Data Store Working group, along with a number of other groups from the identity and IPFS ecosystems. Our Web Native File System is live today as a user-owned personal data store, so this is a great opportunity to see how we can come to a set of standards and specifications that work for everyone.</p><p>We also announced that we'll be working on DID interoperability. Our goal will be to accept DIDs from other systems, so that you can bring your own identity and make use of Fission's app publishing platform, personal data store, and other features.</p><p>We will be adding DID support to the Fission server, and targeting the <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">Microsoft ION</a> network as our first interoperability target.</p><p>We're talking to other people in the DID ecosystem and would love to showcase other examples of interoperability. If you're a developer building DID-based solutions, get in touch!</p> TiddlyWiki Demo with Jeremy Ruston <p>Jeremy Ruston, creator of TiddlyWiki, joined us to give an update on TiddlyWiki on Fission, as well as some really great new work on <a href="https://twpub-tools.org/">converting ePub books into annotatable TiddlyWiki content</a>.</p><a href="https://vimeo.com/555058528">Watch Jeremy's Fission + TiddlyWiki demo video »</a> Funding TiddlyWiki Core Image Uploads with OpenCollective <p>Also announced was the fact that Boris is personally funding a core plugin to make it much easier to upload images, files and assets as separate files in TiddlyWiki.</p><p>The first backend supported will be uploading to Fission's Webnative File System on IPFS. Other backends and features will be prioritized by contributors.</p><p>Since Demo Day last week, <a href="https://github.com/saqimtiaz">Saq Imtiaz</a> has agreed to do the TiddlyWiki core development to make this happen. You can find a <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/tiddlywiki-file-upload-plugin-webnative-ipfs-funded/1926">full write up on the plan in the Fission forum</a>, including some background from Saq. </p><p><a href="https://opencollective.com/tiddlywiki-on-fission/projects/tiddlywiki-file-upload">Visit the OpenCollective page to support the project »</a></p> VSCode Fission Plug-in <p>Brian took on updating the VS Code Fission plugin with our latest CLI updates and improvements. You can easily register and publish apps directly from within VSCode.</p><p>You can find it in the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fissioncodes.fission">VSCode marketplace</a>, and the source code is on Github <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/fission-vscode">https://github.com/fission-suite/fission-vscode</a></p><p>He also managed to sneak in a demo of CLI linking as well, showing how you can now link your Fission account to your developer machine as well as to web browsers.</p> Fission Account Backup WIP Demo <p>Philipp showed off his work-in-progress on the <a href="https://dashboard.fission.codes">Dashboard</a> around Account Backup. Fission accounts are based on public/private keys, and Fission doesn't keep a copy. This means that if you lose all of your devices, no one can get at your encrypted files.</p><p>Fission's account backup strategy is to give users a key fragment that you can use for recovery, without ever having access or control over your private files, similar to other secure, privacy-preserving systems.</p> Bonus Boris on TiddlyWiki <p>The end of the demo day had some extended content, with more Fission + TiddlyWiki demos of Boris' personal usage of the system:</p><p><a href="https://boris.files.fission.name/p/twgroceries/">Tiddly Groceries:</a> a shopping list, ingredients, recipes, stores, and more, all inter-linked together into one glorious TiddlyWiki. Original version by <a href="https://marxsal.github.io/various/groceries.html">marxsal</a>.</p><p><a href="https://akhater.github.io/drift/">Drift:</a> Boris keeps his working version of this TiddlyWiki in the encrypted, private version of his Fission webnative account. It has plugins that include Daily Notes, backlinks, autocomplete, and more, perfect for #ToolsForThought style note taking.

<p>It’s RSA Conference week again, and while we’re still functioning in the virtual realm for the time being, some things don’t change. One of those things being executives searching for the best technologies to protect their data and IT infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
      
<p><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/security/the-5-most-innovative-cybersecurity-startups-from-rsa-conference/5">CRN surveyed</a> a number of those executives, asking them to identify the cybersecurity startups they believe best poised to bring to market “innovative ways to protect data, cloud workloads and open-source software”. Here at HYPR, we’re thrilled to crack that Top 5 list, and we couldn’t be prouder to be rubbing shoulders with such unicorns as Orca Security, BigID, Snyk, and BitSight.</p>
      
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless Authentication is providing a platform for companies to accelerate their MFA initiatives — many mandated by government or insurance regulations — and allocate that budget into a passwordless MFA initiative. As Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint’s EVP of Cybersecurity Strategy writes, “Most breaches involve either human error or compromised credentials.” Passwordless MFA eliminates the target, and solves the desktop MFA gap.</p>
      
<p>Something I’ve always shied away from as a marketer is submitting my company (or product or C Level executive) into “pay for play” award opportunities. Occasionally there’s decent optics for these, a splashy logo advertising a Best in Category Winner to highlight in a social post, for example. But this? Being named in the Top 5 is the kind of organic win I like to write about: an independent organization surveying executives anonymously, and being grouped with Unicorns. That old adage about being as good as the company you keep certainly rings true here.&nbsp;</p>

These use cases are a compilation of the <a href="https://affinidipocathon.devpost.com/">submissions</a> (in no particular order) made by the participants of the Affindi PoCathon&nbsp;2021.</p> AED Access <p>CPR devices provide chest compression during a cardiac arrest to resuscitate a patient and can be a lifesaver in emergencies. However, it must be used only by those trained in CPR to prevent unwanted complications.</p><p>Currently, in the US, companies are worried about the liability of having an untrained person use the CPR device in an emergency, and hence, are wary of making them available to the general public, thereby creating a possible void in emergencies.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-mckay/">Dave McKay</a> came up with the idea of using VCs to solve this problem and implemented the PoC using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs. Here is the workflow of his solution.</p>  The organizations that provide training on CPR and AED devices can issue a credential to people who pass the course and are certified to use the&nbsp;device.  Organizations can place the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/aed-access">AED devices</a> in a locked&nbsp;cabinet.  On the cabinet will be a QR code for a VC proof&nbsp;request.  The VC holder scans the QR code and sends their&nbsp;VC.  The VC triggers a message to the cabinet to&nbsp;unlock.  <p>Thus, a life is potentially saved.</p> YouNo <p>Alan Wang decided to use VCs to solve a social problem that is sometimes even considered taboo to talk&nbsp;about.</p><p>He came up with the idea of <a href="https://devpost.com/software/you-no">using VCs</a> to empower sex workers and to protect them from the spread of sexually transmittable diseases. Alan’s implementation aims to share the details of sexually transmitted diseases confidentially and in a trustable way, such that it can only be verified when two people physically meet in&nbsp;person.</p><p>Here, the issuer is a clinic that issues VCs detailing the presence/absence of sexually transmittable diseases in an individual, who is the holder. This VC can be shared by the holder while meeting a sex worker in person, and this worker will verify the VCs before deciding the next&nbsp;step.</p><p>This PoC built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs goes to show how even small steps in technology and innovation can create a big social impact, especially on the marginalized sections of&nbsp;society.</p> Daver Proxy <p>Alex Varabei, Arthur Pinchuk, Александр Годун, Jus1x, Constanine Agapotov, Andrey Kozlovskiy, and Eugene Bogatyrev came together to address the problem of corporate authorization.</p><p>Banks, brokers, and counterparties often request the authorization of a representative to perform certain actions such as bank account opening, contract signing, etc. But this still didn’t solve the problem of trust because the proxy could be revoked at any time. Notary verifications were a hassle due to their cost, time consumption, and complexity of dealing with apostille (not all states joined the Hague Convention).</p><p>To tackle this problem with an SSI-based solution, the team leveraged the timestamping provided by the Ethereum blockchain and used Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs. This solution has three operational roles: Manager, Board Members, and Counterparty (the legal entity that has a stake in ensuring that the proxy is valid to avoid financial risks). VC Issuer is not present on the interface but participates in the process of credential verification. The manager seeks the approval of the proxy by Board Members and the proxy authorizes the Manager to sign a contract on behalf of the company with the counterparty.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/daver-proxy">detailed implementation</a> of this&nbsp;PoC.</p> RippleFund <p>RippleFund by Carey Lai and Callista Chang is a VC-based crowdfunding idea built on Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>It aims&nbsp;to,</p>  Make crowdfunding accessible to and trusted by the public (MAS- and SAF-backed)  Protect crowdfunding backers from con artists and&nbsp;scams  Build trust and engagement among Singaporean startups and crowdfunding backers  Promote entrepreneurship as well as innovative methods of capital raising in Singapore  <p>Click here for a <a href="https://vimeo.com/547835578">demo video</a> of this&nbsp;product.</p> TransportHub <p>Priyanka Pol, Nita Hinge, Madhusudan J, Tanvi Lokhande, and Mandar Tawde decided to ideate the possibility of using verifiable credentials to revolutionize the future of trucking and logistics. They envision TransportHub as a marketplace with verifiable credentials for all parties using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to increase transparency and information flow.</p><p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/transportation-hub-lorry-receipt-issuer">TransportHub</a> is a marketplace that would digitize the documents such as lorry receipts, driver information, consignee, consigner, and transporter to give participants visibility to the entire process with digital authentication.</p><p>Here,</p>  Issuer is a startup company called TransportHub that would collect the details from the consignor (the person sending the consignment) and would issue the VC. Some possible information contained in the VC can be related to the consignor, consignee, goods, freight charges, driver, and vehicle&nbsp;details.  Holder is the consignor  Verifier is the consignee (entity receiving the goods), drivers, and others who can use these credentials to change the status of the trip in their respective systems.   The Hospitality Manager <p>Created by Arnav Ladkat and Aamir Miyajiwala, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-hospitality-manager">The Hospitality Manager</a> uses Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to protect the identity documents of travelers and to reduce the possibilities of identity&nbsp;theft.</p><p>This project is developed from the perspective of a company that issues VCs that can be verified during hotel check-ins. It verifies user-submitted data and accordingly, issues the VC that can be shared by the holder during his/her&nbsp;travel.</p> Empowering Migrant&nbsp;Workers <p>Another social issue that was addressed was the problem of migrant workers. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/yhgt">David Bensandon</a> came up with this idea where domestic workers can use VCs (reference letters, work permits, etc) to build up their careers, get better salaries, and share them to easily sign up for third-party services.</p><p>In this prototype developed using Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs, a domestic worker will submit a reference letter or a work permit. The agency would verify the validity and authenticity of these documents and issue the VCs accordingly. The domestic worker could then share the reference letter with a job portal, third-party service providers, or any other&nbsp;agency.</p> Patient Health Data Distributed Interface (PHDDI) <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/affinidifabric">verifiable credential PoC</a>, Kent Lau uses Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to record the provision of goods and services by healthcare professionals to an insured patient. The VC gets endorsed by the patient and shared with the insurer for swift reimbursement.</p><p>This is a simple scenario where a patient interacts with several healthcare professionals (issuers), who would be reimbursed by the health insurer (verifier). The patient would hold the VCs in a wallet and share them with the insurer when&nbsp;needed.</p> Pharma’s League <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/pharma-s-league">VC prototype</a>, Carey Lai proposes using Affinidi’s SDKs and APIs to eliminate counterfeits in the pharma industry that has been grappling with counterfeit medicines worth $89&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Here, the issuer is the pharma company that can issue a digitized VC for approved merchants looking to resell their products. The holder is the reseller while the verifier is the Pharma’s league, a trusted marketplace. This way, buyers don’t have to worry about the legitimacy of the drugs and the pharma companies will face no losses from counterfeit medicines.</p> Decentralized Clinical&nbsp;Trials <p>With the raging COVID19, decentralized trials are gaining steam because of the speed and efficiency with which they can be performed. At the same time, there are concerns about the trustworthiness of these trials, and Leon Mak aims to address them with VCs built on Affinidi’s SDKs and&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>This <a href="https://devpost.com/software/apply-remotely-for-decentralized-clinical-trials">portal</a> will allow patients to check if they are eligible to participate and remotely share their credentials with those who are conducting the research. Especially when vaccine trials fail to report ethnicity data, having patients participate in trials using verified credentials with such information can help understand how diverse a trial was, and increase the confidence in the drug’s effectiveness.</p> CREDucate <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/creducate">CREDucate</a> by Saundarya Kumar and Pratik Savla is the platform where institutions can issue educational credentials to students who have registered under them and verifiers(other institutions) can request and verify those credentials.</p><p>This platform, built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, can ease the application and verification process in today’s job market. It is envisaged to help students to quickly and securely share their credentials with multiple entities and could provide a way for prospective employers/educational institutions to verify the credentials of the applicants.</p> RxChain <p>Olusegun Usman Quadri, a trained pharmacist and software developer from Nigeria, imagined the possibility of using VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to prevent imitation drugs, cosmetics, and foods that can impact the health of unsuspecting consumers.</p><p>His PoC, called <a href="https://devpost.com/software/rxchain-zr1j9x">RxChain</a>, aims to help pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and food companies protect their products by issuing a verifiable credential for each batch of products. This can be verified by the end-users. With this technology, end users can be assured of the source of the products they are taking and can stay away from imitations that can impact their&nbsp;health.</p> Helping Hand&nbsp;SME <p>Many SMEs tend to have cash flow issues despite doing good business due to pending invoices, Since these SMEs play a significant role in every country’s economy, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/helping-hand-sme">Hemanth Ankerla and Manoj Kumar</a> came up with the idea of using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to convert the pending invoices into VCs, so the same can be used as collateral for&nbsp;loans.</p><p>They believe that this idea can be extended to other services like insurance as&nbsp;well.</p> Global Identifier for Traveller <p>Richard Xiang Qian Ong came up with an idea to redefine the check-in process for travellers in the post-pandemic world using verifiable credentials. He believes this would avoid the long waiting times during check-in, the hassle of handing over physical documents during the check-in process, and the danger of COVID-19.</p><p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/global-identifier-for-traveller-using-affinidi-api">PoC</a>, he proposes using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create a verifiable credential that can digitalize the check-in process to make it a safer and hassle-free process for travellers.</p> VaccinationVC <p>Zong Yu Lee wants to use VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to streamline the process of vaccination, especially while traveling. His VC will allow trained personnel who issue the vaccines to sign up for an account and log in, to issue and sign the vaccination certification to those passengers who are eligible for it. The holder can then use this VC to prove their vaccination status to airlines, hotels, AirBnbs, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>He foresees <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vaccinationvc">VaccinationVC</a> to be a useful application in a post-COVID19 world where people would want to start traveling after getting their vaccines.</p> Immigrant Verifier <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/vaccinationvc">Immigrant Verifier</a> by Nestor Campos is a PoC that aims to use verifiable credentials built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to help immigrants validate their situation in a specific country, with the help of their governments by validating their data through verified credentials.</p><p>He believes that his solution will allow people to create their credentials, with data that identifies them (passport, national document, and photograph, as well as other data), so that an institution in their country of origin can sign the document and prove the holder’s identity, Later, the holder can present this VC in any part of the destination country to qualify for government benefits, jobs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Employment Certificates <p>Rohit Patil wants to use Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create <a href="https://devpost.com/software/employment-certificates">VCs for employment verification</a> where employers would issue employment certificates that can be easily verified by recruiters with a few simple&nbsp;steps.</p><p>His PoC has three components, namely,</p>  Employee: The employee will apply for employment certificates to his/her employer.  Employer: The employer can see requests submitted by employees and can approve if the submitted information is&nbsp;correct.  Recruiter: Employee can share a link/QR Code of his/her employment VC after storing it in his/her wallet. The recruiter can verify the authenticity of the certificate either by entering the URL or by scanning the QR&nbsp;code.   Power of VCs in a Pandemic Stricken&nbsp;World <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-power-of-vcs-in-a-pandemic-stricken-world">Hao Ze Chok</a> aims to use VCs built on Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs to create a validated list of healthcare product suppliers so that nations could quickly engage with them during times of national emergency to commence export operations immediately.</p><p>His idea was born from the recent Covid pandemic that stressed the global supply chain of healthcare and medical products due to the sudden surge in demand among&nbsp;nations.</p><p>In his PoC, an issuer will check the products for their quality and will create a VC for the same. The holder is the seller who can then share this VC through an e-commerce platform for B2C transactions or through email with other B2B transactions. The VCs can be verified on a central platform on each country’s assurance portal.</p> DefenShe <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/defenshe-women-s-emergency-alert-system-gts3yj">DefenShe</a> is an initiative to bridge the gender disparity and empower women’s security by leveraging VCs.This is a real-time women’s emergency alert system built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs and backed by dynamic geofencing and cloud notifications. The currently existing apps consider reporting the emergency only to the official in proximity, which might not ensure a quick response to the alert, since the official might not be near the woman who called for the&nbsp;alert.</p><p>DefenShe solves this problem by considering the public around the woman, which increases the probability of the alert being addressed by a thousand-fold. Moreover, to serve them better and to increase the probability, DefenShe plans to use a credit system that completely revolves around Affinidi API Service to authenticate, authorize, and verify the users for claiming the monetary benefits. DefenShe is envisioned as a self-sustaining application that would generate revenue based on the advertisements powered by Google AdMob and use this for the DefenShe credit system to pay for the users who help a woman in&nbsp;need.</p> KYC Data <p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/kyc-data-as-verifiable-credentials-for-policy-documents">PoC</a>, Ian Lim came up with the idea of using an AI chatbot-enabled messaging platform to facilitate the transfer of Know-Your-Customer data as Verifiable Credentials and performing KYC verification before releasing sensitive policy documents. His idea was inspired by Telegram’s integration of its payment service to the messaging platform and uses Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>In this PoC, he explores the possibility of using chatbots to retrieve a user’s insurance policy document. As insurance policy documents are sensitive, his chatbot would use the policy holder’s Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data as Verifiable Credentials (VC) to perform a KYC check before sending over the document to the policyholder.</p> Banker’s Guarantee <p>Kishan Reddy aims to pave the way for safe and secure global transactions through his VC-based <a href="https://devpost.com/software/safe-trade">Banker’s Guarantee</a> PoC built using Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs.</p><p>In this idea, the business owner would apply for the Banker’s guarantee. The issuer/bank will check the agreement details from the concerned parties and issue the Verifiable Credential as financial security.</p><p>The two parties (holder and verifier) can use this VC to secure the deal. If the payment is not made after the deal, the payment is made by the Bank and this gives the verifier the financial confidence to enter into a business agreement with the&nbsp;holder.</p> Health Wallet <p>As the name suggests, the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/health-wallet-a1ke0t">Health Wallet</a> PoC by Shraddha Kandpal that was built using Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, would contain the verifiable credentials of a holder related to his/her health and could include health records like prescriptions, reports, medical bills,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When needed, the holder can securely share this information with the concerned parties such as healthcare professionals, insurance companies, and&nbsp;more.</p> Easy Loans <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/easy-loans">Easy loans</a> by Ramya Parthiban is a VC-based loan approval process that could speed up the loan approval process as it won’t entail the collection, submission, and verification of physical documents.</p><p>In her PoC created with Affinidi’s APIs and SDKs, all the proofs required for the loan process are verified by trusted third-party financial institutions, and the verifiable credentials are accordingly issued to the borrower. So, the bank can directly verify the Verifiable Credential and approve the loan without having to spend time and resources for the whole process. Undoubtedly, it will also help the borrower to quickly get the loan&nbsp;amount.</p> Vote from&nbsp;Home <p>Notagodzilla (username on Affindi’s Discord channel) wants to use VCs to revolutionize the voting process and make it easier and safer for people to exercise their fundamental democratic rights.</p><p>In this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/vote-from-home-your-democratic-right-modernized">PoC</a> developed with Affinidi’s APIs and&nbsp;SDKs,</p>  The holder would create an account with a username and password which will be authenticated, authorized and stored in&nbsp;Affinidi  With permission from the user, the IP address and mac address are also collected to establish a two-factor verification  The issuer would receive the holder’s necessary details as a credential, and will accordingly validate&nbsp;it.  When the user votes, the vote will be verified by the verifier which is again a governmental organization. And when the election period ends, the server IP will be switched using Huawei’s Elastic IP (therefore no third party can access it), after which the verifier will count the votes by cross-checking all the verifiable factors of all votes such as the IP address,&nbsp;etc.  Users’ data and votes are immutable at any&nbsp;time.   AfinFi <p>Sagar Jethi and Oceanpro want to use verifiable credentials to accelerate P2P lending by instantly evaluating the creditworthiness of the applicant.</p><p>They believe that the biggest bottleneck in P2P lending is KYC, as both the borrower and the lending platform have to go through a 3rd party service, which ends up being time-consuming and expensive.</p><p>Instead, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/afinfi">AfinFi</a> would allow P2P lenders to see the creditworthiness of their clients and seamlessly manage the flow of data transfer between parties through a simple API provided by Affindi’s SDK without worrying about the complex and error-prone process for doing&nbsp;KYC</p><p>Thus, these are the PoCs that were evaluated in Affinidi’s PoCathon&nbsp;2021.</p><p>A big <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">congratulations</a> once again to all the participants for enriching us with your innovation.</p><p>We hope these PoCs inspire more people to explore the world of SSI through verifiable credentials.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

<p>These two posts point out some common Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) that all organizations should be on the lookout for as indicators of attack:</p>
 
 Password spraying against Virtual Private Network (VPN) devices. Legitimate user credentials found and used. 
 Malware exploits against SonicWall VPN (disabling Multi-Factor Authentication). Vulnerability has been patched. 
 Use of phishing emails for initial compromise. 
 Creation of domain accounts for attacker use. 
 Use of Mimikatz for capturing more credentials and escalating privileges. 
 Use of Cobalt Strike, BEACON, BLOODHOUND, TeamViewer, RDP, and F-Secure Labs' C3 (a red teaming tool) for recon, lateral movement, and C2 comms. 
 Use of rclone to exfiltrate data to cloud hosting locations. 
 Deletion of backups and Windows volume shadow copies. 
 Use of ESXi to disable cloud snapshots. 
 Use of PsExec and PowerShell to encrypt victim files. 
 Use of NGROK utility to allow remote access through defenses.

			<p>One of the key benefits of tokenization is that investors get direct ownership of their assets. Through tokenization, they can directly control their portfolio or delegate the management to third-party service providers. As the assets are controlled by smart contracts, it is important to understand the roles and permissions of each of the parties in order to ensure digital asset custody whilst allowing efficient asset management.</p>
<p>Usually, marketplace platforms enable issuers and investors to manage security tokens across the lifecycle by providing web interfaces reflecting the blockchain states. If the digital asset marketplace helps issuing tokens on a public blockchain, they can also provide ways for their users to connect their blockchain identities and/or wallets to secure the access to smart contracts and token keys. Indeed, issuers and/or their agents need to perform administrative and corporate functions by signing blockchain transactions.</p>
 Safekeeping of private keys and authorizing agents 
<p>Marketplace operators must not propose wallet services to issuers. Issuers must be in control of their securities as they are the liable counterparty. They can delegate some responsibilities, but they must be able to manage their service providers. Concretely, the issuer must be the technical owners of their smart contracts, and be able to appoint the relevant smart contracts functions to their agents depending on their roles and delegated responsibilities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issuer needs a wallet that’s set as the owner and controller of the smart contracts and one that can be used to grant certain permissions to its agents. This wallet will therefore not be used on a daily basis and can be easily secured with a multisig or in cold storage.</p>
<p>Everytime a function of a smart contract is triggered, a transaction is sent to the blockchain, and an authorized wallet must sign it. In order to respect the roles and permissions, it is important that each stakeholder manages the access of its own wallet. To reduce risks, these wallets must always be replaceable and this is only possible if the wallets are linked to a blockchain identity. For example, a smart contract owner should be able to change its agent(s) at any time, and the agent should be able to recover the lost tokens of an investor and so on.</p>
  
 Agent roles and marketplaces 
<p>Issuers are obligated to perform a range of administrative tasks and functions after the primary issuance of their assets. In traditional markets these functions are typically performed by agents. The marketplace, with its own wallets, can act as an agent and combine different roles such as KYC agent (add proofs of KYC on the blockchain, whitelist Investors, etc.), paying agent, transfer agent, registrar, etc.</p>
<p>These tasks could be performed on the blockchain directly but of course, a web platform triggering the blockchain functions is more suitable and easy to use. Therefore, in order to perform these functions, issuers, or the agent they instruct, should ideally access an administration panel linking the blockchain data with confidential information such as the names and addresses of the Investors.</p>
<p>The marketplace, by leveraging the security token standard they use, should provide a servicing platform in order to manage the lifecycle of the assets. This part of the platform needs to enable the agent or directly the issuer to perform operations on the tokens (like mint/burn, pause/unpause, force transfer, etc.) and to manage investors status and access their identity information. At the minimum, the platform should provide the following set of features:</p>
 
 
 
 Asset control and oversight to force and block transfers between their investors. 
 Maintain complete and transparent logs of data. 
 Run position reports immediately. 
 View their cap table that’s automatically updated throughout the lifecycle. 
 To perform the recovery process for investors if they have lost their wallet information and access to their security tokens. This can be performed securely through identification of the investor.

 Platform provider enriches IDnow AutoIdent with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology to create even better user experience 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, May 20th 2021, IDnow, a German based leader&nbsp;in&nbsp;platform-as-a-service&nbsp;identity verification, today announced the implementation of NFC reading capability into IDnow AutoIdent. This will offer users an even smoother and quicker verification process.</p>
<p>The new solution will support all identification documents globally that follow the ICAO 9303 standard like ePassports and NFC supported ID cards. All the user needs are an ID card with a RFID chip (radio-frequency identification) as well as an NFC-enabled smartphone. The IDnow App recognizes the availability of an RFID chip, reads the personal data and biometric information (photo) that is contained on the chip with integrated privacy protection and compares the biometric information retrieved from the chip to a video selfie and a liveness check.</p>
<p>IDnow has seen that users increasingly value quick and easy identification and appreciate the freedom of choice when selecting their identification method. Different user groups prefer different methods, and businesses&nbsp; can see large increases in their conversion rates if they offer users a choice. Therefore, IDnow offers a comprehensive platform, that includes identification methods from offline to online, from automated methods to procedures carried out by identity specialists, available flexibly online, offline in branches and even by a courier at the user’s doorstep.</p>
<p>“The NFC capability for our AutoIdent product is a significant step in order to further augment our platform and create a smooth user journey for everyone. Our customers value this freedom of choice for their user and see high conversion rates with seamless, easy processes”, says Vikas Seth, CPO at IDnow. “Through the application of NFC-based RFID chip read out in the IDnow AutoIdent product, you don’t need to compromise, but get the best of both worlds – a high level of security and a convenient onboarding process at high speed”, he adds.</p>
<p>The principle of reading out an ePassport via NFC is successfully used by airports with ePassport gates, places with an extremely high security requirements. By adding this feature to IDnow AutoIdent, IDnow is empowering banks, insurance providers and other businesses to get the same level of protection from fraudsters and identity thieves through a method, that is already well established and understood by their end users, completely automated and built to improve conversion rates.</p>
<p>For high security use cases IDnow is also offering a variant that can check the authenticity of the RFID chip and validate it on a secure server with digital certificates to ensure that the RFID chip itself is not compromised by fraudsters.</p>
<p>IDnow has expanded its role in recent years far beyond simply offering individual ident methods and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year.</p>
<p>In early 2021, IDnow announced the acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, one of the leading international providers for on- and offline verification. This was the second acquisition within six months for IDnow and represents an important milestone on the way to becoming the leading identity platform in Europe. The acquisition of identity Trust Management AG enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Germany and beyond.</p>

<p>It’s official:&nbsp;only&nbsp;5% of&nbsp;US&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;want apps to track them across the internet for targeted advertising.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means&nbsp;95% of&nbsp;US&nbsp;consumers are saying&nbsp;‘no way’&nbsp;to&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking with Apple’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT)&nbsp;feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verizon Media’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">Flurry Analytics</a>&nbsp;is monitoring&nbsp;daily&nbsp;US and worldwide&nbsp;opt-in&nbsp;rates&nbsp;for&nbsp;cross-app&nbsp;tracking&nbsp;following&nbsp;the ATT release,&nbsp;and it’s&nbsp;abundantly&nbsp;clear&nbsp;most consumers&nbsp;like the&nbsp;control&nbsp;ATT&nbsp;gives them over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 5% stat we quote here was posted at 10 am Pacific Standard Time on May 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flurry Analytics is&nbsp;monitoring&nbsp;answers to&nbsp;the&nbsp;privacy question,&nbsp;Do you want&nbsp;us to track your activity across other companies’ apps and websites?&nbsp;which now appears when&nbsp;a&nbsp;user opens an app for the first time after the iOS 14.5 update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flurry Analytics&nbsp;says it has&nbsp;aggregated insights across&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">2 billion mobile phone devices</a>&nbsp;per month. As well as&nbsp;the ATT&nbsp;opt-in rate in the US and worldwide,&nbsp;Flurry is&nbsp;also monitoring the share of users that apps cannot ask to track (‘restricted’ status) in both the US and worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&nbsp;shows&nbsp;the worldwide opt-in rate is higher than the US rate, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flurry.com/blog/ios-14-5-opt-in-rate-att-restricted-app-tracking-transparency-worldwide-us-daily-latest-update/">13%</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;10 am Pacific Standard Time on May 8, 2021, but as they&nbsp;say&nbsp;over at&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">Ars&nbsp;Technica</a>, this global number is still below some ad companies’&nbsp;opt-in&nbsp;estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>ATT will&nbsp;likely&nbsp;sucker punch ad tech&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We agree with Flurry Analytics when it describes iOS 14.5 as “the most industry-impacting iOS release to date”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stats are rapidly confirming early fears from ad tech&nbsp;that ATT will be very bad for business — which is why&nbsp;Facebook&nbsp;has&nbsp;pushed&nbsp;back so hard&nbsp;against&nbsp;it for 12 months and with&nbsp;extra&nbsp;gusto recently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The media is having a field day.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mashable.com/article/ios-14-5-users-opt-out-of-ad-tracking/">Mashable</a>&nbsp;starts its article about the&nbsp;low US&nbsp;opt-in rate with “Sorry, Facebook.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over at&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/">Ars&nbsp;Technica</a>&nbsp;they’re saying: “Some of the first data on user behavior exceeds advertisers’&nbsp;worst fears.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are, of course, going to watch this space. In the meantime,&nbsp;we recommend that you answer ‘no’ to the ATT privacy question. Disabling cross-app tracking is good for your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read our article&nbsp;“Apple’s New ATT and Why Facebook Is Pushing Back Hard”&nbsp;if you want to understand ATT better. Importantly, remember ATT doesn’t stop tracking within a single app (it’s only for cross-app tracking). You still need&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized and protected</a>&nbsp;across different services.

<p>Securing high-value physical asset NFTs requires the dynamic and scalable approach to distributed risk protection that UNION&nbsp;provides</p><p>The DeFi (decentralized finance) space has seen explosive growth over the past couple years as numerous protocols have emerged to power an open financial infrastructure for borrowing, lending, liquidity provision, stablecoin issuance, and other services in this uniquely composable network. At the time of writing, the current<a href="https://defipulse.com/"> total value locked</a> (TVL) in DeFi protocols has exceeded $55 billion in digitally-native crypto assets. Yet throughout this stratospheric growth in DeFi, several high-profile protocols have been hacked or exploited, compromising tens of millions in crypto-assets and causing cascading effects throughout these interdependent protocols.</p><p><a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>’s core mission is to build the legal and technical systems that can bring the trillions of dollars in underutilized and illiquid physical assets into the crypto economy, which begs the question: how do we safeguard against systemic failures throughout all parts of the protocol&nbsp;stack?</p><p>Our recently announced partnership with<a href="https://www.unn.finance/index.html"> UNION</a> will provide the dynamic and scalable approach to providing risk protection which will integrate seamlessly with Mattereum Asset Passports and associated Real-World Asset NFTs (rwaNFTs).</p><p>Here’s a brief overview of the DeFi insurance landscape, UNION’s unique approach to risk protection, and how the UNION and Mattereum integration will work in practice.</p> The Current State of DeFi Insurance <p>Insurance is a vast and complicated topic, and this is certainly true in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, insurance is about mitigating and protecting against possible risks which can befall an individual, group, institution, or system. Risk protection is packaged and purchased in various forms in the marketplace and is activated when someone makes a claim to offset or cover costs stemming from the particular event in question (accident, medical care, etc.). Managing risk in commerce and life is, shall we say, a messy business.</p><p>However, crypto, being a global financial network powered by decentralised, interdependent protocols and a largely pseudonymous and in some cases anonymous user base, complicates the notion even further. How do we protect assets in this Rube Goldberg financial infrastructure in which we often don’t know the other&nbsp;players?</p><p>Risk protection and insurance-like platforms in the blockchain world have covered mainly two areas: smart contract cover and transaction risk.</p>  Smart Contract Cover: Individuals purchase cover in relation to a particular smart contract underpinning a DeFi protocol. If the smart contract was exploited and funds were lost, the individual could then make a claim once said hack has been verified by an oracle. This sort of cover is notably provided by Nexus Mutual (NXM). Yearn Finance creator Andre Cronje later created a workaround of NXM’s KYC requirements and built yInsure, a means of buying smart contract cover underwritten by NXM and packaged as&nbsp;NFTs.  Transaction risk: As the term denotes, this form of risk protection is focused on singular transactions rather than ongoing operations in DeFi protocols (e.g. liquidity provision, staking, etc.). An example of one approach to risk protection at this scale can be found in VouchForMe, a peer-to-peer insurance protocol that leverages a “social proof” system for individuals to establish their trustworthiness with one another. Alice puts her reputation and some financial stake on the line by lending credibility to Bob, vice versa, and across a network of peers, establishing a bottom-up trust framework to secure confidence in commercial transactions.  <p>Currently, the available platforms lack the magnitude or dynamism that can provide a more layered risk protection at all levels of the protocol stack, from the base-layer blockchain to smart contracts moving billions in value every&nbsp;day.</p><p>So if the current systems are inadequate for the scale of DeFi, how does UNION’s design provide the necessary guard rails for safely bridging DeFi to the physical world through the Mattereum Protocol?</p> UNION: Decentralized, Full-Stack Risk Protection for&nbsp;DeFi <p>UNION is a platform which provides bundled risk protection, decentralized governance and inclusion, a liquid secondary marketplace for sharing risk, and a multi-token model that is altogether capable of covering the myriad risks in this uniquely open, interconnected, and global financial system. Let’s unpack this statement:</p>  Bundled risk protection: UNION can provide risk protection to various activities and operations within the crypto economy throughout the entire protocol stack, including possible systemic fallouts from base-layer exploits, smart contracts, and applications. Most blockchain insurance projects focus mostly on smart contract&nbsp;cover.  Day-one decentralized governance: The platform will be powered by a combination of the community of stakeholders and the UNN DAO. The former are UNN holders who can participate in governance (direct or delegated). The latter is a virtual organization composed of larger UNN stakeholders, the UNION Foundation, and industry experts voted into the DAO which altogether work toward ensuring that UNION remains secure, fair, and transparent. All without KYC requirements.  Liquid marketplace for risk-sharing: UNION has adapted battle-tested pricing models in the traditional financial and insurance industries to the DeFi markets, allowing the unique composition of stakeholders in the blockchain industry to better distribute risk and create a safer environment for digital commerce and&nbsp;finance.  Multi-token model: UNION uses a three-token model. UNN is used by community stakeholders for strictly governance processes (voting, conflict resolution, protocol adjustments). uUNN tokens give protection buyers rights to a particular policy. pUNN are issued to writers of protection policies, representing a percentage share of the protection pool. This three-tiered structure specifically separates governance tokens from protection tokens to prevent conflicts of interest or clashing market dynamics. Bundling multiple utilities within one token can create critical problems down the line, such as when Nexus Mutual (NXM)<a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/nexus-mutual-just-ran-out-defi-coverage-heres-why/"> ran out of DeFi coverage</a> in September 2020 from a third party’s botched liquidity mining&nbsp;scheme.  <p>UNION’s composable and adaptable design is quite suited for integration with the Mattereum Protocol. Here’s how it will&nbsp;work:</p> Mattereum &amp; UNION: Risk Protection for the Digital-Physical Economy <p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Real-World Asset NFTs, and Trust Communities. Here’s how the protocol works, in&nbsp;brief:</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the<a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/"> Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p>  Asset Passports are a bundle of legal warranties tied to a particular object. Essential warranties include identification (data points provided by the owner and subject experts which describe and authenticate the asset), confirmation of the presence and capabilities of verification technologies such as NFC tags, and establishing the pairing of an asset with a particular Real-World Asset NFT (along with the terms of purchase and ownership of the&nbsp;same.)  Real-World Asset NFTs (rwaNFTs) are unique digital tokens that denote the right to take physical custody of a particular object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an underlying physical asset, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability to create trust in&nbsp;trade.  Trust Communities are the network of expert certifiers that will accrue around an object (artwork, memorabilia, precious metals) throughout its lifetime. All expert certification of an object is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment.  <p>In practice, the Mattereum Asset Passport will integrate with UNION as a warranty with a plain-English prose agreement that features a pointer to the specific UNION risk protection pool and vice versa, dually-integrating the two systems. This is how we bring insurance into the Mattereum Protocol.</p><p>The UNION protection pools can also facilitate the indemnified certification process that form an object’s Trust Community, providing tiered coverage for appraisers with liquidity sourced from UNION protection pools.</p><p>From zero history to storied&nbsp;value</p><p>With blockchain-enabled authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, Mattereum removes the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued digital commerce for decades. Our partnership with UNION provides a key piece of the puzzle: a decentralized yet robust platform for full-stack risk protection that can provide some peace of mind for participants within the Mattereum Protocol and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Follow us as we bring the Mattereum Protocol to an expanding variety of markets ranging from memorabilia, gold, wine, to prized classical instruments, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>More at: <a href="http://www.mattereum.com">http://www.mattereum.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/mattereum">https://twitter.com/mattereum</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/mattereum">https://t.me/mattereum</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/mattereum-union-risk-protection-for-the-digital-physical-economy-628371e4cf8a">Mattereum &amp; UNION: Risk Protection for the Digital-Physical Economy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
